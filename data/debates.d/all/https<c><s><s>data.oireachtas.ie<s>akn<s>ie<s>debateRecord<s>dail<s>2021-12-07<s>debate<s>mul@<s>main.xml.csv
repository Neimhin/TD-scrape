Today and tonight, people need to stay safe. No one should take chances or risks. It is important that we pay tribute to our front-line workers. After 18 months of heroism, they now find themselves in the eye of the storm, again risking their own safety to keep us safe and the show on the road. We thank them. Our children are not in school today because of this exceptional storm. We are now in winter and our children and teaching staff have been freezing in classrooms wearing hats and scarves during the school day, with windows wide open in an attempt to keep them safe. We are nearly two years into this pandemic, but the Government has still not delivered a plan for proper ventilation in our schools. It has been clear for some time that high-efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters have an important role to play in ensuring schools have clean air. They remove contaminants and viruses from the air and help reduce airborne transmission in classrooms with poor ventilation. The WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the Government's own expert group on ventilation have emphasised the value of HEPA filters in keeping schools safe. Instead of listening to this expert advice and installing HEPA filters in schools, the Government's approach is, as the Taoiseach put it at his press conference on Friday, to open the windows and so on. Parents and school staff must have been shaking their heads in disbelief. This refusal to act on filtration in schools reminds us of the Government's reticence to accept the advice on mask wearing at the start of the pandemic and its failure to incorporate antigen tests until the eleventh hour in the fight against Covid. We again see no sense of urgency, no forward planning and no common sense from the Government on the issue of ventilation in schools. It has been known for some time that Covid is an airborne virus and we knew that schools would be a greater challenge in the face of a more transmissible variant. The rates of infection among school-aged children have shot up in recent months. The writing is on the wall and the Government has had ample time and every opportunity to get things right, yet it has wasted these opportunities.In December last year, Deputy Ó Laoghaire called on the Minister for Education to ensure that schools were provided with devices over the Christmas break to make sure children returned to safely ventilated classrooms last January. He was ignored. Indeed, it took nine months for the Government to act on CO2 monitors. These monitors are badly needed but they do not clean the air. They have to be backed up with a filtration system. We do not have another nine months to wait for the Government to get HEPA devices into classrooms. Tá sé thar am anois chun a bheith dáiríre faoi aeráil cheart sna scoileanna agus ag coinneáil páistí agus baill fhoirne sábháilte. Tá sé thar am ag an Rialtas scagairí HEPA a fháil i seomraí ranga chomh tapa agus is féidir. Does the Taoiseach accept we must move beyond opening windows as a plan for ventilation in school and will he commit to immediately commencing the installation of HEPA filters in classrooms?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	2	I again put on the record of the House the Government's deep appreciation for all those in the emergency services who are doing so much across the country to protect life and limb, especially in the south west at the moment, in helping our communities to cope through Storm Barra. Our emergency services, ESB staff, council employees and community workers are all doing so at considerable personal risk and I pay tribute to the National Emergency Co-ordination Centre for the preparatory work it has been engaged in for well over the past week, planning and preparing for what is a very challenging, difficult and varied storm. To the members of that team, we owe an awful lot indeed. On the situation pertaining to Covid, putting aside all the noise and the attempts to undermine or attack the Government, which is a legitimate position from the Opposition if it wants to pursue that road, the most important collective message we as a House can give to people today is to take their booster vaccine when they are offered it. Vaccination, more than anything else, is protecting people against severe illness, hospitalisation and admission to ICUs. The booster vaccination jabs have been shown to produce very strong antibody responses and are likely to provide protection against severe disease, hospitalisation and death from most variants, including Delta and Omicron. The reason I am saying this is that in the week commencing 22 November, 208,000 appointments were offered, of which about 80,000 turned up. Last week, of 180,000 appointments, 93,000 turned up. The same urgency does not seem to be there in respect of availing of the option to take the booster as was there when we were offered the first and second doses. In the over-75 group, where people have been taking up the offer of a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in high numbers, we are seeing a significant reduction in the incidence of the disease, so it does work. The booster vaccines will have a really significant impact on Delta. I cannot stress that enough. It is the one message I want to get across today, above and beyond everything else to do with Covid-19. On ventilation and our schools, the Minister for Education has at all times adhered to expert advice in respect of ventilation. While it may at times be tempting to lampoon the idea of fresh air, the number one item on that expert advice is that, where possible, fresh air is the most effective form of ventilation. Of course, that has limitations in the context of cold and inclement weather. The Minister for Education has provided substantial resources to schools and will continue to do so. Schools will be in a position, if they wish and if it is suitable, to buy HEPA filters for classrooms, but I point out the advice of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, SAGE, the expert body in the UK, on HEPA filters.It is saying there is a need for better data on real-world application to support these technologies. It may be a viable solution in spaces where it is difficult to provide good ventilation. SAGE is saying that a lot of the application of filters will depend on the configuration of rooms and certain situations. The point I would make is this. I have noticed throughout the course of the pandemic that, every now and again, someone comes up with the magic solution. Invariably, there is no one magic silver bullet to deal with Covid. It is a combination of efforts and, right now, it seems to me, from looking at the data, that the most effective thing we can do out there is to encourage people to take their booster vaccine when it is offered.

However, I asked the Taoiseach a different question. I asked him about ventilation and air quality in our classrooms. Between removing contact tracing from schools, a very sluggish response to teaching supply and mixed and confused messaging on children wearing masks in schools, the Government's record in dealing with staff and children in the classroom is not good. To say to staff and children that the answer is to shiver in classrooms is not acceptable. These HEPA filters are one item, an important item, in the toolbox that we have to keep people safe. I have asked the Taoiseach a very straightforward question. I have quoted the expert advice. The World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and, indeed, the expert group that his own Government appointed recognise that these filters are an important intervention. Instead of taking a laissez-faire approach with schools, I want the Taoiseach to commit that the Government will ensure that these filters are rolled out. Use the Christmas break, use the opportunity of the kids being on holidays, to install these ventilators and to ensure that we have clean air and that we do not have frozen children and staff members, as one action, but an important action, in an array of things we will have to do to keep our children safe.

I do not want to use the phrase “gag” but that seems to be what it is. Now, all communication has to go through the Government Information Service, GIS. If that is the way the Taoiseach wants to do things, that is fine, but he is responsible for that because it reports to him and GIS is in his Department. Why is this change happening now as regards the process by which NPHET communicates with the public? The Taoiseach is responsible for it, but why now? Is it because of what happened last Thursday in regard to information coming out from a NPHET meeting before the Government made the decision? If it is, just say so. I have a concern. The Government makes decisions and has to make the ultimate communications, but there are times when we have to hear directly from public health experts in regard to specifics. We have a storm going on outside. With all due respect to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I would rather hear from Evelyn Cusack and Met Éireann as regards the direction of that storm than from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage because there is a very specific need. I say that in jest but we are also in the middle of a pandemic.There are specific needs as regards information that has to be communicated. Going through GIS in order to have to make media appearances is worrying from a transparency point of view. The Taoiseach needs to clear this up because, from my perspective and from that of the Labour Party, the main confusion over the past week has not been from NPHET but from the Government. When it came to antigen testing, the Government indicated there were going to be subsidies but then all of a sudden the Minister announced on television that there would not be. A missive was sent out at 6.15 p.m. on Tuesday last regarding masks being mandatory. There was a U-turn on Monday because I challenged the Government in the Dáil on the legality of this for principals. In some cases, principals were unwilling to do it. That changed as a result. There were changes in respect of those arriving into the country. Aer Lingus informed the country that a change had taken place between Friday and Sunday as regards the requirement for PCR and antigen tests on arrival. We see a pattern here. I also raised the issue of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and Ministers were touting different schemes until yesterday when the Minister for Social Protection gave us some, but not all, of the information. We now know that information will not be fully out there until Thursday or Friday. We have the issues of HEPA filters, and I agree with the previous speaker that this has been going on forever. I have no understanding whatsoever as to why this has not been put forward and dealt with. I want to ask the Taoiseach the following questions. Who is responsible for the change in policy of how NPHET is to communicate with the public on specific public health issues? Why was that decided? Does the Taoiseach accept that it is Ministers and their failures as regards communication that have created the omnishambles over the five issues I have pointed out in the past week alone? For those workers who are so impacted by the restrictions that have been brought about, including those who are servicing the hospitality industry - taxi drivers and others - what bespoke measures will be put in place in order to support them during this difficult time?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	15	I agree with the Deputy’s comments on the centrality and importance of the public health advice during the global pandemic. From the outset of this pandemic, when I was on the Opposition benches in the immediate aftermath of the general election, at the first meeting with public health officials I stated - Deputy Shortall would have been present at that meeting and would have said exactly the same thing - that all of us in this House must accept the centrality of public health advice as a guide to dealing and coping with the pandemic. That remains my position. It is extremely important that public health advice is independent and transparent and is seen to be so. I will give the following commitment: as long as I am Taoiseach, there will never be an attempt, in any shape or form, to undermine the independence or transparency of public health advice. The Deputy may have overstated the degree to which there has been a change in communications. All press officers in all Departments have been asked to make sure that NPHET spokespeople are facilitated in going forward to the public media to do interviews, make media appearances and communicate public health advices in the context of Government policy and to explain to people the rationale for the advice that is given. The Government also decided that we will co-ordinate this so that we do not have six spokespeople out on the one day as opposed to two or three and that there is a synchronising and a proper co-ordination of those appearances. That is not something anybody can quibble with. That is the position. I have checked back on what happened over the weekend and nobody was stopped from going on any show from what I have garnered. I said what I said at a press outing on Sunday morning in good faith. This matters to me too and I believe in the independence of NPHET. I want to make the following point while reflecting on what has happened in recent months.I have come to the conclusion that, more often than not, referring to mixed messaging is a good way of saying "I actually don't like the message". That seems to me to be the position. In the House from time to time, people have said that we have not done antigen testing but everyone knows that public health advisers have not been, from the earliest days, the strongest advocates of antigen testing. There is a robust debate about antigen testing and there is also a robust debate about ventilation. I believe we should do everything we possibly can on ventilation, and we will, but people move on very quickly from the public health advice and say that the Government is not doing this or that when, on many occasions, it can be because that is the advice. All of us need to be careful not to fall prey to the inevitable human failing of always seeking to blame the messenger when we do not quite like the message.

It is very hard to take the Taoiseach seriously when he says that the message is sometimes lost in translation. What happened in relation to schools was not lost in translation; it was a direct contradiction. I have been raising antigen testing in the House for 14 months. I am worried about GIS and the spokespeople from NPHET, a considerable percentage of whom are public servants. Some of those involved with NPHET and NIAC are not public servants, but some are. I have a concern that they feel that they need to go through GIS in order to appear on radio or TV shows or speak to the print media. Will the Taoiseach confirm that they do not have to go through GIS? Mr. Gavan Reilly said last Sunday that a senior member of NPHET was supposed to appear on his show but then he was told that the person was not available. The Taoiseach is now saying that is not the case. Will he confirm to the House that anybody from NPHET who wants to appear on any show or give an interview to the print media does not have to go through GIS or any spokespeople?

The pandemic has necessitated very frequent interviews and commentary, particularly with regard to Omicron. Let us be clear. The reason there was a significant range of announcements in the past ten days was because Omicron was a big factor. Let us be honest. We had to make a call in terms of travel. The rise in cases of Delta among five- to 11-year-olds necessitated a response from public health and a Government decision on 9- to 11-year-olds and masks. We have to move quickly at times in respect of public health advice on new developments. Omicron was one of those new developments. It looks like it will be a significant element in the next phase of the pandemic, which is why I said what I said at the outset about the absolute necessity and importance of people getting the booster vaccine.

We now know that Covid-19 is an airborne disease. It hangs around in the air. In particular, it hangs around in buildings that are of poor quality and in which there are poor levels of ventilation or a lack of filtration of air to ensure air purity. The science is building up rapidly on this but the Government is doing nothing about it. People Before Profit has been talking about this for months. Last week, we brought forward a Bill in which we are looking for the Government to establish minimum standards on ventilation and air quality. We did so on the basis of science and public health expertise. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established that two HEPA filters in a room will reduce exposure to Covid-19 and other infectious diseases such as flu by 65%. In November, the University of Cambridge completed a study at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, where HEPA filters were put in for five days. The filters removed all traces of Covid-19 from the air. They then tested for five days in the same hospital without HEPA filters and Covid-19 returned. That is very strong evidence. Orla Hegarty demonstrated the startling fact that half of all those who have died in this country as a result of infection were infected in fewer than 400 buildings. That is less than 1% of buildings. I am talking about nursing homes, hospitals and industrial and workplace settings - meat factories and so on - in which there was poor-quality ventilation. The evidence is very strong. It is not a silver bullet, but it may be a significant game changer. Against that background, the Government is talking about using the minor works grant, which is probably just existing money instead of, as New Zealand has done, putting HEPA filters and air monitoring in every classroom. It should provide the money to purchase them up front and take the necessary action over Christmas. The Government should add to that hospitals, in respect of which the question of air quality is absolutely critical for the protection of the health workers who the Taoiseach was just praising. This is what the nurses and medical unions have been calling for for some time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	33	The Government acts on science all the time in respect of anything we do with regard to Covid-19. The Minister for Education acted on expert advice. A working group was formed and advice was given to the Minister for Education on schools. There is expert guidance regarding workplaces which was issued in the early stages of the pandemic. Public health officials have been arguing about good ventilation from the get-go. I quoted SAGE to the Deputy earlier. It says that it may be of help but it qualifies it significantly. We issued approximately 35,000 CO2 monitors to schools. In second level schools there is vaccination of students from 12 to 17 years of age. There has been a significant wave of Delta in primary schools. Funding will be made available but there could be different solutions for different schools around ventilation and air quality. Some may be more medium term. The immediate short-term solution is portable HEPA filters or some improvement of that kind. Funding will be made available for that. However, it is not a silver bullet by any means. The Deputy seems to ignore the advice that public health has given to schools or that the expert working group gave to the Minister in respect of ventilation.The Minister got expert advice. Different publications come along from time to time. I do not think the evidence about the 400 buildings would stand the test of all public health officials or public health expertise, in terms of narrowing it down to that. Obviously, in nursing homes where people are resident for a number of years, you are unfortunately going to get a high preponderance and we found that out in the earlier part of the pandemic. However, that has been much improved because of vaccination, as opposed to having to lock down and stopping people from visiting and so on. The one game-changer for nursing homes has been vaccination. Let us call a spade a spade. The Deputy can be shocked all he likes about other aspects. I am open to everything that works. I am for proven means of ventilation. I am also in favour of the principle of doing no harm in respect of whatever we provide or we put in. The resources will be provided where schools feel it is necessary. I was in a school recently which actually had another alternative solution which was working for it. It has not had a single transmission. It was Larkin Community College. I was shown the particular, unique construction of the school and the kind of defences there. The 35,400 CO2 monitors are in 4,000 schools across the country. We will continue to work with the schools. There is also a technical team available to work with schools as well.

We have actively encouraged people to take it up, as has everybody in this House. However, it is still not enough. It is clearly not enough because we are asking entertainment, music, taxi drivers and all sorts of people to take the hit once again as we head into Christmas and asking people to reduce their social contacts. Maybe that is necessary but the Taoiseach cannot absolve himself of the responsibility to do absolutely everything he possibly can to reduce the impact of this virus and the Government is not doing it when it comes to air quality. When you go into a hospital for surgery, the air in the operating theatre is filtered precisely to prevent the transmission of infection in the theatre. Why does the Taoiseach think that is done? It is done because it works. It stops the transmission of infectious disease through the air. So the science is clear on this. It will definitely help. It could be a game-changer but it will definitely help significantly, yet the Government is delaying. Why is the Taoiseach not demanding minimum air quality standards and providing the resources, like filters, that will be necessary? By the way the cost of HEPA facilities in every school, in hospitals and in nursing homes as well as other places we know the disease has hit disproportionately would be a fraction of the money the Government is having to pour out on income supports.

We are not against HEPA filters. We are for them and will provide resources for them. I have said this three times today already. There are 50,000 classrooms across the country, between primary and post-primary schools. The Department and the Minister are adopting a targeted approach to address ventilation issues, which may include air cleaners, where required. We are looking here at air cleaners costing between €1,500 and €1,800, which we think are what is required for classrooms.

Hopefully, there will be no further snafus with building on the Taoiseach's promise to the people of the south east.It is fair to say that we had all better keep a beady eye on the delivery of these future approved appointments. With that in hand for the moment, it allows me to use my time to address an issue of national importance, that is, our dysfunctional insurance market. Insurance, the contributions of the many for the losses of the few, is supposed to make our society more resilient. Our Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was not wrong when he observed that we do things in life, such as playing sport or throwing a child onto a trampoline, that inherently carry a risk. We have got to manage that risk. Increasingly, commercial business, not-for-profits, schools, the Government and families are finding it hard, and that they can do less in life, because insurance is not working. This is déjà vu from 20 years ago. Occupiers' liability remains extraordinarily onerous. If something happens on your premises, you are to blame, irrespective of the circumstances. Nothing has happened on the reform of occupiers' liability, despite it being in the justice action plan. The ink is barely dry on the personal injuries guidelines committee award levels and they are already being circumvented. There appear to be no repercussions for making persistent nuisance, or even downright fraudulent, claims. Cases take too long and take too much out of the people involved in them. Simply put, insurance costs too much and for many it is becoming impossible to obtain at any reasonable economic cost. Indeed, what is becoming a parasitical insurance-medical-legal industry crushes the social, cultural and economic vitality of our society. It is no surprise that that honeypot crushed the troika back in the day. It is surely time to grab the nettle and stop tinkering with tort reform but replace tort compensation with a sturdy social security framework that serves victims without respect to cause or fault. Tort reform was legislated for in Australia a decade ago and has delivered for that society. We must do something similar in Ireland.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	48	I thank the Deputy for his query. I noted his comments regarding the cardiac situation in Waterford, which we will continue to pursue vigorously. I am conscious another Waterford Deputy and Minister is sitting adjacent to me, who is also advocating strongly for that. I take the Deputy's point on the issue. On insurance inform, I have a lot of sympathy with the Deputy's comments on the impact of insurance costs on employment, business and enterprise. That is why it is a key priority for the Government. The action plan for insurance reform was published in December 2020. It sets out 66 actions to bring down costs for consumers and businesses, introduce more competition into the market, prevent fraud and reduce the burden on enterprises and community and voluntary organisations. Some 95% of the actions are due to be completed by the end of 2021. The first action plan implementation report, published in July, shows that tangible progress has been made. The introduction of new personal injury guidelines is one example. Early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board demonstrates that award levels have declined by an average of 40%. I take the Deputy's point that we need to see that translated into premium reductions. An office to promote competition in the insurance market has been established, chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for financial services, credit unions and insurance, Deputy Sean Fleming, who is doing exceptional work on this topic. The Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 passed all Stages on 15 June. This will make perjury an offence for the first time and will, therefore, help tackle insurance fraud. An insurance fraud co-ordination office has been established within An Garda Síochána. The Deputy identified the issue of occupiers' liability. He will know that the Department of Justice has recently completed a review of the Occupiers' Liability Act, which included the issues of duty of care, notices and waivers. The Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, has noted to Government the intention to bring forward legislative proposals to reform the law in this area. Those proposals are at a very advanced stage. The Minister has indicated that the heads of the relevant amendments have been drafted and advice has been sought from the Office of the Attorney General. The planned rebalancing of duty of care with a view to applying a common sense approach to risk is of particular relevance to leisure and high-footfall activities, as it will help to address so-called slips, trips and falls. The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is progressing development of a general scheme of legislative amendments to increase the number of cases which are settled by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, without recourse to litigation and he is working in consultation with the Attorney General on the reform of PIAB and legislative reforms in that regard. A comprehensive programme of action is under way. The issue will be, as those reforms are implemented and given effect to, whether we can translate those reforms. We need to ensure the translation of those reforms into reduced costs for people, such as households, community and voluntary groups and businesses.

It is becoming unaffordable and unavailable for a significant number of sectors. Many only have recourse to one underwriter and they have to pay whatever is being asked of them. The Taoiseach mentioned PIAB and he knows PIAB claims are being circumvented with the attachment of post traumatic stress to soft tissue injuries. That was never meant to be where we were going in terms of the personal injuries guidelines committee, PIGC. There has been no attachment of costs to solicitors' practices bringing nuisance cases. I have not seen any and, in fact, there was one high profile case recently where the judge explicitly refused to do this. It related to GAA insurance. The insurance companies are not settling. They are settling low-pay costs because they do not want to go to the High Court and even when they are getting awards, they cannot recover the costs from the other side. This is leading to this large level of dysfunction. When the Taoiseach talks about claims falling, what he is really talking about is the motor insurance industry. That is the only heading where insurance claims appear to be falling and where premiums are falling. They are not falling anywhere else. I have a friend in the sports amenity business who is facing a claim from somebody who broke through a fence, came into the property at night and injured themselves. My friend is facing a personal injuries claim, as an occupier. Unfortunately, this is endemic throughout the country if one looks at where the courts are going. It is being supported, unfortunately, by many in the legal profession and we will have to legislate again and properly on insurance reform beyond what we are doing.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	50	I thank the Deputy for raising what is a very important issue for people and it is part of a wider agenda within Government to reduce costs for people in their ordinary lives. Insurance is a significant cost, whether one is in a household, motoring or in a business. The Deputy was correct to point to the reduction in motor insurance. This morning, the Government again adopted a significant road safety strategy for the coming years. It is interesting when one looks at the number of people who died on our roads 20 years ago compared to now. The number is stark - in other words, it is far fewer now. I stand corrected on the figures but it was something like 450 per annum but it is approximately 150 now, which is still too many. However, it illustrates what good strategies and reforms can achieve. I recall the howling in the House when the then Minister was introducing drink driving laws and so on. Deputies were opposing them. Noel Dempsey was the Minister at the time and the late Gay Byrne headed up the RSA. However, the results are there to be seen in reduced road fatalities and accidents. Strategies work. The agenda we have for insurance reform is comprehensive and will work, but we have to keep the focus on it and make sure it works and translates into reduced costs.

In May 2019, I warned the then Taoiseach and current Tánaiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, that the contract signed by the Government to deliver the national broadband plan was a bad deal for the taxpayer. I raised a concern that the contract would see the taxpayer shell out over €3 billion up front to roll out the broadband network and, at the end of the day, the State would not own the infrastructure. I also raised the concern that the bidder had very little skin in the game and could walk away at any time. It now transpires that the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Robert Watt, shared my concerns. In a memo to the Government he described the contract as a "leap of faith" with "unprecedented risk" to the Exchequer in an asset we will not even own. Today's article raises serious questions about this deal. Will the Taoiseach confirm that Oak Hill Advisors are the ultimate majority shareholder of National Broadband Ireland? This is crucial because Oak Hill Advisors is a US firm specialising not in long-term infrastructure investment but as a vulture fund investing in distressed debt. Will the Taoiseach confirm how much this consortium has contributed and how much it has already recouped from this deal?

My Labour Party colleague in Dún Laoghaire, Councillor Denis O'Callaghan, has been working on a co-operative housing proposal for ten years to deliver 42 homes on Loughlinstown Drive. It was to be delivered by Co-operative Housing Ireland, CHI, which had 34 social housing apartments. It also included eight three-bedroom homes that families in the Loughlinstown housing co-operative would receive. This important initiative has been going on for a long time. The land was disposed of by the council to CHI and the Loughlinstown group in 2018 but the developer pulled out last week.The planning permission will lapse next spring and not alone will we lose 34 social houses, but eight families who have scraped and saved will lose their homes. I ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to intervene in this matter because we are very short on time.

I would make the point that I do take on board very seriously the report today. Mortgage lending is very robust at the moment and commencements, which are mentioned in that report, have increased very significantly. We are looking at approximately 31,000 commencements from October to October. While it is extraordinarily challenging, the help-to-buy scheme and the shared equity scheme and others will help first-time buyers. This is the highest number of commencements in a decade in any one 12 month period. There are signs of hope.

I want to revisit the conversation we had previously with regard to HEPA filters. The Taoiseach mentioned previously that a budget for HEPA filters would be coming on stream in the next couple of weeks. Is that budget the annual minor works grant scheme? If that is the budget to which the Taoiseach refers, are we facing a scenario where schools will be in the invidious situation of having to choose between fixing a broken window or toilet and the installation of a much-needed HEPA filter? Would it not be much better if we had a standalone budget for primary schools that is specifically for HEPA filters? We cannot have a scenario where schools will have to choose between minor works and a mitigation that will, to some degree, make children safer.

There are technical teams available to talk to schools in respect of what will work best for them. There is emergency works funding as well. We have already delivered 35,500 CO2 monitors to 4,000 schools across the country. They are an important aspect following the advice the Minister received. The advice also is that HEPA filters may be appropriate in certain circumstances. As I said earlier, the cost of a HEPA filter is approximately €1,800.

That is an absolutely scandalous position that he has been trying to avoid spelling out all afternoon. I have been listening to him. In any case, I want to ask a question about the sneaky fine print with regard to the announcement made by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, which brings in a new rock bottom pandemic unemployment payment, PUP rate of €150 per week, which is less than the dole and far below the poverty line. It is a lump of coal in the stockings of those hospitality and entertainment workers who have lost their jobs due to the new restrictions. The PUP should be properly restored at €350 per week for all. The question now is if those who lost their jobs in the past weeks due to the restrictions and had to sign on to regular unemployment allowance as the PUP was closed will be allowed to switch to the PUP and get the higher rates or, as seems to be implied by the Minister's press statement, are they stuck on the lower rates because they were let go a few days too soon?

From approximately 26,000 appeals, some 14,000, or just over 50%, appear to have led to a revised decision. This raises important questions about the fairness, transparency and efficiency of social welfare decision-making. If that decision-making were robust and dependable, one would expect few decisions to be overturned. How many people do not raise an appeal when they should? As the Taoiseach and I both know, as does every other Deputy, past and present, denying a payment can have a huge impact on our most vulnerable people and their dependants. Can there be an improvement in standards of work in the Department of Social Protection?

I have brought to Cabinet a request, as reflected in the social protection legislation I am bringing through at the moment, to allow for the appointment of two more registered officers for appeals purposes. That should help to improve any delays. In fairness, the turnaround time has improved considerably over the past number of months.

Why were taxes on fuel not capped in order that, if there were a fuel increase, people would only be paying for the increase and not any extra tax? We are paying an extra 19 cent per litre in tax in the past 12 months, which means every household in Ireland is paying €10.75 in tax out of every €100 of fuel. The farmers and people in the truck industry are on their knees. This week, they are all going out to protest because of the Government's failure to protect the people of Ireland. Every member of the Government should resign his or her position. Every one of the Government backbenchers and Ministers backed this extra tax we are paying. Since 2020, the State is getting an extra 19 cent per litre.

The commission told the Minister: "Concerning SI 82/1989, I have had reason to re-examine the Department's approach to SARs pertaining to health data and I am of the view that the manner in which the Department is handling such requests is not appropriate to the circumstances." In September, the Minister, in response to the Adoption (Information) Bill brought forward by Deputy Connolly and me, told us we would have this Bill before the House by Christmas. In November, the European Commission opened an investigation into the general data protection regulation, GDPR, matter and the Department told the Commission that it is anticipated that the new regulations will be in place by the end of the year.We have seen nothing yet, despite it being prioritised by the Chief Whip's legislative programme for the term. When will the Government get this done? Will the Taoiseach ensure that the proposed section 10(2), which seeks to limit and continue the same unlawful block on direct access, is removed? Most importantly, in the meantime, will the Taoiseach ensure that the Department desists from its unlawful application of SI 82/1989?

The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O’Gorman, being proactive as he is, has been working in parallel with the committee, monitoring the changes that were going to be made. The intention is to bring the Bill forward as quickly as possible. It is not the Government's fault that it has been delayed. On the regulations and so on, again we are conscious and mindful of the need to act sensitively, appropriately and in a timely manner when responding to subject access requests.

However, it is a two-track recovery, with businesses in the technology, pharma and financial services doing extremely well, while many businesses in the hospitality, entertainment and event sectors are struggling. The Government's commitment to these sectors and their employees is appreciated. However, the latest round of restrictions is having a significant impact on these businesses. Can the Taoiseach provide an update on recent engagements with these sectors and an indication of when targeted supports will be introduced?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	106	First, the economy is recovering faster overall than any other in the European Union. One just has to look at the tax receipts which were, for the first 11 months of this year, over €62 billion. That is more than €5.3 billion ahead of target. The budget deficit this year is said to be much smaller than forecast, one of the smallest in European Union. This is basically good policy at work. It is interesting that there are 30,800 job vacancies now in the third quarter, compared to 17,900 in the same time period two years ago. Many job vacancies are out there at the moment. In respect of the sectors of the economy that have been worst affected as a result of restrictions I, along with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the Minister for Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, met with approximately 30 or 40 representatives of the hospitality sector and the live entertainment, music and theatre groups. We are going to go back to them with bespoke models to assist them to keep theatres open, to keep artists performing and to support the ongoing work in hospitality.

It is a huge sector for employment. It is very much about maintaining that link with their employees. We have a large hospitality sector in Limerick and in the midwest. I want to follow up with the Taoiseach on his discussions yesterday. When does he expect those to be concluded? When does he expect that the scheme will be announced, particularly considering the CRSS and the link with the employees? When will these businesses see money in their bank accounts in terms of State support so that we can keep that link with employees and so they can come through this latest difficulty with Covid-19 restrictions?

Now, in this fourth wave of the pandemic, given the overall fact that there is a lot of activity in the economy, we have to tailor-make our responses into the future. Economy-wide measures in themselves could end up supporting sectors that do not necessarily need supports. This is an evolving situation. The Minister of Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has devised amendments and adjustments to the CRSS programme, designed for the current situation. He is refining and fine tuning those. Likewise, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, is working on the entertainment side, with the theatre and arts groups, keeping venues open, and trying to keep performers performing, whilst making them viable in doing so. That is challenging because it is a very diverse group. That is the kind of work that is under way at the moment.

We always have the highest number of people on trolleys. Some 82 people were on trolleys in the hospital yesterday and, unfortunately, 83 people are on trolleys this morning. This is scandalous. People are not statistics. They need to be treated properly. The staff are under huge pressure and have been working really hard. On Friday, UHL management advised mid-west Oireachtas Members that the new 96-bed unit is not expected to be ready before July 2023 at the earliest. When is the Taoiseach going to intervene in respect of this matter? He must be aware at this stage of the capacity and staffing issues at UHL, but there seems to be no action from him. What is his plan to alleviate capacity pressures at UHL in the here and now? What can he do to expedite the construction of the badly needed new 96-bed unit?

There will be significant moves towards improving the pay and conditions of staff, building on the universal core funding that has been in existence for some years now, targeted funding for disadvantaged areas and significantly expanding the State's involvement in this sector. Does the Taoiseach agree that the proposal approved by Cabinet this morning should pave the way for the ending of price hikes within the childcare sector, particularly when it comes to parents who are trying to hold down careers?

These were brought to Cabinet by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and they relate to workforce development and funding models for childcare into the future. Substantial funding was provided in the last budget for the development of workforce pay and conditions. That now has to go to a joint labour committee, which will arrive at an agreed figure in respect of childcare workers. The policy platforms that have gone through Cabinet today are essential building blocks to develop a high-quality childcare system that puts the child at the centre, because it is about the child at the end of the day. Parallel to that, we have to design a system and a framework that makes it affordable for parents.

There is huge recognition in the sector of the significant support this Government has given it throughout this unprecedented crisis. Some employers were in contact with me this morning who are worried about how the new PUP will affect employees if they have to restrict their hours. A number of requests have been made to me by hoteliers and people in the hospitality sector. They are asking for the restoration of the EWSS employment supports for hospitality businesses to November levels. On the EWSS qualification criteria, they ask that hospitality businesses which may become ineligible in December be given the opportunity to requalify for EWSS supports in January. The other point relates to Covid restrictions support scheme business supports and automatic qualification for those supports if hospitality businesses qualify for the EWSS.

The Minister for Finance is still refining and going through those particular issues. We want to make sure that, whatever we do as a Government, we adequately support and provide supports to the hospitality sector, given the decisions that have been taken.Nightclubs are closing as a result of the measures brought in on foot of public health advice - the closing time is back to midnight - and there has been a fall-off in corporate bookings for restaurants and so forth. It is a different type of phase that we are in now. Therefore, it needs a different type of response. We are working on that to make sure that the gap is basically narrowed and that businesses can continue on with good viability and retain staff.

The repeal of the eighth amendment was a landmark decision and the recent budget announcement to provide free contraception to young women was welcome, but women's healthcare goes far beyond contraception and family planning. Menopause can be a challenging time for women physically, mentally and, according to studies, professionally. In 2019, the women's health task force recommended that we needed to improve supports for menopause. Many women find that hormone replacement therapy, HRT, is a lifeline throughout menopause but that the cost can be a barrier to access. Last week, a constituent of mine sent me a copy of her bill for €62.33 for a month's supply of HRT with the comment, "It really still is a man's world". What is the Government doing to improve menopause supports for women and does the Taoiseach have an update on the commitment by the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to establish dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland?

To be fair, the Minister for Health has really led on this front in terms of the programme and the priority he gave it in his budget submission to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. He received funding to create this year four specialist menopause clinics. The first of those four menopause clinics has opened. The intention is to do all four this year.

On 13 January in an attempt to apologise to the victims and survivors of mother and baby homes, the Taoiseach stated that children born outside marriage were treated as outcasts. Some 40% of the survivors now feel that they are being treated like outcasts because they are excluded from the redress scheme. A motion that was passed in the Dáil on 23 November and that the Government did not oppose called on the Government to engage immediately with the victims and survivors who were directly affected by this and to review urgently the time-based criteria, the exclusion of children boarded out and the proposed payment rates. What does the Taoiseach intend to do or are the mother and baby home survivors - the outcasts - going to have to go out on the streets again to push this issue forward?

The majority of people in the State who have died during the pandemic caught Covid in a hospital or a nursing home. Indeed, more than 2,000 people died after contracting Covid in a nursing home. Many of their families are deeply distressed and want to know the truth of what happened to them. Nursing homes were kept open to visitors longer than nursing homes wanted. There was a surge of 10,000 patients from hospitals into nursing homes in the first half of 2020 and many of them were not tested. Will the Government support the Aontú Bill for a commission of investigation into nursing homes?

If my Bill is passed, it would establish a statutory Dublin Bay authority charged with preserving for future generations the distinctive character of Dublin Bay and its ecology as a coastal resource. The authority would have the aim of creating a better framework for environmental protection, governance and improvement of water quality for all of those who use the bay. The idea is that the authority will create and strengthen a better framework for the protection of one of the great resources that our city has. Indeed, it is one of the greatest resources that all of us in Dublin have, not just those in my constituency of Dublin Bay South. All of us in Dublin have strong connections to the body of water stretching from Howth to Sorrento Point. We have strong connections to the bay. It is often the first thing we see when we fly into Dublin when coming home. It welcomes us, it is where many of us learned to swim, sail or paddle and, of course, it is the location for the opening chapter of our greatest novel, Ulysses. I am proud to have worked with a number of people on this Bill, particularly our local councillors in Dublin Bay South, Mr. Dermot Lacey, Ms Mary Freehill and Mr. Kevin Donoghue. Councillor Lacey in particular has been calling for a model like this for some time. I have also worked with swimmers from the Half Moon club in Poolbeg and a group that was formed in 2020 arising out of concerns about water quality in the bay, namely, SOS Dublin Bay. As many colleagues will be aware, the latter's "Save Our Sea" petition has more than 20,000 signatories. Since the start of the terrible pandemic and throughout the various Covid lockdowns, we know how much the bay has become a place of refuge for year-round and seasonal sea swimmers. All too often, though, water quality has been poor and swimming has consequently been under threat in the bay. Biodiversity in the bay, including marine life, is under threat as a result. We want to establish a statutory authority with a specific mandate to propose and promote policies and priorities for the protection and enhancement of the environment, natural habitats and wildlife and to ensure proper monitoring and regulation of sea water quality.The membership of the authority would come from among elected members of the Eastern and Midlands Regional Assembly and others with a special expertise or interest in the future protection of Dublin Bay. While environmental protection will be a key requirement of the new authority, it would also have a mandate to improve access and facilities around Dublin Bay. We are conscious that there is an informal task force which has some responsibilities around Dublin Bay but which has no statutory powers. As a result, there is a lack of co-ordination for the protection and enhancement of this wonderful amenity. For decades we have witnessed the crumbling dereliction of the old Sandymount and Blackrock baths and a lack of facilities for those who would like to be able to use the sea and the bay in a more meaningful manner. We might even see a lido with public access for all swimmers in George's Dock if we establish a new authority with statutory powers that this Bill anticipates and envisages. Such a statutory model works elsewhere. For example, on the east coast of the US, a statutory task force was established some years ago for Chesapeake Bay to preserve the future of the bay, improve water standards and encourage greater use of the bay by local people. That is the sort of community facility we want to see established in and around Dublin Bay. That is why this Bill is so important. At the end of October, I asked a question of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on water quality in Dublin Bay. I was seeking to ensure a better system for monitoring water quality for all of us who swim in the bay throughout the year. On the floor of the House, the Minister disclosed that he, a regular sea swimmer as am I, had recently had an ear infection and wondered if it might be connected to the quality of water in the bay. I have never, to my knowledge, become sick as a result of poor water quality in the bay, but this is a real concern for many others with whom I regularly swim. Many of us have concern about ongoing discharges from the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant and the potential damage that dredging is causing to the ecosystem and biodiversity in Dublin Bay. It is not just about human usage of the bay; we also want to protect marine life and biodiversity. We need a joined-up and co-ordinated approach to the protection and enhancement of the bay. This Bill and the statutory authority it envisages would represent an important first step towards realising the true potential of the bay. I look forward to the Government accepting the Bill given that it has a very important environmental purpose and could really garner cross-party support. I look forward to future debates on it and to working with colleagues and others in the new year to ensure it will pass.

That increase is directly related to the dramatic rise in notices to quit issued since the Government lifted the ban on such notices. This morning, the Simon Communities of Ireland launched this simple but important Bill which gives local authorities greater powers to try to prevent families and children from becoming homeless. It is supported by five Opposition groupings on the floor of the Dáil today. It will be introduced on Second Stage during Sinn Féin's Private Members' time next week. We all need to shift the focus onto homelessness prevention. We need to ensure our local authorities have every power to prevent adults and children from losing their homes and entering emergency accommodation. On that basis, I warmly commend the Bill to the House.

It is simple and straightforward. It is short, but if enacted, its impact would be far reaching. It would greatly support those families, all too many of whom have tried hard to find alternative accommodation often late on a Friday evening, but are suddenly left without a roof over their heads because of an eviction notice. This important Bill is about preventing homelessness, giving space to tenants and local authorities to work together to stop the threat of eviction becoming a reality. We thank the Simon Communities of Ireland and all our colleagues who have supported the Bill. I hope it will indeed attract cross-party support and, in particular, support from the Government. I commend the Simon Communities of Ireland on their work on the Bill.

It uproots families from their communities, friends and support networks. All of us in this House, whether in opposition or in government, have a responsibility to work together to try to tackle homelessness. This is a very practical Bill which puts the focus exactly where it should be: on preventing homelessness. Whatever we can do to tackle homelessness is very worthwhile. It is highly beneficial to prevent the trauma of homelessness in the first place. There is cross-party support on the Opposition benches. I appeal to the Government parties to support the Bill and ensure that it progresses quickly through the Oireachtas. It needs to be implemented as quickly as possible and worked on urgently so that we can make headway in reducing the number of people becoming homeless.

Last week, a man came to my clinic with an eviction date in a couple of weeks. He broke down crying in front of me because he thought he and his family would be out on the street. He was absolutely racked with terror at that possibility. This happens week in, week out. This man had done nothing wrong. He had worked all his life and then had an injury which prevented him from working and impacted on his circumstances. Now he is faced with homelessness. We cannot allow this to continue and this is an important measure in giving tenants and local authorities some opportunity to try to prevent people being flung out on the street or into emergency accommodation. It will prevent that kind of despair, hardship and suffering for people who do not deserve it and who, like everybody else, should have the right to a secure roof over their heads. I hope the Government will support the Bill.

I am supporting the Bill because it is a progressive step for people facing increasing notices to quit and will protect them from eviction and homelessness. In October, 8,830 women, men and children were in emergency accommodation, an increase of 4.2% on September. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (Extension of Notice Periods) Bill 2021 will allow local authorities to determine whether a person or family is at risk of homelessness and this will then trigger an extension in the notice period of that person's or family's tenancy in order to avoid entry into emergency accommodation at the end of the four-week period. It also proposes to change the tenancy law so that a person or family at risk of homelessness is provided with a three-month extension to their notice period. I believe every party can support the Bill and I look forward to next week's debate on 14 December when the Government parties will have an opportunity to support it.

I particularly thank the North West Simon Community for all its help to me in providing good information and background. This is a straightforward, practical proposal which does exactly what it says on the tin. Where the housing authority certifies that a tenant, who is under threat to quit, is at risk of homelessness, a three-month extension will be granted. There will be protections for landlords. This is not simply postponing the inevitable. The three months will then be used to help secure accommodation so that families do not become homeless because of a lack of early intervention. Homelessness is not just an urban problem. While it may be more visible in urban areas, in 2020 the North West Simon Community provided accommodation and-or support to 256 adults and 243 children in the north west. It is a national issue that needs a national response and this Bill provides it.

The sector is to be replaced by a civic society forum made up of Department of Health appointees. This new structure has yet to be formalised or established. There is a growing opinion across the oversight committee that officials are now intent on pushing out those who voice opinions contrary to the Department’s or, worse still, who attempt to hold it to account. I hope the Taoiseach is as alarmed as I am at this development, although I have to say I am not entirely surprised by the Department's actions. Speaking at two recent events in the north inner-city, the Taoiseach acknowledged the irreplaceable work of the community in tackling addiction over the last three decades. His support for the community was widely welcomed but there is now a concern across the north inner-city that his view is at odds with the actions of departmental officials with responsibility for the national drug strategy. Following a cross-party initiative last week opposing the Department's decision to remove the community and voluntary networks from the national drug strategy oversight committee, the Minister of State, Deputy Frankie Feighan, asked Department officials to engage further on the matter. While I welcome this intervention, I am sorry to say that my experience tells me not to hold out too much hope as the Department has, in effect, dismantled the north inner-city drug and alcohol task force and closed down the community sector’s involvement in its work. So bad is the situation that the Inner City Organisations Network and the North West Inner City Network, which are long-established bodies, have been left with no option but to issue a joint statement calling on the Taoiseach to urgently intervene. I wish to echo their call. There is now a clear and dangerous bias within the Department of Health against the community's role in the national drug strategy, locally and nationally, and that cannot stand.

These are badly needed social and affordable houses, so this is a pretty devastating blow in a situation where there is a desperate crisis in our area in terms of the lack of social and affordable housing. I put it to the Taoiseach that not only does he need to intervene on this, but the problem is the council cannot even give it to the other tenderers because of the time limits of the tendering process, and so on. This contractor who has pulled out is also involved in another social housing project in the area. This calls into question the entire Housing for All strategy. If a contractor can pull out based on hyperinflation, because it cannot make money, this can happen at any time. We know there is hyperinflation going on in the construction sector and profiteering, arguably, around the housing crisis. We need intervention around this particular project but, actually, it speaks loudly to the need for a State construction company to deliver on the social and affordable housing targets. We cannot be in a situation where, in terms of the delivery of social and affordable housing, we can be held hostage by contractors who can just pull out on the basis they have decided something is not profitable for them. I ask seriously whether we need to consider the establishment of a State construction company to deliver social and affordable housing. Otherwise, we could find our entire project in that regard under serious threat.

I got a lot of bluster back from the Taoiseach but I did not get an answer. It seems to me that a point of very basic inequality has been created, if I am reading the terms of the new PUP scheme correctly. I would be delighted if the Taoiseach could confirm to me that I am reading them incorrectly and that this inequality is not being created. It seems pretty clear that if, for example, a worker who was earning €450 a week in the entertainment sector lost their job last week as a result of the impact of the Covid restrictions, the impact on the night-time economy and so on, and they then went on the dole, they are not entitled to move onto the pandemic unemployment payment, whereas the equivalent worker who loses their job next week will be entitled, correctly, to go onto the pandemic unemployment payment and will be able to get €350 per week. There will be a difference of income between two workers in identical situations in that they are both out of work as a consequence of pandemic restrictions but have a difference of income between them of €147 per week. I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that that is the case and to take action to reverse it to ensure that anybody who loses their job as a result of Covid restrictions is able to access the PUP at that €350 rate.

Loneliness is a threat to physical and mental health and, for example, 21% of older adults say they are currently suffering from depression, a figure that is double what it was before Covid. Nearly one third of older people say they are suffering from increased levels of stress.One third of older adults said that they either delayed medical care or that medical care was delayed for them. These are heartbreaking and shocking figures. By any measure these figures are a disaster and they are mostly invisible to society. What is the Government doing to mitigate that?

They have been left floundering trying to come up with ways to implement the 50% rules on capacity. It leaves them in the unenviable position of having to put on twice the number of performances on depleted finances or of having to cancel their shows. I welcome the fact the National Campaign for the Arts met Department officials yesterday and that supports will be put in place. I would like to draw the Taoiseach’s attention to the amateur and community arts sector. For example, Born 2 Perform is an amateur kids theatre company in Cavan and Monaghan with hundreds of kids in it who need these supports. It has performances booked out for a week in January and it is left with nothing because it does not reach the benchmark of €150,000 of a turnover. We need to put something in place to save it.

I refer to the Greentown initiative, which aims to deal with criminal networks and to the recently established community safety partnerships arising from the Commission on the Future of Policing, one of which is located in Dublin’s north inner city. I welcome the fact the Taoiseach launched the fourth annual report of the north-east inner city forum last week. I wish to draw the Taoiseach’s attention to a report published last year by Dr. Jack Nolan, retired assistant commissioner for Dublin City Council, on the Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview areas of Dublin Bay North entitled, Darndale, A Long View of an Enduring Challenge, A Socio-Economic & Community Plan. The report was drawn up in response to the escalating levels of violence and antisocial behaviour in the area. It advances an inter-agency approach and makes a number of recommendations. The Department of Justice and An Garda Síochána are central to the report. Can this report be considered by the Cabinet committee as a model of best practice and can all relevant Departments get fully behind the report?

The average deposit a first-time buyer needs to buy a home stands at €52,500. This has doubled in less than a decade. The average age of a first-time buyer is rising steeply and rents have almost doubled in the last decade. According to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, "The construction of new rental homes ... is only viable for households with a gross annual income of at least €100,000.” Does the Taoiseach agree that the increases in house prices and rents, well beyond the rate of wage increases, are completely unsustainable? Does he agree with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the kind of new rental properties that investment funds are bringing on stream are simply unaffordable and out of reach for most people?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	181	I will engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, on the community and voluntary networks and their engagement in the national alcohol and drug strategy. I passionately believe in the community and voluntary pillar in terms of the implementation of national strategies and in working to formulate and implement those strategies. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of tenders. The issue he raises is a feature of the current inflation hike and the increase in building costs, which is not profiteering. We all know the cost of raw materials for building has increased due to supply chain issues arising from Covid-19. The Deputy is correct that there are procurement issues around what happens if somebody pulls out of a project, particularly in public contracts. As I told Deputy Kelly earlier, I will ask the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, to engage on this issue and to see what can possibly be done to rescue the provision of that housing. It is a feature of the tendering process that costs have gone up across the board, which everybody acknowledges.

In this case the developer has pulled out. I will ask the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, to get involved and to see if he can do something. I refer to the points raised by Deputy Paul Murphy. I would not describe what I was doing earlier as “bluster”. On the issue of intervening in the jobs market, the point I was making is that there are 30,000 vacancies in the jobs market, which is up from 19,000 vacancies two years ago. We need to take focused and targeted approaches as we emerge from and evolve throughout the pandemic. We are not where we were when we were in level 5 and level 3 lockdowns; sectors of the economy are open. Anyone who has been on the PUP for more than 12 months will be targeted with activation measures to help them secure work. We will do whatever we can to support those people. Deputy Tóibín raised the TILDA study. Covid has had an impact and this is a pandemic. We have provided unprecedented resources across the board, including community supports and mental health supports, to enable people to try to deal with this. There is no question but that it is stressful for people and it has dampened their future horizons. Delayed medical care is a sad, difficult and challenging reality of Covid-19, so we will put more resources in place to deal with that. We are hiring a lot more capacity from the private sector to deal with elective care, in particular, so that we can get operations, procedures and diagnostics done. The report Deputy Haughey raised is an important framework within which to develop policy on community safety. In the north inner city last week I saw at first hand the significant progress that was made within that community due to the initiatives that have been taken in recent years. I am looking to see where wider application of that model can be carried out in other areas with a more multidisciplinary and multi-agency approach to dealing with a range of challenges that communities across the city and in other cities are facing. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, has made proposals in that regard. Deputy Cian O’Callaghan made similar comments on that report and he raised the issue of first-time buyers. I agree houses are expensive and we need more supply. Since the last lockdown we have made a significant rebound in housing and there have been about 31,000 commencements from October 2020 to October 2021, which is good. The mortgage market is robust with significant increases in the number of people taking out mortgages. The help-to-buy scheme is helping people with affordability. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, has developed a range of affordability measures that are making a difference.

The relationship between Ireland and the United States is deep and of long standing. It is important to the country in many ways, not least politically and economically, and it is one to which I attach the highest value. I have had a number of recent contacts with the President of the United States. I most recently spoke to him by phone on 14 November, when he congratulated Ireland on defeating the All Blacks in that wonderful rugby international. I also had the opportunity to speak to him in person on the margins of the world leaders' summit at COP26, when he vigorously reaffirmed his full commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement and I expressed my deep appreciation for the strong position he has taken in that regard. On 21 September I participated remotely in a global vaccine summit hosted by President Biden, at an event around the 76th session of the UN General Assembly in New York. I will also participate in a further virtual summit on democracy to be hosted by the US President on 9 December.I look forward to continuing to work co-operatively and closely with the Biden Administration, as well as representatives of both parties in Congress to deepen Irish-American relations, strengthen EU-US relations, co-operate on global challenges and support the many Irish people who have made a home in the United States.

He has taken every opportunity to outline the importance of this international agreement and its significance, not just to our country, Britain and Europe but also to the United States. President Biden and other senior political figures have continually given a message to the British Government that Brexit must not damage any aspect of the Good Friday Agreement or its workings. Congress has passed motions in both Houses clearly stating their concerns about Brexit and particular interest in the Good Friday Agreement. In the past very eminent personnel such as Senator George Mitchell held the post of US special envoy to Northern Ireland. Has the Taoiseach raised this issue with President Biden? The appointment of a special envoy would demonstrate the continued US commitment to Northern Ireland. Such an envoy would also act as an additional conduit for bilateral relations on a political, economic, social and trade basis.

He proclaims his Irish heritage whenever he can. The most recent example of this was when he called the men's Irish rugby team to congratulate them on their historic victory over New Zealand. I understand that he also contacted the Taoiseach to pass on his congratulations to the people of Ireland on that victory. It is also clear that the Taoiseach has struck up a good personal relationship with the new President. All of us who believe in multilateral diplomacy and a rules-based international order and who want to see effective measures to tackle climate change, for example, will welcome the change in tone of the US Administration since last year. Has the Taoiseach invited President Biden to make an official visit to Ireland? If so, when is he likely to come here? Separately, it is clear that President Biden, as well as the EU, has concerns that Russia is planning a possible major military offensive in Ukraine. There are reports that Russia is ready to deploy up to 175,000 troops along the Ukrainian border. President Biden is reported to be considering new measures to deal with this threat and a video call with President Putin is scheduled. How concerned is the Taoiseach about these reports? Is this something that the European Council will consider at its meeting later this month?

It goes beyond the Administration itself and the White House and is a position that is shared across the aisles in Congress, including the Senate, and I very much welcome that. Indeed, I had the opportunity to have exchanges and hear those commitments at first hand last week. What vigorous assertions did the Taoiseach make by way of reply to President Biden? What exchanges has he had in respect of legacy and the proposed amnesty legislation the British Government is pressing? What conversation has the Taoiseach commenced in respect of the reunification of our island and the real prospect of referendums on that question in the coming years? Finally, what work has the Taoiseach done and what representations has he made in respect of the many thousands of undocumented Irish citizens trapped in the United States?

Ms Emma Reilly was recently sacked by the UN, reportedly because she blew the whistle on a practice whereby the UN provides to Chinese diplomats the names of Uighur human rights campaigners. She said she has the documents to prove it. In 2013 Emma received an email from Chinese diplomats asking her to confirm the names of Uighurs who were due to speak at a UN event in Geneva. She was told by her superiors in the UN that she should confirm those names to China. We can only imagine what happened to the people involved and their families. Emma tried to speak out about this particular issue and, as a result, armed police were sent to her door to prevent her from speaking at events. Will the Taoiseach speak with Emma Reilly, the whistleblower? Will the Government be sending a representative to the winter Olympics in China?

They have released some of the Government Ministers that they imprisoned but there has been a very significant crackdown on civil society, with protestors killed, large numbers of people wounded and many imprisoned. It is very questionable as to whether the generals who conducted the coup are serious about carrying through with the democratic revolution that started in 2019. Sudanese civil society and Sudanese people living here who support the democratic movement in Sudan have asked that the big powers, particularly the EU but also the US, would stop sending money to the Janjaweed and to the Sudanese military via the Khartoum process because that money is ending up in the hands of the Janjaweed who have carried out atrocities and who are engaging in a quite brutal clampdown on Sudanese civil society. Has the Taoiseach discussed this with his European and American counterparts? Does he have a view on whether sanctions could be imposed to stop this money from getting to the Janjaweed?

If there is a fire in our house, we cannot just put out the fire in the bedroom and forget about all the other rooms in the house. Similarly, vaccinating everyone in the EU and the US but leaving the global south unvaccinated will inevitably lead to a higher number of additional variants and more danger of potentially dangerous variants, such as Omicron, which will then spread around the world. Even the US has now accepted the need to waive intellectual property rights on the vaccines to end the artificial scarcity of vaccines and to put vaccinating the world before the profits of big pharmaceutical companies but the European Union, backed up by Ireland, has been the major block on this measure at the WTO. In light of Omicron, will the Taoiseach now change course and join those calling for the patents on vaccines to be scrapped so that the whole world can be vaccinated as soon as possible?

The President has been very consistent, in all my conversations with him, on the imperative of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and also on the importance of the protocol in the context of the trade agreement between the UK and EU. Deputy Smith referenced the idea of restoring the post of US special envoy to Northern Ireland. That idea has merit and is something we will continue to engage with the President and his Administration on. That post lapsed some time ago but it is something that should be reflected upon. Overall, Deputy Smith's point has merit. Deputy Haughey raised a number of issues. He is correct in saying that the US President has very warm personal feelings for Ireland. I invited him to Ireland and without hesitation he said that there was nothing he would like better than to come to Ireland as President of the United States. Obviously, his schedule is the key in that regard but he has a great affinity with and affection for the country and is very warm in his engagement with us.The build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine is very worrying and is giving concern to the US Administration and also the European Union. We look forward to engagement between President Biden and President Putin on that issue because it needs to be resolved through negotiation. We want to avoid conflict in that situation, which is a worry given the scale of the build-up.  Deputy McDonald raised President Biden's commitment to the Good Friday Agreement. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, recently met the Friends of Ireland. The support from Capitol Hill, on both sides of the aisle, has been very strong in relation to the logic and importance of the protocol but also the importance of the Good Friday Agreement and the need for the EU and UK to resolve this in a timely and negotiated way. I did not have the opportunity of discussing legacy with President Biden. I do not know if the Deputy saw last night's RTÉ programme on the kidnapping of Don Tidey. Garda Gary Sheehan and Private Patrick Kelly were murdered in their bid to free Don Tidey. It was interesting that the families feel they have had no closure whatever. There is a need for people to come forward. In the Deputy's case, I think the movement that she knows of should come forward and give closure to those families who represented Ireland, Óglaigh na hÉireann and An Garda Síochána. I genuinely do. I am appealing and making a very strong case to the British Prime Minister. In my view, the British Government is wrong on this. The Irish Government is not in favour of what the British Government is proposing but there is a need for the provisional movement, essentially, to come forward and show cause-----

If I can get some communications going on that, I certainly will. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised Sudan. I share his concerns on this. We are not sure about the agreement on 21 November between Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and the coup leader, Lt. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. We do not think that it will, on its own, create a path back to constitutional order. The agreement has been rejected by the majority of the civilian political forces. It effectively consolidates the step taken by the military to maintain the reins of power and excludes civilian political forces. Ireland, with the European Union and at the UN Security Council, has denounced the military's action. We will work with the EU on that agenda. I do not have time to go through the wider arguments on the TRIPS waiver. We favour increased vaccine supply to the global south.

I attended the 36th summit meeting of the British-Irish Council hosted by the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, in Cardiff on 18 and 19 November. The council explored approaches to the acquisition of indigenous, minority and lesser used languages in early years settings. I welcomed the opportunity to provide an update to council members through Irish, as a means of showcasing the rich linguistic diversity across the administrations of the British-Irish Council. The council also discussed the latest political developments, including the ongoing impact of Covid-19 across all administrations and on the protocol. On the morning of the summit, First Minister Mark Drakeford hosted a breakfast meeting for heads of delegation. Discussions focused on climate issues in light of recent developments at COP26. I also had bilateral meetings with the Secretary of State, Michael Gove, the First Minister, Mark Drakeford, and the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and participated in a business programme organised by Enterprise Ireland and the consulate general in Cardiff where we met a number of Irish companies which export to Wales and have a significant presence there. Regarding my latest discussions with the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, we spoke by phone on Wednesday, 24 November. I congratulated him on the successful hosting of COP26 in Glasgow and we briefly referenced the latest developments in relation to Covid-19. We then discussed the Northern Ireland protocol. I welcomed the continuation of the talks between the European Union and United Kingdom on the implementation of the protocol and said that it was essential that these now lead to substantive progress and joint tangible solutions within the framework of the protocol. I emphasised to the Prime Minister that it was vital for stability in Northern Ireland, the British-Irish relationship and the wider EU-UK relationship that this would be resolved through agreed solutions. I reiterated the European Union's commitment to addressing genuine implementation issues and reducing friction and administrative burdens on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. I said it was the view of the Irish Government that the latest proposals from the European Union go very far in seeking to respond to issues raised, especially by the business community. The Prime Minister stated he was committed to agreeing a deal if at all possible. However, he highlighted certain areas where he considered further progress was required. He said he did not wish to trigger Article 16 but noted that it remained a possibility where resolution was not reached through the current talks process. I repeated our view that any triggering of Article 16 would have far-reaching implications for stability in Northern Ireland, the British-Irish relationship and the wider EU-UK relationship. We agreed that co-operation between our two Governments is key to ensuring peace and stability in Northern Ireland, which is a priority for both Governments.

As the Taoiseach is aware, the Westminster Government has agreed to legislate for the Irish language, making Gaeilge an official language in the North. Has the Taoiseach used the British-Irish Council or any other opportunity to raise this commitment with the British Government? If so, can he provide details of these engagements? As we have previously discussed, the Irish language will have full working rights in the EU from 1 January 2022. As a result, all new statutes will be made available in Irish, including regulations, directives and decisions. Is it not a cause of concern for the Taoiseach that while Irish language rights are advancing elsewhere, his Government is appealing a High Court judgment that simply reaffirms the constitutional duty of the State to provide Irish language versions of Acts of the Oireachtas? The British-Irish and North-South strands of the Good Friday Agreement are critical democratic structures. At the July meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, it was agreed that the next plenary would be held in December this year. Will the Taoiseach tell us when this meeting will occur and what action he has taken to ensure it takes place?

That is not a wild claim. It is a real issue. A PSNI report on policing in south Armagh stated that little progress had been achieved on policing in south Armagh since the Good Friday Agreement. South Armagh is not alone. I have spoken to nationalists from Tyrone and Derry who have told me that PSNI policing is heavy-handed and militaristic. This has created a significant divide in these communities. In 2019 and 2020, there were only 16 emergency calls made to the PSNI station in Crossmaglen. That is incredible. The Aontú councillor in Derry, Emmet Doyle, has asked me to invite the Chief Constable of the PSNI to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to discuss the policing crisis in many nationalist areas in the North. I have made this request and understand that the invitation has gone out. I ask the Taoiseach to speak to the Chief Constable of the PSNI to see if we can address the crisis of policing in nationalist areas in the North of Ireland. Will he use the British-Irish Council to fix this disaster?

On the British-Irish Council, I am pleased the Taoiseach was able to attend the meeting. It seems a wide range of issues were discussed, including economic matters, trade, ongoing relations with the EU, COP26, Covid-19, and post-pandemic recovery. As the Taoiseach knows, the council was established in 1998 under the Good Friday Agreement to consider issues arising from the totality of relationships on these islands. There is no doubt Brexit has brought about change in these relationships so it is very important this forum meets regularly and is developed and enhanced. The agenda of the meeting last month was quite formal. Did the Taoiseach get any sense from the various delegations from the devolved administrations that Brexit was a bad idea and that it is having adverse implications for trade and economic progress generally in the various jurisdictions?

In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher took a hatchet to workers and the trade union movement and brought in very draconian anti-worker and anti-trade union legislation to tie the hands of workers and limit their ability to take effective action to defend their rights. What is perhaps less well known is that the Northern Assembly has the power to repeal the anti-trade union laws Thatcher brought in but has failed to do so. It is somewhat disappointing that Sinn Féin has not done this. In order to address this deficit, People Before Profit MLA, Gerry Carroll, has brought forward a trade union freedom Bill to try to undo some of the anti-trade union legislation which is being brought into the Assembly. With all the talk of it being payback time for workers after Covid, this is the right time to call for the Thatcherite anti-trade union laws to be repealed in the Assembly. I wonder what the Taoiseach thinks. I hope all parties in the Assembly will support the legislation Gerry Carroll is bringing forward.

An amnesty would mean putting an end to all investigations and prosecutions. The Stormont House Agreement is a balanced and comprehensive framework to deal with legacy issues and should be implemented. It is unbelievable to think any government would want to cut off all potential avenues to the truth. Such an idea is absolutely deplorable. Some family members have invested huge time, effort and resources - some have literally given up their entire lives - trying to get the truth about what happened to a loved one, be that a sibling, a parent or another relative. It is unthinkable that a unilateral decision would be made by the British Government. Not alone are the political parties in this State and our Government against such an amnesty, but the Northern Ireland Assembly voted unanimously last August in opposition to that proposal. The United Nations, the Council of Europe and senior political figures in the United States oppose it as well. We want to drive home to the British Government the message that it is totally unacceptable.

Seeing the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, in the North visiting Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University Magee campus yesterday shows the real potential in higher education and indeed the wider shared island initiative. As we come to the end of this calendar year, with elections in Northern Ireland next year and the sword of Damocles continuing to hang over us in the British Government's threat to trigger Article 16, where are we on ensuring we can get an element of normality back into relations not just North-South but also east-west?

I do not know if it will be done before the recess but certainly it will be done early in the new year. It is a pity it was not done in the Assembly, as agreed last year. The package of language and identity legislation agreed under New Decade, New Approach was detailed, balanced and should be implemented. When I was in Enniskillen recently at the remembrance ceremony I met the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, Conor Burns. He seemed to be of the view it would be coming forward. He was quite well disposed to getting this done, as was committed to. Deputy Tóibín raised the issue of the crisis of confidence. We need to be careful in our language here. We need to work to build up confidence.

Deputy Haughey raised the issue of what transpired at the British-Irish Council. He made a very good point on Brexit. The First Minister of Wales was very clear on the negative impact of Brexit on Wales, in particular the decline in the volume of goods going through Welsh ports. The Welsh are very worried about the long-term impact on their ports, the consequent impact on local economies and the pattern of trade that is developing in the form of direct links between Ireland and the Continent. The Welsh Government is very aware of that. The First Minister of Scotland was also critical of the impact of Brexit. Importantly, both were very clear in their articulation to the British representative, the Secretary of State, Michael Gove, that they did not need any more disruption around Brexit. The last thing all of us on the council need is more disruption, such as triggering Article 16 and causing a further row with the European Union. The very clear message from all the others at the council to the British Government essentially is that it should resolve this within the framework between it and the European Union. It was quite useful from that perspective. The British-Irish Council is a formal set-up but the informal side of it is better. The breakfast hosted by First Minister Drakeford was very useful, in particular on COP and climate and whether we could do more at a British-Irish level, for example, by having our own mini-COP26, which would be a proper conference on what all the administrations can do in respect of climate and energy, specifically wind energy, wave energy and so on. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, I did not raise trade union rights with the British Prime Minister at my last meeting, a phone call with him, which was overwhelmingly about the protocol. However, I note the measures the Deputy's party is promoting in the Northern Ireland Assembly. I have not seen the exact details of the Bill. I favour the right of trade unions to assemble, work and advocate on behalf of their workers. Deputy Brendan Smith again raised the issue of legacy. I met some relatives of victims of the Glennane gang recently at the request of Deputy Tóibín. I am totally opposed to the British Government's proposal for a number of reasons. Not only does it prevent the truth from getting out in respect of murder and killings by all groups, it potentially leaves the British Army off the hook in terms of some activities. There was collusion involving the Glennane gang and loyalist paramilitaries. There were Provisional IRA killings and murders for which there have been no closure and no accountability. Families are not getting enough information. Why the most heinous of crimes would be buried, if you like, by such an amnesty is something I cannot comprehend. I do not understand how those who perpetrated such crimes should be left off the hook like that without any obligation to be accountable to the families and give them some closure as to who murdered their loved ones. I say this genuinely. I saw last night's programme and it was particularly sad for the relatives of those who lost their lives. They have had absolutely no closure. No one has spoken to them and it has not been resolved. Deputy Richmond raised the North-South Ministerial Council.Reflecting on this, since the Good Friday Agreement, the institutions have not been working for close to ten years. There has been too much stop-start with the institutions and, therefore, we are going through our current challenging period because of Northern Ireland protocol issues that remain to be resolved between the British Government and the European Union. That is affecting the operation of the institutions. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, and I brought a joint memo to Cabinet today updating it on North-South co-operation. A lot of good stuff is happening with the shared island initiative, which is gathering great momentum. We will work at this and the best way is to resolve the issues.

PNR data is information provided by passengers during the reservation and booking of tickets and when checking in on flights. The content of PNR data varies depending on the information given by the passenger and may include, for example, dates of travel, travel itinerary and contact details such as address and phone number. The exchange of this information is to assist in the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. The exchange of this data is an essential tool for law enforcement, including countering terrorist threats across the EU and, of course, is of particular value to law enforcement co-operation between Ireland and the UK. Deputies will be aware that if Ireland wishes to take part in an EU measure with a legal basis that falls under Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, TFEU, Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution is required. The Council intends to adopt this measure by 20 December 2021 at the latest, therefore, it is necessary to secure Oireachtas approval as a matter of urgency and, in light of this, I ask Deputies to pass this motion without a vote. The proposal provides for an extension of the special arrangements currently in place in the TCA to allow the continued sharing of PNR data with the UK, which in the absence of a decision to extend will expire at the end of this year, that is, on 31 December 2021. The extension will allow the existing special arrangements to continue to run until the end of 2022. It is worth noting that this measure makes no policy changes in this area. As the extension needs to be in place by the end of the year, the latest it can be adopted at the EU Council is 20 December 2021. Regretfully, this has put us under pressure to complete the opt-in process as soon as possible. However, as I mentioned, I assure Deputies that the measure is purely technical in nature and does not introduce or amend any policy matters. In essence, it provides for a continuation of existing arrangements until the end of 2022. The Government sincerely regrets the lack of time given to the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider this matter, which was not within the Government's control. Unfortunately, the European Commission was unable to produce the draft proposal earlier than 26 November due to the requirement for internal consultations. I trust that Deputies understand the urgency and necessity of this motion passing today. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK includes arrangements for exchanges of PNR and the protection of such data shared by EU airline carriers to the UK. An essential precondition for the arrangements as set out in the TCA is that the UK applies data protection standards essentially equivalent to those set out in the EU's standards and complies with specific additional data protection standards. While EU member states can retain PNR data for a period of five years, the TCA imposes a requirement on the UK to delete PNR data after one year. This is due to the change in the UK's status from EU member state to a third country. The UK's PNR data processing systems were originally configured to comply with the requirements of EU law. As such, their technical systems, including for the deletion of PNR data, operate in exactly the same way as the systems operated by EU member states. However, the UK currently has no mechanism to operate an automated risk assessment process or to delete PNR data automatically other than upon expiry of a period of five years beginning with the date of transfer. As such, the UK's system for processing PNR data remains configured as it was prior to the UK leaving the European Union. However, intensive work is ongoing by the UK to ensure the necessary technical adjustments are being made to guarantee its compliance with the requirements of the TCA. In the meantime, the UK is operating additional interim period safeguards manually. This includes operating a manual risk assessment process and manually logging and putting beyond use PNR data that should be considered as deleted. Due to these circumstances, Article 552 of the TCA provides for a derogation to this requirement to enable the UK to adapt its systems to ensure compliance. This derogation ends in December 2021. The TCA allows for two such yearly extensions until the end of 2023. The UK has informed the Commission that work is continuing on their systems to facilitate this. It is now in the process of redeveloping its technical systems for processing PNR data to meet the requirements of the TCA and it has requested an extension to the derogation. Consequently, the Commission has published this proposal in order to facilitate an extension of this special arrangement up to 31 December 2022, thus allowing the continued sharing of PNR data with the UK. It should be noted that Article 552(11) of the TCA sets out additional safeguards the UK must follow during the derogation period. In conjunction with the request from the UK, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office carried out an independent review of the safeguards provided for in Article 552(11) of the TCA and confirmed that it is satisfied that the safeguards are in place and are operating as set out in the UK report. Without the extension of the derogation period, PNR data will cease to be shared between the EU and the UK from midnight on 31 December 2021. As Deputies will understand, if this were to happen it is something that could potentially have serious repercussions in the fight against terrorism and could impact on the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases. As mentioned earlier, the proposal presented by the Commission includes the use of the legal bases of Article 87(2)(a), making this a measure under Title V of the TFEU. Thus, Protocol 21 applies and Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution is required for Ireland to opt into the measure. The views of the Office of the Attorney General were sought and the legal advice received has confirmed that Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution is required. To conclude, I emphasise that effective implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is an EU priority and Ireland will play its full part in that. Ireland's role in the EU has changed in recent times and will continue to evolve in the coming years. Full implementation of the TCA is necessary for us not only to play our part as an EU member state, but to ensure that our post-Brexit relationship with the UK continues to grow and develop. Part of this relationship is ensuring that the safety and security of our citizens is protected and this measure is necessary to do that. I trust that the House can support the exercise of Ireland's opt-in in respect of this measure. Ongoing exchange of PNR information with the UK is something that is entirely within Ireland's strategic interest. I thank Deputies for their consideration of this important matter.

We all accept that it makes absolute sense that passenger name records information is maintained for a certain period. We all know that we need all the tools that are required to deal with international crime, which is utterly cross-border and, in some cases, technically more proficient than traditional states or even the likes of the European Union.We have to get ourselves into the game. It hardly comes as a shock that Brexit, the TCA and whatever else have thrown up many anomalies. People could nearly be persuaded to say that Brexit was not necessarily a great idea, but we are where we are. Obviously, we want continuity. What is envisaged when we get beyond this interim period is that PNR information will be maintained for 12 months rather than five years. The stipulation in this regard is laid down in the TCA between the European Union and the British Government. I am not sure that this is necessarily a great idea in the sense that when we are dealing with issues relating to international crime and multiple jurisdictions, it can be incredibly complicated and take a huge amount of time. In that context, information needs to be retained and databases need to be maintained. We know the difficulties and complications we have in dealing with the financial and banking sector. All of the complications in question meant that time is needed. Whether the outworkings of this are a good idea, I am not sure. However, this extension needs to be agreed here and now. We are dealing with a British Government that is looking for this extension because it does not have its systems up to date to allow it to do what it said it would under the TCA. So be it, but it is very difficult to be dealing with this when the mood music is not great. I heard a commentator in the past while talk about the feeling in Government circles being that there is a 50-50 chance of Article 16 being triggered. Nobody believes it will be triggered before Christmas. That is the saving grace. Obviously, the behaviour of the British Government has been utterly ridiculous. I would like to say it has been out of character, but my view of British Governments over many years is that even when you think you have a deal, you do not and the British will go back and try to renegotiate parts of it. Someone who would have known far better than me about dealing with the British Government over many years had the idea that even if it is willing to go from point A to point B, it will take the most circuitous route possible, and that will give rise to a huge amount of pain for you rather than them. That is where we are. Obviously, this also gives succour to certain elements of political unionism that are, let us be clear, probably in fear of the ongoing discussion in respect of Irish unity. A huge number of people who would have probably previously fallen into that bracket of being unionists are at least having a discussion. The thing for an awful lot of people is Irish unity is a means of staying within the European Union and not being allied or wedded to the union with Britain and the madness of dealing with this Tory Government or whatever other Government might be thrown up by the British electorate. That is where we are in respect of this matter. We have had multiple statements and declarations by David Frost and Boris Johnson. You are not always sure what you are dealing with - whether it is an actual negotiation, a gambit or somebody who is just playing to the home crowd and who will eventually come up with a sensible solution. The fact is that you do not know. It provides a certain succour to a type of political unionism that does not want to deal with anything and that has got some way worked up about the sea border when the reality is that, from a business perspective, multiple studies and research work and any of our interactions or those of the Government with business, agriculture and various representatives show that there are definite benefits for the North of staying within the Single Market. Obviously, there are also benefits to remaining connected with the British market at the same time. There is an argument that political unionism could be cutting off its nose to spite its face. The fact is that many others do see the benefits in this regard. Commissioner Šefčovič and the European Commission have tried to come up with solutions, whether in the form of the pledge of an 80% reduction in sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks or the possible 50% reduction in customs checks. All of this can be worked through. I get that there will still be multiple issues for a long time. That is the fact of Brexit. It is fair to say that the Irish protocol was put in place to be a mitigation and to protect conditions on the island of Ireland, where it is no way acceptable for there to be a return of a hard border. I live in Dundalk, not very far from the Border. We all know the history that goes with that and nobody can accept going backwards. We will eventually see where the British Government stands, but the games it is playing are of no benefit to anybody. We have to engage robustly with it, on that basis. There is no choice. We always have to work from the point of view of maintaining dialogue and attempting to get the best result. The best result would be that these Frost-Šefčovič talks come up with a solution and that there will be no further threats and, certainly, no triggering of Article 16 or anything else beyond that. That solution will provide huge benefits for businesses, those in agriculture and others in the North. We will also have to deal with the issue of the democratic deficit in the context of the North having to operate under European rules, without having representation. However, there are multiple methods of doing so, whether it is observer status, certain groupings operating within the European Union and ensuring there is engagement, especially at an Executive and assembly level. We need to make sure that all of this happens. It is absolutely necessary. I get that the mood music is not especially great and we have ongoing threats, such as those from political unionism. The latter is probably down to the fact that it is under severe pressure, electorally, both to the left and to the right. It thinks it can play the trick it has always played of wrapping the Union Jack around it and calling people out onto the streets. That may work to some degree at election time, but it is certainly not working at present. It is also not beneficial to a huge number of people. We want to see definite solutions. We also need to look at our solutions here. I will put it quite clearly. We are 100 years on from the treaty. In historical terms, it was a failure of the republican movement at that time not to have a cohesive organisation and leadership or a well-enough worked out strategy to deal with the treaty negotiations. It was a lost opportunity that ended in many tragedies, one of the biggest being partition. We have all had to deal with the outworkings of that. Until we finish that connection with Britain and with British Governments, we will still have to deal with this madness. I welcome what has happened, particularly a number of the moves in respect of the shared island unit, whether those be cross-Border infrastructural projects such as that relating to the Narrow Water bridge and the commitments in respect of them, the studies, reports and modelling being considered in the context of the North and the South and how Departments work, educational attainment, economies or whatever other issues we are dealing with or the shared island dialogue being expanded properly. Those who will be offended are going to be offended. We need a citizens' assembly. We need to have a full conversation with everyone who is willing to have that conversation. Irish unity is coming, and it will be an absolute disaster if we do not plan for it.

So far, the exchange of data has been largely unaffected by Brexit, which was a significant win for the UK. As a third country, the UK must be held to higher standards than it was previously.In this case, the EU has ruled that the UK data protection system is in line with the GDPR and that the exchange of this kind of data can go ahead. However, we are aware of the rhetoric that has come from Downing Street over the past couple of years. It shows a desire to break with GDPR rules and this will have to be kept under constant review. It could be empty rhetoric but we need to watch it closely. No one wants the UK's national security to be at risk. It is our nearest neighbour. Is there a person in the House that does not have some connection to the UK in terms of family members? However, that does not mean we can accept anything other than the highest degree of compliance with the standards set by the GDPR. The Commission made a point of excluding data transfers for the purpose of UK immigration control from the adequacy decisions it adopted in November. This is due to the ruling in the UK courts that the Home Office practice of denying people their personal data was out of line with the GDPR. That seems to affect about 60% of people seeking access. I think it is to do with denying people access to their data. It is a high number of cases. Do the transfers of PNR data for the purposes of immigration control continue despite that court ruling or are they on hold until the UK remedies the situation? The transfer of PNR data relating to international flights has been common practice worldwide since the 9/11 attack. The EU has many agreements with third party countries as a consequence. Recent judgments by the European Court of Justice have shown that the EU is enforcing increasingly high standards for privacy protections, which is welcome and is needed, especially for agreements formed prior to the GDPR coming into effect. Passenger name records include names, addresses, phone numbers, credit card information and meal preferences, a detail that can indicate ethnicity, religious belief or political affiliation. Strong safeguards need to be in place for the exchange and use of the information. There could be an obvious risk of profiling, for example. It is obvious that this needs our approval and to go ahead, but I would like to hear a response to the point on the UK courts and the non-provision of information which those courts identified.

While I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion, I wish it was not necessary. I wish the UK had not left the European Union but, unfortunately, that train has left the station. Perhaps the UK will rejoin in due course. I had read the motion and am happy to support it for three primary reasons. First, it has already been agreed at European Council level. The Council has done due diligence and its strong assessment is that this is the best way to proceed in light of the less than ideal circumstances. I agree with that recommendation. Second, it makes sense for like-minded countries, particularly neighbours, regardless of which political bloc they align themselves with, to exchange information from a passenger name record point of view. That is for a number of reasons, including the fact that is in our interest to ensure there is good order in the skies and so that, if there is a tragedy or catastrophe, there is no ambiguity about who is on the aircraft and next of kin can be informed. As the Minister of State alluded to, the most important reason is from a law enforcement perspective. It is so that we are in a position to prevent, investigate and prosecute serious crimes by terrorist organisations and organised crime. Third, I recognise and appreciate that we are here today because of a failure on the British side to implement IT systems and get structures in place. It is a recurring theme that they did not plan properly for Brexit but there is no point in punishing our nearest neighbour because it is in Ireland's interest that, on 31 December, there will not be mayhem in the skies and that Irish and European Union passengers will be able to travel freely. The other reason I am in favour of this is because the current arrangements are superior to those proposed by the UK Government. On that basis, I am happy that we roll the existing arrangements over. I wish the motion was not necessary but if past performance is an indicator of future behaviour, I suspect we will be back here in 12 months' time, rolling over the same motion until the sunset clause kicks in at the end of 2023.

I will have the Minister come back to Deputy Catherine Murphy on the question she posed. As I mentioned earlier, this measure is essential to ensure continued close law enforcement co-operation between the EU and the UK. It is vital we meet the highest standards possible when it comes to the investigation and prosecution of crimes, and the ongoing transfer of PNR data helps to ensure that. This extension of the special arrangements in place in the TCA will allow the continued sharing of such data with the UK which, in the absence of a decision to extend, will expire at the end of 2021. The extension will run until the end of 2022. The continuation of these special arrangements to facilitate ongoing exchange of PNR information with the UK is the key to co-operation between the EU and the UK on law enforcement. I commend this motion to the House. On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank all Deputies for attending today.

I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House on Second Stage of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2021. This is an annual technical Bill comprising nine sections, all focused on the issue of health insurance. This legislation is needed in order to revise the parameters of the risk equalisation scheme, which is a financial mechanism that supports our community-rated health insurance market.  The amendments outlined in the Bill will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market and seek to keep health insurance policies at an affordable and equal price for all citizens, young or older, healthy or sick. I will begin by briefly outlining the purpose of risk equalisation before providing an overview of the process undertaken to set the 2022 rates and then outlining the specific provisions which will apply next year.  Currently, 46% of the population in Ireland holds private health insurance. This amounts to 2.3 million people and represents a total annual premium income of more than €2.5 billion. Health insurance in Ireland is provided according to four principles, namely, open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefit and community rating. Our community-rated health insurance market means that the cost of health insurance is shared across all members of the market. In general, everyone, with certain exceptions, can buy the same policy at the same price. Insurers cannot take into account personal circumstances such as health status. Older and sicker people pay much less for health insurance than they would in a risk-rated market. Younger and healthier people who are less likely to access health care pay more than they would in a risk-rated market. As young people grow older, their health insurance needs may increase and they too will be supported by community rating. This principle is called intergenerational solidarity. Community rating is supported by the risk equalisation scheme, which has been operational in Ireland since 2013. In essence, the scheme is a financial transfer mechanism whereby money flows from insurers with healthier members to insurers with sicker members in the form of credits. These credits are funded directly by stamp duty levies on all health insurance contracts when those contracts begin and these levies flow into the risk equalisation fund. Without the scheme, an insurer with older and sicker members would be forced to charge much higher premiums than its competitors to cover its claims costs. None of the stamp duties on health insurance contracts goes to the Exchequer; they are all used to fund risk equalisation credits. The risk equalisation fund is managed by the Health Insurance Authority, the independent regulator of the health insurance market. The risk equalisation scheme requires state aid approval from the European Commission in order to function as part of the private health insurance market. The current scheme was approved in 2016 following negotiation with the Commission, with similar schemes approved and in operation in Ireland since 2003. To date, the scheme has been considered a state aid which is compatible with the internal market by the European Commission. The current scheme is approved to operate until 31 March 2022 and was extended from 31 December 2020 due to the impact of Covid-19. Negotiations are at an advanced stage with the European Commission for the new scheme and are expected to be finalised by the end of the year. As Deputies will be aware, a health insurance Bill is needed each year to update the amount of credits paid to insurers under the scheme and the corresponding stamp duties required to fund them. In addition to these standard technical amendments, this year's Bill provides the legislative basis for the introduction of high-cost claims credits to the scheme. Furthermore, the Bill provides for an updated benchmark of reasonable profit and the introduction of a time limit for insurers claiming from the fund. I will set out the detail of these amendments shortly when outlining the specific provisions. These updates are based on the recommendation of the Health Insurance Authority. Each year, the authority carries out an evaluation of the market, focused on the claims costs that every insurer has paid over the year. This evaluation includes information on market conditions, which is particularly important in recent times as Covid-19 continues to have a large impact on the market. Based on that analysis, the authority recommends the level of credits that should apply for the next year. Significant work has also been carried out by the Health Insurance Authority in the past few years in relation to high-cost claims and how high-cost claims credits will be introduced to improve the effectiveness of the scheme. The authority has provided several reports to the Minister for Health on this new addition, including a final recommendation in June of this year following an open consultation which involved health insurers and members of the public. I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill. Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994. Section 2 amends section 6A of the principal Act to include high-cost claim credits in the definition of risk equalisation credits which the insurer is entitled to have paid on behalf of an insured person. This section also proposes to insert new definitions for high-cost claim, high-cost claim credit, high-cost claim quota share and high-cost claims threshold. High-cost claims credits will work by targeting claims costs over a threshold of €50,000 in a rolling 12-month period and compensating the insurer for 40% of the claims cost over this threshold. Currently, health insurers receive no subsidy for these claims. The hospital utilisation credit is the only credit paid related to the health status of customers and is paid when an insured person accesses hospital services. The high-cost claims credit will increase by 25% of the amount of the fund paid directly for health service usage. High-cost claims arise in the Irish health insurance market where an insured person is extremely ill and attends hospital for an extended period and are closely linked to chronic conditions such as cancer. Health insurers must pay claims costs where they are medically necessary and are covered by the insured person’s contract. This new type of credit intends to target subsidies towards the claims costs of sicker customers. This will support the objective of community rating.
Section 3 amends section 7E of the principal Act. It provides that the Minister may require the Health Insurance Authority to furnish a report relating to the high-cost claims credit parameters. The Health Insurance Authority will include the level of high-cost claims credits that should be paid out of the fund, and the basis on which they will be paid, in its annual report and recommendations to the Minister.
Section 4 amends section 7F of the principal Act to provide for a new benchmark of reasonable profit and for transitional arrangements for how it is to be applied for the three-year periods 2020-22, and 2021-23. The benchmark of reasonable profit is used to assess whether an insurer has been overcompensated by the risk equalisation scheme. This is currently set at 4.4% return on sales, gross of reinsurance and excluding investment income. This was agreed with the European Commission under state aid rules in 2015. This section amends the 4.4% return on sales to 6% on the same basis. This was based on the recommendation of a new benchmarking exercise among European and Irish insurers.
Section 5 amends section 11C of the principal Act to provide for a new effective date for revised age-related credits payable from the risk equalisation fund. This section also introduces a time limit on all risk equalisation credits that can be claimed from the risk equalisation fund. There is currently no time limit or cut-off period in the Act restricting how long a health insurer may have to make a claim to the fund. Introducing a cut-off for claims on the fund is expected to have benefits from a data management, administrative and financial reporting perspective for the Health Insurance Authority. There will be a transitional period where health insurers will have an opportunity to submit any claims, which are backdated before this new time limit is introduced.
Section 6 replaces table 2 in Schedule 4 to the principal Act. This table provides for age-related credits, which are payable for insured people over the age of 65. These new credits would be payable from 1 April 2022. This year, the Health Insurance Authority has recommended a marginal decrease in the age-related risk equalisation credits to facilitate the introduction of high-cost claims credits. Age-related credits provide a subsidy for insurers who provide cover for that cohort. These credits cover the expected extra claims costs for insured older people.
Section 7 amends the principal Act by the addition of Schedule 5 which provides the parameters for high cost claims. These are the high-cost claims threshold which will be set at €50,000 and the high-cost claims quota share, which will be set at 40%. Section 8 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.This will specify the stamp duty rates that will apply for 2022. As I outlined earlier, the scheme is Exchequer neutral. It is not funded by the State and the State does not derive any funds from it. The amount of stamp duty levy is calculated to offset the costs associated with the payment of risk equalisation credits. Any surpluses or deficits that arise under the scheme are rolled over and included in the recommendation for the following year. Covid-19 has had a major impact on the private health insurance market in Ireland, as it has on the entire public and private health sectors. The pandemic has restricted utilisation of hospital services, which has impacted claims activity, thereby causing fewer risk equalisation credits to be paid out. That has caused a surplus to arise in the fund. This section provides for a reduction in the stamp duty levy applicable to health insurance contracts from 1 April 2022, which incorporates a surplus of €100 million that had gathered in the fund. The amount of stamp duty payable varies, depending on whether a contract is advanced or non-advanced. The difference between the two is how much private hospital coverage the contract offers, with non-advanced contracts providing for mostly public hospital cover. The stamp duty on advanced health insurance contracts will be €406, a decrease of €43 from 2021 rates. For non-advanced health insurance contracts, the stamp duty will be €122, which is a decrease of €35 from 2021 rates. It is hoped these reductions can benefit customers by way of a reduced premium charged by insurers next year. Section 9 provides for the Short Title, commencement, collective citation and construction of the Bill. The provisions in the Bill relating to the introduction of high-cost claims credits and the amendment of the benchmark for reasonable profit are subject to approval by the European Commission under state aid rules. The commencement of these provisions will be done by ministerial order. To summarise, this Bill allows us to maintain the community-rated health insurance market. Its provisions will increase the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme, which is a fundamental support to the market. I conclude by highlighting the Government's commitment to improving public health services under the Sláintecare programme. As access to these services improves, the proportion of people who hold health insurance may decrease over time. Importantly, the programme for Government commits to retaining access to private healthcare services for people in Ireland, thereby ensuring choice for those accessing healthcare. While such a high proportion of people hold health insurance across Ireland, it makes sense to maintain the community-rated health insurance market. I commend the Bill to the House.

Sinn Féin will support this Bill, as we always do. It is an annual Bill to renew the risk equalisation mechanism that supports the community-rated health insurance market. The Bill revises the stamp duty levy on policies and the risk equalisation credits payable to insurers for 2022. It is a self-funded system. The Bill also provides this year for high-cost claims credits, which will provide an additional layer to smooth the costs of credit allocation by directly subsidising very high-cost outliers, subject to European Commission approval. Risk equalisation ensures costs are constant across the lifespan of the individual. It seeks to ensure, where possible, that age, gender and health status do not influence the cost of an insurance product. Recognising the reliance of many people on health insurance, we will support the Bill, as we have done in previous years. I take this opportunity to reiterate our critique of the current insurance market and the two-tier healthcare system in this State. The Minister of State restated in her opening remarks the Government's commitment to the implementation of Sláintecare and the commitments contained within it. The people who resigned their positions and walked away from the implementation of the programme would disagree that the level of urgency and commitment that should have been given has, in fact, been given. I do not doubt at all that additional funding was made available in last year's healthcare budget, but it followed a decade of underinvestment. Moreover, as we know, most of that money was not spent and was rolled over to this year. Even still, many of the staff and beds that were promised were not delivered and potentially will not be delivered. A total of 45% of people in this State rely on the health insurance market, not because they want to take out private insurance but because they feel they have no choice in the matter. How can we blame then when we look at the waiting lists in the public system? There are 900,000 people on some form of health waiting lists, despite all the promises we had from the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and his predecessors that we would see waiting list strategies. In fact, the head of the Sláintecare implementation body, who has resigned her position, is on the public record as saying there was a waiting list strategy already there and ready to go but it simply was not published and advanced by the Minister. Why is that? All we are seeing is waiting lists going in the wrong direction. It is bad enough that 900,000 people are on some form of public health waiting list but 200,000 of those patients, many of them children, are waiting more than 18 months. That is the reality for many people. I do not have time to go into all the promises made as part of the delivery of Sláintecare. Commitments were given to enhance community care, which would involve more investment in community and primary care and ensuring people are treated, as far as possible, in their own home in the first instance and, for people with chronic pain and cardiac and respiratory illnesses, that their care would be managed in the community. This is not possible for many people because the community infrastructure simply is not there. Anyone to whom I have spoken who knows what he or she is talking about when it comes to healthcare says the HSE simply does not understand the community sector. It has outsourced huge amounts of public money, as we know, to section 38 and section 39 organisations and, indeed, to a large number of private organisations, when it comes to the delivery of home help and home care packages. That is the reality of what is happening. One of the representatives of HIQA who came before the Oireachtas health committee a number of months ago when we were discussing the private nursing home sector and the subsidies the State pays for the sector, said: "The HSE does not understand the private sector that it spends so much of taxpayers' money on." I would say the executive also does not understand the community sector. I have put in parliamentary questions, as other Deputies do all the time, trying to establish where all the money goes, how many community beds are funded and how many staff there are in all these organisations and across all the different layers of community care. We get different responses or, on some occasions, no response because the data are not available. That is crazy when one considers the billions of euro of taxpayers' money that goes into community care. Much of that care is not driven by the HSE and is not publicly owned, managed and controlled. We then have all the issues that flow from that, with section 38 and section 39 organisations paying wages below HSE rates and not being able to attract staff at the same level as the HSE does because of the terms and conditions of employment they offer. We know there is a need to overhaul this sector. Community care is an area in which there has not been investment and where the step change that was needed, which Sláintecare promised, has not been delivered. The two major areas in which very little progress has been made and that are relevant to this Bill are, first, removing healthcare from public hospitals and, second, expanding universal GP access and free GP care. On removing healthcare from public hospitals, we had the Sláintecare report in the first instance, which set out a strategy for how that would be delivered. It was followed up by the de Buitléir report, which again set out a clear strategy for delivering this objective in terms of public-only consulting contracts and grandfathering out those consultants who remain on the types A and B contracts, with some form of enticement, if possible, for the latter to move onto the public-only contracts. Very few advances were made in this regard. Despite there being the Sláintecare report and the de Buitléir report, we still have not made any inroads in this area at all. That will continue to be the case until the political will is there to do it. The lack of action is driving much of the private sector activity in healthcare, which is embedded in our public hospitals. We need, once and for all, not just to agree but to deliver on the commitment to disentangle private healthcare from public hospitals.The cost of that, according to the de Buitléir report, was €700 million. Juxtapose that with the €200 million private sector funding that was made available as part of the winter plan, the access to care fund. That is in addition to what has already been paid in respect of the National Treatment Purchase Fund. That is an additional €200 million, the vast majority which will go into the private sector and into private hospitals. Yet, the cost of removing private healthcare from public hospitals would be €700 million. In the general scheme of healthcare funding, that is not a huge cost. It strikes me that cost is not the problem here but it is the political will to make it happen. It is not happening. It was a big promise that was made but it simply is not being implemented. The expansion of free GP care will be important if we want to ensure people come off private health insurance and that we wean the State away from subsidising private healthcare through the National Treatment Purchase Fund and all of the short-term measures the Government comes up with at the last minute as we go into winter to give a veneer that it is doing something to deal with waiting lists and the crisis in hospitals. All it is doing is outsourcing more funding and giving more funding to the private sector. We need to grapple and deal with those two big issues that I have outlined. Look at what happened in budget 2022 in relation to expanding free GP care. It was meant to be done by 2023, as I understand it. We are nowhere near that. What was funded in the budget was for seven- to eight-year-olds, I think, to receive universal GP access. That is still being negotiated. There are still ongoing talks with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO. Even though it was funded, it still has not been implemented. In fact, many people who are medical card holders have problems getting access to some services already. Bloods, for example, is one of these services. There are huge challenges in that area. Despite the commitment to move to universal GP access for everybody within a five-year period of Sláintecare being committed to and delivered, it has not happened. I am afraid that when the Minister of State and the Government give themselves a pat on the back for what they have done in healthcare reform, they only have to look at the people who are tasked with responsibility for doing that. The chair of the Sláintecare implementation advisory council, SIAC, walked away. The person who was the lead in the HSE for delivering Sláintecare walked away. The vast majority of people, or many of them, on the advisory committee walked away. That is being restructured. The Minister has given responsibility to the Secretary General in the Department and the head of the HSE. However, there has been no sense of urgency from those two individuals in regard to those two big issues. As long as that continues, we are going to be back here every year. Yes, this is technical legislation but I am not prepared to continue to support a two-tier system, which is broken and which does not work for the vast majority of patients. I want to see urgent delivery on the commitments that all parties signed up to in Sláintecare. It strikes me that some people and some political parties who signed up to Sláintecare did not believe in the principle of it. If they did, they would have moved much quicker.

It is an issue that is dealt with every year around this time, in a similar Bill to provide for risk equalisation. Risk equalisation is a mechanism designed to give effect to the objective of a community-rated health insurance market, where customers pay the same premium for the same health insurance plan, regardless of age, gender or health status. The Health Insurance Act has provided for a risk equalisation scheme for the market since January 2013. Under the scheme, insurers receive risk equalisation credits to compensate for the additional cost of insuring less-healthy or older members. This year’s scheme will differ from the current one by introducing high-cost claims credits. Treating these claims separately will mean that the risk equalisation subsidy provided to insurers will be more accurate and effective by removing distortive high-cost claims. As a result of lower claims activity due to Covid-19 a surplus of around €100 million has built up in the risk equalisation fund. The Health Insurance Authority has recommended the return of this €100 million to consumers by way of a reduction in stamp duty for contracts commencing or renewing in the period of 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023. This is likely to be a once-off reduction because of Covid-19 imposed restrictions on access to public and private hospitals, which resulted in lower credits being paid out of the fund. Some 45% of the population is covered by private health insurance and pays out more than €2.5 billion in premiums. For many workers and families, health insurance is a necessary evil. They make great sacrifices to pay for it, hoping that they will never have to use it. The only reason they pay is that our health system is so bad and they fear the long waiting lists in public hospitals. There are hundreds of thousands of people languishing on long waiting lists and this Government has no credible plan to address this. We need to fix the imbalance in healthcare to remove private healthcare from our public hospitals and our public healthcare system. It is time we moved away from a two-tier health system. There are many people falling through the cracks, who earn too much to qualify for a medical card, or too little to afford health insurance. This is wrong. Ability to pay should have no bearing on how we are treated in the healthcare system. People are languishing on waiting lists and are getting sicker, while those with health insurance are fast-tracked to the front of the queue. In some cases, they are treated by the same doctors and, in some cases, the same hospitals. For those who have to wait, their mental health is suffering and in some cases their life expectancy will be lowered. The Minister of State is aware that we have discussed our elderly many times. This is not good enough and health insurance exploits a failed public health system. It is a public health system that is being killed off by successive Governments to favour a private health system. As with the commodification of housing, the commodification of our health service is hurting those who need it most, like our elderly and like those on low income, in other words, the working poor. I spoke to a lady last week who has been waiting for more than three years for a tonsillectomy appointment for her child. She was initially told that the wait would be 18 months. If the family had health insurance, it could be done within a week. Instead, the child endures the pain of recurring sore throats - six in the last year. Children are suffering and it is a disgrace. Sinn Féin in government will deliver an all-Ireland health system that is free at the point of delivery and one that is based on need and not on income.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	233	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to make a brief contribution this afternoon. The Minister of State said the programme for Government commits to retaining access to private healthcare services for people in Ireland and ensuring choice for those accessing healthcare and that while such a high proportion of people hold health insurance across Ireland, it makes sense to maintain a community-rated health insurance market. It would make more sense to have targeted investment and specific planning in our public health service. That makes real sense. An all-island health service would also make sense. Of course, for the moment and for as long as those who are intent on strangling the health service have control over it, there will always be a growing market for private health insurance. Governments such as the one in power at the moment will always lead the charge and act as a great advertisement and a great recruiter for the private health insurance market. Just so the Minister of State is aware, people do not get private health insurance because they want to skip the queue, get one-up on their neighbours or, in many cases, because they can afford it. Many people cannot afford it and they go without, just to have private health insurance. I do not have private health insurance. I am lucky that I have never needed it, touch wood. I would not get it as I do not support it. I live by that but I know many people who have it. They do not favour private health insurance, but they do not want to find themselves on one of the Minister of State’s waiting lists. They do not want to find themselves having to wait years in pain simply to see a doctor. They find the money somewhere to ensure they can pay for private health insurance. The Minister of State acknowledged that we have a high level of private health insurance in this State. I do not think we have a high level, or a disproportionately high level, of people who favour private health insurance. They simply favour being able to see a doctor when they need to see a doctor. They cannot do that in the public health system very often. The Minister of State knows all of the reasons. Just because the Minister of State does not fix it does not mean she is not aware of what has caused it. She knows the reasons our health service has the waiting lists that it has. She does not deny it - in fact, she was nearly celebrating it there in her statement. In any event, we have this debate every year because we have to have it. It is a necessary debate and I fully appreciate that.However, it would be preferable to hear a credible plan from the Minister proposing the legislation to ensure such a massive incentive for private health insurance is not stacked into our public health system. We live in hope. While I have the floor I will raise an issue that affects a very small number of people. I ask the Minister of State to look at this or get someone in her Department to do so. It relates to restricted membership undertakings, RMUs, that is, where a person is a member of a scheme by virtue of the fact that they are married to someone in a particular type of employment, such as the Garda. I am not specifically referring to the Garda medical aid but that is one example. If someone is married to a member of An Garda Síochána they are covered under their spouse's scheme. The scheme was devised when we did not have divorce but if such a couple got divorced then clearly that person would not be covered by the scheme anymore as they would not be a spouse. However, there is no obligation in the legislation for them to be told of this. There is no obligation in law for the spouse who is being divorced from the serving member to be told and that can create problems because of the way the insurance market is structured. That person, through no fault of their own because they might not know their former spouse discontinued their membership of the health insurance scheme, can find themselves on the outside of the health insurance market, and it is harder for people to get private health insurance in their mid to late 50s. In the case that was brought to my attention, the person involved only found out by accident that they did not have private health insurance. It is a very small and niche thing but it is something that could be addressed. I asked a parliamentary question about this matter and the response stated:In the case where a person ceases to be a dependant of a member, for example where they cease to be married to the member of the medical society or where their spouse ceases to qualify as a member, an RMU is not obligated to continue to provide insurance cover to that person.That is fine but they are also not obligated to tell these people. I am not saying there are large numbers involved here but a small fix would be in order. I am using the opportunity this afternoon to bring this matter to the Minister of State's attention. I am happy to discuss it with her afterwards but she might get someone to have a look at it. It is a small thing but since it has happened once there is a small chance that it could happen again and it would be appropriate to have a look at that. I thank the Minister of State for her attention on the matter.
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	234	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak. Annually, we have a debate about the health insurance Bill wherein we establish the regulations and legislation around the private health insurance sector. It is a difficult thing for those of us who have fundamental issues with how the Irish health sector is set up at the moment, and how it has been set up for many years. In the past two years the deep problems of our healthcare system have been clearly exposed for all to see. As a State, we operate a two-tier health service and we attempt to operate these systems in tandem while not having enough capacity within our service to meet the basic public need. That is underlined by massive issues in recruitment and retention. Essentially, our health system is failing to cope with the basic needs of the State and has been for many years. This has led 2.2 million Irish residents to have private health insurance. That is 45% of the population. In the UK, the figure is 13%. While the NHS is not perfect - far from it - it is one of the great achievements of public health in Britain that the vast majority of its population do not pay for for-profit health insurance, because they believe in their health service. They strive for their health service to be better and they are invested in it. It is not just about comparisons with the UK. According to the WHO, Ireland is "unique among EU countries in not providing universal coverage of primary care." It states:Its system of entitlement to publicly financed health care is also complex ... gaps in coverage in Ireland already create significant financial barriers to access, particularly for people who do not have medical cards or [private health insurance], resulting not only in unmet need but also in inequitable and inefficient patterns of use ... these barriers are often substantial relative to most other EU countries, especially for primary care.That is absolutely damning of our health system and we know it. We see the outworkings of it every day in our advice clinics, in our communities and in our families and we discuss the outcomes in various debates in this Chamber. Much of it boils down to the complexities of the two-tier system and trying to unravel that. Believing that Sláintecare is the answer to that is slightly misleading. Sláintecare, if delivered in its entirety or nearly in its entirety, would not replace private health insurance. It would create what will hopefully be an attractive alternative to private health insurance, namely, a public health system in which people have so much confidence and that has such ease of access in terms of cost across many different aspects of healthcare that we feel we do not need private health insurance. That is a huge offer of faith in terms of a health policy. Most people are behind Sláintecare, or say they are, but even if it is delivered we will still have a private health insurance market in this country. It will still be actively touting for business from Irish residents and will be coming from a position of huge advantage because of where it is at the moment, the facilities and resources it has and because it is unconstrained by having to provide pure holistic public health policy. It is a huge ask just for Sláintecare to be delivered and then we have this offer of faith that if it is delivered it will be so attractive and function so well that the private health insurance market will be diminished to an extent similar to the UK, where it only covers 13% of the population. That feels light years away in the Irish context. We need to have some hard conversations about what Sláintecare can and cannot achieve. I do not have faith that Sláintecare will achieve what we need it to when it comes to our reliance on private health insurance. A reliance on private health insurance is what the State has at the moment. That is something we need to move away from. Looking at news articles on private health insurance, two consistent trends are clear. You will see the price of health insurance going up and the profits of health insurance companies going up. What you will not see is waiting lists in the public health system coming down or costs for health insurance coming down. Inequality is widening. Due to the way we have it currently set up this House is hamstrung. No matter what your ideological bent, because of where we are right now this Bill will have to pass. However, we will be back here again next year having a very similar debate. Even if great strides are made and we catch up on the delays and make strides where we need to, Sláintecare is not going to fundamentally solve the problem of our two-tier health system and the hold private health insurance companies and private health providers have. We need to get real in that debate. We are where we are with it now. It is another example of a deeply flawed structure within our health system. As I said, we see its outworkings across many areas. We have a huge recruitment and retention problem. Part of that is due to the fact that private healthcare providers can provide better pay and conditions for staff who are then taken from the public health system. Consultants are working in both private and public healthcare and so the same person on the same list could be offered the same consultation 18 months or two years down the line or they could have it in a week or two with the same person, sometimes in the same room. That is just immoral and that has to change. Turning to our GPs and the pressure they are under, our primary care sector has performed Herculean tasks over the past 20 months, but Covid has laid bare just how stretched the sector is. Real investment in public and primary care will have to come hand in hand with an approach to private health insurance that removes the guilt factor for people who feel that they need to have insurance. It is fantastic if people who are on their own do not want to get private health insurance and decide to take their chances, but if their circumstances change - they get married and have families or other dependants - the pressure on many to stretch their household budgets to include private health insurance tips hard-working people who are just trying to get by onto the edge of the poverty line. This is because they do not have the primary care access that they need and the certainty such access brings. Every Deputy knows and understands that but not everyone is providing the solutions to change it.

He had noted that the premium for 2022 compared with the premium for 2021 had reduced but the credit for the risk equalisation had also reduced, resulting in little change in the overall cost of his premium. He was wondering about the risk equalisation piece. I am in a much better position today to tell him, having read through the research, briefing notes and some other bits and pieces. Notwithstanding everything that has been said because this is, to use a term that has been used this week, part of the peculiarity of the Irish health system, I was amazed that this couple in their 70s were paying almost €3,000 between them for their health insurance for the year. That is unacceptable in this day and age. Like every other Deputy present, I strongly support Sláintecare and yearn for the day when there is universal free healthcare, universal access to healthcare on an equal basis and good and decent healthcare. I do not just mean universal access, but universally timely access to every sort of procedure, every sort of consultant and every sort of care that is necessary for individuals. I am also mindful, though, of the great Republican Party slogan during an election a number of years ago when the Democrats were putting forward the virtues of Medicare and Medicaid, an issue that arises consistently in the USA. The Republicans had a scary slogan: "If you think health care is expensive now, just wait until you see what it costs when it's free". Something that strikes me, and that was mentioned by another Deputy, is that we will always have people who can access private healthcare. Even if we had the resources in the morning to produce a universal healthcare system, there would probably be a splurge in the development of even more private hospitals, including private specialist hospitals. There would then be an even more striking elite with access to that kind of healthcare. However, there is no aspect of Sláintecare that is not virtuous. I was lucky enough to go to and graduate from college. When I got my first job, my parents' advice was to take out a pension and private health insurance. It was part of the DNA. I never thought I was gaining superiority over anyone else. I just assumed it was something that everyone did and to which everyone had access. It was a seamless decision in a world that probably was not characterised by as many inequalities and inequities in terms of accessing the health system. The purpose of the legislation and the reason for the risk equalisation fund being revisited every year have been well rehearsed by other Deputies. It is a good. Whatever about having private healthcare, imagine if we had a system of private healthcare like the system in the US, which is unbridled and unfettered and where no account is taken of someone's age. In fact, the older one gets and the more likely one is to get sick, the larger the payments one must make and health insurance moves out of ordinary people's reach. I am not giving bouquets to our system. Far from it. I believe in an equal system and it is what we all strive for. I certainly strive for it. For example, and to go slightly off topic briefly, the National Treatment Purchase Fund could be used to provide access to psychological services that are otherwise not available. As a society, we could examine this matter. I recently had a case of a child who waited four years for an assessment and, after getting that assessment, must now wait another four years for treatment. The child will have gone through every developmental phase by then. It will be over developmentally for that child. We understand that the reason for the risk equalisation fund is to ensure that people who are in their advancing years and who are more likely, although not always, to become more ill, develop ailments or require hospital admission or specialist care do not pay any more than younger cohorts who are regarded as being stereotypically fit and health. I wish to make two points on this. I enjoyed reading the Health Insurance Authority's paper on this matter. It was well explained, provided good background information and was detailed, but the authority only had 20 respondents to its public consultation. That is risible. The Health Insurance Authority ought to be more robust in its public consultation. It could request that all private health insurance providers include a consultation piece in correspondence to all their members, including a feedback form and the authority's questions. The questions that the authority asked were legitimate and explained to many people the need for risk equalisation, but when one thinks of the millions of people in Ireland who have their health insured privately, that there were only 20 responses to the consultation indicates there was something lacking. We need to do something about it. The Minister of State will be aghast to know that there are more than 380 different health plans. The bulk of them are held by Irish Life. Next is Laya, with VHI holding the fewest plans. Regularly, Claire Byrne and Pat Kenny do the State some service when they have a specialist on who tries to navigate the public's way through the myriad of plans. How can anyone reasonably hope to get value for money in a health insurance plan? I am confident that there are thousands of people who, if they had a helping hand in buying their private health insurance, would save a great deal of money. We could do the State some service, to use that phrase a second time, if we asked the health insurance companies whether they really needed so many plans. I believe Irish Life has 180. Why does a health insurance company need 180 different plans?
#RuairiOmurchu	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-party	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-dob	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	236	We are all dealing with a situation where a large number of people engage private health insurance. It amounts to 45% of people in the State. On some level, this Bill, which is a process that we go through every year, is an element of accepting the failure of our system, in that we do not have the public health system that people deserve and require. We all accept the necessity of this legislation and that, through risk equalisation, we insert an element of fairness into a system that is unfair across the board. There has already been much comment on the need to deliver a national health service and the promises of Sláintecare.That is what Deputy Lahart and others said when they talked about universal, timely access. That is what is required within a system that works. If people had some faith in Sláintecare, it has been rattled by the fact that some of those involved in shaping its delivery have walked away from it. That emphasises the point that we must be serious about this. We need to put a coherent plan in place and deliver upon it. Deputy Cullinane spoke about some of the other gaps we have in the system. We do not have an adequate primary care system which gives rise to a hospital-centric system. That has created particular difficulties during the pandemic, whereby people who could have their care delivered in the community in primary care and other settings are not getting the care they require, which means more people go through the logjam that is the hospital system. That is before we get into private healthcare being operated in public hospitals. In the short time remaining, I will deal with waiting lists. We could talk about the numbers in hundreds of thousands. When my youngest child had an issue with glue ear, he required two operations to release it. I heard an interview with a lady whose son had been on a waiting list for 18 months, or possibly even longer, and she spoke about the damage done to his ear during the period. There was a lifelong impact on his learning. That is the cost of the system we have. We must put in place a public healthcare system that delivers for people. It is not beyond the Government to do that.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	237	Insofar as the purpose of the Bill is to get the approval of the House to establish the risk equalisation mechanism in order to support community-rated health insurance, and the decision must be taken on an annual basis, I have no difficulty with it. I recognise it for what it is. In the context of a private health insurance market, it is better that there is risk equalisation, lifetime community rating and so on, in order that people who have certain illnesses or are of a particular age that would make them more likely to develop illness are not penalised. The principles underpinning that are good. They were agreed many years ago, in 2013. In the context of the private health insurance market, risk equalisation improves it and makes it fairer and better. From that point of view I do not have a difficulty with the Bill, nor do I have a difficulty with the additional provision in this year's Bill, which specifies the amount of risk equalisation along with a high-cost claims credit to enhance the risk equalisation. This credit will assist people of different ages and those who are unlucky enough to have serious illnesses and end up in hospital receiving very expensive treatment and staying for long periods of time. The original risk equalisation was to provide something of a level playing pitch among different insurers and ensure the VHI in particular, which had a greater proportion of older members, would not be disadvantaged relative to other newcomers to the market. Just as risk equalisation was agreed, it is also important that there is equalisation to address a situation where an insurer has a disproportionate number of people with serious illnesses and therefore much higher claims. That is a positive development in this year's proposal. Insofar as it goes, I agree with that in the context of the private health insurance market. I made the point on the previous occasion we dealt with such a Bill that we are having the wrong conversation. The conversation should be about how we run and fund the health service. At the moment, for many historical reasons, including undue influence of business and significant vested interest within the health service, we have a two-tier health service. It is a totally dysfunctional health service that achieves neither the best health outcomes nor the best value for money. That does not make any sense. We have never had a properly functioning public health service, going back to the establishment of the State. In the 1950s, there was the mother and child scheme and all that flowed from that in terms of the political opposition to it. That is sometimes underrated. We hear a lot about the religious objections to the mother and child scheme, but the objections from the medical profession were just as strong, if not stronger, and they were supported and, let us say, indulged by the political system at the time. It is incredible that we still have not achieved proper, free public healthcare for mothers and children. It is outrageous. We are a complete outlier when it comes to the rest of the Europe. We are the only European country that does not have a single-tier universal healthcare system. We are also the only country in Europe where a large majority of the population must fork out the full fee to see a GP. That is just unheard of anywhere else. In most European countries, primary care is free at the point of access. There are other countries where there is a nominal or small charge to see a GP, but we are the only country where large numbers of people must fork out €60 when they want to see a GP. That makes no sense at all. We should be encouraging people to get early access to healthcare so that when they have an ailment they get it seen to and treated at an early stage, rather than having a situation where an awful lot of people simply cannot afford to visit a GP because the cost takes too much out of their family budget. As a result, people leave conditions to fester and get worse and often end up having to go to accident and emergency units or being admitted to hospital for much more serious treatment. Early diagnosis and intervention are key in healthcare. For this reason, rather than being scared of people visiting their GP too much, we should be encouraging them to avail of primary healthcare at an early stage to ensure there is early intervention, which is very important, and they are enabled to return to full health as quickly as possible and make a full contribution to society. That is not the attitude that is taken. The very fact that nearly half of the population feel they have no choice but to take out private health insurance is damning of the State and successive Governments. Ireland, alone in the European context, has utterly failed to introduce a modern, universal public healthcare system. It is an absolute tenet of any modern democracy that there is a properly functioning public health service. We have utterly failed to provide that since the State was founded. We are told that this legislation is about achieving equity and equity of access to private health insurance. I accept that is what it does, but the other issue of equity - equity of access to healthcare - is much more important. Private health insurance enables people to buy access. That means skipping the queue and going ahead of other people. We must consider why people do that. The reason is that it enables them to get early access to healthcare. We all want that. We have such a dysfunctional system. People on very low fixed incomes, who cannot afford private health insurance, will sacrifice many other things to be able to pay a health insurance premium.It is such an appalling reflection on the state of our health system that people have to scrimp and save and make all kinds of sacrifices in order to achieve the kind of assurance that when they need healthcare, they will get it. We should not be putting people in that situation. Others have spoken about other countries where, even with a properly functioning public national health service, people still take out private health insurance. Yes, they do and that is fine and they are welcome to do that, but the state is not promoting that, nor is the state subsidising it - that is the whole thing. In the UK, there is the NHS and it was originally very good, although starved of funding over recent decades, undoubtedly. However, even in that situation, almost 90% of people in the UK are more than happy to use the NHS. These include people on good incomes, high incomes and all of that and they are perfectly happy to use it because it is accessible, they can get seen to quickly and they are happy with the standard of the service. People talk about the NHS and the fact there are waiting lists and all of that, but it is a measure that the vast majority of people in the UK are happy to use it. They give out about delays and so on, but they are happy to use it. That is not the case in Ireland. As I said, almost half of the population feel they have no choice because the public system is so unreliable. A Deputy spoke of a couple spending €3,000 on private health insurance and that is probably at the lower end of the scale. However, even where people fork out a number of thousand euro per year for private health insurance, and for the kind of peace of mind that gives them, it is still very bad value for money. They still have to pay to see a GP, they still have to pay to see a consultant, they have to pay to see a physiotherapist and they have to pay through the nose for diagnostic tests because these things, in the main, are not covered. It is about getting into hospital; it is about skipping the queue and getting early treatment in hospital. It is bad value all round but it also creates that dysfunction within our two-tier system. There are all kinds of perverse incentives within our two-tier system so there is a huge pull factor for people to buy private health insurance and there is also a huge pull factor for staff to work in the private sector. The bottom line in all of this is that the better the public healthcare system is, the less profit there is to be made in the private sector. Equally, one would say that the worse the public healthcare system is, the more money there is to be made in the private healthcare system. There is never money made out of people being well. There is money made out of people being sick. If the public healthcare system does not work properly, as ours does not, if it does not meet the needs of the people, then it provides that huge incentive for the private sector to profiteer from the provision of healthcare. That has been aided, abetted and facilitated by successive Governments down through the years. There are moral questions about that. It is a fundamental failing of government that the Government is incapable of providing a public healthcare system where equity of access to healthcare is guaranteed. Access to healthcare is fundamental to our existence for all of us. That was where Sláintecare came in. It was to achieve the kind of universal public healthcare system that, as I said, every other country in Europe has. There was cross-party agreement on that. Regrettably, the progress on implementing it has been desperately slow. Successive Ministers have been happy to wrap the Sláintecare flag around them and talk the talk of Sláintecare, but not actually deliver the fundamental reforms that are contained in it. Unfortunately, earlier this year, we had the very high-profile resignations of two key people who were charged with leading out the Sláintecare programme. Again, that is absolutely damning of this Government and the last Government and their failure to give political commitment to the implementation of the universal public healthcare system. We are told that those two people have been replaced by the Secretary General of the Department and the chief executive of the HSE. It is a very disappointing move because if the Department of Health and the HSE were capable of reform, they would have done it long ago. They are not capable of reform. There is institutional resistance to reform. The idea of putting the two senior people there in charge of the roll-out of Sláintecare is laughable in many ways. We need political courage and we need political commitment to the principle of equity of access to basic healthcare. That is what has been lacking, that is what we need to see the Minister doing and we need the full Government behind that. Implementing fundamental radical reform of the health service is something on which we must have cross-government support. The Taoiseach has been running away from this, as have the Ministers. It is the responsibility of the entire Government to deliver on Sláintecare. This Government will be judged on its failure or otherwise in respect of that, rightly so. It is also important to acknowledge the principles that were identified in terms of the emergency response over the last two years to the dire situation we face in the context of the pandemic. At an early stage, it was recognised that we have to treat everybody the same on this. Because there was a complete lack of capacity within the hospital system, the private hospital system was brought in and created that additional capacity in terms of hospital beds generally, of staff, of ICU beds and of high dependency unit, HDU, beds in particular. We could not have survived without that. However, in terms of accessing those, there was a very important principle, which was that access would be on the basis of health need. To a large extent, that is how the country has survived the full impact of the pandemic because the healthcare system became a single-tier system, so access to healthcare was on the basis of need, not ability to pay. Imagine that through the big waves of Covid, and we are currently on the fourth wave, we were saying to people they could only get treatment for Covid if they could afford to pay. It would be totally intolerable. Imagine if we said to people they could only get access to vaccines if they were prepared to pay and if they were not able to pay and could not afford it, tough luck, they go to the back of the queue, they do not get the vaccines and they do not get the protection. That is exactly what we are saying to people who need other life-saving care. We are saying it is available to them if they can afford to pay, but tough luck if they cannot because they go on a long waiting list. We have to realise that this is such a basic thing for people and that the Government has such a responsibility in regard to ensuring proper access. There are a couple of further points that need to be made. The first is in regard to the understanding about Sláintecare. Some people think they will not be allowed to have private health insurance under Sláintecare. That was never the case. If people want to buy private health insurance, they are free to go and do it. However, the whole approach in Sláintecare was that we would develop a high quality, universal healthcare system so people did not feel they had to take out private health insurance, irrespective of whether they could afford it or not, and I have used the example of the NHS. We know, of course, that the Exchequer directly subsidises private health insurance to the tune of €377 million. However, that is only the topline figure that we are aware of and in a whole lot of other areas where tax relief is allowed for healthcare, the figures are not even collected by Revenue in such a way that they can be reported.There is a huge element of hidden cross-subsidisation by the public purse of the private system, which again is bad value. The other thing provided for in this Bill that I cannot understand is in section 4. The Bill proposes to increase what is referred to as the benchmark of reasonable profit from 4.4% to 6%. I do not know what the justification for that is. Health insurance companies are profitable and we know that when people get their annual notice to tell them what their premium is, many do not just accept that. Rather, they pick up the phone and tell their health insurer they have received a better quote and ask if it can do something about that. Within seconds the company agrees to drop the premium by 5% or 10%. We should encourage everybody to do that when renewing their insurance and people get that immediate reaction if they ring up, say they got a better quote and threaten to leave. If companies can drop their premiums in an instant then why are we saying their reasonable profit levels should go up? I ask the Minister of State to explain that. We know the health insurance sector was worth €2.64 billion last year so it is a massive market. Some 47% of people in Ireland are paying for expensive private health insurance. What does that contribute to the overall health spend in the country? It is an amazing figure. It only contributes 13% to the overall health spend in the country. The public purse, which is funded from people’s taxes, funds the health service to the tune of 69%. There is massive cross-subsidisation from the public purse to the private sector. That figure tells it all and it is quite startling. We need to start making progress on this. What we have done on Sláintecare so far is not good enough; the public deserves better.

It is the only element of equality that is brought to the private health insurance market. The fact that this must be done shows how it divides ready access to healthcare in favour of those who can afford to pay the costs associated with private health insurance. According to the Health Insurance Authority, the average price being paid by policyholders on 1 January 2021 across all levels of products was €1,440. It is a massive amount of money that many people simply do not have to spare, especially when the cost of living is rising at such a rate. It is indicative of the inequality within the system that ability to pay for private healthcare determines how quickly you get seen. It is not just me or Sinn Féin saying this. Recent research by the Economic and Social Research Institute found that patients with private health insurance receive both outpatient and inpatient care more quickly than those without insurance. This is the two-tier health system that has long been promoted by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in order to make up for the shambles they have presided over when it comes to resourcing our health service. This is evident in the fact that under the Governments of the same two parties, Sláintecare has been ignored to such an extent that only recently, two top board members stepped down from the programme because of the lack of urgency in its implementation. The Minister of State should ask any of the over 900,000 constituents who are on the waiting lists. Sláintecare called for a maximum wait time of ten weeks for an outpatient appointment and ten days for a diagnostic test. Let us take Tipperary University Hospital as an example. Of the 3,979 people on the outpatient list, 1,799 or just under half have been waiting over six months or 24 weeks. This is why we should be discussing universal healthcare where timely access is not dependent on how much you can afford, or on how much you are prepared to scrape together in order to avoid the lengthy lists. Privatisation seems to be the buzzword of this Government. The Minister of State will be aware of St. Brigid’s Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir. It has been closed by this Government and the public was told that private nursing homes would be relied upon instead. Public community care is on the way out and community inpatient care will be on the chopping block if this Government has anything to do with it. In talking about beds in the community, will the Minister of State tell me if funding is being allocated in the national development plan for refurbishment of the wonderful Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Unit in Roscrea, and if the deadline of 1 January after which long-term stay residents will not be accepted will be extended? While we are talking about private healthcare, why is the Government not talking about providing proper funding to voluntary mental health organisations like CARMHA in Nenagh? It is doing tremendous work for people with addiction and mental health issues but it is facing the prospect of possibly having to close its doors in the new year if it cannot secure funding in the near future. CARMHA is operating on local donations alone, since the funding it received under the Rethink Ireland initiative has run out. It makes a huge contribution to our health system by providing services that are in short supply overall. I have written to the Minister of State asking her to meet CARMHA to discuss the issue and I hope that she will do so. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare of the Thirty-second Dáil recommended ceasing all private care in public hospitals and achieving a model where private insurance would no longer confer faster access to healthcare in the public sector, but would be limited to covering private care in private hospitals. We cannot delay on that any longer.

It is no secret that People Before Profit and I do not believe in a two-tier health system. Even though we have a two-tier health system, I think the vast majority of people in this House do not believe in that system any more. If you look at other countries around the world that have a universal healthcare system, the outcomes are much better. The Minister of State can call me old fashioned or out of date but my party and I are ideologically driven by that and in favour of universal healthcare. That is why we will not vote for this Bill. It compounds the inequalities in our health system. I understand that the Health Insurance Acts have to be renewed every year to bring a sense of solidarity and equality into private healthcare. The inequality in this is that we need to examine the question of why people need to get private healthcare in the first place. Many Deputies have said that half of the population in this country have access to private healthcare and you would have to question why that is so. If you put the facts on the table it is clear that the vast majority of people believe in public healthcare and they also pay for it. The reason people take out private health insurance is that they believe they will be waiting X amount of months or years for access to public healthcare. That is correct, and Governments have allowed that to happen. Once a parallel system is in place in healthcare or in any area, you will have inequality. That inequality cannot be escaped once that parallel system is in place. Vast amounts of money are spent each year on public funding of private healthcare. This money drifts off and I argue there is no cost or social exchange to that. This is at the heart of a system that has gone wrong. I want to go back to last year when the State took over 19 of the private hospitals in the State. I hope that in the future there would be no such thing as private healthcare, as people having to jump the queue or as people having to seek out private healthcare. There should be one system of healthcare. I do not know if the Minister of State believes in that personally or on a political basis but all evidence shows that where a healthcare system is universal and there are no stages to it the outcomes are much better. The NHS in Britain is revered more than the royal family. It was founded after the Second World War because of what the British working class went through during the six years of that war. If the NHS had not been set up, there would have been a revolution in Britain because working people had enough of suffering and wanted a cradle-to-grave public healthcare system. Many things have changed over the past 18 months. This public health emergency has showed us many things good and bad, but mostly good. Humanity has stepped up to the plate and public medicine has done so as well. Many things have gone wrong that cannot be fixed here, but one of the main effects of the ongoing public health emergency is that people and governments are asking themselves many questions. They are asking what is the right thing to do and what people want most from life and society. Some of those questions emanate from the last general election, which was defined by a number of issues, the main one being public service and our health system in particular. When asked if they want a health service that delivers, regardless of whether patients are on social welfare or millionaires, the vast majority of people in this country will say that they want a health system for all. The qualities of solidarity and equality that are the main thrust of most healthcare systems in Europe place them at the cutting edge. I do not know if Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil can ever change their ideology. I do not think so because they are embedded in the market system of healthcare. On a personal level, the Minister of State might agree with me that there is no basis for a two-tier health system but actions and words must match. We can talk about Sláintecare, which is a good policy, but is it largely aspirational? We will see. We have been talking about a universal health care system for many decades but people will be judged by their actions. Can we deliver for the citizens of this country a system of universal healthcare? I believe fundamentally that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in government cannot do that. Once we have private healthcare in our system, we will always have inequality. That is why we need transformative change in how politics is done in this country.

In this House on 9 November, the Taoiseach suggested, in response to comments from Deputy Tóibín about the reconfiguration of Navan hospital, that the Deputy should visit Roscommon University Hospital to see the expansion in the range of services there. I noticed that the Taoiseach said that when I was not present. He might have taken a different approach had I been present. However, having said that, I want to see if the Taoiseach is prepared to live up to his words and I hope that we can see some progress in relation to services. It is true that elective services have improved in Roscommon hospital but ambulance services have not. We also have the scandal that more services could be made available and more people could be treated in Roscommon University Hospital were it not for the deliberate blockage by the Saolta Hospital Group of the provision of the sterilisation facilities that are so urgently required. I have with me a letter from the then Minister for Health, dated 9 October 2018, regarding the progression of the central sterile services department, CSSD, at Roscommon University Hospital. In fact, a state-of-the-art room in the hospital has been lying idle since 2018 because funding for the equipment has not been provided so that we can fully utilise the two theatres at Roscommon University Hospital. While some parts of the country are struggling in terms of staffing, we actually have the staff to run our theatres but we do not have the sterilisation equipment to ensure that we can maximise the throughput of patients. We have patients from right across the west of Ireland and the middle of this country who are waiting in pain on waiting lists. Some are waiting, sadly, to go to private hospitals, via the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to access treatment that could easily be available at Roscommon University Hospital if the funding was provided for sterilisation facilities. A headline from a local newspaper on 25 October 2018 reads, "New CSSD Unit for hospital confirmed". That was on foot of a commitment I obtained from the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, at the time. The newspaper outlined that agreement had been reached between Roscommon University Hospital, HSE Estates and the Saolta Hospital Group to proceed with the unit. The then local Senator, now Aire Stáit at the Department of Health, Deputy Feighan, said at the time, "Based on my discussions with Minister Harris, I am confident this project brief will be progressed to design stage as quickly as possible next year". He went on to say that he had "repeatedly highlighted the need to put a long-term solution in place". Absolutely nothing has happened since then. A brief was prepared and presented to the steering group on 13 November 2019 and there it has sat since. On 15 September 2020, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, told me in reply to a parliamentary question that further information was currently being collated in order to future-proof the decontamination requirements of the whole Saolta Hospital Group. That had been going on for 12 months at that stage. The Minister went on to tell me that the HSE had advised him that this exercise would be completed by the fourth quarter of 2020. However, I was told in a recent reply that this is exactly where the project stands today. We have been waiting for three years for the naval gazing to finish because the Saolta Hospital Group and HSE Estates are determined not to fit out a state-of-the-art building. I will tell the Minister of State what is in that building today. The Minister for Health visited Roscommon University Hospital recently to see the new endoscopic facilities there. He passed by the door of the CSSD unit. Inside that unit are walking frames, crutches, beds and wheelchairs because it is now being used as a storage facility. This is a facility that could be used to help to provide treatment to people who are waiting in pain. Instead of that, those people will eventually, through the NTPF, access that treatment in private hospitals. It is just not good enough that for the sake of a small amount of capital funding, we cannot fit out a building that is there already. It is very disappointing. As the Minister of State will know, I have tabled an amendment for Committee Stage that we will deal with tomorrow. I am not sure if the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, or one of the other Ministers of State in the Department will be taking Committee Stage. The reason I am questioning the commitment in respect of Roscommon University Hospital is because there is a lack of commitment generally within the health service to our smaller hospitals. The difficulty is that, in the main, consultants do not like travelling. They do not like travelling from the regional centres to the smaller hospitals where there is capacity, where patients can be treated and where we could address some of the monumental backlogs and waiting lists we have. If consultants do not travel, it does not happen. I can give practical examples from what has happened in Roscommon. The Taoiseach is right that the services have increased there and that, thankfully, we have a problem with car parking at the hospital. However, that is because we have had two very progressive consultants who happen to come from County Roscommon, who have dramatically expanded the services there and who provide services that are the envy of any other hospital in the country in the context of urology and plastic surgery. Why is it that we have to rely on our native consultants to provide those services? Why are we not seeing other consultants from within the Saolta Hospital Group providing services? Saolta was the first hospital group established in the country. It had claimed that it was committed to expanding the services and the level 2 hospitals, but that is not happening. Tomorrow we will see the exact same thing happened with my amendment and health insurance. This will be the fourth year in a row that I will raise the specific issue of smaller hospitals not being covered by Irish Life Health. It has specifically discriminated against the smaller hospitals that could help to ease some of the pressure of the bigger hospitals across the country. To be fair to the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, back in 2019, he did give a commitment to look at the matter. However, the current Minister for Health in a recent reply to a parliamentary question told me that he will not be doing that. I was told that Sláintecare is being implemented, that it is about taking the private health insurers out of public hospitals and that we will use smaller hospitals as guinea pigs in that context. If we want to use guinea pigs, surely it should be the major hospitals that we use because you would start with where there is huge pressure on beds and waiting lists. Of course, that would have an impact on the consultants, the same consultants who will not travel to the smaller hospitals, and they do not want to see their income being impacted in the regional centres. That is why the smaller hospitals are not being protected by the Government in the context of the decision taken by Irish Life Health. I will make two final points. I echo the comments of colleagues, particularly Deputy Shortall, on Sláintecare. It is imperative that we do drive forward with the reform relating to Sláintecare. However, that does not mean we should use the small hospitals as guinea pigs for it when clearly we are not - as with the example I gave in the context of Roscommon - prepared to put the capital investment in to deal with it. The Minister of State should not come in and spin this yarn to me that the Government is not putting the thumbscrews on Irish Life Health because we want to use the smaller hospitals to drive forward the Sláintecare reforms. If that was the case, the Government would be putting the capital investment into the smaller hospitals but that is not happening. I want to see Sláintecare come to fruition. We need a single, unified health system. That is why, along with former Deputy Michael Harty, I insisted during the negotiations on the programme for Government in 2016 that there be an all-party committee established to look at this matter and to set down a long-term plan for our health system. That was because I had seen during the previous 15 years I had been in politics that it all depended on the Minister who was behind the desk on a particular day. As soon as that Minister left, the permanent government would revert to form and the new Minister would come in and would have to start the battle again. It was important, therefore, that there was consistency across Government and political parties. It is imperative that, despite the push-back from the permanent government, we see the Parliament, parliamentarians and politicians taking ownership of Sláintecare and driving it through. This legislation will reduce the cost of insurance but this will only happen in April when the bulk of people will have already renewed their health insurance. I actively encourage every single person who gets a renewal of their policy to please shop around because there are significant savings to be made. There are a number of companies out there which specialise in that. I actively encourage people to go to those companies, shop around and make those savings, because that will bring about some of the change that is needed.

We are talking about reducing the amount of money paid to insurers by way of risk equalisation on the basis of the criteria of age, gender and level of cover, also known as age-related health credits. We are introducing a new system of high-cost claim credits and reducing the stamp duty payable on all health insurance policies that feed into the central support fund. I presume these actions have been costed and are deemed to be beneficial or else I do not expect the Minister of State would have proposed them. She indicated that the scheme is revenue neutral and that any surplus or deficits that might occur will be rolled over into subsequent years. She has noted the high take-up of insurance which stands at 2.3 million. That is to be applauded. However, I would also point out that there is a large discrepancy between policies, as the Minister of State knows well. People tend to gear up their policies as they grow older because, notwithstanding risk equalisation, the chances are that policies at the lower end will not cover you for some of the serious health obstacles you may face as you age. As mentioned by previous speakers, there may be a couple of pensioners paying between €3,500 or €5,000 for a high-level scheme. That seems very difficult for people who have generally paid tax all their lives. It may be that this Bill will deal with some of those inequities. Private and public hospitals and private and public work have been raised several times during the debate. It is very hard to compare what happens in the public hospital sector with what happens in the private hospital sector as they generally relate to different streams of activity. Someone in the private hospital system will be looking for fast, straightforward, repeatable exercises that you can turn around and that basically create fee income. That is what private hospital care is largely based on. The public system is the social contract that we have whereby we decide that we will look after everybody regardless of their health needs. That also includes those with very chronic health needs across a range of medical areas who require lots of care and ongoing treatment both in hospital and in community. That cost is picked up largely by the public purse. When we talk about Sláintecare, therefore, we are talking about trying to get the efficiencies of the private system while having public good at the heart of the policy. It will be a very difficult circle to square, to be quite frank, because there is a great deal of work to be done to try to generate that. Others have spoken of the need to implement Sláintecare, but I would point out the significant obstacles in the recruitment of qualified medical personnel. At present, we are engaged in talks on a new contract for hospital consultants. Many newly qualifying doctors will tell you they are not going to work in the public system for the contract that is being offered to them but are going to emigrate instead. Thus, we will have spent the money educating them but we do not have any system or bursary to provide medical training that would contract them to work in the system for one, two or five years, as is done in other countries. We just educate them and let them fly. At the other end of the scale, there are people who have worked as hospital consultants for 20 or 30 years and may still have time to run on their contracts but they are not going to stay in the system much longer because, quite frankly, they have had enough of a lot of it. We have much reform to deliver on that. I raise also waiting lists, tests and scans. Deputy Naughten has just highlighted how level 2 hospitals can do much of this work and I agree. They should certainly be funded by the private health ensurers and that is an easy initiative to put in place if the will is there. There are also a couple of schemes around the insurance-backed long-term care. I point to the VHI Hospital@Home, which is a system where a VHI patient whose needs are chronic, not acute, may be able to get minded in his or her home. Essentially, VHI will pay for people to come and deal with the patient at home. That is a very efficient system for releasing beds in our public hospitals as well as in the private ones. Similarly, there is the outpatient antimicrobial therapy, OPAT. At the moment, we have patients coming into hospital and taking up a bed for half a day or a day to receive antimicrobial therapy. That can be done quite easily in the home if we have the nurses or qualified doctors to do it. I am aware there is a pilot being discussed at the moment but we do not need to pilot that. This is simple stuff. We should just decide we are going to do it and see what resources we have to do it with. I will be supporting Deputy Naughten's amendment. It is discrimination against model 2 hospitals that any health insurer would not be paying for procedures that they pay for in other hospitals. They are the same procedures. I agree with him they should not be remunerated under the fund until that case has been levied. As I said, I wonder if Sláintecare is realistic in the form we are currently discussing. The Minister of State knows I have been around healthcare for a long number of years. One of the things I have notice about many policy discussions is they generally do not include those who actually have to deliver the service. We talk about what we are going to do on efficiency but we do not speak to the nurses. We talk about what we are going to do on high-level clinical management but we do not speak to the clinical nurse managers and we rarely involve the consultants, to be quite frank. I do not take the view, as other Deputies might, that somehow the consultants are an outlying class in medicine and all out for money. I know very many who are quite the opposite. They are very much pastoral people and their first inclination is to serve, mind and look after their patients. We have created the consultants' contract they work under and many of them are quite happy to work under the system. However, they want support and the proper resources. They want resourcing at junior levels that is adequate to their needs, that is, they need registrars, house officers, junior doctors, clinical nurse managers or secretaries. The consultants are getting tanked off, basically, because when they go into the system they do not have that. That is why we are hearing so many people saying the system is dysfunctional. The system is difficult and it will remain so while public healthcare is offered to all. We must learn from the efficiencies in the private sector and see how we can bring them across into the public sector while getting risk and payment equalisation for all.

However, it would be a real dereliction of my duty as a TD if I did not take the opportunity to outline the current state of healthcare provision in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath. I think all parties in the House have at some point given a commitment to working towards a universal public system where people are treated on the basis of need and not on ability to pay but are we actually any closer to providing meaningful healthcare reform? No, we are not. Are we any closer to that universal, national health service? No, not really. That is why 40% of people in the country rely on health insurance in a market worth €2.5 billion annually across three main providers. The number of people availing of and reliant on private health insurance has increased consistently since the recession. One of the main reasons for that, and the reason people who can ill afford to spend hundreds if not thousands of euro on these premiums annually do so, is fear. They themselves fear they will get sick or that a family member will, and we all know the fastest route to assessments and treatment is private health insurance. That is a fact. It is one I find abhorrent but it is a fact nonetheless. It is also indisputable that those who cannot afford private health insurance are left languishing on a public waiting system watching the days, weeks, months and in some cases years go by as they wait for that all-important appointment to arrive. I have a constituent who maintains that while the official cause of death of his beloved wife was cancer, in reality she died from poverty. She had gone to the doctor and was waiting for an appointment for scans and diagnostic tests but without private insurance time was passing by and her condition was deteriorating. Martina presented to her doctor while in severe pain. Frustrated and concerned the GP rang an ambulance and she was admitted through accident and emergency, where she got the necessary tests and the treatment began. She was in hospital for her fourth dose of chemotherapy when her first public appointment letter arrived. Now, her widower is left torturing himself with the what-ifs. What if they had private health insurance? What if her diagnosis and treatment had begun sooner? It is hard to dispute his logic and his conclusion that his wife died because she did not have insurance and therefore did not have access to the timely care and treatment she so desperately needed while she was still alive. There can be no denying we have a two-tier healthcare system that needs to be phased out once and for all. The reality is that people get treated more quickly based on their monetary worth and their bank balance rather than their health needs. That shameful situation needs to end. We should have no more cases like Martina's. There should be no more tortured widowers.

This is one of the many Bills that have been brought forward so the amount of money paid to the health insurance companies by way of credits can be reduced. These risk credits are paid on the basis of age and gender. Risk needs to be spread so newer entrants coming into the market also bear the cost of risk. The money paid into the equalisation fund comes from a stamp duty paid from every policy sold. There are two distinct pay-outs, namely, risk equalisation credits and hospital utilisation credits. Risk equalisation makes it easier for insurers to carry higher risk profiles, for example, those with higher medical costs because of age, medical history etc. so they can compete in the market with other providers. As happens with all insurance claims, there must be an incentive for the insurance companies to fight a claim. On this, instead of paying out excess amounts, the Government is now proposing to pay a portion of the claim. This should also help reduce the stamp duty paid on all policies. Sections 5 to 7, inclusive, will revise the section relating to equalisation credits, health credits and the high-cost claims. I understand this will be enacted in January 2022. The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, indicates 644,458 people are now waiting for their first appointment. The number of people waiting on a day care procedure is 74,662. This is harrowing and very upsetting. The NTPF also pointed out 217 people have been added to the public hospital waiting list every day since the start of the year.Some nine people every hour are added to our waiting lists. The Minister of State said earlier that costs are escalating in hospitals. Where is the money going? People are paying insurance to sit on a chair for a day or two or to sit on a trolley for a day or a week. Where is the money going, if it is not going into front-line services? It is not going towards paying our nurses. Most of the positions that have been advertised are managerial or administrative. Why are so many of our Irish nurses leaving the public hospital system? Some of them are going to private hospitals and some are leaving altogether because of the way some of the hospitals are being run. When will we audit the CEOs of all the public hospitals and the management system? I will make it very clear that a public hospital should be run the same as a private one when it comes to its management system. I see that private hospitals, if they are not run properly, will not stay in business. I am the person who said in this Chamber that some public hospitals have shorter waiting times, shorter waiting lists and their patients spend less time waiting on trolleys and chairs to be seen. One or two of the public hospitals have an ongoing record, since the CEOs were appointed to them, of a situation that is spiralling out of control. I am disappointed to say that one of the hospitals with the highest numbers is always University Hospital Limerick. I want the management and CEO structure in that hospital to be audited and checked to find out why it has the largest number of people waiting on beds. Why does it have the largest number of people waiting on trolleys for hours and hours, and even days, to be seen? The front-line staff are not the problem; it is the management system. We cannot, at any stage, blame our front-line staff, especially when other hospitals do not have the same issue. Public hospitals do not have the same issue. I did not realise I could speak on my first day in the Dáil. All I had was a small piece of paper on which I wrote one or two notes to give me something in case I got airlocked.

I want to know why the hospital system has changed so much. When I was in Barrington's Hospital as a young lad, which is now a private hospital, a patient was released no later than 11 a.m. If that patient was not well enough to be released by then, he or she stayed in. The structure of the bed system meant the patient stayed in until the following morning when rounds were done by doctors and consultants and, if the patient was fit and well enough, he or she was released. I receive reports day after day from the hospital system of people being released at 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. The system is completely wrong. It is a management system and not a front-line care system. All public hospitals need to introduce a system whereby a patient who is not released by 11 a.m. is not released at all. In that way, those working in front-line services are given the chance to go to the computer to check whether they have five beds free on a given floor and will know what they have. There will not then be nurses ringing upstairs and downstairs to see if a bed is free for somebody who needs it. That is where the chaos arises. It is a management and structural problem and not one of front-line staff. That change has not happened. I am in the Dáil for almost two years, I have been asking for this structure over that time and it still has not happened. I want the Minister of State to tell the hospitals that this is the structure that must be implemented. Not only will beds be released by 11 a.m., front-line staff who have to prepare those beds for the next patients will be given a chance to return beds to the ward by 1 p.m. and nurses will then know that they can manage their hospital. That is a structure. If that structure was introduced, it would take the stress and anxiety away from nurses and healthcare workers trying to make sure that people are in beds. It would also relieve the trolley crisis. I have seen people waiting in hospitals for two days to see a consultant. When they came out, after meeting a consultant, they got huge bills from their insurance companies, which they had to sign if they did not sign them in the hospitals. They refused to sign until they saw the huge costs in those bills for waiting and taking up a bed from a person who could have been terminally ill, or very sick, and waiting to get into hospital. That person was left on a trolley downstairs while the insured person waited for a consultant to see them in the public system. I want the help of the Minister of State, the Minister and the Government with this. I support what is being done in this Bill. When supports are being put in, I support them. At this stage, the issue is bigger than this Bill. It is about the waste of money, waste of people's time and waste of bed units. We can help people, front-line staff and hospitals with a structure, but not until we get the CEOs and management structure right and audited. If a person is in a job and is not doing it properly, he or she should be removed. Let us put in somebody who can manage the structure. I will do whatever I can to help implement this, but I want a commitment from the Government that it will honestly look at it. I see this issue as the biggest reason our nurses are leaving some of our public hospitals. I have checked other public hospitals where nurses are not leaving. It is because a structure is in place whereby they can do their job, and help and care for people, without the stress of trying to manage and run a hospital with no structure. I ask for the Minister of State's help to help me get the right people in place, including the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to audit the CEOs of the hospitals. I said that I am disappointed that I have to stand in the Chamber as a Limerick Deputy and say that University Hospital Limerick has one of the highest waiting times in the country, which has been the case for a number of years. Covid is not causing this situation. Every other public hospital has the same issues with Covid. University Hospital Limerick has a management and structural problem. I ask every Deputy and Minister to help put a structure in place and audit the management of our public hospitals. If any public hospital has gone above and beyond and has an excellent structure, let us introduce that into Limerick and fix the problem there. That is what I am asking for. Let us stop people coming to the Chamber to complain about the front-line service. It is not the front line; it is the structure. I ask for the Minister of State's help.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	246	I want to read the following into the record:6.1 Assessments and care plans...There is evidence that these plans were updated regularly by staff, management and on occasions by a multidisciplinary team however, the contents of the plans rarely changed, nor did Brandon's behaviour change or improve over this period of time, except during periods of ill health... This can be best understood by comparing the first recorded plan for Brandon in November 2003 with the final available plan twelve years later in January 2015."All staff need to be aware that Brandon has a history of inappropriate behaviour.. Brandon needs to be supervised at all times by staff... Any untoward behaviour documented..." (Management plan, 20th November 2003)."Brandon has touched other service users in a sexually inappropriate way... Brandon should not visit other houses... Brandon should not have access to newspapers, magazines and photographs during the day... Brandon is to be supervised when watching TV" (Proactive strategy, January 2015).In a risk assessment and management plan dated 31st August 2004 the guidance for staff was that they should familiarise themselves with the Health Boards policy "Prevention of Challenging Behaviour" as a means by which to manage Brandon's sexual assaults on other more vulnerable service users. However, there was no evidence that staff were provided with training, at that time, in the implementation of this policy.6.2 Management strategies for Brandon's behavioursA common management strategy employed to deal with Brandon's sexually assaultive behaviour was to move him around various wards. Brandon was moved a total of nine times in the fifteen year period of this review. The movement of Brandon from ward to ward began on 12th July 2005 when a decision was taken to move him from 'Breaffy to 'Abbeyside' because "Abbeyside would be a safer environment due to (the) level of supervision and male staff available". Brandon was moved to 'Abbeyside' that day, however, due to his level of distress and the fact he wanted to go back to 'Breaffy', he was moved back again that night. Four days later on 16th July 2005 Brandon was then transferred to 'Castledaly'; "transfer to Castledaly due to his nursing care needs - hoist".On 3rd January 2006 it is recorded that 'Brandon needed an urgent transfer from 'Castledaly' ward' as he was causing major upset to clients, he was subsequently moved from 'Castledaly' back to 'Breaffy' on 2nd February 2006. On 14th June 2007 he was transferred from 'Breaffy' to 'Abbeyside', due to his 'increased aggression towards others. Brandon very difficult to manage...Brandon require(s) male staff 24 hours...Brandon transferred to "Abbeyside" today'.By December 2008 he was transferred to House 1, in the Stillwater complex. While each of these moves provided some respite to the staff and residents of the ward Brandon was vacating, unfortunately they also gave him access to other residents many of whom became new victims of his abusive behaviour.At a staff meeting on 4th May 2011, it was also confirmed that a particularly vulnerable resident targeted by Brandon (resident 1) who had no speech and was unable to call out for help had been moved to a different house for his own safety. The decision to move this resident was subsequently reversed five weeks later in a review meeting held on the 9th June 2011 which stated "Resident 1 to return to house 1 in Stillwater because a management plan is in place regarding Brandon's behaviour. The physical environment had been made secure. Alarm applied to bedroom door". The decision to return resident 1 to this unit with Brandon after he had moved for his own safety is very concerning. The review panel believe the assumption the bedroom alarm on Brandon's door would ensure this vulnerable resident's safety is erroneous, as the alarm on Brandon's door had been in place since 30th June 2008 with limited success. In a staff meeting one week later on 15th June 2011 it is recorded: "(it was) acknowledged that Brandon has the capability of opening and closing the door to sound the alarm in an effort to dupe staff" suggesting that Brandon had figured out how to beat the alarm.Six Month's later on the 22nd December 2011 Brandon was moved to house 2, in the Stillwater complex to live by himself, away from other vulnerable residents. While this move resulted in a sharp reduction in the number of sexual assaults recorded, unfortunately, on 4th September 2013 he was again moved back again to house 1 to live with residents he had previously assaulted.Brandon's move to house 2 appears to have been the only successful strategy employed in the management of Brandon in that it did provide some protection, albeit short term, to other residents. The reason for Brandon's move back to house 1 was recorded in a "Protection of Vulnerable Adults Strategy Meeting", 19th September 2013.
"...on the 15th August 2013 Brandon became unwell and following this was unable to weight bear and as a result required additional staff to manage his care needs so he was transferred to House 1... It was agreed that due to Brandon's recent deterioration in his health he was no longer able to participate in inappropriate sexual behaviour".
The assessment that Brandon was no longer a risk to others turned out to be inaccurate. According to a document referred to as a "Primary Risk Screening Form" dated 9th September 2015 (two years later) the risks of physical and sexual harm to others from Brandon continue to be identified...A risk rating scored '25' is the highest risk rating score that can be applied to risks as per the HSE's 'Integrated Risk Management Policy' (2011). On 9th May 2016 Brandon transferred to a nursing home. The nursing home has documented that the reason for Brandon's admission to them is: "Nursing Home) received a request to assess Brandon for long term nursing care in April 2016 from (Stillwater) services. Disclosure was given on an alleged pattern of sexually abusive behaviour and that the transfer was essential because the alleged victim was still resident in the same accommodation as Brandon".This extract from the nursing home documentation demonstrates that management in the HSE believed Brandon continued to be a risk to other residents in Stillwater and that his abusive behaviour was continuing.This view is shared by the CHO's Safeguarding and Protection Team's (SPT's) principal social worker who, on 31st October 2017, spoke to the CHO's Chief Officer and said:"Brandon poses a risk to other vulnerable adults of sexual abuse. Responses to date are that the risk Brandon poses are minimised due to his now limited mobility, however, I do not agree that this is an accurate reflection of the risk as Brandon's behaviours were primarily centred on exposing himself to peers and exposing peers to sexually inappropriate behaviours... Clearly, limited mobility does not minimise the risk of this to an extent whereby other vulnerable adults are protected"...
"The staff at the current environment within the resources available try to limit these incidents which are on-going. If the move to the new house happens now this could reduce the number of these assaults for the most vulnerable group and improve the quality of life for all concerned".
On two occasions psychiatrist (1) also sought a second opinion from other external psychiatrists. The first external opinion was from psychiatrist (2) who reviewed Brandon on 19th March 2008. Psychiatrist (2) brief note states:
"Very difficult management problem...sexualisation probably due to underlying affective disorder...no quality of life due to mental state".
In April 2011 a second external review was sought from a psychiatrist (3) who completed an assessment of Brandon on 12th April 2011. Psychiatrist (3) submitted her report to psychiatrist (1) and service manager (1) on 27th April 2011. This five-page report provides a concise synopsis of what psychiatrist (3) describes as Brandon's "seriously abnormal sexual behaviour". The report outlines two particular problems: "excessive masturbation" and "contact sexual behaviour". The psychiatrist (3) described the residents living with Brandon as "very vulnerable to the sexual threat of opportunistic, predatory and recidivistic approach of this man". Psychiatrist (3) report went on to make a number of recommendations including:
- "It is totally inappropriate to allow this man to continue to live with and sexually exploit vulnerable learning disabled men...

-The fact that relatives of his known victims have not been informed of the episodes of abuse could be interpreted as collusion or complicity if the situation were ever the subject of an investigation...".
On 4th May 2011 at a staff meeting the issues referred to in the psychiatrist (3) report were discussed and it was concluded that "the residents of house 1 are at risk of sexual advance from Brandon at any time"...6.4 Reports to external managers...The first reference of concerns about Brandon being escalated to senior management was in a letter by psychiatrist (1) to his GP dated 7th February 2008 which stated; 'I will be speaking with senior nursing staff in relation to the management of Brandon's behaviour. I will be raising the issues in managing this type of individual within current resources with the local health manager'.

The letter also stated "three residents in particular are at a significant risk of both physical and sexual assault from the other residents". The letter also stated "one patient requires constant supervision due to a combination of frontal lobe damage and mental illness as he is opportunistically assaulting others sexually".The general manager (2) in his capacity as acting local health manager for the County Community Services responded on 15th August 2008, "We have commenced the process of recruitment of staff nurses which will enable us to complete the opening of Stillwater complex... by October... The move to the new houses should take place in October and this could reduce the number of these assaults and incidents on this most vulnerable group..."It is clear from this response that senior management viewed the move to the Stillwater complex as the solution to Brandon's inappropriate behaviour. However, a short time later in or around December 2008 Brandon was also moved to the Stillwater complex to share house 1 with five other vulnerable residents. It is not clear why the decision to move Brandon to the Stillwater complex was made, however, the consequences of this decision turned out to be devastating for all the other residents living in house 1...6.5 The letter from six staff members, 26th February 2008The concern and frustration of staff working with Brandon is evident in a letter dated the 26th February 2008 addressed to the multi-disciplinary team meeting (which took place on 4th March 2008). This letter was signed by six nursing staff members. This letter is a significant milestone in the overall account of Brandon's assaults on others and demonstrates the deep level of concern that these six staff members had about vulnerable individuals in their care. The letter described Brandon's behaviours in 'Breaffy' ward and how these behaviours continued in the 'Abbeyside' ward. The letter stated that "although initially well behaved (when he moved to the Abbeyside) Brandon soon resumed sexually assaulting his fellow residents".The letter goes on to say that "the more staff intervened to prevent this behaviour, the more violent, aggressive and argumentative towards staff he became". The letter also warns that "despite the higher level of supervision... Brandon's assaultive nature was increased where he will... blatantly touch others in the company of staff and within seconds of staff providing a duty of care elsewhere..."

I commend the firefighters and ambulance paramedics of Dublin Fire Brigade, who have a long and proud tradition of keeping our community safe, especially during the pandemic. When most people were being told to stay home and stay safe, front-line workers like the members of the Dublin Fire Brigade donned their gear, left their families and went to work. I will outline what the Government and Dublin Fire Brigade management need to do to support our firefighters and ambulance staff. They need to initiate two back-to-back recruitment training classes to be scheduled immediately to exhaust the current training panel and alleviate the situation in a timely manner; immediately establish a new panel to allow for further recruitment classes to be trained; support every effort made by both sides to reach an agreement on overall Dublin Fire Brigade operational manning levels and other outstanding issues currently being negotiated; ensure all firefighters and officers are fully trained in managing high-rise fire and medical emergencies; schedule a full training programme to ensure full competencies across all watches and stations, including retained stations; fully implement the recommendations of the fire safety task force group report published by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in July 2018; and recognise the propensity of staff to suffer from burnout if repeatedly working overtime to cover staff shortages, provide information to staff regarding the tall-tale signs of burnout and support for staff who may be suffering from burnout. I will return later to the issue of resources and a strategic plan for the future growth of Dublin Fire Brigade in an ever-growing Dublin, in terms of both population and business. At the start of this pandemic, firefighters and paramedics in the Dublin Fire Brigade did not know what was ahead of them. That did not matter as they had a job to do which involved saving lives, supporting our communities and keeping them safe. Over recent weeks, I have met with trade union representatives, firefighters, the chief fire officer and staff in Dublin City Council. The firefighters talked about how they are demoralised. They were working excessively long hours covering shifts and are fearful for their own and others' safety if the situation of staff shortages continues. Here are the hard numbers. All agree the current number of firefighters is 965. However, there are currently 35 vacancies, 35 on bereavement leave and 30 on special projects. All accept these are important projects but it adds to the problem of staff shortages. I acknowledge 35 new recruits are to come in December or January with a new class of 45 to start in February. However, these 45 recruits will not be added to the roster until at least the end of 2022 as it takes a minimum of ten months to train a firefighter. Today a firefighter informed me that the Dublin Fire Brigade factor in 30 to 35 retirements each year and a firefighter told me yesterday at a meeting that it is like filling a bucket but the holes are getter bigger each year. He said what is happening at the moment is not even enough to cover people who are leaving through retirement. It is clear that what is being done to relieve the pressure on workers will not solve the problem in the coming years and staff are at risk of burnout, which will impact their health and safety, along with that of our citizens. This must be seen as an urgent matter for the Government. As I said, I will return later to the resources, the expansion of Dublin city and county and the strategic plan for Dublin Fire Brigade as Dublin grows. The Minister has heard the statistics we have been given by the trade unions and the chief fire officer, who admitted they are not sufficient for the current numbers, let alone for a growing Dublin.

That is just one moment which their successors, today's firefighters, look back on with pride. There are many other reasons for them and us to be proud of Dublin Fire Brigade. Like all other front-line services, they did not have to be asked twice to step up when this pandemic hit our shores. As the emergency ambulance services for the greater Dublin area, the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade have been run off their feet trying to cope with Covid calls on top of their ordinary, or extraordinary, work day-in, day-out. Despite being often hamstrung by huge staff shortages, they have got the job done but they are at breaking point. They are emulating the firefighting heroes of the past daily and the least we can do is ensure they have a full complement of staff to carry out their duties and the equipment to do their jobs, nothing more or less. Dublin Fire Brigade does not have the pull to deal with the large staff shortages which are beginning to cripple the service. It needs to do much more to deliver for Dublin in terms of fire, rescue and ambulance services. As the city expands and grows upwards, it needs more emergency medical technicians, EMTs, and first responders delivering Dublin's fire rescue and ambulance services, saving lives and tackling emergencies.

We all miss her greatly. When she was sick she was taken to hospital in a Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance. That is the experience of my family: the care we got, the compassion with which we were treated, the speed, efficiency and all-round decency of the men and women who turned up. That is the experience of thousands of Dubliners. The Minister knows this and is proud of the Dublin Fire Brigade, as I am. It is an important service, not just for who its members are and what they do, but for what they represent to the people of Dublin. It is a highly trained service. Its members are trained paramedics and firefighters but they are not well resourced. They are enthusiastic and willing and they put themselves in danger. They are capable and highly trained and we are all proud of them but we do not have enough firefighters for the city and county. The Minister and I represent a constituency with a rapidly growing population, which is welcome. It is great to see so many young people across north County Dublin but we need a fire service that is fit for today and future-proofed to take account of the growing population and the growing number of housing developments. These developments are going upwards in many cases, rather than outwards, and that requires specialised equipment. We need a fire service to service the capital city and county that is fit for purpose and future-proofed. The purpose of this motion is to show our support and that of the Oireachtas for the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade.We need to acknowledge that there is a reason they balloted for industrial action They did not do that without reason. These are people who take their job extremely seriously. I know this because I worked as a union official for a long time and I worked with Dublin Fire Brigade on many occasions. Its members do not want to be in the business of talking to politicians or union officials; they want to get on with doing the work for which they are highly trained and competent and well capable of doing. When they have to ballot for industrial action, step out of their comfort zone and their area of work and into industrial relations and health and safety legislation, that should set off alarm bells in the Minister's office and across the city and county. We have an opportunity this evening to speak as an Oireachtas with one voice and to say to the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade that we hear their concerns, we understand them and that the resources they need will be provided.

Like others, and as all Deputies who contribute to the debate this evening probably will do, I pay tribute to the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade, our firefighters, ambulance staff and paramedics. I do not think there is a Member of this House who, either directly from family experience or as a constituency politician, has not had interaction with the fire service at the front line of its work. This is not a normal job. It is not a job you start at 9 a.m., and from which you can go home at 5 p.m. It is a vocation. The men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade bring to that job an enormous level of commitment. That is shown very clearly in the fact that day in, day out they put their own lives at risk. That is not only a tribute to them, but to their families and their wider communities. When I look at successive Governments, I find that often it is those public servants at the very coalface of some of the most difficult jobs who are resourced the poorest. Sometimes, that is carers and other times it is nurses or members of the Defence Forces. That the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade felt the need to ballot for industrial action is itself a failure. Everybody here knows what is required. Everybody here knows what we need to do. It would be really powerful if, coming out of this debate, we had unanimity and an acceptance that there are issues here in terms of resourcing, staff, training and support that need to be resolved and that, with collective political will, clear intent and signalling from Government, we can ensure are resolved in the best interests of the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade and the men, women and children of the city in Dublin. Like the Minister and Deputy O'Reilly, I represent a constituency that is growing very rapidly, namely, Adamstown, which the Minister visited recently, and the significant residential development at Clonburris will commence soon. Therefore, not only do we need to meet the current staff complement, in respect of which there is a shortfall, we need to go further than that. I genuinely look forward to the Minister's response. I hope we can speak with one voice tonight and do the right thing by the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	259	We need to remind ourselves that Dublin Fire Brigade responds to fires, car crashes, accidents, storms such as we are experiencing tonight and emergencies, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It operates 12 full-time stations, inclusive of the station at the Belgard Road in Tallaght. This work is being done even though the service is almost 100 firefighters short of what is required to adequately and safely man our fire stations. It is an almost daily occurrence that vehicles are unavailable for deployment owing to insufficient firefighters to staff them. Staff are constantly battling exhaustion owing to, we are told, repeated requests to work overtime and to cover staff shortages. Simply put, our fire service is at crisis point. This is not a new issue. Dublin Fire Brigade has been highlighting severe understaffing for years, which has worsened in the face of inaction by senior management. Tallaght fire station is the centre for responses to major incidents in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. My fear is that it does not have the personnel or the necessary equipment to respond to such emergencies. The Minister might address that in his response.  The lack of planning is evidenced elsewhere in that there are only 36 trainees to graduate this January, which is not nearly enough to fill the existing vacancies in the service. More firefighters will retire next year. If this continues, more gaps will open up and responders will be spread even more thinly. The joint Dublin fire and ambulance medical response model that currently operates and delivers fully trained medical responders is, I am told, also under threat and needs to be supported, not changed. The failure of the Government to ensure that Dublin Fire Brigade has the personnel and equipment it needs is also leaving the public vulnerable. It is essential that Dublin City Council chief executive officer, Owen Keegan, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, meet directly with the firefighters and their unions to address these funding and staffing issues. Staff shortages directly affect the emergency response times of Dublin Fire Brigade and must be immediately addressed because understaffing or delayed response times put the public at serious risk. In my area of Tallaght, there was a fire recently in an apartment block. That incident showed the skills and ability of the ambulance and fire brigade services, but it also served as a warning in regard to resourcing and staffing of our fire services. On that evening, at the height of the response, there were eight fire brigades on the scene, which is the majority of Dublin Fire Brigade's strength. Had a second major incident occurred simultaneously, it would have stretched Dublin Fire Brigade's response capability to the brink. We know that the turntable ladder is located in the city and of the concern that raises in terms of delays, etc. A major incident on the M50 and, at the same time, a fire on the north side would put the fire services in the impossible position of having to divide resources with lives in the balance. In a city of well over 1 million inhabitants, we need a fire service that has the capability to respond to more than one major incident at any one time. The current situation whereby on-call vehicles are leaving stations with less than a full complement of firefighters is putting the crews and public at risk.

I commend the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade on their commitment and bravery in carrying out their work. When one looks out the window today, it is notable that most people are indoors, but the fire services are the people we call on if there is any trouble or concern for us or our families. I particularly thank the members of the Dublin Fire Brigade stations in Donnybrook and Tara Street which operate across Dublin Bay South. Not only are they an emergency service and fire brigade stations, they are an integral part of the community. They are involved in events held by the community and they regularly engage in fundraising for a range of charities.  Dublin Fire Brigade provides immediate medical assistance 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It has had such a profound impact on countless lives across the city and beyond. In many cases, these firefighters put their own lives at risk while carrying out this invaluable work. It cannot be said often enough how indebted we in this city are to the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade, but words in support and praise are not nearly enough. A round of applause will not help. The Dublin Fire Brigade is in need of urgent support. That is what this motion brought forward by Deputy Paul Donnelly intends to deliver. We are hearing near constant reports of increased pressure owing to staff shortages. There is huge concern with regard to a lack of equipment and resources. Dublin Fire Brigade has saved countless lives in this city. In times of crisis elsewhere in this country, it has gone wherever it was needed. A first responder should never be put under this type of pressure. The men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade are the backbone of the emergency response in Dublin. They should never have to ballot for industrial action owing to staff shortages and concerns that the safety of firefighters and members of the public is being compromised.  We frequently hear reports of fire engines being off the road due to staff shortages. During last Hallowe'en, one of the busiest periods of the year for Dublin Fire Brigade, there were five engines off the road owing to staff shortages. We need to see back-to-back recruitment classes scheduled immediately and supports put in place to bring this lack of emergency cover to an end.We need to provide the Dublin Fire Brigade with the equipment and resources needed to carry out its job to the fullest of its members' ability. Dublin's fire brigade service is its first and last line of defence and it needs to be better resourced. I call on all parties to support this motion and give the Dublin Fire Brigade the support it deserves.

I accept the motion in the spirit in which it is tabled. Anybody who knows me knows that during all my time in the Dáil, I have been a strong and ardent supporter of the Dublin Fire Brigade since well before I took ministerial responsibility for fire and emergency services, a responsibility I have not delegated to a Minister of State and have retained for myself. I have friends involved in the fire service, as many of us do, and I see the work the crews do on a daily basis. I take this opportunity, as others have done, to recognise, on the day that is in it, the work of all our emergency services and front-line staff, including our fire crews all across the country and, indeed, here in Dublin. As a Dub and like many Dubliners, I am extremely proud of the invaluable fire rescue and ambulance service provided by the Dublin Fire Brigade. The work that is undertaken by the men and women of the brigade, as other speakers have recognised, can be dangerous, physically and mentally demanding and very challenging. It takes a particular kind of brave and dedicated person to take on the role. The Dublin Fire Brigade members and their colleagues in the emergency services throughout the State save lives, first and foremost, and also prevent damage to residential and commercial property. I particularly want to recognise the very difficult circumstances in which our crews have worked through the 22 months of the pandemic. It has been a very challenging time and continues to be so. I am sure Deputy Donnelly is aware of the following points but I want to raise them for the record of the House. Under the Fire Services Act, it is the statutory function of the fire authorities to provide a fire service in a particular functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of fire brigades, assessment of fire cover and provision of fire station premises. My role in the Department, which I am very serious about, is to support the fire authorities through setting general policy and national standards, providing a central training programme, which I will turn to presently, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and, very importantly, providing capital funding, of which we recently allocated €61 million over the next five years, for equipment, appliances and priority infrastructural projects to meet the needs of a growing population. I will now deal with some of the issues that are raised in the motion. The Covid pandemic has presented challenges to the Dublin Fire Brigade in respect of recruitment and training of new staff, which has resulted in particular staff shortages at this time. There is no question about that. However, my Department, as instructed by me, together with Dublin City Council, is actively engaging to address this issue and see how we can expedite the recruitment programme. Covid has presented a difficulty in terms of the length of time training is taking. It bears repeating, however, that, despite the pandemic, recruitment and training is ongoing in the O'Brien Institute in Marino and other training centres. As I travel around the country, I make it my business to visit fire crews and paramedics, whether in North Strand or Swords, Ballybay or Ennis. This motion is timely in that it recognises the work they do. The most recent firefighter recruitment campaign began in September 2019, as Deputies know, and the first class of recruits began training in April 2020. It is detailed and tough training and there is a time constraint in that regard. The second recruitment class started in June 2021 and will finish in December, with 36 recruits taking up positions. Deputy Donnelly may not be aware that a third recruitment class of 45 will begin training in early 2022, with provision within the Dublin City Council budget for a fourth class of the remaining panelled recruits later in 2022. We need to make up the gap the Deputy spoke about, and that is planned for and is happening. Funding was mentioned in the context of delivering overall additional staff positions. To be clear, the issue of staff shortages is not just a funding one. Firefighters and paramedics are not just hired; there is an extensive recruitment and training process. I encourage everyone, with the permission of the Dublin Fire Brigade, to visit the training centres and see the extensive training undertaken by recruits. That training takes time and the fire brigade management must follow a process. It should be clearly understood that there a number of issues at play at this time in respect of the Dublin Fire Brigade. Dublin City Council, as the employer, has been engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies, including both Fórsa and SIPTU, at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. There has been some progress in a number of areas. I am very glad of that and I continue to watch the matter very closely. There is not a week that goes by when I am not in contact with someone in the fire brigade, its management or somebody in Dublin City Council. Some of that progress would alleviate the pressures caused by current staffing arrangements but no final agreement has yet been reached. In an attempt to break the impasse, a proposal was made on 17 November and a response is awaited. The most important thing at this point is to get all parties to re-engage with the established statutory industrial machinery in order to achieve a resolution without delay. I believe such a resolution is achievable. I will deal presently with issues relating to the Department of Health. I take this opportunity strongly to urge all parties to re-enter that process in good faith. I am confident the remaining issues are capable of being resolved. My Department and I continue to work with the Dublin Fire Brigade on issues and to provide support. Last week, during the normal course of my duties and in advance of this motion being tabled, I met the Minister for Health in an attempt to make progress around the provision of ambulance services by the Dublin Fire Brigade on behalf of the National Ambulance Service, NAS. A long-standing issue that is nearly resolved is the use of one combined system but involving separate locations. The Duffy report provides the way for this to be resolved, as I reiterated at the meeting last week. I am of the firm belief that an equitable solution can be met. I am an unequivocal supporter of the Dublin Fire Brigade retaining its emergency services role. I want to be really clear about that. There are synergies and our crews in the NAS also do incredible work. We want to make sure the call and dispatch system is uniform. In the short time remaining, I want to respond to the further points that were raised. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will wrap up the debate and give the final response from the Government. We are not opposing the motion. A significant portion of it is very similar to the motion I brought forward in the previous Oireachtas, which was supported by all parties. We want to move this forward. For the two minutes that are left to me, I will talk briefly about funding. Local authorities across the country have a yearly budget of approximately €240 million to run fire services. That budget is supplemented by my Department's fire services capital programme, which provides for investment in appliances, vehicles, equipment, upgrading of existing stations and construction of new stations. In December 2020, I announced a new fire services capital programme for the period from then until 2025, with an allocation of €61 million. Following extensive engagements with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works appliances were received, evaluated and prioritised. Nationally, the new programme will see six new fire stations built and continued support for the further construction of an additional 12, nine fire station refurbishments and 35 new fire engines. In Dublin specifically, as part of the 2020 fire services capital plan, Dublin Fire Brigade will receive six new class B appliances. It should be noted that these appliances are not bought off the shelf. They are constructed on order, which involves a lead time. I am pleased to say that Dublin Fire Brigade took delivery of two new class B appliances very recently and is finalising local upskilling in order that the tenders can be in service before Christmas. Two additional new appliances are due for delivery early in the new year. In addition, a new turntable ladder is due to be delivered in January and an additional turntable ladder has been sanctioned by my Department. As part of the 2020 five-year capital services plan - this is really important as we see the region expanding - we are looking at where new stations need to be located and where the capacity of existing stations needs to be increased to deal with the rise in population. I am heavily invested in the issues relating to Dublin Fire Brigade and I want them to be resolved. The motion is useful and helpful. By engagement through the existing machinery and by placing a real focus on this matter, we can bring some of the outstanding issues to resolution. I want to be clear - and I am sure the House speaks as one on this - that we firmly support the provision of emergency services in Dublin by Dublin Fire Brigade and their colleagues in other front-line services such as the National Ambulance Service. We want to make sure that continues and that the services are funded into the future. We can bridge the recruitment gap that has been impacted by Covid. Those with a fair view from the outside looking in will understand that the pandemic has been an issue in the context of how we can bring in new recruits. We will be expediting two further recruitment classes. As I said, I am not able to respond to the motion. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will reply to the debate towards the end. I thank Deputies for their contributions.

It is a privilege to speak on it. The Minister mentioned a number of fire stations, namely, those in Ballybay, Ennis and Swords. I take this opportunity to remind him that the country is not a doughnut. There is a centre to it, which, I believe, is commonly referred to as the midlands. We also have fire stations.

I am struck by a memory of when I was very small in school. We visited a fire station and were told that the most important thing you could do in a fire was to get out and stay out. The people of whom we are speaking here this evening actually run into burning buildings. Their job is to protect us and to rescue us. We rely on them when we are at our most vulnerable. Dublin firefighters have given notice of their intention to ballot for industrial action over staff shortages because their safety and that of their colleagues and the members of the public they serve has been compromised by the failure to deal with issues and concerns raised. The service is currently operating below agreed safe staffing levels and there is an over-reliance on overtime to reach daily staffing levels. I know from speaking regularly with the fire service in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath that Dublin Fire Brigade is not alone. Panels cannot be filled, let alone posts. People are leaving. Some are actually leaving the country. These retained firefighters talk not only of the stressful nature of the job that they do, which they signed up to do, which they love and which they want to do, they also speak about the negative impact that it has on their families, their children, their partners and their spouses. They speak of their inability to take holidays or to give a commitment to just simply be there as part of the family because of that same over-reliance on overtime. However, they do it. They do it willingly to support each other because that is the nature of the job. Firefighters and communities deserve much better than the massaging of figures and statistics. What I hear from firefighters is that they do not feel supported. They feel that their role is not being valued and that overtime, the service and they themselves are purposely being downgraded because there is an increase in reliance on voluntary responders and a lack of appropriate training. They simply do not feel like they are being listened to or that their concerns are being addressed. The fact that many employed in our fire services are not given the tools, the support or the proper working conditions required to perform their duties is farcical. Dublin firefighters are considering strike action to improve the safety of the service. Others may well follow suit. Our firefighters across the country, both retained and full-time, are willing to do this vital work. Is the Minister willing to properly resource them to do it?

Dublin Fire Brigade provides an invaluable full-time fire rescue and ambulance service for the greater Dublin area. It is a model that should be replicated throughout the country. It is clear that while the retained model that is prevalent in rural Ireland is doing its best thanks to part-time retained firefighters, the system is not suitable for the 21st century. We need an all-Ireland national fire service that is free from the budget constraints of local authorities, where it competes with roads and playgrounds for the meagre resources provided out of county councils' income. Economies of scale and the sharing of expertise will help to modernise our fire service. If the issues of recruitment and retention are not addressed, firefighters or members of the public may be seriously injured or even die. This simply cannot be allowed to occur. Firefighters put their lives on the line every time they answer a call. In 2007, firefighters Brian Murray and Mark O’Shaughnessy from Bray and Michael Liston from Foynes, County Limerick, gave their lives in the line of duty. I would like to remember them and all those who have served in our fire service who are no longer with us. The Government must provide funding to employ additional fire service staff by offering positions to all those currently on the recruitment panel for the greater Dublin area and to plan for further expansion in the years ahead. The Government must make it easier for firefighters transfer between local authorities without loss of pay grade and pension entitlements. The Minister heard Deputy Seán Crowe speak about Kildare. I know several firefighters who live in Kildare and who commute outside the county to full-time positions. Some of them are obliged to travel more than 100 miles each way. They would gladly work in Dublin were it not for the lack of ability to transfer, as well as the loss of pay and entitlements. They should be as successful at interview as any raw recruit. I would imagine that there are many more who live much closer to Dublin. I feel urgent action is needed before the situation gets any worse.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	267	I welcome this motion on Dublin Fire Brigade. I also wish to commend my colleague, Deputy Paul Donnelly, on bringing it forward. My constituency of Dublin North-West has a large and growing population. It is served by Finglas fire station, which is known as No. 5 station within Dublin Fire Brigade. I cannot but give the highest of praise to all those who serve in Finglas and in the fire services throughout Dublin. I would like to take the opportunity now to thank them for their courage and dedication serving communities in Dublin North-West and across the city. These men and women of the fire service place themselves in danger every day in order to keep us safe and to safeguard our properties. The very least we can do is make sure that they have all the resources they require to do their job and keep them safe. However, in recent months members of the fire service have increasingly raised their concerns over staff shortages, particularly during the run up to Hallowe’en, which is traditionally one of the fire service’s busiest times of the year. It is clear that the fire service is understaffed. Union representatives for the fire services have said that a recruitment drive is urgently needed to offset the critical shortage in staffing. A number of months ago, a spokesman for the fire service union SIPTU spoke of his understanding that as many as up to four fire trucks were not in service due to a shortage in the staff numbers needed to operate them. This disturbing situation puts lives and property and risk. Measures should be put in place to ensure that this never happens again. The very least that can be done immediately would be an increase in the minimum number of firefighters. There should also be a recruitment drive that will take into account the number of vacancies left by retirement from the service. A great number of members of the service are retiring this year because many of them were obliged to delay their retirement due to Covid-19. While the fire service is under-resourced and understaffed, all our lives and the lives of the members of the staff of the service are put at risk. It is welcomed that the Government is not opposing this motion, but actions speak louder than words.

The Deputy and I often have a little bit of banter about the northside and the southside of Dublin, which the Minister will know about from being a Dub. There are some things that unite us, such as the likes of the Dublin GAA team and the value that we place on Dublin Fire Brigade. I sat in on Leaders' Questions this morning and I heard the Taoiseach commend the front-line workers that will be called upon throughout the day and tonight during Storm Barra. One of the services that will be called first tonight will be Dublin Fire Brigade. I want to thank the members of the brigade for the service that they give us and I want to wish them well in their endeavours on behalf of all of us tonight. We expect the fire brigade to come to our aid when things are difficult and sometimes in life-threatening situations to make things safer for us all. At the moment, Dublin Fire Brigade staff do not get the same consideration in the workplace. In fact, SIPTU has written to the chief fire officer calling for a safe system of work to be provided for all of its members. It has given a notice, although I do not think it is very likely, of intention to ballot fire fighters in two weeks’ time in respect of industrial action. In my constituency of Dublin Mid-West, the Adamstown fire station was promised nearly 20 years ago. It has still not materialised. As the Minister indicated, there are areas of high population growth that need to be looked after, such as the places like Adamstown and the Clonburris strategic development zone. There have been serious concerns regarding staffing levels, which my colleagues have mentioned, and there have been times when appliances and fire brigades were taken off the road. Five fire trucks were taken off the road at Hallowe'en, which is the busiest time of year for firefighters. Our fire services perform an invaluable service, saving lives and protecting our communities and we know just how important the fire brigade is to our communities. Due to the Government's failure to invest, the service is understaffed and workers feel exhausted and unsafe. Our communities deserve better. Our motion will support communities and services by ensuring a fully resourced Dublin Fire Brigade. I welcome the Minister's support for the motion. I also welcome the initial recruitment drive that he mentioned. We are all on the same page here. We all want a fully resourced fire brigade that is able to call out where and when needed. As I have said already, actions speak louder than words so let us hope there is political will behind those words.

I do not think anyone could grow up in Dublin, particularly on the northside, without the issue of Stardust looming large whenever the fire brigade or firefighters are mentioned. It is a scar across the northside. It happened 40 years ago but it is something that runs extremely deep. That is why, when we had a presentation from SIPTU and firefighters a number of weeks ago about this matter, I could almost see myself sitting in an Oireachtas committee after some disaster in the future listening to testimony about how we were completely unprepared. Having visited Kilbarrack fire station in my constituency and having listened to firefighters there saying they have no capacity to deal with any fire that takes place over the sixth storey in any apartment block, it is clear that these people are putting their lives on the line for something they believe in, which is protecting life and public safety, but they are not given the tools to do the job properly. It takes a huge amount for somebody to ballot for industrial action. It is the biggest thing a worker can ever do. I sometimes wonder if people who do not understand the trade union movement or the labour movement think balloting for industrial action is a frivolous thing that people do without thinking. It is the biggest thing a worker can ever do. There is no selfish motive behind this. It is not about pay or conditions. This is about the potential for the service to actually do its job. We were all told to stay home today. Schoolchildren were told not to go to school. Childcare facilities and third level institutions were closed and will still be closed in many areas around the country tomorrow but our firefighter personnel are still expected to go out and effectively put their lives on the line to protect us. They put on that uniform and believe in it but the feeling from them is that the State, or the authorities in Dublin who oversee the fire brigade, do not believe in that uniform as much as they do. I appreciate that this motion is not being opposed. That is a positive move and much of what the Minister said is to be commended. However, I was absolutely shook by the testimony given to me and others when Senator Marie Sherlock organised that briefing for us. I felt that we were potentially looking at a situation like what happened in the UK when a major fire incident took place. Lives were lost and destroyed, bodies were maimed, children's lives were torn apart and children's parents were lost. We were told at that briefing that the capacity of Dublin Fire Brigade to deal with such a major event is being undermined by lack of personnel, staff shortages and lack of basic equipment, as I have outlined. In my constituency, there are massive Celtic tiger constructions that have been built over the past 20 or so years. With the changing face of Dublin, the way people live now is very different to the way they lived at the time of the Stardust fire. They live in apartment complexes and the major complaint people have about apartment defects is always around fire safety. If we were to face a major fire in one of these complexes, which have question marks as regards fire safety, and if we had a catastrophe of the nature of what has happened in the UK in more recent years, we would be looking at each other at an Oireachtas committee saying that we were told and asking what we did about it. We are still about 100 people short of what is needed to properly service the fire hazard needs of this city. It is not just what these people do as regards fire but it is also to do with rescue, cardiac arrests and various other things that firefighters and people in Dublin Fire Brigade are trained to deal with. I know from the Minister's response that he is across this issue but all of us in politics are always fearful of the day when we are sitting in a committee meeting knowing that we have been told, that it was outlined to us and that we did not do enough when told to prevent it. We are all very wise after an event. Whenever anything happens in politics, or some major catastrophe, event or occasion, everybody is wise after the event. Everybody can tell you exactly what should have happened but we are being told about this now. For Dublin Fire Brigade to ballot for industrial action is a huge move from those members. It is nothing to do with pay or conditions. It is all to do with the service in which they are proud to serve and the uniform they put on. I can only imagine how a family member of a firefighter feels every time they leave home in order to go to work because I am quite sure there is a percentage of their brain that worries about them coming back through that door again. Other jobs are just not like that. Every fire station has a dedication to somebody whose life was lost or changed as a result of the work they do. If they are telling us, unselfishly, that they need more people to do their jobs and protect the city then they absolutely must be listened to. If they are saying to people like me that they do not have any capacity to deal with a fire over the sixth storey of an apartment block, they have to be listened to. These are the front-line heroes we keep hearing about. We cannot keep congratulating people for the work they do day to day, as well as on days like today, then not listen to what they have to say and force them to go down the route of industrial action. It is a shameful day when firefighters, fire personnel and Dublin Fire Brigade have to ballot for industrial action. For people in my constituency, every northside Dubliner, and probably every Dubliner and most people in this country, when they hear the word "Stardust" they know exactly what that means. It was 40 years ago but all of us have been shaped by that event. None of us wants to be in a situation - and I am repeating the point - of saying in a number of years after an event that we were told and did not do enough. These people are telling us now, in an unselfish fashion, using the most powerful method they have by potentially withdrawing their labour and going through an industrial action process, about the deficiencies in the service. We have to do our bit. We are all collectively supporting this motion but what we need is a service with 1,040 members, as has been advocated for. That is the service we need. We should not just go up to 965, which will happen when the 45 people the Minister said are currently in training are added. These people deserve better. We are reminded today of the sacrifices they make every day, and of their families, who I am sure wonder every day if they are going to cross back over the threshold of the home when they come back from work.
#GaryGannon	unknown-#GaryGannon-party	unknown-#GaryGannon-dob	unknown-#GaryGannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	270	I thank Sinn Féin for tabling this timely and worthy motion. The past two years have forced us to have a greater appreciation of our front-line workers and their dedication and workload, but also the environment in which they work and the resources they are provided. I have said this many times in the Chamber regarding our nurses, our teachers, our other front-line services and now our Dublin Fire Brigade. It is not enough to clap our hands in admiration or for those in power to cross their fingers and hope that inadequate resources will not result in disaster. This is an important and urgent motion. Perhaps it is fitting that it is being debated today when Storm Barra is causing havoc for the emergency services that are keeping the public safe, including the Dublin Fire Brigade despite its years-long staffing shortage, exhaustion and low morale. Last night, Dublin Fire Brigade rescued a person who had taken shelter in a tower crane after spotting the person with a thermal imaging camera. Retirement numbers are adding further strain to the staffing situation. The balance between retirements and recruitment is out of whack. Only 36 recruits have joined the Dublin Fire Brigade this year. The Minister has addressed this issue, so I will change my point. Yesterday marked the retirement of a firefighter from the service. I wish Mr. Stephen Dillon the best in his retirement. While the Dublin Fire Brigade's staffing has been an issue for several years, Covid has exacerbated the situation. That is a phrase that we often use in the Chamber, but I will provide an example to outline the extent of the problem. On 22 November, 49 Dublin Fire Brigade staff were unavailable to work due to testing positive, being a close contact or awaiting a test result. That loss of staff was critical, particularly given that the brigade was already operating at below operational levels. It also meant that critical fire appliances were off the road due to crews being short-staffed. This was an issue even before the pandemic. In July 2019, it was revealed that 23 fire appliances were off the road over the course of seven days. Crews were short a combined 161 personnel. This has been a constant issue, with reports of 20% of appliances being out of use most weeks. Every day, the people we trust in an emergency are going out concerned not only for their ability to work and keep people safe, but for their own safety. We are plugging the gap with overtime, but that cannot be maintained and is having a detrimental effect on the well-being and health of personnel. We must listen to the very people who manage risk and assess dangerous situations every day when they tell us that there is a problem. I welcome the call on the Government to ensure that all firefighters and officers are fully trained to manage high-rise fires. There is not the staffing, training or equipment required to ensure that fires in tall building blocks are dealt with adequately. There has been little increase in the provision of high-reach fire appliances despite the city having grown considerably and there is a clear disconnect between the strategic housing development scheme granting numerous planning permissions for high-rise apartment blocks and the Dublin Fire Brigade's training. International best practice is needed when ladders cannot reach. Our firefighters know the techniques to best manage the fire inside. Fighting fires in high-rise buildings requires different techniques and training. It is not something that a firefighter should have to learn in the moment when dealing with an emergency. This is not something that can be learned on the job. While new height training modules are available, they are limited to new recruits and newly promoted officers. We must ensure that this essential training is rolled out to all personnel across the Dublin Fire Brigade. When looking out at Storm Barra raging, I remembered a presentation that the Dublin Fire Brigade gave to Dublin City Council in October when a similar motion to this one was tabled. It was mentioned that, because it had rained on Halloween night, the firefighters were relieved. They thanked the heavens that it was raining because they did not have the personnel to deal with what would normally have been one of their busiest nights of the year. That firefighters have to look to the sky in order to figure out whether they can do their job is an incredible indictment of the State and something that we need to address. I remember a presentation from the Dublin Fire Brigade on water safety training and water-based rescues while I was on Dublin City Council. Dublin Fire Brigade takes more people out of the water than it does out of burning houses now. It carries out that training either at the end of the Liffey or in Glendalough, which is fed by a spate river. When it rains as it is at the moment, though, there is too much water and the brigade cannot train. During the summer months when it does not rain enough, there is too little water and it cannot train either. We need a Dublin Fire Brigade that is suitable for 21st century rescues, be they in high-rise buildings or on water, and it needs personnel. For all the Dublin Fire Brigade officers whom I have come into contact with, it is a vocation. They do the job because they believe in it. It is a sad indictment of the State that they are now considering industrial action. This is something that we can address, be it in this Chamber or across Dublin's councils, but urgency is required. There is not much in the way of argument in this Chamber because we all agree that the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade are incredible. They need resources. What they need from this Chamber is not just words, but urgency. I hope that the Minister can give them that this evening. I thank the motion's proposer and the Minister.

It is coincidentally a good day for such a discussion in the sense that the hard, dangerous and vital work that is being done by people in the Dublin Fire Brigade and fire brigades across the country is clear to people who are watching the news, social media feeds and so on. How essential that work is is being underlined, and not just in terms of fighting fires. I welcome that the Government is not opposing the motion. That is good. We want the motion to be implemented, though. I fear that the Government has decided, with some good reason, that the best way to avoid controversy on issues in the Dáil is generally to allow motions to pass.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	275	I do not, but this is a general point about how the Government has responded to motions. To people tracking this, it is clear how, six or nine months ago, the Government decided that it did not want pictures of it voting against stuff that people thought was eminently reasonable and it would instead allow those motions to pass. It would not vote against them but it would not necessarily implement them either. I hope that will not be the case in this instance. Not resourcing the fire brigade properly would be a difficult argument to make. I was watching the debate and a point was made by a number of Deputies about the broad public support for the fire brigade. That point is correct and it is right that the brigade has such support. I warn the Government, though, as that broad public support will carry through into broad public support for industrial action if the firefighters feel that is necessary. It will not wane. The public will see that these people, who are putting their lives on the line to protect society day in and day out, feel it is necessary to take industrial action in order to ensure that our fire services are properly resourced and people are safe. That broad public support will continue. This should be extra pressure on the Government to follow through on the motion's acceptance. In the remainder of my time, I will focus on a particular issue that has featured reasonably prominently in this debate, that of high-rise buildings or tall and complex buildings, as firefighters refer to them. It was reported in August by a firefighter, Mr. John Mahon, in speaking to the Dublin Inquirer that the Dublin Fire Brigade did not have the training or equipment it needed to tackle blazes in high-rise buildings. I understand from speaking to fire brigade personnel that there are two issues, those being, training and equipment, by which I mean aerial appliances. Consider the development of Dublin as a city. There is a moderately dense city centre, relatively low-density building as far as the outskirts and, at the outskirts in Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Finglas and around the M50 ring, a proliferation of reasonably high-rise developments of six, seven, eight or nine storeys. That development is accelerating. In some areas, the strategic housing development process, which is thankfully being closed, has been used to drive that. This raises a serious issue if high-rise developments are getting approved and we do not have the equipment and training necessary to ensure that those who will live there are safe.As I understand it, there is very good training available in Dublin Fire Brigade to deal with tall and complex buildings. I also understand that aerial appliances, for example, are not the answer all by themselves, because once you go above a certain height, you are not going to get people out via an aerial appliance and you must get them out through the inside of the building. It is very dangerous and specialised work for which training is required. The point, as I understand it, is that because of the under-resourcing and understaffing of the fire brigade, people are not able to get the training as there is a need to be able to cover the service on a daily basis. Covid has had an extra impact in terms of knocking people out, and then there are not enough people left to be able to facilitate enough people to get the training that needs to be done. We have an under-trained fire service as it stands, although we have people with enormous talents, skills and the capacity to provide the training, but it is not currently happening. The second issue is equipment. The fire at the Glashaus Hotel and apartments in Tallaght a month and a half ago was mentioned. The stories that emerged from that were truly terrifying. People were trapped on their balconies in fear of their lives waiting to be rescued. The amount of time they were trapped on the balconies was prolonged because of the lack of equipment. The balconies were on the fifth and sixth storeys, which was a level where they could be rescued via aerial appliance, and in fact were ultimately rescued by aerial appliance. The reason they had to wait for at least 20 minutes, and some say they waited longer than that, is that the aerial appliance had to be transported from Tara Street to Tallaght. One of the tenants was quoted as saying: "We kept thinking we were going to be burnt to ashes and maybe they would find our bodies hugging each other." I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister and I got an answer saying:Dublin Fire Brigade's fleet of aerial appliances consists of two turntable ladders based at Dublin Fire Brigade Headquarters in Tara Street, and a hydraulic platform based at Dún Laoghaire Fire Station, all of which can be deployed rapidly to anywhere in the functional area of the four local authorities. Does the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, or the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, really think that 20 minutes is an adequate response time for someone who is trapped on a balcony with their home burning behind them and the entire building going up in flames? The Tánaiste agreed with me last week when I asked him about it, as did a firefighter to whom I spoke earlier, that the appliances need to be locally based. Not every area across the city or the country where there is high-rise development will have a specific area for aerial appliances, but they need to be based in areas whereby they can rapidly get to areas when needed. It is not the case that we only have high-rise building at Tara Street and Dún Laoghaire. Action must be taken urgently to ensure that where there are high-rise developments that the aerial appliances that are needed can get there rapidly to save people's lives. We need a commitment from the Government to have that, as well as a commitment to properly resource and staff the firefighting service so that the necessary training can be provided, but also that the appropriate service can be provided at all times.

On a night like tonight when we have a storm, it is appropriate that we are talking about people who are on standby and waiting to help out if there is a need in the case of an emergency arising. They are probably out there taking care of emergencies at the moment. We must reflect on the fire service and what it does right across the country every day of the week. I commend the Department, the Minister and the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, on their support to me in delivering new fire stations across Galway East. I had the honour of officially opening the new fire station in Tuam approximately two years ago. A new site has been located for the fire station in Athenry, the Part 8 planning has been completed, and a detailed design is now being prepared. I hope that will go to tender once approval is given by the Department. A site has also been identified for Loughrea fire station and a design team has been appointed, with the approval of the Department. It is very important to have the infrastructure right. We also have a fine premises in Gort and in Mountbellew, which are all serving the east of the county. The fire service in Galway looks after the city as well as the county. The existing fire service site is not fit for purpose. Galway County Council, in conjunction with Galway City Council and the departmental officials are identifying a site. I am sure the Department will be very supportive of the acquisition of the site to make sure that we can build a fire station that is fit for purpose for the city of Galway and the surrounding areas. We are getting there, from the point of view of infrastructure and buildings and proper state-of-the-art facilities for the firemen that serve us so well. One of the issues that arises has been alluded to in the context of Dublin, but it is not just a Dublin issue. It is the issue of recruitment into the retained firefighters service, which is falling. What is happening is that as people retire, younger people are not coming in. There are several reasons for that. We must try to make the retained firefighter position more attractive and give more recognition for the work. The National Retained Firefighters Association, which looks after the interests of these fine men and women, has been trying to improve the resources to the fire service. Retained firefighters are on call 24-7, 365 days a year with just 28 days off within that time and while they might not be involved all the time, they are on call. That is a big sacrifice for anyone to make, but especially younger people. It is time that we looked at the pay and conditions of retained firefighters. It would not cost an arm and a leg. In future, we should have a situation where all of our fire stations are properly resourced in terms of human resources. We have a difficulty with recruitment. Some fire stations, including Gort, Athenry and Mountbellew, have a shortage of personnel. That is a worrying trend. We talk about giving recognition to the fire service and retained firefighters, and one of the asks of the National Retained Firefighters Association is that we provide a national uniform for the service. This is something we can do that would not cost an arm and a leg but would give them an identity and a sense of purpose. No more than the Garda or the Army, they would be recognised by their uniform. That is a small ask but it is something we should do. When I was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works we had a lot of flooding in 2015 and 2016 and I remember the fire service carrying out Trojan work day and night to keep roads open. It worked in conjunction with Galway County Council. It is something that we take for granted because firefighters are not in the limelight. They are called out to deal with accidents and tough scenarios and they do it as a matter of course. They must be trained and given the necessary resources. Training is important because in the modern digital era we must make sure the fire service is up to speed with modern techniques and that the equipment keeps pace with developments. It is an investment, not a cost. It is an investment in our safety and in people. We must make sure that no more than with the Garda or the Army we have a fire service that we are all proud of and that we can rely on and also have the comfort of knowing that they are happy in what they are doing.They are happy in what they are doing, but people are not going into it because younger people are not attracted to that retained firefighter role due to the commitment that has to be made, and the reward just is not there. I plead with the Minister and the Department to keep up the good work in terms of providing infrastructure and providing the tenders and the equipment that are needed, but also to please look at the human resource element for the fire service nationally, both in Dublin and right across the country. That is where we need to invest time, effort and recognition for what they do.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	277	Our public services face a crisis. They face under-funding, staff shortages and general lack of resources. This has created intolerable working conditions for those who provide essential services and life-saving services. This motion deals with just one element, which is staff shortages and the consequences for Dublin Fire Brigade. I salute the firefighters on their professionalism and dedication to their job and to the citizens of this State, but that must demand respect from the powers that be, who have the responsibility to resource and support these workers. Dublin Fire Brigade is the biggest fire service in the country, with 12 full-time and two part-time stations and with more than 900 staff. However, recent months have seen staff shortages of up to 20%, with up to three quarters of our fire engines taken out of service for periods of time, leaving parts of the city without adequate cover. If the people of the city realised this, they would be angry and shocked. I contacted a SIPTU official, who said these types of shortages have consistently been the case. Dublin Fire Brigade and Dublin City Council management accept there is a staffing shortage issue. The official said SIPTU had called for accelerated recruitment to overtake the issue and that it would bring it to the Workplace Relations Commission to try to secure that. He also said that, unfortunately, Dublin Fire Brigade has refused to commit to the required level of recruitment and has instead tried to leverage concessions by undermining the 2012 Dublin Fire Brigade control room agreement, which provides that Dublin Fire Brigade emergency service controllers would demonstrate fitness at the recruitment stage to progress in due course to firefighter, which most of them aspire to. This is obviously the reason the firefighters feel they are forced into taking industrial action. On one Monday in September, I received an email from SIPTU highlighting the crisis that the firefighters are looking at every day of the week. At 9 p.m. on Tuesday, 28 September 2021, the following engines were off the road due to staff depletion: D81 fire appliance, Rathfarnham; D126 aerial appliance, Dún Laoghaire; D41 fire appliance, North Strand; District Office Delta, district officer, North Strand; D31 fire appliance, Phibsborough; and D101 fire appliance, Tara Street. In addition, the following appliances were manned by one firefighter: D11 fire appliance, Donnybrook; D12 fire appliance, Donnybrook; D121 fire appliance, Dun Laoghaire; D21 fire appliance, Dolphins Barn; D22 fire appliance, Dolphins Barn; D71 fire appliance, Tallaght; and D72 fire appliance, Tallaght. The following appliances were manned by two firefighters: D51 fire appliance, Finglas, with one pump station; and D91 fire appliance, Blanchardstown, with one pump station. He went on to say that following overtime call backs and the contacting of staff on leave, the position at 10.30 p.m. for "off the road" was: D41 fire appliance, North Strand; District Office Delta, district officer, North Strand; D31 fire appliance, Phibsborough; and D101 fire appliance, Tara Street. That is a crisis for these workers. These fire engines cannot be manned so they are not able to go out to fire incidents. However, as I said, despite recognition by Dublin City Council management that there is a staff shortage, it has refused to commit to the required level of recruitment. In June 2018, Fianna Fáil Deputy John Lahart and former Deputy John Curran put forward a motion, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, spoke in that debate to support the motion, which was not opposed under the then confidence and supply arrangement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, said: “We need to make sure that a clear message goes out from the Dáil tomorrow and this evening that Dáil Éireann supports the operation of Dublin Fire Brigade, the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service and the fire-based emergency medical system.” He continued:I spoke with the Minister, Deputy Harris, this evening and I suggested to him that after the planning of this motion I would sit down with him to work on the next steps forward. Our colleagues in Dublin Fire Brigade want to know what will happen next. A motion and debate in the Dáil and ventilation of the issues are good and well but the Fianna Fáil Party and I want to see a roadmap forward to investing in Dublin Fire Brigade. At the moment there should be 133 firefighters and paramedics and 36 officers on duty at all times maintaining front-line fire appliances. However, there were only 129 and 29 officers due to start work last night. There is a deficit in staff and appliances. We need at least another four ambulances within the service and we should be proud of the service that is there.  That was in June 2018, so the Minister has obviously been on top of this issue since then. He had direct contact with the Minister of the time and he was going to put in a plan to bring in more ambulance services and recruitment. I know that Covid hit in 2020 but that was a year and a half after this debate in the Dáil. I would certainly like to see more urgency from the Minister, although I am glad he is not opposing the motion. What I would like to see is that the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage would have a quarterly report from the Minister on recruitment levels and the position on fire appliances, in particular how many have been brought into service in the previous quarter. That type of accountability is going to be important for the future of fire services in Dublin. I ask that the Deputies on that committee would demand that quarterly report so a close eye can be kept on this and there would be transparency as to what exactly is going on in our fire services. This is particularly important around the point on the growth of high-rise apartments and to ensure Dublin Fire Brigade is given the resources and training to fight fires in high-rise buildings. How is that training going to be given to the staff who are there at the moment? As pointed out by other Deputies, these firefighters cannot be released because of the low numbers and they are already in a state of crisis, so how is that going to happen? I urge the committee to ensure that transparency from the Minister every quarter as to where we are in regard to recruitment, appliances and firefighting in high-rise apartments.

I am certainly conscious, as we all are this evening, particularly in light of the storm, of the incredible resource of our emergency services and fire services across the country. We thank them all for the work they are putting in. There has been extraordinary work across the country to keep people safe, to get services up and running and to keep people moving, which is critical. We appreciate all of that. I will try to respond to some of the questions. I listened to the first half of the session with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien. Questions were raised in the early part of the session by Deputy Seán Crowe in regard to staff shortages and equipment. Specifically on that point, the Department has initiated a review of the retained fire services to address training, recruitment and retention issues and, again, to strengthen the services. Deputy Paul Murphy raised a question around high-rise developments, although I will not go into the specific incident that he raised. Dublin Fire Brigade currently has three aerial appliances and one more is due for delivery in January, with one more to be ordered. These are available for response throughout Dublin where and when required. Deputy Seán Canney raised the issue around the fire station in Tuam. I thank him for his comments in regard to the progress that is being made around capital investment, in particular in regard to fire stations.The Deputy made the point that we are getting there in Galway city. He also mentioned the issue of a national uniform and a standard kit. He said that the uniform is not standard across the service and we take that point on board. The other issues raised were taking the fire brigade for granted, training and the modern technology that is an investment and not a cost. Deputy Joan Collins raised the issue of staffing and adequate cover, specifically in Dublin. I know this is putting a focus on all of our fire services throughout the country but I will update the Deputy on the most recent firefighter recruitment campaign. It began in September 2019 and all recent fire brigade recruit training has taken place in the shadow of the pandemic, which has placed considerable additional challenges on the process. The first class of recruits from that campaign began training in April 2020 and have taken up positions across the fire brigade. A second recruit class began training in June 2021 and will finish this December with 36 recruits taking up positions. A third recruit class of 45 will begin training early in February 2022 and provision has been made within Dublin City Council's budget for a fourth and final class of recruits from the remaining panel later in 2022. On staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, Dublin City Council as the employer has engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies Fórsa and SIPTU and the WRC. The issues under consideration include: manning levels; staff numbers; the role of operational intelligence risk assessment; implementation of efficiencies in the operation of special appliances; recruitment; and the schedule of recruitment to ensure staffing level continuity. Those are just quick responses to the issues raised by Deputies since I took over this part of the debate. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, and I would like to thank all of the Deputies for raising these issues. We have heard the concerns of Deputies raised this evening but it is important to put it all into context. No one can or would deny that Dublin Fire Brigade provides an invaluable fire, rescue and ambulance service for the greater Dublin area and there is no doubt that the service saves countless lives, as well as preventing damage to residential and commercial property daily. Dublin Fire Brigade, which is part of Dublin City Council, provides fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authority areas: Dublin City Council; Fingal County Council; South Dublin County Council; and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. It also provides an ambulance service in these areas for the HSE on an agency basis. Dubliners are undoubtedly proud of the men and women who provide these services to nearly 1.5 million people across an area of 356 square miles and at a time of risk to their own lives in doing so. As we have discussed, it is true that the Covid pandemic has presented huge challenges in recruitment and training of new staff, resulting in staffing shortages in recent times. However, my Department and Dublin City Council are actively engaged in working to address the situation. I have outlined the current recruitment drive and processes that have taken place to date. As my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, has already stated, firefighters and paramedics are not just hired; there is also an extensive recruitment and training process to follow before suitable candidates are appointed and this takes time. Dublin Fire Brigade management is following this process. I would like to again emphasise that much is going on in the background. Dublin City Council, as the employer, has been engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies Fórsa and SIPTU, as well as with the WRC. I am glad to say there has been some progress in a number of areas, some of which will alleviate pressures caused by current staffing arrangements. Unfortunately, no final agreement has been reached. I call for all parties to re-engage with the process as a matter of urgency and to use the industrial relations machinery that are in place. Everyone wants a positive resolution that is acceptable to all stakeholders and we want it as quickly as possible. While local authorities, as the provider and employer of fire services and their staff, have a yearly budget of €240 million for same, this budget is supplemented by my Department’s fire services capital programme. This provides for investment in: appliances; vehicles; equipment; upgrading of existing stations; and construction of new stations. This Government’s continued support for all fire services is reflected in the most recent fire services capital programme, which will see an investment of €61 million between 2021 and 2025. Nationally we will see: six new fire stations built; continued support for the construction of a further 12 new stations already under construction; nine fire station refurbishments; and the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In previous programmes in 2015 and 2017, Dublin Fire Brigade saw the delivery of six appliances at an approximate cost of €2 million. It will continue to benefit from my Department’s capital programme with a current allocation of six new vehicles. Sanction has also been given for the purchase of a new turntable ladder at a cost of €850,000. New vehicles have been sanctioned and are being ordered, specced, built and delivered. As importantly, as officials from my Department are actively engaging with Dublin Fire Brigade management on the strategic development of fire service infrastructure going into the future, discussions include the upgrading of existing stations and new station proposals. My Department is always available to consider additional proposals as they may arise. Training has also been raised as a point of concern by many Deputies. The issue of recruitment and training of new recruits has already been addressed by the Minister. I would like to reiterate that the national director for fire emergency management, NDFEM, in my Department provides a central training programme that supports all fire services, including Dublin Fire Brigade. The annual programme of courses for the fire services officers and firefighters supports the ability of fire authorities to deliver efficient and effective fire and rescue services. The NDFEM also supports fire service delivery through the preparation of appropriate standards and guidance on the management of a large range of fire services and operational activities, including fighting fires in high-rise buildings. A key element over the last decade has been the preparation and circulation of standard operational guidance; a suite of 47 documents developed between 2010 and 2012 by fire service personnel and issued by the NDFEM to all local authorities for consideration and adoption. The NDFEM programme complements Dublin Fire Brigade’s training programmes, which take place in its training centre, the O’Brien Institute and other venues. As high-rise firefighting has been raised by a number of Deputies, I should mention that high-rise training modules have been delivered to all new recruits and newly promoted officers within Dublin Fire Brigade. The programme is being assessed for sign-off for broader upskilling of all officers and firefighters as soon as possible. The Department, my colleague, the Minister, and I, remain committed to an invested in and supported Dublin Fire Brigade. We will continue to work with all parties in an effort to resolve the outstanding issues and support ongoing initiatives. We cannot praise Dublin Fire Brigade and our fire services across the country enough for their collaborative efforts with other emergency services throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. As I said at the outset, we deeply appreciate the dedication, skill and courage of our fire services in today’s response to Storm Barra.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	279	In 2005 firefighters in Bray staged a walkout from the fire station in Bray, arising from concerns regarding the condition of the retained service in Wicklow. As a county councillor at the time I spoke to them, and I was the only public representative to do so. The walkout was led by sub-officer Brian Murray. They outlined a litany of issues within the service that were impacting their ability to do their jobs. Call vetting, recruitment and retention and underinvestment in the retained service were but a few of the issues raised. Brian told me at the time that someone would die unless the issues they were highlighting were addressed. Two years later, on 26 September 2007, sub-officer Brian Murray and firefighter Mark O’Shaughnessy lost their lives in the line of duty. They died protecting their community but they died because of the systematic failures within a service that is not fit for purpose. Here we are 14 years after Brian and Mark’s deaths and things in the retained service are as bad if not worse. During a recent conference of the chief fire officers, the retained fire service was described as not being fit for purpose and I agree. There have been instances where fire services have been unable to respond to emergencies due to a shortage of firefighters and in other instances some fire stations have been forced to close. Firefighters are on call 24-7 and 365 days of the year and many simply cannot take time off due to a shortage of personnel.In County Clare, for example, 24 firefighters have been recruited since 2016 but 16 have already left the service and this is being replicated right across the State within the retained service. Bray fire station which serves a population of over 35,000 should be a two-pump station but for the last five years it has been reduced to a one-pump station, with Greystones providing backup. This has obvious knock-on implications for Greystones and the wider area. Necessity demands that Bray be a full-time service but because the local authority is unable to fund it, this simply has not happened. Fire services are being delivered on the basis of a local authority budget as opposed to a risk assessment.  Recently the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management approved a proposal for undertaking a review of the model of local authority retained service delivery. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, informed me that the objective of this review is to explore and understand the issues impacting service delivery, to undertake research and analysis, and to propose options which will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future. The model used for the retained fire service is the root cause of many of the difficulties in the service. I have long advocated for the creation of a national fire authority in line with one of the key recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks report of 2002 and this should also be included in the review which is being rolled out by the Department. As many would say, there are simply too many chiefs and not enough firefighters in the service. There are many issues within the fire service but the failure to address the issues of recruitment and retention is literally a matter of life and death. I do not want to see the death or injury of another firefighter or member of the public in Wicklow or anywhere else in this State due to the failure to address the serious issues within the service. If the issue of staffing levels is not addressed, the Government is endangering the welfare of firefighters and the public throughout the State. The aforementioned review must not be a whitewash either. It must look at all of the issues including the structures within the retained service. The Minister must also commit to publishing the final report once complete and to fully implementing any findings to ensure that we have a retained service that is fit for purpose and fit for the 21st century.
#PaulDonnelly	unknown-#PaulDonnelly-party	unknown-#PaulDonnelly-dob	unknown-#PaulDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	280	I thank my party colleagues and other Deputies for their support for this motion. I welcome the Minister's acceptance of the motion and acknowledge the passion he expressed for Dublin Fire Brigade. However, as fire officers have continuously said to me in the course of meetings with them in recent weeks, they want support now. They do not have very much confidence in anyone to deliver at the moment. They want to see something happen for them. On the sum of €61 million in capital funding, I believe that is for the fire services in the entire State, including Dublin Fire Brigade and the retained fire services, but it is my understanding that the chief fire officer has said that he needs €80 million for Dublin alone. We can clearly see the disparity between what is required for a modern fire service and what is being provided. When we are throwing figures around, we must be clear and concise about the impact these sums will have. I wish to focus on a number of issues that I did not have time to deal with earlier, including the growing population in Dublin city and county and the height and scale of buildings, which others have raised. When firefighters told me recently about the engines they were using, to say I was dumbfounded is not an exaggeration. If the people of Dublin really knew of the condition and age of the equipment being used by firefighters they would be genuinely shocked. I have been told that Dublin fire brigade has 21 engines and as has been confirmed in the House, the chief fire officer has committed to the provision of four new engines, two before Christmas and two after. A lot of the current stock is between 15 and 17 years old, with 2003, 2004 and 2005 engines that have over 200,000 km on their clocks. It is unbelievable that some of the most highly qualified and professional firefighters in the world are expected to carry out their role in such old trucks. Taxi drivers are not allowed to operate in cars that are more than ten years old and yet we expect fire officers to work with engines that are 15 or 16 years old. I have been informed that although four new engines are on the way, some of the equipment that is coming into the country is already five or six years old. We are getting the cast-offs of some other fire services. How can the Department justify not giving such a vital service the funding required so that firefighters can carry out their job safely and effectively? The Minister spoke about the amount of funding being provided but if it is not sufficient to cover what is required then it is not enough.  Every organisation needs a strategic plan that is based on the needs of the service that is being provided to the community but it is clear that there is no such signed-off, strategic plan as required under section 26 of the Fire Services Act 1981. I am concerned about the timelines for the development of the fire service, especially in terms of the growth of Dublin Fire Brigade. The chief fire officer has mentioned certain capital projects which will be delivered in eight to ten years but that is not sufficient for Dublin. The city and county is growing as we speak and has been for the last 30 years. I live in Dublin West. There is a fire station in Coolmine, around the corner from my house, which has one fire engine, one fire officer and seven staff, including two Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance paramedics as part of the team, serving a population of over 110,000 people. In the next number of years, that population will grow to 140,000. There are 50,000 people working in the industrial units in Ballycoolin and Tyrrelstown. Is that sufficient? Absolutely not. Do we need another engine in that fire station? Yes, without a shadow of a doubt. Adamstown has already been mentioned. It has been on the map since 2020 and still there is no fire station. The most incredible example is in North Strand. A Portakabin was delivered for the additional staff that were hired and they were told they would have a new fire station in two years. How many years ago was that? It was 13 years ago. Staff were told 13 years ago that a temporary Portakabin would be in situ for two years and then they would have a new station.  When I listen to fire officers, what I hear is complete and utter frustration and a lack of trust in what is being said to them by the Government, the chief fire officer and Dublin City Council. Everybody has given a clear outline of exactly what is required from the Government, Dublin City Council and the chief fire officer. I urge the Government and all of those with the power, authority and funding to listen to the workers. They are the people we asked to go out onto the front line today. When the rest of us were told to stay at home, we asked them to go out. During the pandemic, we are asked to work from home and they are asked to go out and put their lives at risk. They do not want applause; they want to be respected.

It is a huge drop on the period from 2007 to 2013, considering the very important role played by LEADER. I ask the Minister to make a statement on what has been announced thus far.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	282	The Government clearly recognises the vital role that LEADER plays in delivering impactful rural development projects at local level and it will continue to support investment in rural Ireland. In the 2014-20 CAP programming period, €250 million was allocated to LEADER. For the seven-year programming period from 2021 to 2027, this funding allocation will be maintained. It is comprised of €70 million provided for the transitional period from 2021 to 2022, and the recently announced indicative allocation of €180 million for the period 2023 to 2027. The maintenance of the €250 million funding from the 2014-20 period is evidence of the Government's continued support for the LEADER programme. Any discussion of rural development investment must also take account of the record levels of investment in recent years. A range of schemes have been implemented in recent years, such as the rural regeneration and development fund, the town and village renewal scheme, the walks scheme, and the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme.  Budget 2022 also saw increases secured across all my Department's rural schemes and the national development plan, NDP, outlines a clear commitment to a continuation of investment in rural Ireland as a matter of priority. Capital funding allocations for my Department have seen an increase from €88 million in 2018 to €205 million in 2025 under the NDP. This increased funding will help to deliver on the range of actions for our rural communities into the future as set out in the Government’s ambitious rural development policy, Our Rural Future.

It is seeking a budget of €389 million for the LEADER programme. It is coming at this issue based on the commitments that were made in Our Rural Future. I do not think it is good enough that we should stand still. I appreciate the Minister's point that by adding the transitional fund period to the period from 2023 to 2027, we will reaching that €250 million figure, similar to the 2014-2020 level. However, it is a much reduced budget from the level reached from 2007 to 2013. For instance, my native county of Roscommon got over €11 million in the CAP period from 2007 to 2013. Looking at the indicative budget for the period from 2023 to 2027, it is looking at €6 million. The budget announced from the CAP is much less for that period if you take the transitional period out of the scenario. That will have an impact on counties such as Roscommon and Galway in particular.

It was a very positive engagement and gave me a good opportunity to hear a lot of what they had to say directly and to allow them to outline to me the really good work they are carrying out in their areas. Martina Earley, from the Roscommon LEADER Partnership in the Deputy's neck of the woods, outlined to me the different issues she had, as well as the great work they are doing down there. In fairness, there is confusion about this LEADER budget but the one thing I am certain about is there is absolutely no cut to funding. The previous LEADER programme from 2014 to 2020 had funding of €250 million. That is plain to be seen. The programme from 2021 to 2027 has a total of €250 million, that is, €70 million of transitional funding and €180 million in funding for the period from 2023 to 2027.

It represents massive amounts of funding for enterprise and boosting tourism. They have done a lot for the county, as have partnerships across the State. LEADER, in particular, has a really important role to play. The Minister is probably aware of an issue that has arisen in a number of counties whereby for that transitional period, funding is almost gone or has been allocated for this year and they have no funding left for next year. That is an issue. We need to look at the level of funding the Government is putting up in relation to the CAP fund. It is not enough to stand still at the €250 million allocation from 2021 to 2027. We have to consider that it is a huge drop from that 2007 to 2013 period when we were looking at an allocation of €425 million. I gave the example of Roscommon. There is a big difference between €11 million and €6 million over the fairly lengthy period covered by this LEADER programme. I ask that the Minister, at the very least, looks at the ILDN proposal.

The 2014 to 2022 allocation was €250 million and this programme is also worth €250 million. The €70 million transition programme is over two years, that is, this year and next year. It would be fair to say you would expect to have around 50% of that already spent. According to our records, we have approvals of €16 million, which really only represents about 33% of the budget. Some of the LEADER companies are performing very well in getting their money out and others are not doing so well at all. The Deputy's native county of Roscommon has a project allocation of €1.9 million over the two-year period. It has €667,000 worth of approvals, which accounts for 24%. County Kilkenny has €1.7 million in project allocation funding, for instance. It has approvals of €270,000. It has only about 15.69% of its funding allocated. I think, to be fair, there is sufficient money there currently.

Is the €6 million fund sufficient to cover the need of local authority and non-local authority-run centres? I am concerned about local authority and non-local authority community centres. The former already have a substantial stream from the local authorities themselves.
#JoeOBrien	unknown-#JoeOBrien-party	unknown-#JoeOBrien-dob	unknown-#JoeOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	288	First, I wish to acknowledge the importance of community centres. They are the cornerstone of community life in many places around the country. As the Deputy is aware, a new capital fund for the upgrade of community centres featured in the national development plan and funding of €5 million has been secured for this under budget 2022. This is consistent with the programme for Government commitment to establish a small capital grants scheme for the maintenance, improvement and upkeep of community centres. The details of this capital scheme are currently being developed within the Department. While details are yet to be finalised, it is likely that community centres in urban and rural areas will be eligible and that the types of work that will be eligible will include works to address safety concerns, works to improve disability access, works to improve communal facilities such as kitchens and toilets, as well as energy retrofitting. The scheme will be launched in early 2022 and further details will be announced in due course. Separately, my Department has a number of schemes that are relevant to community centres such as the community enhancement programme. The programme in 2021 provided €4.5 million in funding for small capital grants for the improvement of facilities and it will be available again in 2022.  More recently and more substantially, I recently launched the community activities fund to support community and voluntary groups impacted by Covid-19. This fund will help community groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs such as utility or insurance bills, as well as with improvements to their facilities.
#PaulDonnelly	unknown-#PaulDonnelly-party	unknown-#PaulDonnelly-dob	unknown-#PaulDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	289	I thank the Minister of State. I am sure he is tired of being spoken to about Hartstown Community Centre, which is close to my heart. We have been passionately trying to help and support it. Unfortunately, it recently endured another crisis, with an inspection from Tusla leading to another really difficult and stressful time for the voluntary board of management. Unfortunately, the management needs a massive investment of funding in the centre to turn it into a modern community centre. The existing funding is very welcome and helpful in keeping the centre ticking over. However, community centres not owned by a local authority do not get the same level of funding. For example, if this situation were happening in a local authority community centre in the next community - and there is one there - funding would have been secured and the problem sorted out by now. It is unfair that because the diocese and the community took on board the management, running, ownership and so on of Hartstown Community Centre, it is again being left with very small amounts of funding when it needs a massive injection of it.

That needs to be allocated before the end of February but it can be spent until the end of August next year. That is a substantial amount. It is in the area of small grants but they have an impact as well. The criteria for the new programme are being worked on at the moment. We would be slow to make it exclusive because there are always unusual situations arising, even with local authority centres. The criteria are being developed at the moment. As I mentioned, the community enhancement programme in Fingal is worth €150,000 this year as well. I take the Deputy's point on the scale of funding that is needed. The Minister is committed to growing the size of the fund as well.
#PaulDonnelly	unknown-#PaulDonnelly-party	unknown-#PaulDonnelly-dob	unknown-#PaulDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	291	I was hoping to hear something on substantial amounts of funding but also on the other aspect of this, because it is an extremely important point, which I will make again. Local authorities have substantial funding. For example, Fingal County Council, which is one of the wealthiest local authorities in the State, has substantial funding and is able to utilise that funding, as well as borrowing and so on, for capital funding for its own local authority community centres. I have seen it. Those centres do fantastic work and I have no issue with that and have supported it 100% of the way. However, we have centres that are not owned by local authorities. Maybe they are owned by a diocese or a local community group that came together. They are all over the place but the one I know best is the one in Hartstown. That centre does not have access to those types of funding streams, to borrowing or to any of the different measures that are in place for local authorities. I urge that this €5 million be allocated exclusively for centres that are not owned by local authorities. I hope the Minister and Minister of State will consider doing so in future.

There will be exceptions in other parts of the country as well. Community centres start up in a variety of different ways. They all have very different sorts of life paths with respect to how they started and how the initial funding became a reality as well. It is fair to say the majority of community centres around the country are not owned or run by a local authority. They have often come out of parish centres and are connected to sports clubs and other services as well. Broadly speaking, centres that are not owned by local authorities will very much be part of what is targeted by the scheme. I think needs will also be part of the criteria. We obviously want to target the funds where they are needed most. That will be part of the plan going forward. It is a fund we want to grow over time as well.

The build of that plan is a full 12 months behind schedule after only two years of the project. This will have a significant impact on the uptake of remote working across the country. This includes public sector workers, for whom the Government has set a target of having 20% working remotely by the end of the year.

That task force addressed 70 actions between 2016 and 2019. These spanned a mix of practical and policy approaches that have removed significant barriers to the deployment of telecoms services in the State. The previous task force clearly delivered real benefits and impact. There is now more information available to consumers to help them to choose the right service to meet their needs. More people have access to reliable, high-speed broadband than ever before and throughout the country mobile phone coverage has improved dramatically. Building on this changed context, the new task force will concentrate on a number of strategically important and complex issues and will leverage the proactive, practical and co-operative approach taken by its predecessor. We will make use of the expertise and resources available to us to build on past successes. It is intended to convene a meeting of the new task force at the earliest possible date. Together with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, I have written to the key stakeholders who will make up the new task force in order to arrange an initial meeting. To ensure that the new task force has clear momentum from the start, I have also asked the stakeholders to consider a number of strategically important thematic areas that will underpin a detailed work programme. Building on the successful collaborative model of the previous task force, this work programme will be finalised on foot of this consultation. It is intended that the new task force's work programme will include actions to address issues such as outdoor mobile coverage, planning and licensing issues, asset mapping and access to infrastructure. I look forward to convening the first meeting of the new task force shortly.

I welcome the fact this task force is being re-established. I am deeply disappointed it did not sit for the two years since the signing of the national broadband plan contract. In that time we have seen ongoing delays in engaging with local authorities, CIÉ and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII. These are all problems the contractor has had with getting access to infrastructure. Does the Minister not agree that if the task force had not been put in abeyance and had been actively engaging with those bodies over the last two years we would not now be 12 months behind schedule and would not have 75,000 families who will not get their broadband on time?

They were in contact with the service providers and there was much good work done on the ground. As I said, 70 actions were completed. That collaboration still takes place today. The last task force completed its work programme at the end of 2019. At that stage plans for a reformatted task force were well advanced but were very much of their time. Since then a new Government has been formed, the national broadband roll-out has started, Covid-19 has arrived and the priorities of all involved in the telecoms sector have quite rightly changed. As important as the strategic work of the task force has been and will be, the focus of the Government and the telecoms sector has had to pivot dramatically in the last two years to provide immediate solutions to the challenges that face us all. Task force members were at the centre of those immediate solutions and made excellent use of the lines of communication established by the task force. They continue to use those and to apply the proactive and collaborative approach.

Surely, one of the first things that should have been done was to re-establish the task force rather than considering it 18 months down the road. I have a suggestion for the Minister for inclusion on the work programme. As she knows, as National Broadband Ireland delivers fibre broadband to homes, families will come off wireless services. That will provide an opportunity to improve the quality of wireless services to families who are further from the deployment areas. There is a problem with the physical coverage of those wireless services. There is an opportunity to improve coverage if local authorities and State agencies provide sites to these wireless operators, but it is key those sites are provided free of charge. We are talking about services that will have a very short lifespan. It is important that, first, local authorities provide the sites and, second, they do not look at this as a cash cow but as a way of facilitating delivery of wireless services pending the completion of the fibre build.

The following broad areas are within the scope of discussion: permits, consents and planning permission, mapping and register of assets, geographic mobile coverage, consumer information and innovation, and proof of concept projects. Working with the broadband officers' role, which was something the original task force outlined, my Department has provided more than €6 million to local authorities to support the continued employment of 31 broadband officers. Since then, they have repeatedly proved the value of their appointments and have been the driving force behind a number of projects and initiatives, including supporting broadband connection points, which have been invaluable in areas where there is poor broadband.

I have heard the Minister's responses this evening and last week and have received her written response regarding the six-year tranche of funding of €250 million, about which she is quite correct. This level of funding, however, is at a standstill compared with the previous funding period and is a cut of more than 40% from the 2007 allocations. Taking inflation into account, the cut is 50%. Will the Minister revisit this?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	302	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. As she will be aware, the LEADER programme is one of the key interventions of Our Rural Future, the Government’s policy for rural development launched earlier this year. An indicative budget of €180 million was recently announced for the LEADER programme for the period 2023 to 2027. When taken together with the €70 million already provided for 2021 and 2022 under the transitional LEADER programme, a total of €250 million will be made available, thus maintaining the level of funding provided for the 2014 to 2020 programme period. The maintenance of the €250 million funding allocation will underpin the continued contribution of the LEADER approach in delivering on the Government’s vision for rural Ireland. Preparations for the design and delivery of the next LEADER programme from 2023 to 2027 are well under way. My Department has commissioned an independent review of the current programme, which is nearing completion. This review will draw on the experience of all stakeholders in the 2014 to 2020 LEADER programme and help to underpin effective scheme design for the new LEADER programme. My officials are also engaging with stakeholders on an ongoing basis regarding the design of the next LEADER programme. They are also working closely with colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the EU Commission in developing the next CAP strategic plan from 2023 to 2027, of which LEADER will form part. The ongoing engagement and consultation with stakeholders, combined with the funding allocation indicated, will ensure the LEADER programme from 2023 will continue to support and further develop our rural communities and businesses. It is important to say there is unprecedented investment in rural Ireland through all our other schemes. When comparing different periods, if you go back to 2007 to 2013, we did not have all these other funding schemes we now have that are providing investment in rural Ireland.

It is unique. As an MEP, I was proud to see an EU Court of Auditors report in 2010 stating the Irish model was best practice. What has happened since then is we have significantly minimised the active role of the local community in the context of decision-making regarding funding decisions for LEADER, with the exception of a few independent LEADER companies, and we have cut the funding. I agree with the Minister on the funding figures but in my constituency the reality is, if we take inflation into account, which is not high at only 10% since 2007, there is a 28% cut in Sligo and Roscommon and a 47% cut in Leitrim since 2007. Yes, Leitrim Development Company, Roscommon LEADER Partnership and Sligo LEADER Partnership do great work, but these cuts mean they have to cut back on supports and resources for their local communities.

That is no longer the case. We have a whole swathe of funding streams to support rural communities. In my Department, we have the rural regeneration and development fund, the town and village renewal scheme and the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme. Many of those schemes offer higher grant aid than that available under LEADER. We also have specific funding streams to support social enterprises. Only yesterday, I was pleased to announce funding for more than 200 social enterprise projects. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment runs the regional enterprise development fund. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has a range of schemes to support climate action. LEADER complements all those programmes but it would be wrong to try to portray that it was the only support for rural communities, which the Deputy will acknowledge. The €70 million transition funding will be over two years. A number of allocations have been made from it, but an average of 33% has been allocated to date out of that €70 million.

LEADER is not the only show in town but it is the only one that is community led. I will come back to what the Minister asks LEADER companies to deliver in their transition programmes. The Minister asks them to support rural business, especially in the context of innovation, diversification, Covid and Brexit. That is crucial in Border counties. LEADER companies are asked to look at ensuring adequate resources not just for the companies themselves but for the LEADER companies that will develop and deliver those programmes. The Minister asks that they support innovative projects in the areas of climate change and the green economy and, quite rightly, that they maximise the potential of the digital economy, all of which are excellent initiatives. I again ask the Minister to look at the level of resources provided and to please ensure a sustainable, effective and adequately funded LEADER programme.

LEADER complements all the other funding programmes. It is about people working together. That is where we get the results. The Deputy mentioned the Border. Not alone do we have the regional enterprise development fund, we have the Border enterprise development fund, which is specifically for the Border region because of the impacts of Brexit. That is run by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The local enterprise offices do great work with businesses. We want to see joined-up thinking between LEADER, the local authorities, the local enterprise offices, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, who should all work together. At the end of the day, we want to see more jobs and more investment through different schemes in rural Ireland. Sligo local action group, LAG, which was mentioned by the Deputy, was allocated €2.2 million under the transitional programme, of which nearly €1.7 million will be allocated for new projects. To date, Sligo LAG has allocated approximately 29% or almost €500,000. To be fair, we are halfway through this, so we would like to see it at the 50% mark towards the end of this year, but it is doing okay at 29%, which is about the average. Some LEADER programmes are looking for more money but have only spent a fraction of what they have got already.

My Department continues to support the development of remote working hubs throughout the country. Our Rural Future commits to investing significantly in remote working facilities and to examining the potential to introduce specific incentives to encourage remote workers to relocate to rural areas, as part of budget 2022. I have instructed my officials to examine options for such an incentive mechanism, building on the connected hubs network, in particular. It is critical this is done in the right and responsible way and a number of approaches are currently under consideration. To date, more than €83 million has been provided by my Department, through various funding streams, to support the development of digital hubs and remote working facilities. The rural regeneration and development fund and the town and village renewal scheme both support the establishment of digital hubs. Under this year's schemes, projects that bring vacant properties in town centres back into use as remote working hubs or repurposed existing community or publicly owned buildings in town and village centres to facilitate remote working were eligible for funding. My Department also supports the development of the connected hubs network, found at connectedhubs.ie. Some 170 hubs are live on the platform, with this number growing every week. Earlier this year, I also awarded almost €9 million in funding through the connected hubs funding stream to further support hubs throughout the country. The development of a national hubs network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the development of remote working hubs, in recognition of the vital role they can play in our post-Covid recovery. I absolutely believe in remote working or, connected working, as I prefer to call it. It is a game changer for rural Ireland. Before the pandemic, remote working was just a concept or an aspiration. Now, because of Covid, it is an everyday working reality for thousands of workers. I want to support people who want to live and work in their own community. Obviously, the public health advice is again that if one can work from home, one should. However, there are huge opportunities here for regional development. Many major multinational companies have told their staff they can work remotely for the long term and that is very positive. I know there is one multinational in the Deputy's county of Cork. A huge part of its workforce is working remotely and that is part of its policy. That is the way forward and we in the Department want to support this. There are many benefits, across the board, to remote working. We know them all. People live and work in their locality. It enables young people to avail of cheaper house prices in the country and less time spent commuting, which is also good for the environment. The reality is if one is an office worker and has good phone and broadband coverage, which is guaranteed in these remote working spaces, one can do the same job. I will be a bit parochial here - one can do the same job in Ballybay as in Ballsbridge. We need to seize the momentum around remote working. My Department is investing in the development of remote working hubs through schemes such as the €1 billion rural regeneration and development fund, the town and village renewal scheme and the connected hubs fund. As the Deputy knows, there are plenty of examples of old buildings in our town centres that can be renovated and used as hubs. There are a number of investments in north-west Cork. There is the gteic i mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh, which got €30,000 for the connected hubs funding there. Macroom enterprise centre got €68,000 and that is just to name a couple. Of course, the digital innovation hubs strategy was in the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, for Cork, of €206,000 and in Skibereen, the Ludgate Hub, with which I know Deputy Moynihan is very familiar, got €152,000. We used some of that funding to help kit out their premises, buy furniture and improve their facilities. I am on the same page as the Deputy in that I am absolutely committed to remote working.

Remote working will be a big part of the rural future. Having people working locally, rather than having to travel as much, offers a great deal of opportunity to communities. I acknowledge that a number of significant works are under way in our area, such as in Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh, Coláiste Íosagáin i mBaile Bhuirne, Achadh Bolg, Castletown and Aubane. I will draw the Minister's attention to the fact many community groups are not able to raise their own funding to take on some of the schemes. In some places, it will be a private enterprise in smaller communities. Indeed, there may not even be a public building, beyond the school, in some smaller communities. There should be some way in which those private enterprises would be able to access funding, whether it is the publican or the vacant shop owner on the main street, to make those facilities available for their rural communities. They will not be profit generating, but in many communities, they are the only available buildings and real option. They should be able to access funding, as well. What approaches are under consideration and do the likes of those smaller communities and private operators have an opportunity?

We have seen it during the pandemic. I am thinking of Dungarvan, Lismore and west Waterford, where people had the opportunity to move down. These three questions are complementary. It was interesting to see them grouped. Deputy Ó Muimhneacháin is asking about the roll-out of the technology. Deputy Dillon is asking about the buildings and the physical infrastructure. I am asking about the people. How do we entice people to move down the country or how do we make it easier for them to make that decision? What kinds of nudges can we put in place? Portugal put in place quite an interesting scheme called the work inland programme, where a grant of up to €4,800 was made available to people who wanted to change from the larger cities and move down to work. I wonder whether we have sufficient supports in place for companies, in the same way, to make it available and attractive to them to allow their employees to engage in remote or blended working in order that we see those people we need to see moving down the country.

It was great to have the Minister in Swinford last May, where she saw, first hand, the remodelling of the old courthouse into the new DigiWest hub.Many towns and villages in Mayo are working to achieve similar outcomes to what was done in Swinford. In places like Balla, Partry, Bohola, Ballycastle, Ballycroy, Belmullet and Louisburgh we have rural communities who are eager to embark on projects through the town and village renewal scheme to ensure they fully capitalise on giving people the option to remote or co-work in their area. It would be useful if the Minister provided an outline on how communities can access funding for any plans they may have to get more out of these projects coming online as quickly as possible.

Budget 2022 provides my Department with a funding allocation of €376 million, an increase of €35 million, or 10% on budget 2021, in recognition of the critical role my Department plays in delivering on Our Rural Future. We are considering a number of options, including the use of the connected hubs network, which now includes more than 170 hubs. Research that the Western Development Commission and NUIG have published on remote working in Ireland through the pandemic indicates a significant number of people have already moved to the west. My ambition is that any incentive introduced by my Department creates new reasons to move north, south or west and does not simply reinforce existing mobility drivers. There is an initiative I am working on with the vintners, namely, the hub in the pub. Covid has left things slower than we hoped but I am working with them on that initiative, which will look at converting pubs during the day to other purposes, such as, if high speed broadband is available, to accommodate remote working.

In some smaller communities, there are no public buildings other than the school. I note what the Minister said about the pub option and repurposing buildings is a very real option because in many communities a shop and a pub might be the only public buildings aside from the school. On the main streets of towns there are many vacant buildings and they should be an option as well. It would add greatly to our towns and villages. Will the Minister outline that the towns and villages will have the opportunity to access those schemes and do away with the vacancies we see in so many towns and villages?

As well as giving nudges to workers to move down the country, which is vital, the Irish word that stands out to me is "fite fuaite", which rolls off the tongue better than "policy coherence". We need individual policy actors to work together. If we look to get people into our rural towns and villages, we have quality of life in spades, but we need housing solutions and, as Deputy Ó Muimhneacháin suggested, we need to tackle vacancy in housing. We need place-making, good quality public realm and services, including good schools, good water infrastructure and good public transport options. The Our Rural Future document goes a long way towards that. I look forward to seeing the town centres first policy document which I know the Department is having input on. We need all these policy objectives to come together to unlock the potential in our rural towns and villages.

I know Our Rural Future aims to expand the town and village renewal scheme as a key enabler in bringing vacant and derelict buildings back into multipurpose spaces and for residential use. I raised the issue of dereliction in our towns and villages at a Topical Issues debate with Deputy Stanton, who is in the Chamber. I note with interest the mention of appointing town regeneration officers, announced as part of budget 2022. It would be useful to have more information on the proposed town regeneration officers and when they are likely to be appointed. Will tackling the scourge of dereliction be part of their role? If so, what resources will be made available to assist them in doing so?

They will work with the different stakeholders to have a clear plan on where towns want to go. They will consult with local communities and work with the people in the town. There are many different funding streams so we need joined-up thinking as to what the overall plan is. The town regeneration officers will get the plan and work with different Departments to make sure they maximise it and the right outcome is there in terms of planning. If one does not plan, one is in bother. We have the €9 million connected hubs funding stream for existing digital hubs and broadband connection points in every region. There are opportunities for private operators to apply for that funding and some of them have done so. The fund is closed at the minute. It has been disbursed but there is more for next year. To communities I would say to work with the local authorities. That is the best place to go because local authorities have been doing good work in consulting with communities and putting in applications, whether for improvement in the town centre or bringing back derelict buildings for 21st-century use. Deputy Dillon is right. I was in Swinford and had a great day there. What they have done to convert that old courthouse into a remote working hub is wonderful.

I suggest we have to scale this up even further to target larger employers who might employ hundreds of people, many of whom travel for many hours every day to cities and so forth when they could work in their own towns. We have, as has been mentioned, community centres and old buildings being repurposed. We need more than that. We need to think big and look at centres that house 100 people or more.

Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025 recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and commits to establishing a comprehensive and integrated network of remote working hubs over the lifetime of the policy to 2025. In May I launched the national connected hubs network, together with the connected hubs platform. The platform offers a suite of booking and hub management applications to members of the network. The national hub network working group, led by my Department, has so far identified and mapped over 460 remote working hubs across the country, of which 170 are live on the platform, with this number growing every week. The national hub network includes a diverse range of hubs, services and facilities, thus facilitating companies of different sizes. To date our focus has been to develop a critical mass of hubs on the connectedhubs.ie platform. The focus will now shift to raising awareness of the network among the relevant stakeholders, including SMEs, business owners and hub users. Work is also ongoing to consult with hub managers across the country in developing the future strategic direction of the network. A significant number of initiatives will be developed through the network, including supporting collective engagement between connected hubs and large-scale employers and between connected hubs and Government agencies and supporting collaborative projects in the network to drive economies of scale. The development of a national hubs network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the development of a comprehensive and integrated network of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role they can play in our post-Covid recovery.If there is need for a particular type of hub for a particular type of business, we can accommodate it.

I particularly thank her for recognising the need of large-scale employers and the workers in those operations. Has a national survey been undertaken with respect to the need for hubs across the country? Are there areas where there are no hubs? Has the Minister consulted with her colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, with regard to third-level outreach? Does she agree that it is possible for universities and technological universities to outreach into towns and villages rather than have students travelling every day into those centres? If large-scale buildings are needed, is there a way of providing comfort to individuals who might wish to put such facilities in place, which will need large investment as well?

It is important that we look at this from the different approaches. Many local authorities have made applications for funding under the town and village renewal scheme and the rural regeneration and development fund for the conversion of old buildings. There are many examples of them throughout the country. I have visited a number of them, where there are top-class remote working facilities. The private sector has come in there as well in terms of provision. The Deputy mentioned third-level outreach. Students experiencing poor broadband in their homes have been able to use the broadband connection points. We are keen to expand this to community halls in different parts of the country where broadband service is poor. Broadband is available in our libraries as well, which some students have availed of. That is a good way to combine it as well. We are unlimited in what we can do to facilitate people to work and study in rural Ireland.

A number of Departments can contribute to this. I welcome her remarks with regard to students. Can we go beyond facilitating students to link up to lectures and so forth and allow for research and development to take place? Collaboration, innovation and so forth can occur in such hubs if they are of a scale that can facilitate such movement.

For some parts, there may be a research and development element. It is a matter for particular areas as to whether they want to go down that road. The regional enterprise development fund has supported a number of centres that could facilitate research and development. There is another area we can capitalise on, namely, ehealth. As the Deputy and I know, many people will wait some time for a hospital appointment with a consultant and when they get to that appointment the consultant might not even lift a stethoscope or examine them; he or she will just look at them and talk to them. There is no reason those same people cannot attend an ehealth hub within their community for such an appointment. I visited such a hub in Scotstown, County Monaghan two weeks ago. Everything is in place such that the doctor can engage remotely with the patient and decide at that point whether there is need for an in-person appointment. Much of that consultation is a conversation. There is no reason we cannot do that remotely as well.

My concern relates to the need for the upkeep and enhancement of community centres. I note that she has touched on this earlier but there are additional strains out there now such that over the past two years community groups and community centres have not been able to hold fundraising events or social functions and, therefore, there is a significant drain on the funding that they would normally have. I would welcome if something further could be done to help those community centres to continue to provide those facilities and to make sure those facilities are safe and maintained in a proper and safe manner.

I acknowledge the importance of community centres. They are the cornerstone of community life in many places around the country. My Department has a number of schemes that communities can avail of for the upkeep, enhancement or establishment of community centres. The Department provides small capital grants for the improvement of facilities through the community enhancement programme. The 2021 programme provided funding of €4.5 million and will be available again in 2022. The €9 million community activities fund was recently launched to support community and voluntary groups impacted by Covid-19. This fund will help community groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs, such as utility or insurance bills, as well as with improvements to their facilities. In addition, the €49 million community services programme supports more than 420 community organisations, including community centres, to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model. Funding is provided as a contribution towards the cost of employing staff in these organisations.  The Minister referenced the town and village renewal scheme. It is also relevant to community centres, supporting the repurposing of community buildings in town centres to facilitate remote working and other projects to bring vacant and derelict buildings back into use. A new capital fund for the upgrade of community centres was referenced in the national development plan and funding of €5 million has been secured for this under budget 2022. The details of this capital scheme are currently being developed within my Department and it will be launched in 2022, with further details to be announced in due course.

For that new role to be put in place, a large number of community centres need to be upgraded, particularly in rural areas where there is no broadband provision. I know of an area where there is no broadband, landline or mobile phone connection, but the local community centre has a hub in place, which is extremely important for that area. Other areas do not have access to a hub for people to work from. In one particular area, where more than 900 primary schoolchildren are in four schools, we are working to try to get a broadband hub into the local community centre, in respect of which the lack of engagement from the local authority surprises me. There is a need to examine the involvement of local authorities in the context of whether they are being proactive enough. We need to consider a new role for community centres, which I think is possible. They will respond to that need. That is the reason we need additional funding.

I would like to reference some allocations in the Deputy's area under the community activities fund. A €9 million fund was announced recently, applications for which are open until February but the spending must be done by August next year. Cork City Council received an allocation of €307,000 and Cork County Council received an allocation of €312,000. Under the community enhancement programme, the allocation for this year was €153,000 in the city and €156,000 in the county. Regarding the particular community centre mentioned by the Deputy, the community services programme has also been enhanced significantly during the Covid period.In the past few weeks, we added another €1 million to the support fund specifically for organisations that struggled during the pandemic and did not have the opportunity to achieve an earned income because they had to close.

With reference to Question No. 68, will he outline what supports are in place to assist communities that do not currently have a centre to develop one? Will he consider doing a national audit of towns and villages across the country to see where the deficits are and to encourage and support local authorities to put in place measures to ensure, first, that land is made available and that community centres can be constructed in those locations? It might be done as part of a planning condition. I am involved in a small community centre that is used by 1,000 people a week. It is amazing to see people, young and old, using it, as well as children's clubs, fitness clubs and God knows what else. If we build it, they will come. It is a fantastic facility and the community services programme is terrific. I support the Minister of State in the work he is doing in this area. I encourage him to carry out an audit across the country to see where the blank spots are and support the provision of centres in some of those areas.
#JoeOBrien	unknown-#JoeOBrien-party	unknown-#JoeOBrien-dob	unknown-#JoeOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	331	To pick up on Deputy Burke's point, there certainly is a constant flow of feedback. Regarding the community activities fund and the community enhancement programme, decisions in terms of local allocations are made by the local community development committees, LCDCs, in a bottom-up approach. The main feedback we get is that the schemes are very popular and are, in fact, oversubscribed, which is why we were glad to put more funding in that direction this year as well. In terms of the strategy, it should fit in with the local economic and community plan, but it is the LCDCs making the calls in terms of where the funding goes, with the proviso that it goes to the areas that need it most. I take Deputy Stanton's point about scoping, broadly speaking. As I mentioned earlier, community centres across the country have a different life. If there is an area with no centre and a need for one, my first question would be to the local authority as to why it did not plan for that. I see it in my constituency, where there are large housing estates and the facilities, including community centres, were not put in when they were built. The first thing to do is to see whether the local authority can provide a piece of land to get things going. Securing land is often where projects start and get moving.

They need encouragement, support and a policy direction. Does he agree that community centres can provide services, facilities and a place for people, young and old, to go at night and where communities can really develop? We need more of them and, where there is a deficit, that needs to be identified and encouragement provided to local authorities to address it. Such provision should be a condition of planning when new estates are being built in order that we do not have wildernesses and deserts, with rows of houses and no facilities. The Minister of State knows where that leads.

One of the advantages of opening a specifically identified and named fund for community centres is that the process of dealing with applications will give us a good sense of the need that exists. It will enhance the conversation with local authorities because we will not always be saying, "Yes, here is your money", especially if the local authority has a clear responsibility in the matter. I take the Deputy's point in that regard. We will be developing more in this space in terms of dialogue with local authorities and pinning down the need across the country. One of the reasons there is provision in this regard in the national development plan and the programme for Government is that all parties involved knew very well the need that is there. I look forward to progressing matters in this area.

We all know the difficulties there are at this point in time with the roll-out of the national broadband plan, NBP. Even in a best-case scenario, we know provision in a number of areas is going to be very late to be delivered upon and we need to look at interim solutions. This body could not only be a clearing house for industry but could also do some of the necessary due diligence work in terms of offering people alternatives in the interim.

Officials from my Department have been working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in recent months to finalise arrangements for the reconvening of the mobile phone and broadband task force. The previous task force was very successful in delivering on a wide range of important actions and I am keen to build on that success. It is intended to convene a meeting of the new task force at the earliest possible date. Together with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, I have written to the key stakeholders who will make up the new task force to arrange an initial meeting. With regard to the membership of the task force, we discovered over the course of its predecessor's term that having the right organisations at the table, represented by the right people, is key to achieving progress. The new body will include input from relevant Departments, the local government sector and private industry. A full membership can be published once arrangements for the initial meeting have been finalised. In order to develop a detailed work plan for the new task force, I have asked the relevant stakeholders to consider potential actions that can be delivered in a number of strategically important thematic areas. It is intended that the new body's work programme will include actions to address issues such as outdoor mobile coverage, planning and licensing issues, asset mapping and access to infrastructure. I look forward to building on the success of the previous task force and working with the members of the new task force. It will convene at the earliest possible date before the year's end. In fact, I understand that meeting will take place next week. The task force will take on fewer actions than its predecessor but those actions will be more complex and impactful, requiring more time, resources and collaboration.

We can guess the different actions it will need to do. If it sets out with a limited scope in terms of the number of jobs it has to do and if it can deliver on them, that will be welcome. A vital part of that will be dealing with interim solutions for areas that may be waiting five, six or seven years at this point for delivery of the national broadband roll-out. It is very difficult to talk about National Broadband Ireland, NBI, without dealing with the issues that have arisen at this time. I accept that the Minister cannot answer this point but there needs to be a forum in which the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and possibly the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, can deal with the questions that are out there regarding the ownership of Oak Hill Advisors, which is the main body behind Granahan McCourt, and the fact that we seem to have almost a Gordon Gekko-type scenario in terms of those controlling the delivery of rural broadband. I welcome what the Minister said in regard to the mobile phone and broadband task force.

I see the vans around the place and I say "keep going" because we want to get it rolled out as quickly as we can. I am sure the Deputy is aware of the broadband officers in the local authorities, who have done a fantastic job. They were appointed in 2016 and have worked with the different providers across the board. They have managed to ensure the broadband connection points, BCPs, were delivered in many remote parts of the country, which would otherwise not have happened.I want to say thanks to them because they did a wonderful job. We were able to support them with funding to roll out those broadband connection points in small halls across rural areas and they have helped connect and break down some of the issues the providers may have had in getting the different licences. These were simple roadblocks that they were able to clear.

Significant work has been done by broadband officers. I will come at this from two ends. There is a necessity to look at planning laws and such. National Broadband Ireland, NBI, is looking for the resource to be available, particularly if it gets to the point of an acceleration, where people would have the knowledge of planning permissions and road opening licences. Those would be road engineers and those with knowledge of planning, and they are very necessary. My fear is not the NBI and its operations, although I think we need interim solutions, but that the financial arrangements behind it will lead to difficulties. The due diligence might not have been done on whether Granahan McCourt had the financial arrangements to deliver what we need. I accept this question needs to be answered by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth.

They can direct them to who they need to because they will know the story. They should know the story in the local authorities and, I have to say, they have been very good at doing that. The new actions the task force will look at when it convenes for its first meeting on 15 December are permits, consents and planning permission, as the Deputy highlighted, mapping and registers of assets, geographic mobile coverage, consumer information, and innovation and proof of concept projects. Those are the sort of things we will be looking at. They are more complex, more knotty, as they say, and they are more time consuming. On whether my phone, the Deputy’s phone, or anyone else’s phone is secure, that would be a matter for cybersecurity. It does not fall under the broadband task force.

I ask the Minister about the supports provided to the community associations and community centres as a result of Covid-19 and what further work we can do on that. We are going to go through at least another three to four months of difficulties in this area. The Minister might give me some information on that area.

That fund is now closed and there are no plans at present for further rounds of the stability fund. The innovate together fund was launched in May 2020 and was administered by Rethink Ireland. This consisted of a €5 million commitment from my Department’s Dormant Accounts Fund and €600,000 from philanthropic donations. The purpose of the fund was to assist organisations working with vulnerable people and communities. Some 71 projects received grants of between €20,000 and €200,000 as well as non-financial business supports. My Department currently supports more than 420 community organisations in the community services programme, CSP, to provide local services through a social enterprise model. My Department recently announced a further extension of €1 million to the CSP support fund to cover the period up to December 2021, bringing the total funding allocated to the CSP support fund to €8.95 million for 2020 to 2021. This funding was provided to CSP-supported organisations which required additional assistance to continue to retain their CSP-supported employees on their payroll, provided assistance for the employers’ PRSI contributions and supported organisations considered by my Department to be most in need to cover overhead costs. Most recently, I was pleased to launch a new community activities fund. This €9 million fund is being provided by the Government to support community and voluntary groups impacted by Covid-19. This once-off funding, allocated under the Department’s community enhancement programme and administered locally by the local community development committees, will support groups, especially in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs as well as with improvements to their facilities.

One of the challenges that we now have as a result of the downturn in business in certain areas is that there will be people who will not go back to the jobs they had had before. Will we open up the area of community employment, CE, and change the rules to make it more adaptable to the changes that have occurred over the past 12 months? Is that being considered at this time so that there is a benefit for people who have not employment at the moment as well as for the community groups and centres throughout the country?

I will only say yes, we are looking at community employment. On the Deputy’s initial question, the stability fund was our main response to community and voluntary sector for larger groups. A large number of groups were covered under that. The community services support fund was targeted particularly at groups funded under that stream, with groups that needed traded income, or relied on traded income to a fair extent. For example, many community centres using a social enterprise model were not able to generate traded income over the past while. Obviously, restrictions were lifted during the summer, but prior to that they had been suffering, which is why we added more to the support fund. There was a gap in terms of smaller community groups, and that is what the more recent community activity fund is targeting. That €9 million will be distributed by the local community development committees throughout the country. They will be small grants but they will be very effective in remobilising those smaller community groups throughout the country as well.

I have come across a situation where there is support from Avondhu Duhallow, which is a very effective organisation, but there are not supports, for instance, from the local authority. Can we look at that co-ordination of supports so that if moneys are granted by one organisation, sufficient moneys are granted, the other organisations involved are made aware by the Department or the relevant organisation that is providing the funding, and there is joined-up thinking in that whole area?

I think he was talking about a local development company, Avondhu Duhallow, which is in a different realm again. Its funding stayed solid in terms of the programmes it rolls out for Government, be it SICAP or LEADER or whatnot. I am not sure how the local authorities might support it in different ways. On the stability fund, organisations were asked what their earnings were. They were asked for details on their accounts and where they were getting funding. There are checks and balances done in that regard. On the community services programme, we are working through the recommendations of the Indecon report.We obviously stalled it a little over the last year or so while we have been restructuring the community services programme. We have a small number of applications that were in the pipeline when we stalled it. We are going to try to process them early next year and then we are looking at the middle of next year, roughly speaking, because we have a bit of work to do yet before we reopen the new restructured programme.

As she will be aware, Galway County Council is the body responsible for development of stage 3 of the Caladh Mór pier development on Inis Meáin. Users of the pier, including a number of State-subsidised ferry operators, have highlighted issues with capacity within the harbour, as well as with currents around the mouth of the harbour. As part of the preparatory works, the National Maritime College of Ireland, NMCI, was instructed by Galway County Council to develop a model simulation for the harbour, which will inform the business case options for the development. The NMCI hosted a group of islanders, ferry operators and officials at its facility in July for a demonstration of the initial iteration of the marine simulation. Following feedback from the various parties that attended the demonstration, the NMCI is furthering the development of the simulation. It is expected that the updated simulation will give a more precise and accurate overview of how the conditions at the pier affect the specific key vessels that use it. Galway County Council is in ongoing contact with the ferry and cargo operators to collate the technical specifications which the NMCI will use in its updated simulation. Once the NMCI has completed its work, Galway County Council will incorporate the findings into its draft business case. Following on from this, the Department will then be able to evaluate the next steps in the process, in line with the public spending code and available funding.

This is the third phase for Inis Meáin. This has been going on for years and that is the exact same answer my colleagues got about it.

When will it be completed? Most important, what money will be allocated? Has money been put aside for this development?

As the Deputy and I well know, sorting out a pier presents different challenges and everybody seems to have a different solution. The college has done the simulation and it is going back now to look at a number of other things that arose during those simulations. The parties have reviewed this and there is ongoing contact between the county council and the maritime college. The Government is absolutely committed to a new pier. I agree with the Deputy that this has been going on for a long time. My officials are in contact with Galway County Council on a fortnightly basis. We have to get the business case but it has to be made by the county council before I can bring it any further. We are working with the local authority. In fairness, it is trying to find out what the best solution is here because, from my experience of the islands, one could find a solution but it might not be the right one. This simulation will give us more information on what needs to be done.

This is very specific, especially as it goes back such a long time and the development has not been completed. When will the work of the maritime college in Cork be finished?

What is the status of the ten-year, cross-departmental policy for island development, and associated action plans to ensure delivery of the policy, as outlined in Our Rural Future?

However, as Deputy Ó Cathasaigh appears to be the only one here I will focus on his question. As set out in Our Rural Future, the Government is committed to publishing a ten-year policy on island development, with associated plans. It had been initially envisaged that the new policy would be published in 2021. However, following engagement with island communities it became clear that more time was required to get the policy right. Indeed, at this year's annual general meeting of the islands' representative body, Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, at which I was present, this very point was stressed by members of that body. We have to get it right. I understand that based on the development work to date, the draft policy is expected to be ready by the middle of next year. Some initial work has already been made on aspects of the policy document and considerable progress has also been made on bilateral meetings with stakeholders. In particular, my Department has now completed the bilateral meetings with all relevant Departments. The bilateral meetings have provided an opportunity for frank discussion of the issues raised by island communities and for Departments to assess how they might help address the various issues raised. It is not just my Department; we want to involve many other Departments in this. The interdepartmental committee for the islands held its most recent meeting on Monday, 29 November, during which the participating Departments reviewed progress on the policy development. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for February 2022. In the past year, I have managed to visit a good number of islands. I was on Inis Mór and Inis Meáin and I have been to two of the Donegal islands and some of the islands off the coast of Cork. I am imagining living on an island tonight. It does present challenges. This policy is an important document and we want to make sure it is right. As I said, we had a meeting at the end of November and we will continue to work on it. I thank the Deputy for his question.

Islanders often feel they have been tagged on to the end of the departmental line.One of the representatives who spoke to our committee referenced a programme that was on TG4 Player, "Inis Airc: Bás Oileáin", which is about the leaving of Inishark. We must acknowledge that the way of life that exists on the islands is precious but also marginal. It is difficult for families to maintain their life on an island. While I welcome the Minister's comments, the work must be multi-departmental. Many issues need to be addressed, for example, housing and employment. Language is also a major consideration on many islands because they are often Gaeltacht communities. Other issues include schools, how to keep young people on the island and how to attract inward investment.

I can imagine how they must feel isolated. It is fine in the summer months when everyone wants to visit the islands but it is different in the winter months. When there is an evening like this, it must be very challenging. I have been on a number of islands, for example, Clare Island. I apologise, as I should have said I visited Árainn Mhór, not Inis Mór. I have been to Inis Oírr, Inis Meáin, Bere Island and Gola and I intend to visit more of the islands to hear first hand the issues that they have. I want to work with them and support them. We have granted funding because roads and piers are major issues for the islands. I want to try to maintain their schools and keep their children on the islands. That is challenging no matter how one looks at it. I will continue to work with them.

We believed the removal was going to happen on Friday. A number of us met and the Minister of State will have received a letter as well as communications from a number of people on this matter. There has been a stay of execution and there is talk of further discussion, which needs to happen. I am seeking real engagement. The concern is that we will go through the motions only for what we feared happening last Friday happening anyway. There is another concern. There were six groups: the family addiction support network steering group, CityWide, UISCE, the voluntary addiction network teams and two additional bodies that changed from time to time. The difficulty is that we believe this number will be reduced to four and then become the civil society forum. The problem with having a civil society forum is that the Department will make a determination as to which personnel will sit on it. This does not reflect accountability, transparency or the idea of the national drugs strategy having ground-up community representation. It is similar to what is happening on the regional drugs task forces. Whether one is dealing with the Department or the HSE, community organisations will say that they are dealing with corporatism. We would be dealing with corporatism and bureaucracy and the cutting out of the community voluntary sector. That is not good enough and we need to get commitments today.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	362	For 25 years, our national drugs strategy has been underpinned by a community development approach. In 1996, the then Minister, on behalf of the State, acknowledged to community leaders who had been campaigning on the drugs issue for years that the then Government had not listened. The Minister set up a partnership structure that included community representation as a right to ensure that would never happen again. With the publication of the midterm review, it appears that the Department is attempting to bring that partnership to an end. In the review document, the Department is effectively writing the community sector out of the national drugs strategy. It is altering the definition of "community" to remove the engagement with the wider community and has set out proposals for new structures that would remove the community networks that represent their sectors as core constituents of the strategy. There is no evidence base for the proposed changes to the structures, and adequate time and space have not been allowed for the networks to consider them. A brake has been put on the process, though. The national oversight committee was supposed to meet on Friday but the Minister has agreed that the Department will hold further discussions with the community sector. The community sector has noticed that something is going on within the drug strategy. It is either a political decision, a HSE-driven decision or a Civil Service decision to try to take the community out of "community". I do not support that and I hope to hear a positive response from the Minister of State to the effect that the community will be part of the structure and will be listened to within it.

Communities have been central to the partnership and the framework of trying to tackle the problem within them. They are the experts in many ways. It is a pity that Departments, Ministers and so on sometimes dream up changes to things that are working. If it is not broken, do not fix it, especially where communities are involved. It took a lot of time to win the communities' trust. I was there during the time of Concerned Parents Against Drugs and the Coalition of Communities Against Drugs, COCAD, when communities had considerable mistrust of the system as they saw it - the Garda, the then health boards, Ministers and so on. Communities bought into the partnership approach. They saw it as an opportunity to frame national policy on an issue that was affecting them directly as communities, mothers, fathers or people who were addicted to drugs. They were able to inform that policy instead of having a policy that was dreamed up somewhere else being imposed on them. It is sad that the situation has come to this and that there is an "uncivil" row, as it were. I do not know where the title "civil society forum" comes from. It would usually be "civic". We need to consider what the likes of Mr. Fergus McCabe fought for. It was not to be excluded or sidelined. Rather, it was to be central to all of the strategy around drugs.

Last week, it was about dismantling the local jobs clubs, and this week it relates to community involvement in the drugs strategy. There seems to be a direct threat from the Government to communities and their resilience. Any chance the Government has to erode such resilience is grabbed with both hands. I am a former member of the Clondalkin drug and alcohol task force. I worked on front-line community drugs services for many years. The last one I worked on was in Deputy Ó Snodaigh’s area in Inchicore. I saw the value of the role the community played in our strategic plans and strategies and how it engaged and informed what was going on there. Who is better placed to do that outside our communities? There has been a deliberate attempt to reduce the number of community groups on the national oversight committee from six to four. As part of this, a decision has been made to remove the likes of CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign, the National Family Support Network and Uisce, on behalf of the community sector and the voluntary drug treatment network, from the national oversight committee. A cross-party group, including members of the Minister of State’s party, met with CityWide last week. The last question I asked CityWide was what engagement it had with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, in this process. The meeting was a public one. It informed me that it had no engagement with the Minister of State. Despite making numerous attempts in that regard, a meeting did not happen. I have been made aware that the position has shifted since the meeting last week and that is to be welcomed. What will be the implication on funding for CityWide and other voluntary community addiction services? Will their funding stream be impeded by this decision?

I welcome this opportunity to confirm for the House the continued participation of the community and voluntary sector in the national oversight committee for the national drugs strategy.
I convened a meeting of the national oversight committee on Friday. My door is always open to meeting various groups. I have met CityWide on many occasions. It has been part of various deputations I have met previously. The meeting was attended by three representatives from the community and voluntary sector, representing CityWide, the National Voluntary Drug and Alcohol Sector and Uisce, the service user organisation. A fourth position remains vacant and will be filled in due course. At the meeting, I provided reassurance that there is no proposal to remove community and voluntary groups from the national oversight committee. This appears to have arisen from a misunderstanding by CityWide of the Department's proposals to establish a civil society on drugs. I also dispute the accuracy of the claim that community groups are being written out of the national drugs strategy. To be clear: Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, a health-led response to drugs and alcohol use, remains in place as the national drug strategy until 2025. As the strategy is a dynamic process, there is flexibility to introduce new actions to address emerging issues in the period from 2021 to 2025. To this end, I recently published the mid-term review of the actions in the strategy. Based on the learning from the mid-term review, six strategic priorities for 2021 to 2025 were identified. These priorities strengthen the health-led approach, reflect commitments in the programme for Government and align with the EU drugs strategy and action plan for 2021 to 2025. I assure Deputies that the priorities complement and build on the five goals in the national drugs strategy. The interagency approach involving a partnership between statutory, community and voluntary bodies remains central to the strategy, as does strengthening the resilience of communities to respond to the drug problem.

This is where we are starting from. When we talk to any organisation working in the community and voluntary sector that deals with drug addiction and the communities that are being ravaged by it, they tell us that it has become more difficult to deal with the State. I hope that what the Minister of State is saying will be the case, that there will be no diminution in the number of groups sitting on the national oversight committee and that the determination will be made by those groups and not by someone from the Department. The groups are currently very worried.

I hope that it will stand the test of time and that, as he presented it, this was a miscommunication. I know the Minister of State’s track record on the drugs issue. I accept that he personally might not want to go ahead with this but there has been tension all along between communities, community groups and some in the Department and the HSE. I urge the Minister of State to be cautious in that regard.

I have worked with front-line organisations in addiction centres, and they have experience of the way things work. They do not make mistakes or misunderstand what is happening. CityWide was unequivocal in what it said: it did seek a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and there was no acknowledgement of the request. I did not say the Minister of State turned down the request, but there was no acknowledgement by him of the request for a meeting. A line needs to be drawn under the issue. I welcome the initiatives the Minister of State outlined. I hope they happen, because we cannot erode any more community services or community resilience.

The interagency approach involving a partnership between statutory, community and voluntary bodies remains central to the strategy, as does strengthening the resilience of communities to respond to the drug problem. Community organisations will continue to have an active role in the design and delivery of the strategy, both at local level through the drug and alcohol task forces and at national level through the national oversight committee. I acknowledge the concerns of one organisation regarding its continued involvement in the national drugs strategy, and I understand the point made by Deputy Joan Collins. I know from long experience that the key to addressing legitimate concerns is not though megaphone diplomacy but through direct communication between parties based on mutual respect. I will meet those parties again to see if we can iron out any difficulties. I look forward to working with all stakeholders, including community groups, voluntary service providers and people with lived experience of drugs, to deliver the strategic priorities for the strategy over its remaining years. Deputy Ward spoke about a meeting and I will follow that up in the morning. My office is open at all times. People have my number or they can email me, and I will be only too delighted to meet to try to resolve this issue. I thank all the Deputies for being balanced. I will try to work to ensure we get a satisfactory outcome that we all can be happy with. There are issues and it is a very difficult issue but I hope we will be able to resolve it in the coming days and weeks. Again, I thank all of the Deputies.

I believe Covid taught us one thing and that is the value, where it is a viable option, of caring for loved ones at home, particularly in old age. Moreover, that is often the desire of families. We all resolved after Covid to ensure that this would be a more viable option and that more people who want to be cared for at home, both by themselves and by their families, would be given that option. To do that, we need strong State supports. It is a very economical way of doing this but to do it, we need home care packages and home carers. However, in reality, the opposite is happening. I will give a few examples. I know the case of a lady with multiple sclerosis and diabetes who has been awarded 42 hours, so that is approved. The agency that was given this package by the HSE has handed it back and there are now no carers. It handed it back on the understanding that it did not have the carers. As the HSE has stated that it also does not have the carers, she is only in receipt of 13 hours weekly that is provided by carers. There is another case where the carer was not replaced when she went on annual leave and no arrangements were put in place to cover the carer's leave. Everybody is entitled to leave. There is another case of a constituent who was awarded 16 hours of home care per week but has not been given more than six hours in any given week. On and on it goes. I want to highlight these particular cases because it is a human tragedy that this is happening. Of course, it is making people reassess the option of caring for people in their own home environment which, as I said, is often the choice. However, it is not viable if people do not have the support. What I am hoping to hear tonight is that the Government has a plan to address the issues. One of the fundamental issues, by the way, is that the profession of caring in the home is not a particularly well-paid profession. As I have argued for years, there is too big a gap between what the top of the public service is paid and what the bottom of the public service is paid, and we need to address this. It is coming back to haunt us that this issue has been allowed to go on. I hope the Minister of State will have some answers tonight. I know she is sympathetic. If she needs support in looking for the money, she will get the support of every Member of the House in making a stand. People who are caring and being cared for deserve the best and home is the best in many cases, although I am not ruling out the incredible role that nursing homes also play.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	375	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I notice Deputy Joan Collins is also here and listening; we had a discussion earlier in the back corridor, and many other Deputies have raised the situation with me. The issue is not funding. If the issue was funding, I would be able to go and look for more funding and I feel I would secure it. My budget for home care for this year is €666 million, it increased by €150 million this year and I have secured the same increase for next year, which is to deliver 24 million hours of home care. The Deputy is right that Covid has taught us the value of caring for people at home. I want to see the Sláintecare model, that is, the right care at the right time in the right place, as close to home as possible. By the end of October, almost 17 million hours had been provided to over 54,000 people, which is about 2.5 million more hours compared to the period last year, so we have made a lot of improvements this year alone. Significant inroads have been achieved in reducing the waiting list for funding approval for new and additional services. In January 2020, there were 7,800 people waiting for funding and it was down to 400 in September 2021, so I have managed to reduce the number of those waiting for funding for home care by 88%. Therein lies the problem and the problem has got worse during the year. There are delays between the approval of funding and the delivery of home support hours, and the number of people in this category has increased steadily this year, primarily due to staff capacity issues. At the end of September this year, there were 4,933 people assessed and waiting for care to become available but the funding has been provided to provide the package. That is the most frustrating part for me - the fact I actually have the funding for the first year ever. I often stood on the other side at the House, talking to my predecessor, the former Minister of State, Jim Daly, and the funding was not available at the time due to different issues. Now, the funding is available, which is what makes it most frustrating. The HSE is acutely aware there are increasing capacity issues across both direct and indirect provision. It continues to advertise on an ongoing basis for healthcare assistants and it recruits as many suitable candidates as possible. For example, the community healthcare organisation, CHO, covering the Deputy's area, CHO 4, is recruiting 300 home care assistants and that was put out for advertising last week. Every single HSE area and every single CHO is trying to recruit as many people as possible. They are recruiting through a variety of channels, both at local level and through the shared services office of the HSE's health business services. I recently started a round of meetings with the older person's lead in each CHO to discuss these challenges and to discuss day-care respite and community step-down. If we want to keep the throughput in our acute hospitals, the only way we can do that is by having the supports at home. I am also meeting regularly with Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI, which represents the private providers, and they also continue to recruit home support workers. I have established a cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group. The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and to examine workforce challenges in home support and nursing homes. The areas to be considered include recruitment, retention, training, career development and the sustainable employment of home care workers into the future.

However, how am I meant to go back to a constituent who was awarded just 14 hours home help weekly?The hours were meant to be divided between morning and evening but the hours are only being given in the morning and the wife of the person being cared for has to put her husband to bed. However, because of the condition he is in, this requires two people. She was told that the latest they could come was 6.30 p.m. It is not a viable option to put somebody to bed at 6.30 p.m. because if that is done, he or she will be up very early the following morning and we will have the same problem in reverse. I acknowledge all the statistics and the work the Minister of State is doing but that is no good to the person facing the individual dilemma. Funding is being provided but not funding in the normal sense. I accept that there is extra funding and that it is now much quicker to get the hours granted. We used to have the problem of getting the hours granted and now we have the problem of getting the carers. There is a problem this society has to look at. I recall the late Frank Prendergast, who was a Labour Deputy in this House and a trade unionist, talking to me time and again about how over the years the gap in how we pay people was growing. These are front-line workers. It is becoming more obvious across society that critical services are not being provided because we refuse to restructure our society to properly reward those providing the same services. Then we wonder why we cannot provide the services.

I announced a call for submissions last Friday to further identify key issues in recruitment and retention and to inform the establishment of the group in early 2022, which is January as far as I am concerned as it needs to be done as soon as possible. We are all aware that terms and conditions vary from the private sector to the HSE. The HSE pays approximately €16 per hour plus travel. Some of the private operators pay the minimum wage and others pay more. There are challenges there and those operators are losing staff to the HSE. We have had a lot of talks with the HSE and a few recommendations have gone to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to be examined. For example, we have some young people who avail of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants who are allowed to work a certain amount of hours per month and we are trying to double that. We are also considering supporting people who receive a Department of Social Protection payment working a set amount of hours, as happens with the disability grant, so that they would not lose their supports and their medical cards would not be affected. We hope we can encourage more people back into the workforce that way. I understand exactly where the Deputy is coming from. I get these queries in my constituency office as well; I would say there is no Deputy who does not get them. The problem we have is that a lot of carers work split shifts in the morning and the evening. Some 75% of all carers work part time. Everybody wants his or her loved one to be put to bed last but when carers are going out at 5 p.m., 6 p.m., 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. in the evening, they go to one house and move on to the next. That side of it is very difficult but all I can do is provide a commitment that I will continue to do everything in my power to try to get more home care workers into the system. As the Deputy knows, we are challenged in that we have more people working than we ever had in the history of the State. We are challenged with hospitality, home care and retail and it is quite difficult. All I can say is I am working at this every day.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	378	I thank the Minister of State for being here to discuss this important issue. I also acknowledge her personal interest and involvement in this issue since it arose last summer. Last June, the announcement was made that the Owenacurra Centre would close on 31 October and that in the interim all residents, and their families where appropriate, would be consulted. It was also promised that the will and preference of the residents would be paramount when suggestions were made on possible new placements for residents, of which there were 19, although I understand there are 15 now. The reason given for the closure at the time was the building was no longer fit for purpose in that it did not allow for the needs of a modern residential and day service and it had been criticised by the regulator. There were also questions about safety. One of the families asked me earlier to ask the Minister of State a question. We understand that some works have been carried out at the centre recently. Is she satisfied that these works will enable the residents to stay there safely for the time being and are there plans to carry out other interim works in respect of safety? That is an issue that families and residents are concerned about. I hope she can tell me this evening that she is satisfied that it is safe. We know it is not fit for purpose for reasons of size, scale, design and so forth but can the Minister of State tell me this evening that nobody will be evicted from the centre against his or her will? That would mean that people could relax, engage and wait until a proper placement was proposed to them. It would be helpful for her to tell us that. I refer to the broader policy on 24-hour staffed residential services. We have been informed that there is an extensive community-based service operating across the local area, including a home-based treatment team in multiple specialist services, which is good. I applaud that because we want to keep people in their homes and communities as far and as long as possible. I understand that a residential type setting is being sought to provide "a supported mode of living locally" and that the site will be used for future mental health services. What is meant by “a supported mode of living locally”? Supported living means people can live but it is not the same as 24-hour staffing. The question arises: what is the future of 24-hour staffed residential services such as those provided by the Owenacurra Centre? These have been described to me as being a type of step-down facility. We know that the kind of supports and services that have been provided there have been exemplary and that people have benefited from them. Could the Minister of State outline Government policy on 24-hour staffed residential services? Recently she told me: "There are no issues with community residences for mental health.” Does that include the type of service provided in the Owenacurra Centre? If this centre closes, will east Cork be the only region in the county of Cork without such a service? Will east Cork have 24-hour residential services into the future? What are the long-term plans for the site? The HSE stated it is engaging with the local authority about long-term plans to use it for mental health services and so on. The local people value the 24-hour staffed service for a certain number of people who benefit from that. We know that there are other people who would benefit from supported living, that more people would benefit from being at home and that more people want to live in congregated settings and need that kind of support. The Owenacurra Centre is not a congregated setting; it is one of the steps on the way to recovery. Some people have been living there all their lives. These people know the area and they can go in and out of the shops, down the street and so forth and it is their home. Can the Minister of State confirm that the place is safe and that people can relax as they will not be moved from the centre against their will? What is the policy on 24-hour staffed residential services nationally and in east Cork?
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	379	I thank the Deputy for his question and for the constructive way he has phrased it. As he and I are aware, there are 19 residents living in the Owenacurra Centre and it is their home. I will not go over the history of it but in June 2021, the HSE notified the Department of its decision to close the Owenacurra Centre. The current building is not fit for purpose and cannot be brought to the standard required. The works being undertaken in the facility currently are to ensure that it is safe for the residents who live there. The Deputy will be aware, for example, that the kitchen was removed because it was a fire hazard and that food was being brought in from another facility. The HSE's focus is on the impact of this closure on residents and their families in order that the will and preference of each individual will be heard like the Deputy said. Since the HSE informed staff and residents of this decision in June, it has been consulting with them on an ongoing basis and this consultation is continuing. The multidisciplinary team has met with all of the residents and their families where the person wishes to have family members involved, which is not always the case, and where the family members wish to attend meetings, which also is not always the case, to discuss their options. Unfortunately, I have to point that out. The will and preference of each resident is core to this process. I spoke to the area lead for mental health, Mr. Kevin Morrison, today and the relocation process is progressing. As of today, all the residents have had their needs assessed so that they can be appropriately placed in accordance with their assessed needs. The latest position is that of the 19 residents in Owenacurra, four have already transferred.Two people have moved to nursing homes, one person has transitioned to a high support hostel, and another individual required admission to acute care but has a place secured with St. Catherine's continuing care centre. It is planned that a further two people will be moved to alternative placements this week, one to a nursing home and another to St. Stephen's hospital. These residents are being moved to a nursing home because their physical health challenges now outweigh their mental health challenges. Residents will not be moved until appropriate placements have been found for each person based on their individual assessed needs, will and preference. I can give Deputy Stanton a guarantee on that. The Mental Health Commission is being informed of every single one of these moves and has asked to be kept apprised of what is happening. The priority of the Government and the HSE is the welfare of the remaining residents in the centre and that was always my concern too. While some people may require ongoing continuing care, others will be facilitated to live in lower support settings, based on their assessed needs. A residential-type setting for a number of residents is being sought to provide a supported mode of living locally. By this, I mean the community houses I spoke about last week. There are approximately 1,200 community houses throughout the country which provide ongoing, continuing care. Typically four or five people would live in these homes and they would be supported within the community. A possible location has also been identified to restore the day service in the town and negotiations are under way on its use. Deputy Stanton will appreciate that this is commercially sensitive but HSE Estates is involved and progress is being made. It is very important that the day care centre opens up as soon as possible. Importantly, the Owenacurra site will be used in the future to build supported living accommodation for mental health service users and discussions have commenced with the local authority to explore options. These discussions are at an early stage and the HSE will proceed with developing proposals to this end over the coming months.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	380	I thank the Minister of State for her very positive response, particularly her assurance that residents will not be moved "until appropriate placements have been found for each person based on their individual assessed needs, will and preference." That means that no pressure will be put on people and they will have to agree before they move to location X, Y or Z. That is hugely important and will be of great relief to the residents and their families. I ask the Minister of State to explain what she means by building "supported living accommodation for mental health service users". I want to go back to the second part of my question this evening which is in respect of a 24-hour staffed service. I envisage a stepped service involving places like St. Stephen's, from which people can move down to somewhere like Midleton where there is a 24-hour staffed service, then there is the supported living which may not be a 24-hour staffed service and finally, care in the community and at home. They are all important but I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on the 24-hour staffed service. There is only one such service in east Cork which serves Youghal, Midleton, Cobh and right up to Glenville. It is a huge area. There are four such services in north Cork and there are others in west Cork and across the country. These services are 24-hour staffed, with people living in their homes but if they need support any time of the day or night, it is there for them. The policy, which is the Minister of State's responsibility, is what I want to tease out this evening. What is Government policy around this? Is it the intention of the HSE that such a service will be provided in east Cork? I would like to see a small centre in Youghal, another in Midleton and one in Cobh but there must be at least one such service in east Cork. This comes back to the question as to whether this service is required. Is a 24-hour staffed service part of the overall plan? It could be described as supported living but a bit more intensive than what the Minister of State described in her earlier response.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2021-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	381	Improving all aspects of mental health service delivery is a priority for me and that is what I try to do when I secure as much funding as possible, particularly for the recruitment and retention of staff. As we all know, the delivery of mental health services depends on the staff we have. Deputy Stanton referred to the fact that east Cork will be left without a facility like Owenacurra. The national implementation and monitoring committee is currently undertaking a bed capacity review for mental health beds across the whole country. It is looking at acute and community services, including the community houses to which I referred, to determine how we are fixed in that regard. It is also looking at forensic mental health services in the context of our prisons and the facility at Portrane. A commitment has been given by the HSE that mental health support services will always be provided on the Owenacurra site, which is massive. We know that the building is not fit for purpose and that the residents have to leave. As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, what I do not want is that the only possibility for people is ending up in a long-term residential care facility. That is what I do not want. I want people to have the supports they need. There will be a range of people who want to live in supported housing with the correct wraparound supports. That does not mean that they will have somebody 24-7 but that they will have the correct wraparound supports, as determined by the individual. There are people living like that within the community. Deputy Stanton asked about a 24-hour staffed service which is only available in Cork and Dublin through mental health crisis resolution teams. There are only two such teams in the whole country. I can only assume that is what Deputy Stanton is referring to, but I will check that out and revert back to the Deputy.  I want to make sure that the residents of Owenacurra have the best possible outcome.
