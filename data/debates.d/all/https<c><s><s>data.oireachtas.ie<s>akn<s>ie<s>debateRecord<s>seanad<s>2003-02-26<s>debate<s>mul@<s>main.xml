          <p eId="para_9">I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 2 be deleted from the Order of Business until such time as the advice the Attorney General gave to the Government is made available to Members, concerning the constitutionality of the Local Government Bill 2003. Irrespective of one's views on the substantive issue contained within the legislation, Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas have a responsibility to ensure that legislation is not repugnant to the Constitution. We have seen too many cases where the Supreme Court has overturned sections or entire Acts. It would be sensible for all Members of the House to be given the advice of the Attorney General because the Bill as proposed is suspect in terms of its constitutionality.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_14">The reason the legislation is to be published on Friday is that all sides of the House have some difficulty with it. This is bad law and the Government is attempting to overturn legislation that was agreed on an all-party basis in 1997. It is not good for accountability or the notion of democracy. Why can Members from all sides and people outside the Houses not see decisions that were taken five years ago? The legislation to be published on Friday is bad and this side of the House will resolutely oppose it.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_15">I wish to clarify a point I made yesterday about statutory instruments, ministerial orders and papers before the House being placed on the websites. Statutory instruments are already published on the website of the Office of the Attorney General but ministerial orders and papers laid before the House are not and there is a case for their being made equally accessible. It is also an unnecessary burden on Library staff to have to provide these in non-electronic form.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I do not have any party allegiance on the issue raised by Senator Hayes. I agree with many Government Members who will be voting the other way on this Bill. However, there is a constitutional issue and it should be sorted out. The approach seems to be similar to that which was taken to the rod licence when the Government rushed into it and tried to meet all the parties and cobble something together. It seems like rushed legislation. More time should be given to it as it will cause problems and probably face a constitutional challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Senator Minihan has raised the issue of the Cork School of Music on a number of occasions in recent months. It has wider implications for the development of public private partnerships – it is a vote of no confidence in the system. This will be a vital cog in the building of bridges, roads, schools and hospitals. This is the only country in western Europe where there is agreement among the social partners on a way of approaching PPPs that addresses everybody's needs, responsibilities and rights. The Minister for Finance should come to the House to answer the questions raised by Senator Minihan and others in other fora. He must tell us what the Government is doing in this regard. Every time an Adjournment matter is tabled regarding the provision of a new school etc., the bad handling taking place could impact negatively upon these matters. I would like a full debate on the issue with the Minister. While I know he is fully supportive of the PPP initiative, there seem to be officials in his Department who take a different view.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">After the behaviour of Fianna Fáil councillors in Loughrea in rezoning land on which the motorway was supposed to be built perhaps the Government is right to introduce the Local Government Bill. Perhaps Fianna Fáil has reservations about extending the powers of local government if its function is to reward its buddies by rezoning land in advance of it being compulsorily acquired by the State for public purposes. That is the way to give local government a bad reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">A Bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act will be published on Friday. Surely even Fianna Fáil can appreciate the irony of the blanket of secrecy that has fallen on freedom of information. I have never known the contents of legislation to be less signalled in advance. There is also irony in the compilation of a secret report by those most inconvenienced by the Freedom of Information Act, senior civil servants, without consultation with the Information Commissioner whose budget has been cut this year. This is a statement of attitude that merits serious consideration by a House of the Oireachtas.

Will the Leader consider holding a debate on the cost of insurance in general and liability insurance in particular? The long-term implications for industry and employment are seriously affected by circumstances in the insurance industry. Legal costs are a huge impacting factor in the prohibitive cost of insurance. The advocacy rather than inquisitorial approach of the court system should also be looked at. I would like to think the issue of competition within the sector would receive an airing. Is there any legislation pending in this area? This is one of the most serious challenges facing the economy.</p>

The proposal to amend the Freedom of Information Act will be strenuously opposed by this side of the House. The rush to pass the legislation is unseemly, to say the least. It is clearly an attempt by the Government to control information on its daily activities. It is also linked to the amount being spent on spin doctors and propaganda and the manner in which the Government chooses selectively to leak reports on health boards, rail reviews and other major decisions. It is a leak Government, on the one hand, and a controlling Government, on the other. This attempt to alter the freedom of information legislation will, I hope, be seen for what it is, an insidious and dangerous attempt by the Government to control the amount of information the people are getting about its decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">Senator Brian Hayes proposed an amendment to which many speakers referred which requests the advice of the Attorney General regarding the constitutionality of the Local Government Bill 2003. I am happy to concur with Senator Mansergh on this issue. In my many years of experience at Cabinet I know that the Attorney General's advice is sought on all legislation. No Minister would rush ahead with legislation without such advice. It appears that Deputy Ring's advice reigns supreme in the House. Perhaps he has aspirations in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">This is a short Bill. Its chief effect will be to end the dual mandate from the next local elections in 2004 onwards. It will also continue the current long-standing arrangements for the election of the cathaoirligh of county and city councils. This will be done by repealing the provision in the Local Government Act 2001, which would have introduced new arrangements for elections from 2004 onwards. While the Bill may be short, it will have significant implications at two levels – for the national Parliament and local government now recognised in the Constitution as a fundamental element of our democratic system.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The ending of the dual mandate has been advocated by a range of interests for some time. The Barrington report in 1990 recommended that simultaneous membership of local government and the national Parliament should end. Legislation passed the following year took the first step in this direction by disqualifying Ministers and Ministers of State from local authority membership. The second report of the Commission for the Status of Women also recommended the ending of the dual mandate as an opportunity for women to enter local government. Currently, only about 16% of councillors are women. Other bodies such as the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the National Youth Council and the General Council of County Councils have also called for the ending of the dual mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The Local Government Act 1994 disqualified the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and MEPs from local authority membership. It also provided that Members of the Oireachtas who were councillors could not, from the 1999 local elections onwards, hold the position of cathaoirleach or leas-chathaoirleach of a local authority. The White Paper, Better Local Government, committed the Government to consider further action after the 1999 local elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The Bill before us today, therefore, is the culmination of a considered process which has been moving progressively in this direction for well over a decade. It is also worth noting that it has been the stated policy of almost all political parties in this House that the dual mandate should end. Reflecting this, the Local Government Bill 2000 contained similar provisions to those before us. However, as Senators will be aware, they were deleted from the Bill during its passage. This was done to sustain the support of certain Deputies on whom the Government then depended for support in implementing its overall programme of economic and social progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">The reality is that the demands of local government have greatly increased over the past ten years or so. The range and complexity of local government functions, be they in the field of planning, infrastructure, housing or environmental services, have altered dramatically. Local authorities now have a greater role in promoting social inclusion and in local development initiatives generally. This is reflected in part in the varied and wide range of bodies to which local councillors are now appointed, which include Leader groups, port companies, health boards, county enterprise boards, county development boards and vocational education committees. Local councils now play a significant role in local community development groups, tourism promotion and tackling social exclusion. Such involvement is vital to provide for a more co-ordinated approach to local development and proper democratic input to meeting the wide rage of local community needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">At national level there has also been significant and parallel change. In recent years the parliamentary committee system has continued to develop and provide the opportunity for Members to have a much fuller role in the consideration of legislation and the overview of Government policy generally. The demands on Members' time have increased correspondingly. This is a trend which will undoubtedly intensify as Parliament evolves its key role under the Constitution, namely, "the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State".</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Against this background, it is clear that the difficulty for any individual of properly and simultaneously fulfilling both national and local roles can only become more acute in the years ahead. Any substance from gold to gossamer, if spread too thinly, will eventually become patchy. We cannot allow this to happen. As elected representatives of the people, it is our duty to ensure they are efficiently served within all the tiers of our democratic system.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">The ending of the dual mandate is an important change in the Irish context. For the first time since the foundation of the State local government will be in a position to develop its separate role within our democracy. Council chambers will no longer be subject to inappropriate external constraints such as national parliamentary timetables which heretofore have determined such basic matters as to when local authority meetings can take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">As already indicated, the Bill repeals legislative provisions currently in place which provide for the introduction of direct election of cathaoirligh of county-city councils in 2004. The Bill provides, therefore, that in 2004 the cathaoirleach will be chosen by the newly elected councillors from among their number as in the past. The ending of the dual mandate will bring about substantial change and, with the normal turnover at election time, there will be a large influx of new entrants to local government. These changes need time to bed down. The issue of the cathaoirleach's election and role will be considered in the light of experience of these changes and others in prospect.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">Apart from the Bill now before us, further actions are being taken to develop our local government system. A major independent study of local government funding will be undertaken and further measures to improve local authority performance and the role of the elected council developed. The review of the strategic policy committees, already well under way, will also feed into this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">It is my aim that over the lifetime of the Government we will see a major change agenda carried forward for local government – change which will underpin its democratic roots but with an emphasis on effectiveness and efficiency; change which will see local government bringing together the various State, community and other interests at local level. Crucially, I envisage that this change will see local government at the helm of local initiative and as the key focus in supporting economic and social development at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">I will turn now to a more detailed look at the provisions of the Bill. Section 1, for the purposes of the Bill, defines the principal Act as the Local Government Act, 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Section 2 inserts a new section 13A in the principal Act, the effect of which is to disqualify Oireachtas Members from being elected or co-opted or from being a member of a local authority. Section 13 of the 2001 Act already sets out a number of disqualifications. For example, Ministers, Ministers of State, MEPs, EU officeholders, judges, gardaí etc. are all disqualified from holding local authority membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Section 3 will allow Oireachtas Members, who so request a local authority, to be supplied with notice of meetings and agendas. Additionally, the Minister can issue guidelines to local authorities as to their dealings with Oireachtas Members. I envisage that such guidelines would be prepared and issued later this year. These will provide that Oireachtas Members continue to receive a satisfactory level of service in carrying out their representational role.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Section 4 provides for various amendments to the Local Government Act 2001 consequential on the substantive changes to the Act made by the Bill affecting the dual mandate and direct election of cathaoirligh. The discontinuation of the arrangements for direct election of cathaoirligh of county-city councils is effected by section 7 by way of the repeal of Chapter 3 of Part 5 of the Local Government Act 2001. The amendments set out in the Schedule are largely consequential on that repeal and the insertion of the new section 13A. The amendment to section 167 of the 2001 Act, however, clarifies that specified provisions of the new ethics regime apply to all local authority employees. These are a duty to maintain proper standards of integrity, a prohibition on seeking or accepting rewards arising from one's duties and a code of conduct. Section 5 amends section 97 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to insert a minor amendment omitted by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Section 6 amends the Local Elections Regulations, 1995. These amendments arise primarily from section 14 of the Local Government Act 2001 which prohibits multiple membership of local authorities, apart from membership of a county council and town council. For example, simultaneous membership of two or more county councils, or a city council, and a number of county councils is prohibited. The effect of the amendment to the regulations is that if a person stands for and is elected to a number of different local authorities, he or she must choose one and a casual vacancy then occurs in the others. Where the person does not so choose, he or she is deemed to have been elected where he or she received the highest vote. These arrangements mirror those already in place for many years which deal with election of the same person to a number of local electoral areas within the same local authority. As mentioned, the primary effect of section 7 is to repeal the provisions of the 2001 Act relating to the direct election of county-city cathaoirligh.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Before concluding I must digress and refer to the amendment opposing the Second Reading of the Bill. This would seem to be an opportunistic move by Fine Gael, though in reality it is a bewildering attempt to move in opposite directions simultaneously – to oppose the ending of the dual mandate, having strongly supported its ending in line with Fine Gael policy the last time such legislation was before the House—</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_195">It is out of place to expect this House to give the Local Government Bill 2003 a Second Reading given that it not only flies in the face of democracy as we know it but also asks us to sign our own death warrants in terms of local representation. Currently, nearly two thirds of the Members of this House are also members of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The Bill focuses on the abolition of the dual mandate but makes no adequate provision for the way Members of the Oireachtas will represent their constituents in respect of local matters, should it be passed. It is not accompanied by any real reform of the local authority system and fails to provide for a radical overhaul of the way services are provided and delivered. Statutory regulations, not guidelines, are imperative to direct local authorities on how they conduct their business with Oireachtas Members. Such regulations should have been published with the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">There is nothing in place to make provision for the following essential reforms: modernising local government; democratic renewal – following new ways of working giving local authorities new powers to lead their communities; new technology to improve services, deliver budgets for the term of the council, calculated on the basis of needs; and improving the internal efficiencies of local authorities to deliver services.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">One of the hottest topics for debate, the future funding of local authorities, is not addressed in the Bill. There are no recommendations regarding financing strategies for local authorities and we are left with real concerns about the delivery of properly funded local government services.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Regrettably, local authorities are too dependent on central Government. The abolition of rates and water charges, together with the promise of adequate funding to deliver services locally, were central decisions but the promise is a mockery given the current cutbacks, which see local authorities underfunded and unable to provide essential services. Where is the political will in this Bill to do something about this situation by establishing links between local taxation and local spending?</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Historically, Senators have no local constituency. Their constituency is the whole of Ireland and their function is to represent their "constituents" on a countrywide basis, inclusive of national and local matters. The ending of membership of both local authorities and the Seanad is nothing short of the choking of the oxygen supply to local areas. Far from double jobbing, Members do not get paid for sitting on councils. They see the dual role as the perfect marriage of local and national representation, which benefits the entire population. Dual membership provides a national platform for all Senators who wish to raise matters of local concern at national level, through motions, Private Members' Business, the Order of Business and so on. There is no better way to work than being a member of a local authority and having a strong electoral connection with local democracy. It greatly enhances the image of the Seanad and underpins its very effective community representation role. More importantly, it provides access to a national platform for the most marginalised community groups in the State. It is essential to keep in close contact with our citizens on the many issues which affect them and their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Is this Bill constitutionally sound?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_133" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">

          <p eId="para_202">Yes.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_203">Is the Government prepared to publish the Attorney General's opinion or would the grey areas he has probably found strengthen the case of those who oppose the Bill? By taking democracy out of the hands of the people, the Government is denying them their democratic right to decide their local representatives. This sort of disrespect for our Constitution would not be accepted in any other EU country. Unfortunately the Government does not appreciate or respect what Oireachtas Members have done for local government. It is choosing to override the democratic process. Our Constitution provides that no person may be a member of the Dáil and Seanad at the same time but it says nothing about being a member of both a local authority and the Oireachtas. Therefore, according to the Constitution, there is nothing to prevent anyone from being a member of a local authority and of Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">It was 1918 before women in this country got a vote and then it was only married women of 30 years or over. Women were debarred from membership of county and borough councils until 1911. One might say that is history but in 2003 another debarring order is about to be imposed on us. How can democratically elected Members of the Oireachtas be denied the right to take their places as leaders of their communities and to develop and shape those communities at both local and national levels?</p>
          <p eId="para_205">It is unconstitutional to deny the citizens of the State the right to elect whoever they want to serve them on local authorities. Voters must be allowed to have their say. The Government's change of mind in relation to the proposed direct election of mayors is an obvious indication that it is afraid to face the electorate in such elections. Its candidates would certainly suffer the consequences of the broken promises and widespread cutbacks since the general election. Under these proposals experienced people will be forced to leave local government. I assure the Minister that the offer of a financial sweetener, which is tantamount to a dubious pay-off, is no incentive to councillors, Senators and Deputies to give up their unpaid work for their local areas. The windows of opportunity opened after the passing of the Local Government Act 2001, but the Minister is pulling down the shades by introducing the Local Government Bill 2003. The people he is shoving off local councils have invaluable experience and knowledge of the local government system and, most importantly, they are the choice of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">What price democracy when that choice is arbitrarily removed from the electorate and it is no longer allowed to decide who represents it? My party has serious concerns about the Bill, which has fallen far short of the comprehensive and major reform we expected. Following the recent proposals in the Environment Protection Bill to remove certain powers from elected councillors and to give those powers to county or city managers, this Bill again hits at the core of local democracy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_135">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_207">I welcome this debate. The Minister gave a history of proposals to end the dual mandate, going back to the Barrington report of 1990, and I will discuss some related issues which have affected me and other Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">We should start with the role of the county councillor and I agree with Senator Bannon that that is very important. Perhaps the role of the councillor has not always received sufficient recognition from both the Government and the public. The previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was the first to introduce a modest payment for councillors, which I welcomed. It was something councillors were anxious to receive and I hope they will get more recognition, financial and otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">This short Bill ends dual membership of local authorities and Parliament, which will commence with the next local elections in 2004. The Government also said it would discontinue the arrangements currently in place to introduce direct elections of city and county cathaoirligh at the same time. I favoured the ending of the dual mandate and as a member of Galway County Council for 17 years I know of one practical reason for that, which the Minister also alluded. We spent a lot of time trying to arrange meetings because of the number of Oireachtas Members on our local authority and there were constant rows about the dates and times of meetings as a result. Obviously it is even more difficult now since the strategic policy committees require local authorities to meet more frequently. I was a member of the authority from 1975 and it always amazed me that Ministers could remain on the authority until the following local election. That caused even more difficulty in arranging meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Reform has been slow and gradual. In 1991 the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government brought in legislation providing that Ministers and Ministers of State automatically lost their local authority seats when they were appointed to Cabinet. I was a victim of that legislation as I was then a Minister of State and lost my local authority seat. Worse followed for my party as it did not get to co-opt my seat. At the time whoever had the majority took the seat, which was wrong. Deputy Noel Dempsey rectified that when he was Minister, stating that the party which lost the member would retain the seat. That is only right to ensure proper representation for different electoral areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The Minister did not go into too much detail about payments. Members who give up their seats by June should receive a decent amount. The scheme in 1999 paid local authority members on the basis of the length of service, up to a maximum of 20 years, with a highest payment of £20,000. It was a good scheme, particularly for retiring members, because those who availed of it and who want to stand in future local elections have to pay back the money received. It is interesting that this is not a retirement payment because recipients will be able to stand again for local elections in future without having to pay back the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">There was concern in 1999 about those with more than one dual mandate who retired from a local authority but who did not receive payment. The Minister made it clear that we are talking about local authorities where a person received the highest vote. People on health boards and vocational education committees feel they should be viewed in a more favourable light because they are giving up more than a local authority seat.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Section 3 deals with the entitlements of Oireachtas Members who request information – be it notice of meetings or agendas – from local authorities. The section states that the matters to which the guidelines may relate include correspondence with Members of either House, supply of information generally and such other matters as the Minister may consider appropriate and local authorities shall, in so far as is practical, follow these guidelines. That is the minimum. I hope that Oireachtas Members would be able to discuss estimates. They should also be able to discuss county development plans and receive prior notice of planning applications. I have not served on a local authority in ten years, but it is difficult to obtain information on planning, which is an important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Area meetings are also increasingly important. In County Galway there are five electoral areas and deputations attend their meetings. It is important that notice of such meetings and their agendas are given to Oireachtas Members. Area meetings are now being expanded to include extra community representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I have never been aware of support from councillors for directly elected mayors. The Minister compared the current situation to the manner in which we elect the Taoiseach. We elect Deputies and, by vote in the Dáil, they elect the Taoiseach. This is what councillors have been doing and the system works well. There is a chance to rotate the position. There is no ground-swell of support to change the <i>status quo</i>. However, Members opposite possess information I do not have about the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Why do so many officials have not just a dual but a triple or quadruple mandate? I come across the same people on enterprise boards, Leader boards and tourism boards. This is difficult to understand. Last year I was trying to assist a person to secure funding for a very good tourism project. I brought him to talk to an enterprise board, but the funding was refused. I said I would try the Leader board, but the official to whom I spoke told me that he would be there as well and that the request for funding would again be refused. I then met the same person at a meeting of the tourism board. The same people were probably sitting on the Western Development Board. It does not make sense to have the same people sit on so many agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Other issues arise in respect of advisory and research groups. A group is currently looking at manpower in the health services. A number of chief executive officers and managers are members of that group and they say they are acting in consultancy roles. However, the work they do for the group takes away from their work as executives. This matter should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The Oireachtas enjoys an effective committee system, of which the DIRT inquiry led by the late Deputy Jim Mitchell was a good example. The latter showed what can be achieved by committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">There is no constraint, in terms of membership, for those who are prepared to work hard on local authorities. We could, however, improve the situation for Senators. The Minister for Finance has greatly improved facilities for Oireachtas Members in general, but most of those improvements were for Deputies. The work of Senators is similar to that of Deputies, but Senators do not each have a secretary or office and receive little help to maintain their constituency offices. The Government should look at this area. One Oireachtas Member who is also a member of a health board told me that if he was chairman of that board, some of the money he would receive would go to maintaining a constituency office. That demonstrates Senators' desire to serve the public. The option that Deputies have to employ a secretary in either their constituency or in the Oireachtas should be available to Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Senators should be able to maintain contact with their electorate, namely, councillors. I do not know what reform will be implemented in the Seanad when the committee publishes its report, but Senators must keep in contact through conferences and meetings and should be offered help to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">In welcoming the Bill, I wish to underline the improvements which have been made in the role of public representatives generally. The previous Minister for Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was very keen to have that reform and I greatly welcome his achievements for the benefit of local authority members. The current Minister, Deputy Cullen, has made a great deal of progress in a very short time in continuing that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Because of this Bill, there will be opportunities for new people to become involved in politics. The Minister has already referred to the fact that only 16% of county councillors are women. Greater involvement in politics by women and young people would be a very welcome development as a result of this Bill and I hope a substantial number of them come forward. Vacancies will have been created already because Oireachtas Members will not be contesting seats or will have the opportunity to give up their seats. Accordingly, there will be opportunities for new candidates in the local elections next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I welcome the Bill to advance the reform of local government and congratulate the Minister on introducing it. I hope the Minister will take on board some of the points I have made as to how Oireachtas Members can relate to local government and be involved in it.</p>

I agree with Senator Bannon's submission on the constitutionality issue. For example, Article 15.14 requires that no person may, at the same time, be a Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas. If any Member of one House becomes a Member of the other House, he or she is deemed to have forfeited his or her first seat. Similarly, in Article 12.2, if a Member of either House of the Oireachtas is elected President of Ireland, he or she is deemed to have vacated his or her seat in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Why was it deemed necessary to spell that out in the Constitution rather than in ordinary legislation? I believe it was because of the important role of the people in the Constitution, which derives its validity from the people. Similarly, elected public representatives and governments obtain their mandate and validity from the people, from whom our authority and powers ultimately derive. The right of citizens to vote in Dáil elections is enshrined in the Constitution. For that reason, I believe there is no way to compel a Deputy or Senator to give up his or her seat other than through the Constitution, on the grounds that he or she has been elected to one of the other Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">In Article 28 A(2), local government has been similarly enshrined in the Constitution. Directly elected local authorities are subject to the provisions of the Constitution and the right to vote is given to every citizen who has a right to vote in Dáil elections and such others as may be determined by law. As in the case of the Oireachtas, the mandate and powers for local government come from the people. Indeed, the mandate is even broader than that for Dáil elections in that, under European law, non-nationals may stand for election to local authorities, once they meet the same legal criteria as national candidates. On that basis, I do not believe local councillors can be compelled to give up their seats once they are elected, unless that is provided for in the Constitution. Nobody would suggest that an elected Deputy or Senator could be compelled to give up his or her seat. Why should we feel free to do so in legislation in relation to county councillors? The legislation itself—</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_230">If the Minister will allow me to finish, I will go into that and explain it. The wording of the Bill itself signifies that there is a problem, legally and constitutionally. It does not just prevent one from holding a seat; it actually prevents one from running for election. The proposed new section 13A states that one cannot be elected to a local authority if one is a Member of either House of the Oireachtas. That is a recognition of the fact that one cannot take away the mandate and powers an elected local councillor derives from the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The problem from the Minister's point of view – and the factor which dooms this Bill to failure – is that a councillor can run for election to the Dáil. I do not see how such an elected person can be compelled to give up their seat unless appropriate provision is made in the Constitution. That is largely where the constitutional challenge will lie.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The Minister has spoken of separating national and local government, but in reality he wants to have it both ways. He is not going to prevent councillors from running for the Dáil or the Seanad. He cannot have it both ways. By setting out to do so, he is leaving a constitutional loophole.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The Minister also referred to previous legislation. My first argument is that it has not been challenged and, second, it is different in that the disqualifications already existing in the Local Government Act 2001 largely relate to incompatibility or a conflict of interest. Ministers are appointed to their positions. A county councillor cannot "run" for appointment as a Minister. It is different in that sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">In relation to the European Parliament, one is not prohibited from being both a Deputy and an MEP but one is prohibited from being a Minister and an MEP. That is because a conflict of interest arises. If one is a Minister, one may be involved in negotiations with the European Parliament and local authorities. Clearly, there is a specific reason behind that legislation which is not present in relation to the provisions of this Bill. Being a Deputy or Senator does not involve that type of relationship or give rise to any conflict of interest. I do not accept that there is any disability or incapacity which could be argued in court to justify the provisions in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Another problem arises, giving grounds for legal challenge, where a non-party or independent councillor is elected to the Dáil. Under this Bill, the mandate of those people who voted for such non-party representation in the local authority will, effectively, be pushed aside as the outgoing non-party councillor will not have the opportunity to nominate a successor. The position will be filled by the majority group in the council and will, most likely, go to a member of a political party, thereby taking away the democratic rights of those who elected an independent councillor.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The Minister has put great emphasis on the provision in the Bill to reward those who give up their elected mandate before a date well in advance of the local elections. That involves financial discrimination as between those who avail of that provision and those who serve out their electoral mandate. I believe that is open to legal challenge. It takes away the rights of the people who elect county councillors. Those who serve out their full term are serving democracy, as they are supposed to do. The widespread co-option of non-elected people to local authorities as a consequence of this Bill is, undoubtedly, a subversion of the very local democracy which we enshrined in Article 28 A of the Constitution in 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Other constitutional provisions which give grounds for challenge to this Bill include Article 1, which gives the nation the choice of its own form of government and Article 40, which gives the people the right to express their own convictions and opinions. I also refer to Article 2, which gives rights to people in Northern Ireland. I believe this Bill will be found to discriminate against some citizens of this country as opposed to others. There is nothing to stop Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly running in local elections in the South, subject to fulfilling the residency requirements, as I have no doubt they will if it comes to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">This Bill is also open to challenge because of the inequality and unfairness it brings about. It singles out Members of the Oireachtas. It does not prohibit a Deputy from being a Member of the European Parliament and <i>vice versa</i>, yet it does not allow national politicians to transfer to local government without resigning their seats. One may transfer from European to national politics; one may transfer from local government to national politics, but the one transfer which will be prohibited under this Bill is from national to local politics without giving up one's seat in either House of the Oireachtas. That is my understanding of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">In relation to the European aspect, Directive 94/80 EC gives non-nationals the right to run as candidates in local elections if they fulfil the same criteria as national citizens. In this regard also, a case could arise in terms of discrimination against Members of the Oireachtas. Senator Bannon spoke of this Bill as being regressive rather than progressive, by introducing bars to running for local government rather than opening it up to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Senator Bannon mentioned the way women had been debarred. The Minister referred to the National Women's Council and the opportunity for women to run for office. Only 10% of county councillors are Oireachtas Members. That is not going to make a major difference to the participation of women in local democracy. Much more fundamental measures are needed to deal with the lack of participation by women in local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I recently read a book published in 1972 about practices of the Seanad which noted that, in 1961, a joint committee on electoral law recommended that existing legal disqualifications should be removed in respect of the Dáil and the Seanad. The committee said that electors must be regarded as mature enough to elect representatives of the type they want, and to take the consequences should the persons elected become incapable of acting during the period of office by reason of imprisonment, mental instability, bankruptcy and so on. That same committee wanted to remove the disqualifications in respect of civil servants wishing to seek election. The committee members wanted to move forward. They had an idea of voters being mature enough to make their own decisions about who they would like to be their public representatives. They wanted to remove disqualifications in order to open up our democracy. This legislation is doing the reverse, and it is a bad precedent. Instead of the philosophy of trusting voters, it is the philosophy of telling the people what the Government thinks is good for them. That is a backward step.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I believe that the roles of Oireachtas Member and local authority member are complementary, not incompatible. I am happy that as a county councillor I bring something to the Seanad. Other professions bring their own perspectives to the Dáil and Seanad. There are many business people, barristers, doctors, solicitors and others practising their professions while Members of the Oireachtas. We do not object to them bringing their perspectives to the Oireachtas. It will be a loss to both Houses to lose the local government perspective. County councillors have their ears to the ground and would know, for example, much more about the housing problems at first hand. They are generally the ones who raise such issues in these Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The argument that one must separate the role of national legislator from that of local politician is ridiculous. As Tip O'Neill said, all politics are local, and there is no national legislation which does not have a local dimension – and no local issue which does not also have a national and legislative dimension. In other countries, national politicians can hold local authority seats. Ireland is a much smaller country than many of these, and much more manageable in terms of holding a dual mandate. If a national politician in France can also be a local councillor, I do not see why the dual mandate is not possible in Ireland. It is not compulsory to hold the dual mandate, and those Oireachtas Members who do not want to sit on local authorities or feel they cannot manage it should make the choice themselves, rather than having it imposed on them, as is proposed in this legislation. One can be a Member of the Oireachtas as well as being an MEP, and that is not considered legally unmanageable. I do not see why being a Member of the Oireachtas and the local council is not more manageable and defensible. It is absurd that while one will be allowed to hold two full-time elected positions, as an Oireachtas Member and an MEP, this legislation will not allow an Oireachtas Member to hold a part-time elected position on the local council.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Minister has suggested in the media that in future, local councillors should be full-time. Can he be serious about this, in a small country like Ireland? Apart from the fact that we would lose many prospective participants in local government, the whole idea of local government is that it should be representative of the community. To suggest at the same time as saying we should have fewer TDs that we should have 1,000 councillors on full-time salaries is ridiculous. The public would not accept that.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">It would be bad for local government if the dual mandate were abolished. That is my personal opinion, which I have always stated. This legislation comes from a very patronising and dictatory point of view, the same view which threatens that councils can be abolished if they do not adopt their estimates. That is unconstitutional, because the wording in the constitutional amendment of 1999 under Article 28A is that there shall be such directly elected local authorities. It is the wording "directly elected" which makes unconstitutional the threat held over county councils that they might be abolished and replaced by an unelected commissioner. That is why the Minister is bringing in legislation to take away the power from the elected representatives. He knows that under the Constitution it is no longer defensible to hold that threat over county councillors.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">As Senator Bannon and others have mentioned, we can see that more and more powers are being taken away from local government. The one reform which might have shifted power away the county manager and towards the elected and accountable public representative is being removed in this Bill. The abolition of the dual mandate indicates that the lack of regard for local democracy will continue. At national level, ultimately in Fianna Fáil, what is still left of social democracy, in the persons of the Oireachtas Members who are local authority members, will eventually disappear.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I would say to those on the Government benches that this Bill is just the beginning. Seanad reform may well bring an end to councillors voting in Seanad elections. The Minister has indicated in relation to the Dáil that he foresees reforms relating to fewer Dáil seats and list voting. That is according to the media recently. If the Minister brings in full-time paid councillors he may well reduce their numbers, or the numbers of local authorities, to make it financially feasible.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">As for those not favoured by the Fianna Fáil or PD leaderships in the last Seanad elections, who nevertheless achieved election on their own merits, I would warn them that their parties are beginning to phase them out. If they vote for this Bill, they are indeed like turkeys voting for Christmas.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_250">Is there anybody I should welcome?</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I accept the need for this Bill and I will support it when there is a division, yet I have reservations to which I will come presently. I note what the Minister had to say regarding the Barrington report of 1990, a very authoritative report which recommended the abolition of the dual mandate. The Commission on the Status of Women subsequently did the same, as did the general council of county councils, the chambers of commerce of Ireland and the National Youth Council. There is unquestionably quite a body of authoritative opinion supporting the abolition of the dual mandate, and regard must be taken of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">We must also accept a diversity of views not just within the Houses but within the political parties. The amendment on the Order of Business today was quite opportunistic in its approach, because it concentrated on the constitutional aspects of the Bill while not confronting what the party's formal position might be with regard to the same Bill. This was a very convenient refuge. It is not for us to decide whether or not the Bill is constitutional. That is a matter for the courts, and we are conscious of the separation of powers between these Houses and the Judiciary. That does not preclude people from having a view on these matters. People must be free to express such views.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">I recall equal status legislation where I believe Senator O'Toole took the view that a particular section might be unconstitutional. It was to do with the right of people with disabilities to equal treatment. The then President referred that Bill to the Supreme Court, and it was indeed found to be unconstitutional, but with regard to a section which had not attracted much attention. We must leave such matters to the courts. We proceed with legislation, and if it must then be tested, so be it. I doubt too if any individual will succeed in a case to declare the removal of the dual mandate unconstitutional. That again may be tested in the courts. There are precedents with regard to the European Parliament and Dáil Éireann dual mandate that suggest that a case taken on this ground would not be successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I accept the Minister's point that the work of a public representative has become increasingly onerous. At county council level, and I declare an interest as a member of one, representatives are confronted with an increasing number of SPCs, committees and Leader groups. The degree of work that has to be done by Oireachtas Members is increasing, particularly in terms of servicing joint committees, the all-party committee on the Constitution, the Forum for Europe and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. The scope of Members' work has also widened, outside constituency work and the normal day-to-day politics. It is difficult to marry these positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">There is also the issue of county councils arranging meetings on Mondays and Fridays so as not to clash with the parliamentary week. I understand this is not a satisfactory arrangement, but it is inevitable due to the dual membership at local government level and national level. This is another argument for the abolition of the dual mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I have some sympathy for the points expressed by Senator Tuffy, in particular that the people are sovereign. I have expressed this viewpoint at my own party meetings, though it is a minority view rather than a majority one. The people decide. If in their wisdom, they decide that a person is suitable to be a member of several bodies, that is their prerogative. If they decide their representatives are unsatisfactory, then it is their prerogative at the next election to remove them. We tread in dangerous waters if this sovereign right of the people is removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">There is no possibility of Senators losing touch with their electorate. I cannot imagine this happening, whether or not there is a dual mandate. Every elected Member of both Houses keeps in touch with the electorate. If not, they will not be re-elected. I doubt if the complexion of this House will vary dramatically when the dual mandate is abolished. There is though a point of difference between the Seanad and the Dáil. The Seanad is a vocational Chamber and it was always accepted that Members would have outside, paid employment. That is a subtle distinction between this House and the Dáil. In that context, there might be a case for treating both Houses differently. However, I accept that for reasons of consistency and practicality, it would have to apply to both.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Another issue that arises is the decision not to proceed with the direct election of mayors. If the electorate decides to elect someone to office that the general body politic regards as an unsuitable holder, that is up to the people, not the general body politic. That is why I have always favoured the direct election of mayors. One aspect that makes this case different is the chairing of county council and corporation meetings, which requires a certain degree of knowledge of how the system works and certain skills in conducting meetings. This can only be acquired through membership of a local authority. It would be unusual for someone to be elected to the chair of a local authority on their first day. Nevertheless, I do believe it would be right to have such elections and that the tenure of such officers should run in conjunction with the term of the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">It was a step forward that the ministerial prerogative allowing local authority elections to be postponed indefinitely was removed. We can argue what the length of the period should be, but it must still be defined. The chair of a local authority should then occupy that position for the whole period. In my council in County Kildare, there is effectively a coalition between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The chair rotates on an annual basis and, though it works satisfactorily for all parties, there is a need for a continuity. I favour giving more powers in controlling the executive to the position of chairman. The council does have some control but it may need to be strengthened. This is, however, an argument for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The other issue that needs to be examined in the abolition of the dual mandate is subsidiarity – the degree to which decisions can be made at local level. I do not mean it in the strict EU sense of the word. If representatives will not be moving between the Oireachtas and local authorities, then there needs to be a look at how subsidiarity will work. Commendable attempts have been made in the past by Governments to devolve more functions to the local authorities, but they have not always been successful and some members of local authorities refused to accept more responsibilities. This was evident in the case of legislation on waste disposal, when some local authority members would not take on the extra responsibilities associated with it. In those circumstances, I agree with the Minister that decisions must be made effectively, even if the powers to do so are devolved to a local authority executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">I note there will be a study on the issue of local authority funding but I think there have been too many. There needs to be coherence in these studies. In County Kildare, there is a rapidly growing population and infrastructural difficulties. I accept there are counties in the west where the population is in decline and certain infrastructural problems have to be addressed regardless. However, the rapidly growing counties around Dublin have been penalised by the very fact that they cannot raise the revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Yesterday in the House, the Valuation Office was raised on the Order of Business, an issue which must be attended to very soon. The rates revenue of councils is affected by their inability to get the rateable valuations established for businesses that are coming into their areas. Local government is now big business – the current budget of Kildare County Council is €80 million. It is an onerous task for the council members and executive to manage that budget effectively and properly to the advantage of the people and clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The Minister referred to ethics and the Act of 2001. I accept the need for an ethical standard which applies to all local government employees. However there needs to be distinction between the codes of practice and compliance. Every member has an obligation to declare their interest but the system has become overly bureaucratic. It would not be the Minister's intention that people at the lower levels should have the same onus of compliance in terms of form-filling, etc., that applies at the higher levels, but there must be a standard.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_266">I welcome the Minister to the House. I second the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator Bannon. When Better Local Government was introduced by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, he stated that greater powers would be extended to local authority members, that bureaucracy and duplication would be cut out, that there would be directly elected mayors and that the dual mandate would go. What have we seen since that Better Local Government document was produced?</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The last Government was to abolish the dual mandate but it backed down because of pressure from some Independents. It was still intent on going ahead with the introduction of directly elected mayors. We have seen bureaucracy increase in local authorities and local authority members being stripped of many of their powers by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, in areas such as waste management and planning. Members of the Government are running around like headless chickens. What they propose in one instance they go back on and then reintroduce. We do not know what they are at.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Senator Kitt asked if Members would continue to sit on sub-committees such as health boards, vocational education committees and regional authorities. There is an obvious answer. If one is not a member of a local authority, of course one cannot be a member of those bodies. That obviously strips Members of their powers in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The Minister referred to access by Oireachtas Members to local authorities should this Bill go through and said he would introduce guidelines at a later stage. Why does he not place all his cards on the table now? Why are these guidelines not before us for discussion in tandem with this Bill? We are really putting the cart before the horse in this regard. We are not getting all the information.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Senator Tuffy eloquently discussed the question of the constitutionality of this Bill. My party also has doubts about its constitutionality. It may be tested in the courts at a later stage. Why not put before us the Attorney General's advice on constitutionality of the Bill? Perhaps then we would be more informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Senator Tuffy asked if this debars councillors from standing for election to the Seanad and to the Dáil. The Minister is debarring Oireachtas Members from being members of local authorities. Does the opposite apply? Senator Tuffy quite rightly mentioned that this could be the question which would test the constitutionality of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Senator Dardis raised his reservations also. Many Fianna Fáil Senators and Deputies have expressed their reservations but they have obviously come like sheep behind this Bill for whatever reason – certainly not on principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I am worried about making bad law. No law is better than bad law and what the Minister is introducing here, without having all the information put before us, could be deemed bad law. It is all very well to speak of giving greater powers to local authorities. Words are fine, but the actions have not followed through in that regard. If one asked local authority members whether they were better off before Better Local Government or after it, many would say they were much worse off, that more powers were being vested in officials and unelected persons rather than in local authority members.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I have expressed my reservations, as will many other speakers. We are certainly concerned about the constitutionality of the Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_275">I too welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this legislation. Reform of local government is something every public representative welcomes. Many attempts have been made by successive Ministers to achieve this. Looking back on the past six Ministers for the Environment, it is true to say that under the two Fianna Fáil Ministers, Deputies Cullen and Noel Dempsey, local government reform has been started and much has been achieved to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Since the last local elections, local authority SPCs systems were introduced whereby public representatives worked together with community groups' representatives, management and sectional interests in the formation of policies at local authority level. We also recognise the role which dual mandate Members have played in the development of our local authorities. It is indeed a great honour, given by people at elections to public representatives, to serve and represent the electorate on a local authority. I deeply respect and treasure this honour given to me over the past 19 years by the people of County Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Under this legislation, the dual mandate will end in June 2004. I also treasure the greatest honour elected public representatives can get, that is, to be nominated as one of the Taoiseach's eleven. Senator Tuffy warned that we are on the way out, but I can assure the Opposition Members that the people on this side of the House have greater plans ahead for those Members as public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I ask the Minister to look seriously at the access which Oireachtas Members will have at local authority level. I refer to minutes and reports of council meetings and SPCs and a right of reply by county managers and staff to correspondence from Members. It was said that this will be done by directive. It is most important that the Minister take on board Members' concerns in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Under the existing regulations, retiring councillors qualify for a retirement gratuity. This has been mentioned by previous speakers. I refer to local authority members who may be retiring in June 2004. The County Councils General Council – I welcome its director, Liam Kenny, who is in the gallery – and LAMA have, in the past, made clear to the Minister their concerns about service by elected members, some of whom have given more than 30 years of service to their local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I ask the Minister to review the legislation, taking into consideration that many councillors not included in the dual mandate will be retiring next June. The constitutionality of the Bill has been questioned, but our job is to achieve better local government through legislation so that is a matter for another day. I wish the Minister well and congratulate him on what has been achieved to date.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_281">I welcome the Minister to the House, in which he has recently been spending much time. The Bill has been long awaited, particularly by those of us who are members of local authorities. My colleague, Senator Tuffy, has clearly elucidated some legal issues, so I will speak about the political aspect of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">This is a short Bill, designed specifically to abolish the dual mandate. In other words, its aim is to prevent Members of the Oireachtas, ourselves included, from also serving on local authorities. There are different sides to the issue. From a logical point of view, in order to do one's job properly, either as a Member or as a councillor, one should not mix or be involved in both areas. That makes sense, given that in recent years the amount of work for county councillors has increased considerably. I am aware of this on foot of my membership of a county council, an SPC and, consequently, a joint library committee. One needs to concentrate on the policy side through the SPC. It is easy to see why the two jobs should be separated.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Like many Members, I have put a great deal of thought into this matter. Local and national politics are intertwined, particularly in this House. When this matter first came up for debate during the term of the last Dáil, I made the point that the relationship between Senators and councillors is different from, for example, that of Deputies and councillors. The reason is that we are elected by councillors and, therefore, have a direct relationship with local government. Being a member of a local authority is important in terms of one's relationship with county councillors. I have discussed this with a number of county councillors and I know they would like to feel that the route we took to get here was reflected in our work. This special relationship should be reflected in the legislation, but that is not the case. The Bill makes no distinction between Senators and Deputies, regardless of whether those Senators are elected by councillors. I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">As other speakers stated, this proposal would be far easier to swallow if it was being introduced in the context of a major reform of local government. However, those of us who are members of local authorities know that, if anything, our role is being diminished as each day passes. One need only consider another Bill – the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 – currently before the House which again reduces the role of elected members on the local authority by enhancing the functions of the county manager, taking powers away from the county council. We are looking at a framework not of enhanced power for the local authority member, but of a diminished role. That makes this proposal even less acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">This is not happening in the context in which it should be. I suspect it is happening for purely political reasons, namely, to allow the major Government party to maximise its position in advance of next year's local elections. We will see how that works out in terms of the public response to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">This is not a Bill to reform local government; it is aimed at reducing it in size. Fellow members of North Tipperary County Council feel that the council will be worse off when it loses the Oireachtas Members because it is they who can contest most strongly the power of the manager. One of the reasons for this is that being Members, especially of this House, gives us access to information that is extremely useful at local authority level. These developments could diminish the role of the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I do not want to take away from the contribution made by county councillors who are not Members of the Oireachtas. The councillor – the person in question is not a member of my party – who said this to me is not a Member, nor has he any ambitions to be. He sees, however, that the strongest voices on the local authority are those of the Members of the Oireachtas. When they are removed, the voice of the local authority will be weaker, especially when it comes to taking on the manager. My concerns are made greater by the fact that this is happening against the background of a reduction in power for the elected member.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">In my opinion, a political decision has been made to abolish the concept of directly elected mayors. If such positions had been created, the holders would have been capable of disputing managers' decisions. Directly elected mayors would have had the advantage of holding a mandate and being in office for a period of five years would have enabled them to engage in forward planning. A period of 12 months is extremely short in terms of being able to put in place initiatives, implement plans or work through a strategy. The loss of the office of directly elected mayors will again diminish the role of councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The Bill is a framework of diminution, undermining and weakening of position. As a Member of this House who was elected by members of local authorities, I cannot support it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_148">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_290">I welcome the Minister back to the Seanad, which he has frequented on a number of occasions recently. I am glad he is spending time here to debate the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">As the Minister is aware, I have some difficulties with the Bill because I have a direct connection with some of the issues that arise. The Government and the Office of the Attorney General have given their approval and the Bill is now before the House, so Fine Gael's amendment is rather unusual. The amendment prejudges the Bill before it has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and sent to the President for signing. The President may decide to refer it to the Council of State, which may, in turn, refer it to the Supreme Court. It is also open to any individual to bring the Bill before the court, so there are many opportunities for people to challenge its validity. The Minister would not bring the Bill before the House if he did not have the full support of the Attorney General and the Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">This legislation is not unprecedented. Ministers and Ministers of State were deprived of membership of councils in 1991. They say lightning does not strike twice, but in my case it has done so. I served as Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing and, until 1991, I received numerous letters from the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, asking when I might leave the local authority. There was always a good reason not to leave, whether it was the forthcoming election of the cathaoirleach or some other important issue. I did not seek or receive any subsistence at that point because I was a Minister of State, but I attended the majority of meetings – I had one of the best attendance records – and managed to combine the roles of Deputy, Minister of State and councillor. I did not stand for election to the council in 1991 because of the legislation, I lost my Dáil seat in 1992 and I lost my Seanad seat in 1993.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_151">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_295">It is important that the Minister makes the role of Oireachtas Members clear in this legislation, giving them a right of access to local authorities. I respectfully suggest that the term "the local authority should, as far as is practicable, comply with guidelines" be deleted from the legislation. If local authorities are given a way out, they will take it.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I wanted to continue in public life despite not being a Deputy, Senator or councillor, so when I was appointed to the Western Health Board by the Government, I worked at the job full-time because I was committed to returning to this House. During the period in question I sought a meeting with the housing officer on behalf of a constituent who had come to me because I had served as a Deputy for 15 and a half years and as a councillor for 17 years. At the meeting, a phone call came through from the secretary of the county council instructing that the meeting be terminated. It was hurtful that, after my service in public life, I was treated in this manner and that I no longer counted in terms of representing the people of County Roscommon. I made a strong case to the then Minister, Deputy Howlin because I considered taking a constitutional case on whether I could represent the people. The file is in the Department. The Minister had no legislation to instruct the county manager or the executive to communicate with me as a former member of the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The unique protocol we arranged was that I wrote to the Minister on representations to the local authority on housing, roads, local employment schemes, etc., and he communicated these to the county manager who replied to him within seven days. The Minister then replied to me and I informed the constituent of the position. It was an unnecessary situation, but, I must admit, I got a tremendous response to my representations. I returned to the council in 1999, heading the poll for Fianna Fáil in the mid-Roscommon area and delivering three out of five seats.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_299">Deputy Howlin was helpful at the time and the arrangement continued when Deputy Noel Dempsey became Minister for the Environment and Local Government. If I had informed the electorate that I had become useless because I could not make representations, I would not have been re-elected so I had to suppress my public denouncement of the council at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I met the county manager at the Easter parade in Strokestown in 1999 and asked him if he would lift the boycott given that I was standing for election to the council that June. He told me he would not do so until I was elected. I was duly elected and I resumed a meeting with the same housing officer on behalf of a different constituent and asked him, since he was still there and I had returned, could the meeting continue, which it did.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">On foot of my personal experience, I believe it is imperative that this provision be included in the Bill. One can have regulations, but the local authority must respond to Oireachtas Members and ensure they are met by the executive and officials, that their concerns on behalf of constituents are heard and that the right of access to documentation is assured. The Minister has said that agendas and minutes would be circulated and that is welcome but there are circumstances when a Member should be able to seek to be heard at a meeting of their local authority whether they have been members or are seeking to become members.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Last Monday's meeting of Roscommon County Council discussed a major development on the Boyle road, which is of concern to me as a member of the council. If I had known the matter was on the agenda, I should have been able to contact the convenor of the meeting to indicate that I wished to attend and make a contribution. This should also be the case in relation to bypasses such as that in Ballaghadereen. Membership of a local authority is important and has been the beginning of many people's political careers, including those of the Minister, myself and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">As Members of the Seanad, councillors are our electorate. I accept the argument that the role of Deputies and Senators will be greatly enhanced in the public eye. Will the Minister make provisions for Members to attend, by right, seminars or conferences of national organisations such as the General Council of County Councils and the health boards and meet the councillors who comprise their electorate?</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I ask that councillors' years of service be taken into account in relation to pension rights or, at least, that there should be some recognition of their situation. If a member of the local authority vacates their seat during the period 4 May until the end of June, any position they hold on that local authority should be held by the group they represent and that should be embodied in the legislation. If a vacancy occurs on a county council at present, the vacancy is filled by the party that loses that seat. If a member resigns from an authority on the basis of the Bill and he or she is a member of a health board, that party may lose that seat and if he or she is a member of a regional authority, he or she may lose that seat. In the interest of equity, the party that loses a seat due to the resignation of a member should retain that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Each local authority member should complete their term of office in 2004. I was elected in 1999 and I fought to get back, so I am reluctant to give up the seat prematurely. I wish to finish my term in 2004, but I also wish to be re-elected to this House or elected to the Dáil.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_306">I thank the Minister for staying in the House and listening to the contributions of Senators. Unfortunately, some of his colleagues make a speech and leave. That there is a difference of opinion in all parties is quite clear. The futility of consistency in respect of all parties arguing for this can be put to one side. There have been many fine speeches from the Fianna Fáil benches, Senators Dardis and Tuffy, among others, putting the case for why this legislation is suspect. The difference of opinion in parties is healthy and we should not be afraid of Members coming to the House with an independent mind prepared to state their opinions. I made this point when we had a debate on Seanad reform. Members should not be tied down by party political policy on this. That is what the Seanad should stand for.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Reference has been made to the amendment my colleagues and I have tabled in respect of the Second Reading of the Bill. Standing Order 104 allows it to proceed where there is reasoned opposition to the basic provisions proposed. Fine Gael has set out three reasons it believes the Bill is premature and will not support its Second Reading. This is consistent with the position we have taken on the issue in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">There is a perceived wisdom that the difference between our national Parliament and councils will be good for local government. This wisdom has been supported by a number of laudable national organisations. I do not find the public arguing for this. While members of the public come to me and other Members with a wide variety of issues – not only local ones – this is not an issue that has been brought to my attention. It is interesting to cite a number of national organisations as backing the call but it does not necessarily reflect public opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Unfortunately, we have witnessed a "dumbing down" of mandates in politics at both national and local level. That we frequently undermine the mandate we receive is a party political problem. The Bill is part of the process of undermining the mandate elected representatives receive from the public. This is an issue to which the courts will return if the Bill is passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I was taken by the contribution of Senator Tuffy where she set out the serious doubts she held about the constitutionality of provisions in the Bill. The Minister did not indicate a constitutional reasoning to counter the arguments made. Perhaps he will do so at the end of Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Article 40 of the Constitution deals with the notion of fundamental rights to all citizens. It does not distinguish between politicians and non-politicians or farmers and non-farmers. Article 40.6.1º refers to the right of citizens to freely express their convictions and opinions. One could argue that the Bill is repugnant to that Article as it gives power to the Oireachtas to tell the public whom it can and cannot vote for. This is repugnant to Article 40.6.1.i as it is a denial of the fundamental right of citizens to freely express their convictions and opinions. If I am not on the ticket in my ward at next election, it could be argued by citizens who vote for me that this is a diminution of their right to express their opinions and convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Article 40.6.1. iii enshrines the right of citizens to form associations and unions. This is wider than the notion of labour law; it deals with political parties, even though there is no mention of political parties in the Constitution. This is an issue to which we should return. Article 40.6.2º states: "Laws regulating the manner in which the right of forming associations and unions and the right of free assembly may be exercised shall contain no political, religious or class discrimination". It is arguable that excluding certain classes of politician from exercising their right to be elected to a local authority is repugnant to this Article.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I have only referred to Article 40. Senator Tuffy made a good case for the rights of Deputies and Senators. The Constitution clearly states one cannot be a Deputy and a Senator but it is silent on everything else. We must ask ourselves if we are opening a more difficult situation were this to be opposed in the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">If Fianna Fáil supports the ending of the dual mandate, in principle, and sees it as good for the party, it should implement it within the party. The Green Party has a principled position; once a councillor is elected to the Oireachtas he or she automatically leaves the council.</p>

That is the reason the legislation could come unstuck. A case could be successfully mounted on the provisions of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Reference has been made to directly elected mayors. The direct election of mayors would be a good thing. I ask the Minister to consider piloting this in a number of cities at the next local government elections.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_321">The Leader has more experience which should be heard in her contribution. It would be good if we were to pilot directly elected mayoral elections in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway. We must think of new ways of engaging the public with local government – the number of citizens who vote in local government elections is small. We have seen the success of this in London and there is a case for it to be introduced in Dublin, Cork and Galway. I ask the Minister to consider this on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Members of the Oireachtas who are not local councillors frequently fail to put into practice locally what they preach here. At my local council I supported the provision of a halting site and a Government Deputy voted against it, even though it represented Government policy. One of the benefits of keeping Members of the Oireachtas as members of councils is that it ensures we must practice what we preach locally. I have heard the Minister speak about this in the past and he was right. Too many Members of these Houses who are not county councillors hide on important issues such as waste management, zoning and Travellers. It is arguable that some of the hardest decisions one must make as a politician are local as they confront people with changes that must occur in their community. That is one of the inherent benefits of our system which we should not overlook.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_323">I congratulate the Minister on his interest in this matter. He is spending a great deal of time in the House. I welcome the Bill for a number of reasons but particularly because it modernises and enhances the role of local government while strengthening the role of Oireachtas Members. How many times at election time have we heard somebody say: "We have not seen you since the last election"? This is particularly the case at local elections when that cry is heard everywhere. These changes can only improve the representation of communities at local level. We have been given much free legal advice this morning but I have confidence in the Attorney General's acceptance of the Bill which will be proven over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Many Senators have expressed concerns about access to officials and meetings at local authority level. The Minister has succeeded in addressing these concerns by providing for Members to have direct access to certain information regarding meetings and agendas. I am confident that the further instructions he intends to issue to local authorities will ensure Members who wish to have access will be treated with due respect and able to continue to serve the interests of their constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I am a new Member of this House and have not had the privilege of serving on a local authority. Nevertheless, during the years I have worked closely with councillors and officials at all levels. I have found that once a relationship is built up with an individual it is possible to reach a point where information is accessible. A local representative will have a network of local contacts, particularly in Dublin where the thrust of city council policy has been to decentralise its services throughout the city. In many cases officials are only too happy to share information and co-operate with local representatives, regardless of whether they are Members of the Dáil or Seanad. This benefits all concerned, the local representative, the local authority and the communities concerned. Local authorities have also signed up to the strategic management initiative which imposes firm controls on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Freeing up time for Oireachtas Members can only be welcomed by all sides. It cannot be seen as a diminution of their relevance at local level. In fact, it can only increase their relevance as they will be in a stronger position to serve the electorate in their constituencies. Politics at national level have changed radically in recent years. I must disagree with Senator Tuffy who quoted Tip O'Neill's slogan that all politics are local. That maxim, if carried through, actually counters the Senator's argument. The changes in this legislation increase, at both national and local level, the access people will have to their local representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Politics have changed radically. We have a more sophisticated and informed electorate. The issues being dealt with by a Senator or Deputy today are different from those dealt with 20 or even ten years ago. In this age of information technology and the Internet a local representative must be familiar with every issue, national and local. The changes proposed in this legislation are a further step in the modernisation of the service provided by elected representatives for their communities. The legislation enhances the role of the representative and ensures a greater emphasis is put on serving the needs and concerns of local communities and individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I welcome the continuation of the democratic practice of duly elected councillors choosing their cathaoirligh and mayors. Look at the example in the United Kingdom mentioned by Deputy Brian Hayes. The directly elected mayor of London may have been effective in some areas but there is always the possibility that a crank candidate could be elected as a protest. Councillors elect the mayor. This means the public is guaranteed its input into this important matter through its choice of councillors.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The Minister has said the Bill represents the first part of his plans to enhance the role of local government and attract new people into this area. The party in my constituency recently attracted three new young candidates, one female, to contest the next local elections. That is a step forward. We were having trouble attracting good candidates. These candidates are highly educated and committed and this legislation will give them the opportunity to fulfil their dream of serving their local communities at an effective level. The changes will go a long way towards opening up local politics and, thereby, improve the service in towns and cities. I support the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_330">I expressed my views on the Order of Business this morning when an amendment was proposed regarding the constitutionality of the Bill. As I have heard other Members speak about this aspect, I will not deliberate on it further. However, there is concern and it is possible the legislation will be challenged. My viewpoint is not the view of my party. I have already told its members that I respect their views as to whether they should be members of local authorities. I favour ending the dual mandate. I have been a member of the council since 1985 and it is right that I should give somebody else an opportunity to become a member.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I must, however, express some concerns. Much of the work of elected representatives has a local authority emphasis. If one was to quantify our representations, it would equate to about 80% while 20% would relate to Dáil and Seanad issues and queries to Departments. It is local issues which are pertinent to the community one serves as a Deputy, Senator or councillor and one is often assessed on the basis of how one performs with regard to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">To call this a local government Bill is a misnomer. It might as easily have been titled the abolition of the dual mandate Bill. Unless one addresses many other serious issues in a local government Bill, one is not addressing the area of local government. The Minister mentioned guidelines to managers on how to handle councillors, a matter I have discussed with the county manager. My biggest concern about leaving the council is that the level of service I get as a councillor will not be available when I am only a Senator. If one is attending area meetings, council meetings, calling to the council building and working at the coalface, one can table specific questions and motions on the agenda and get a reply. Naturally, when one is in ongoing contact with officials, they respect one's views.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I will have to be convinced about the strength of the guidelines the Minister will issue to the local authority on giving information to Senators and Deputies. How strong and enforceable will they be? Will a county manager get his knuckles rapped if I do not get co-operation from him or her? Can I contact the Department of the Environment and Local Government to say the guidelines are not working? They need to be strengthened to ensure we get a level of service that will enable us to represent our constituency in order that people cannot knock us afterwards for not doing so. They should be sufficiently strong that the Department will be able to insist that something has to be done rather than may be done or done at the behest of the county manager or at the discretion of officials. That message must percolate through the county councils if Members are to leave local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">There has been one good aspect to Deputies and Senators sitting on local councils. They brought another dimension to council business because they were in the Oireachtas and familiar with legislation. Will county managers think they have an easier mandate because Deputies and Senators will be removed from the equation? The guidelines must be strong if we are to make the sacrifice of vacating a position on the local authority. It is worth bearing in mind that, unlike other councillors, we are not paid for doing this work, so we can feel strongly about the issue. Other Members have pointed out that doctors, teachers and others who are councillors are not criticised for having a dual mandate. Why is it always politicians who are criticised? The roles of councillor and Deputy or Senator are often complementary.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Oireachtas Members find it difficult since the emergence of strategic policy committees to sustain an 80% attendance record at meetings. It is difficult to fulfil and places a consequent constraint on local authorities regarding when they can hold meetings. Members are only available to attend on Mondays and Fridays.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Strategic policy committees – SPCs – were introduced as a strand of local government but they are not working effectively. That may be because it takes time for them to bed down. It is time that SPCs engaged in serious discussion on issues such as waste management, etc. I referred previously to the farcical situation that occurs at our annual estimates meeting when we spend a long period discussing waste management charges and try to ask questions in the space of a few hours. If the environmental SPC was functioning properly with local authority members and others as members of it, it would prepare a document for councillors for the estimates meeting detailing costs and where savings could be made. This would allow councillors to examine the issue on a more scientific and analytical basis rather than the farcical situation that applies at estimates meetings when we end up discussing refuse charges and scoring points off each other. The serious nature of local government is not discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The Minister should consult county managers to see if the role of SPCs can be strengthened to allow them to be a vehicle for obtaining information in the scrutiny of areas under a local authority's remit, which information could then be given to the council proper. They would then perform a good role because they would be involved in what could subsequently become policy issues. If that is not done, councillors on SPCs and other members who take time off work to attend meetings will become frustrated and will come to see the committee as a waste of time and money. The result will be that they will gradually slip away, thus draining the SPC process.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The committees should be strengthened by involving them in concrete business such as compiling worthwhile reports for the council, etc. For example, councillors could be provided with all relevant documentation in the run-up to the estimates meeting to allow them see the true costs. This would replace the estimates document prepared by the finance officer which councillors receive two to three weeks beforehand and help avoid the type of ritual that is played out at estimates meetings. The process could be much more positive if it were done properly by using SPCs.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I have newspaper articles about how the Minister wishes to strengthen local government. It is a long time since Liam Kavanagh, as Minister for the Environment, published a document on local government reform. We have not advanced very far in the interim. In many instances, I have seen a reduction in the role of councillors. If their role is to be meaningful and the Minister is to pay them full-time salaries – a matter to which he has alluded – he will probably have to give them enhanced powers. Perhaps he will work in this direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Assuming the Minister has enough support to have the Bill passed – I am sure it has been discussed at length by the respective parliamentary parties of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and has received their blessing – will a councillor who is elected to the Dáil or Seanad at the next general election be obliged to resign his or her position on the council?</p>

          <p eId="para_354">I support the legislation. It is a major reform which will have far-reaching beneficial consequences for the work of the Oireachtas. Elected Members will put their energies into their Oireachtas work and will act as the interface between their constituency and central Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I find the constitutional arguments against the Bill unconvincing. They could equally be applied in arguing that it is unconstitutional to debar Ministers, Ministers of State, civil servants or others from standing in local elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Nothing I say should be taken as wishing to denigrate or diminish the role played by those who make the dual effort. The vast majority of people who are councillors and Oireachtas Members put in a huge effort in terms of time and the number of meetings they attend. The increasingly complex nature and rising demands of local government require an enormous sacrifice from them. I can understand why people who have served time in local government are so attached to it. This legislation will be something of a wrench for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">There is merit in separating the roles of local councillors and Oireachtas Members. These roles are complementary, however, and councillors and Members can help each other, which is what they should do. An example would be councillors asking Oireachtas Members to help them with problems that cannot be solved at local level. The separation of these roles has merit in that it will encourage greater participation. More people will become involved and that is why reports recommend this change.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I know of few councillors who are not Oireachtas Members who oppose the legislation. I do not imagine the Custom House has been inundated by resolutions from county councils opposing the abolition of the dual mandate. There is no doubt that, to a certain extent, Oireachtas Members cramp the style of people who are only councillors and who want to remain so on a full-time basis. This most obviously happens when meetings are held on Mondays and Fridays. It might be possible to spread the work more evenly across the week if that was no longer a consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I am surprised by the attitude of Fine Gael.</p>

          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_360">On behalf of Seanad Éireann, I welcome Mr. Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, as part of the arrangements for statements on the Convention on the Future of Europe. This is the first occasion on which an address has been made under the new procedure adopted by the House on 17 May 2001. We look forward to an informative exchange of views.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Proinsias De Rossa</from>
          <p eId="para_361">I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak here today. I previously had the opportunity to speak in the Seanad some years ago. It is quite an innovation for the Seanad to introduce non-Oireachtas members to the Chamber to deal with important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">One of the most significant aspects of the debate within the Convention has been the attention given to the role of national parliaments. There has been general agreement that national parliaments have a distinct role to play within the European Union and that enhancing their involvement would help to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union and bring it closer to its citizens. The specific role of national parliaments within the European Union relates to their capacity to influence European Union decisions through dialogue with their governments; effective scrutiny of EU legislation along the lines recently introduced in the Oireachtas; and a proposed formal capacity to monitor the respect of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality of decisions made by the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I have proposed, and the Convention working group on national parliaments has recommended, that a European week should be organised each year to create a common window for EU-wide debates on European issues in every member state. For example, the Commission has indicated willingness to bring its annual legislative programme to each national parliament for an open debate. Both the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the National Forum on Europe are considering the implications of this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Another important consideration is the future composition of the European Commission. There is widespread support in the Convention for the election of the President of the Commission to overcome its perceived lack of democratic legitimacy. There is a lively debate on the appropriate method of election. There is a strong case for this democratic exercise to take place in the European Parliament, which represents the citizens and political families of the member states. However, there are other arguments. For example, the Irish Government believes it would be better to have an electoral college, which would consist of European parliamentarians and national parliamentarians. A third method, favoured by Deputy John Bruton, who is a member of the Praesidium of the Convention, is to have a Europe-wide popular vote by each citizen, which has other implications. Underlying all three proposals is the need for greater legitimacy on the part of the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The strengthening of the role and democratic status of the Commission is a matter of real interest to this country. Over the years, the Commission and the European Parliament have provided the impetus for the Union's most progressive policies. It is the Commission, operating within the framework of the traditional community method, which can ensure that policies such as those for social inclusion and support of the developing world are tabled, promoted and implemented. It would be entirely contrary to the interests of this country if there were to be a move towards more intergovernmental decision-making in an enlarged Union. This would give undue influence to the larger member states and their interests. A balanced EU system in which the Council works with a more open and legitimate Commission, with more influential and involved national parliaments and with the democratically elected European Parliament is our best hope of creating a Union that will serve the real interests of its citizens and of the wider world.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I will now outline the background to the idea for a Convention. The people in this country probably know 99% more than anyone else in Europe about the contents and implications of the Nice treaty. Although it did not get much attention during our debate, the treaty contains a proposal to give consideration to where Europe was going. This reflected a debate that was going on within member states' governments, the Commission and the Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The Nice declaration indicated that the purpose of the debate was to bring the EU closer to its citizens. In addition, the prospect of an enlarging Europe raised questions about how the institutions needed to be redesigned to allow it operate, efficiently and democratically with a greatly increased membership of 27 or more states. Based on the Nice declaration, there was a further declaration in Laeken under the Belgian Presidency in December 2001. At Laeken, the European Union set up the structure and laid down the agenda for the Convention to consider the key issues arising for the future of the Union and to identify possible responses. The Convention was set four tasks: the division of powers between member states and the Union; the simplification of the legal and other instruments used by the Union; increased democracy, transparency and efficiency in the Union; and working towards a constitution for the Union and its citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The Convention began its work in March 2002 and is scheduled to complete its tasks by June 2003. The Convention has 105 members, each of whom has an alternate. There are three members from Ireland, with three alternates. Along with me, our members are Deputy John Bruton and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche. The three alternates are Deputy John Gormley, Deputy Pat Carey and Mr. Bobby McDonagh from the Department of Foreign Affairs. The 13 candidate countries have both government and parliamentary representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The Praesidium, established by the Laeken declaration, also has a representative of the governments and parliaments of the accession countries. The European Parliament has representation there, as does the Commission. In addition, there are observers representing the committee of the regions, the social partners – trades unions and employers – and, as I am sure all the Senators are aware, the chairman is the former French President, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and the vice chairmen are Giuliano Amato – former Prime Minister of Italy – and Jean Luc Dehaene – former Prime Minister of Belgium. Along with Deputy John Bruton, Ms Gisela Stuart is a member representing national parliamentarians. John Cushnahan, MEP, is an alternate member of the European Parliament delegation.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The Convention has established contact groups involving a wide range of NGOs in areas such as human rights, third world development, the environment and various social concerns. A plenary session in June 2002 was devoted to hearings on these themes. A Youth Convention, structured in the same way as the main body, took place in July 2002 and its findings were communicated to a plenary session of the Convention. Six Irish representatives were selected by the National Youth Council following a process of application and selection. At some stage the Seanad might wish to contact the young people who participated in that Convention. I am sure they would have some interesting views to put forward on how they see Europe evolving in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The Convention established 11 working groups to deal with the key issues of subsidiarity; the charter of fundamental rights; the legal personality of the European Union; the role of national parliaments, of which I was a member; complementary competences, that is, the areas in which the European Union and member states share competences; economic governance; external action; defence, of which I was also a member; the simplification of legislative procedures and instruments; the European area of freedom; security and justice, and social Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">We had to fight hard to get agreement on establishing the working group on social Europe. The weight of opinion in favour of establishing such a group eventually ensured it was conceded at the last minute. As it was established late, its findings were not incorporated in the first 16 draft articles produced in recent weeks. However, the process of incorporating in the draft treaty the views expressed in its findings is now under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The working groups have submitted their reports which have been discussed in plenary. Key issues addressed in the reports include establishing a greater role for national parliaments in respect of subsidiarity; organising a Europe week, proposed by a working group of which I was a member; the incorporation of the charter of fundamental rights into the treaty or constitutional treaty as it is now known; a single legal personality for the European Union which implies abolishing the current three pillar structure – we can discuss this issue in greater detail during the question and answer session; the definition of the principles and objectives of the external policies of the Union; the expansion of Petersberg tasks to deal with current challenges with regard to peacekeeping, peacemaking and so forth; a solidarity clause to deal with terrorism in member states; simplification of legislative procedures and instruments; initiatives on key issues of justice and home affairs; treaty recognition of the balance between economic and social policies; inclusion of important social values and objectives in the treaty text; and recognition of the open method of co-ordination in areas of social concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">If, like most people, Senators have no idea what the open method of co-ordination is, I will be happy to address the issue when we move to questions and answers. It is an important element of particular interest to Ireland in terms of how the Government views it.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Many matters of controversy have arisen from the deliberations of the working groups, including the future role of the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy who is essentially a representative of the Council. The fact that there is also a Commissioner in charge of external relations who is responsible to the Commission means we have a two headed system. It is believed this needs to be rationalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Other issues raised, which may be of concern here, include the possibility of a mutual defence clause and, perhaps of lesser concern, the extension of qualified majority voting for decision making, EU competence in criminal law and the extension of competences in the social policy area.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The Convention has worked on the basis of trying to find a broad consensus on issues. To date, a kind of working consensus has been achieved on many issues, although on many this is not necessarily a broad consensus or even the majority view. This allows us to raise issues and keep them on the table pending further discussion. In the language of the negotiations in Northern Ireland, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. This is an important principle in the Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The momentum driving the Convention has increased significantly in recent months as it has reached the crucial issues of institutional structures, balance and functioning. The debate on institutions – essentially the location of power in the European Union – will dominate much of the remaining months of its work and probably determine whether the Convention is viewed as a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The political weight of the Convention has been changed significantly by the arrival as Government representatives of a number of Foreign Ministers and other senior Ministers from Germany, France, Greece, the United Kingdom, Slovenia and Latvia. This signals that the debates within the Convention are seen as fundamental to the interests of member states in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. The Convention is now recognised as the location of decisive debate on the future of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">This is a timely moment to allude to the role of the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche, the Government representative at the Convention. From the Government's point of view, he is doing an excellent job and there is no question that he has made a significant contribution to the work of the Convention. Not every member state, even some of the bigger ones, has sent senior Ministers or their Ministers for Foreign Affairs to represent them at the Convention. In saying this I am trying to head off a pointless argument that we should switch horses at this stage, which would not be a realistic option.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">From its early meetings, which dealt with broad issues such as the missions and competences of the European Union, the division of powers between it and member states and its external action, the Convention has been transformed into a constitutional conference with the clear objective of presenting a detailed draft constitutional treaty to the European Council in Thessaloníki in June 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The Laeken declaration envisaged that the Convention might propose the adoption of a new treaty in the form of a constitution for the European Union. This was seen as a means of replacing the current complex set of treaty texts, running to more than 1,200 pages, with a clear statement of the values and objectives of the Union, the rights and obligations of its citizens, the relationship between member states and the Union through the common institutions and the framework for policies and actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">In October 2002 the Praesidium presented a preliminary draft constitutional treaty as the basis for the Convention's work. This was clearly based on the debates which had taken place up to that point in the plenaries of the Convention. The draft was broadly welcomed by the Convention in so far as it provided a clear and logical framework for drafting the necessary text.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">It proposes a constitutional treaty in three parts. Part one would be the constitutional structure which would set out the values, objectives, citizenship, competences and institutions of the European Union and cover issues such as the implementation of Union action, the democratic life of the Union, finances, membership of the Union etc. Part two would be Union policies and implementation and address the internal market, EMU and other specific policy areas such as internal security, areas of supporting action, external action, defence, budgetary provisions etc. Part three would have general provisions on questions of legal continuity from previous treaties, protocols, revision procedures, adoption, ratification, duration and languages. Revision procedures will be an important aspect of the treaty given that the European Union will have 25 member states, each with its own constitutional provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">On the question how the treaty will be adopted, it is my view that there is no way to adopt it other than with existing procedures in the member states. Arguments have been made for future constitutional treaties to be adopted by way of a European-wide referendum, but in my view that does not arise on this occasion because we would have to hold a referendum before a referendum to change the current process—</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Proinsias De Rossa</from>
          <p eId="para_387">Yes, we have had enough of them. There is also the question of the duration of the treaty and that of languages in Europe, which is a key issue in the Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">On 6 February the Praesidium submitted further detailed proposals for the text of the first 16 articles of the treaty. Based on debates on the preliminary draft from last year, there are now 16 draft articles which are under discussion. I travel to the Convention tomorrow morning where a debate will begin on those 16 draft articles, in respect of which hundreds of amendments have already been submitted. Further drafts of the articles will be published in the coming weeks. At the weekend, there will be a further tranche of articles and more will be forthcoming in March. The process is quickening and it is expected to conclude by the middle of June.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I will not outline the content of the draft articles other than to say they are listed under the definition and objectives of the Union, the fundamental rights of the citizen and the Union's competences. A debate has already started on the articles, which have been drawn up in the light of the recommendations from the working groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The way the working groups operated was an attempt to find consensus in as many areas as possible. The idea was not to exclude any view, but to try to reflect the weight of those views. In the reports, some ideas are expressed as unanimous views of the working group, some have broad support while others have minority support. If a view was expressed strongly by, for example, a significant Government representative on a working group, that would also be reflected in the report. The idea was to reflect the debate and the weight of any of those ideas. It should be borne in mind that there was no way of guaranteeing that the weight of political viewpoints would be reflected equally in all of the working groups. That was the case in the social policy working group, for example, where there was a significant left of centre view. Nevertheless, we managed to ensure that there was a reflection of all views in the working group.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The central debate in the remaining months will concern the location of legislative and executive power in the Commission and the Council and the future development of the unique, triangular structure of the Union, namely, the Council, Commission and Parliament, which interact with each other in various ways. It is the strong view of most people in the Convention that that balance should be maintained. It does not mean that one element or the other will not be changed, but if there is a change in, for example, the way the Council is chaired, an equally important change will be made with the Commission or perhaps more power given to the Parliament or whatever so that there is equilibrium among the three main institutions of the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">A working consensus, but not necessarily a majority, has emerged on a number of issues including the idea of a single constitutional treaty and a single legal personality, which would bring an end to the pillar structure. The importance of that is that the first pillar is generally subject to European parliamentary scrutiny, whereas, in general, the second and third pillars are not, except where the Council finds that it should consult with the Parliament. However, the Parliament does not have any legislative role in the second and third pillars. It has a consultative role in some, but not all, cases. The importance of having a single legal personality, therefore, means that a greater degree of democracy is created within the decision-making process. I must be honest and say that other speakers will present Members with a different view on how far we should go in that regard. However, that matter is part of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Another idea is an increase in the use of qualified majority voting, QMV, which I mentioned already, and co-decision of the Parliament – the role of the European Parliament as co-decision maker with the Council. That is a process which is probably unique, certainly in Europe, in which the Council and the Governments of Europe have to sit down with the Parliament and agree compromises in respect of legislation they want to put forward. That is an important power for the European Parliament in terms of ensuring full openness and accountability on the part of the Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">There is resistance in some areas to extending qualified majority voting, which includes co-decision making. Some argue against it in some areas including, for example, the tax area, an issue which will be debated in Ireland to some extent. The question is whether we should have QMV in the tax area. There are other issues also besides tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">On the question of the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the treaty, there is a broad consensus that that should be done. However, the issue lies in the way this should be done. Should it be part of the treaty or added on as a protocol and what is the legal difference in terms of its application?</p>
          <p eId="para_396">There is also the question of clarification on the extent to which the European Charter of Fundamental Rights applies to European citizens. The bottom line on that is that it applies in so far as the EU institutions are acting on foot of European decisions. In other words, where the Council accedes to certain measures agreed by the Parliament, the rights applied under the charter would apply or where member states are implementing decisions agreed at European level, rights would apply in that case. They would not apply, however, in circumstances where a member state is acting under its own constitution in implementing matters which have not, or are unlikely to be dealt with, by the European Union and we can all think of such examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">On the role of national parliaments in monitoring subsidiarity, one of the issues that arose early in the course of the debate on the Convention was the question of a European congress or Senate. However, it has been generally accepted that adding another tier of scrutiny would make Europe more opaque and less understandable than at present and that ways must be found to provide for national parliamentary scrutiny which does not obscure what is happening but rather clarifies it. We have already begun to take steps like that in the Oireachtas in relation to decision-making.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The idea of a congress is still on the agenda. One suggestion is that a congress could elect the President of the Commission. I do not believe that is a runner, but I am simply pointing out that issues which might not hit the headlines are also being debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The Presidency of the Union currently rotates between member states. Ireland will hold the Presidency from January to June next year. I have argued strongly that this is an important role for all states, particularly smaller ones, as they are then at the centre of what is happening in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">There was a counterproposal, primarily from the United Kingdom but supported by others, for a long-term elected president of the European Council. The exact way this might be done has not yet been thrashed out but the idea is that someone would hold office for two and a half or five years. It could not be held by the Prime Minister of a member state as it would be impossible to be president of the Council and Prime Minister of Ireland or anywhere else. That would not be feasible. Therefore, the question of who would be eligible to stand then arose.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The argument in favour is that it would be more efficient and provide greater continuity for the agenda of the European Union. Those of us who disagree argue that we can create efficiency and continuity by having the proper structures in place. I favour a team presidency. If it was introduced next year, though it will not, one would have Italy, Ireland and the current holder of the Presidency, Greece, as a team presidency. Each country could chair individual Council meetings for a year or two. There are ways to create the efficiency and continuity required without undercutting the rotational idea of the Presidency, which is important for smaller states.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I have mentioned the external representation of the European Union and the two hats being worn at present with Javier Solana representing the Council and Chris Patten representing the European Commission. Each is playing a first class part on the world stage but the question is whether it would be better to have a single representative. If that representative was appointed or selected, where would he or she sit? Would he or she sit on the Council or the Commission? Does one interfere with the Commission, essentially the policeman of the Union, or the Council, the political head of the Union? These issues have to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">There is also the extent to which the European Union should have competence in the areas of criminal law or economic co-ordination, for example. Should there be an elected president of the Commission? Which model should be used for such an election? Should there be a rotating presidency or QMV, as I mentioned? Should there be a solidarity clause in the defence area?</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Social Europe is one of my main concerns. An important debate has commenced on the report of the social Europe working group which contains important recommendations concerning the values and objectives of the European Union. It proposes the addition of the values of social justice, solidarity and equality, particularly equality between men and women. The inclusion of such values would highlight the argument of the working group that the Union cannot be a credible force for good in the wider world if it is indifferent to questions of social justice and poverty in European society. Such principles will be of the utmost importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Regarding the timetable, the Convention is scheduled to complete its work in early June and the draft constitution will be given to the Thessaloníki European Council by the president of the Convention. The debate will the be taken up by member states and an Intergovernmental Conference will be established at some point, though we do not know when. The idea is that a period of reflection will be provided to ensure a gap, perhaps of some months, between the conclusion of the Convention and the start of the Intergovernmental Conference which could span both the Italian and Irish Presidencies of the Council but it is felt should not continue too long and conclude with the Irish Presidency at the latest.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">A related issue is the date for the formal entry into the European Union of the candidate countries, 1 May 2004. It would not be reasonable, even with consultation and accession countries sitting in on the debate, to conclude on significant issues while such states are not full members. An issue of timing also arises. If a state is represented at a meeting but not a member and is asked to support an issue, there are questions as to whether that opinion is a true reflection of the state's views as it does not have a veto. The question of decisions being made before 1 May 2004 in terms of the final draft of the document should be borne in mind. There could be serious repercussions in candidate countries which are holding referenda on accession this year. If they cannot guarantee to their electorates that they will be full partners in the decisions on a new constitutional treaty, they could have serious problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">In Ireland the debate on the Convention involves the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs which has commenced a series of hearings and debates and is briefed regularly by the Irish Convention participants. The National Forum on Europe has initiated a series of plenary sessions and regional public meetings on aspects of the Convention's work and will continue to operate for the rest of the year. I am pleased additional funding is being provided for the forum which only had a budget up to June this year; the new funding will bring it to the end of the year. It is an important window on debate for our citizens and it is in all our interests that it continue right through the period of the Intergovernmental Conference as important ideas and proposals will come through right to the end. The Minister for Foreign Affairs delivered a comprehensive overview of the position of the Government in his address to the Institute of European Affairs in recent weeks when he outlined the Government's position on the Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I have outlined the membership of the Convention but, as Members can imagine, debate does not just take place on the floor of the Convention or in the Praesidium, though that is an important part of the process. There are political families such as the socialist family which consists of the MEPs, national parliamentarians and Government representatives which come together on a regular basis; the same goes for the Christian Democrat and Green families. They try to establish common positions, although because of the nature of the European Union even within the same political family there can be differences of opinion and emphasis. We have all experienced this, even in our domestic political families. It is important to bear in mind that in many cases the national family comes together.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Tomorrow I will meet the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and Deputies John Bruton, Gormley and Carey as well as Mr. Bobby McDonagh to discuss the issues we can promote jointly and those on which we disagree in order that we can present a united front to the Convention. Inevitably, because we come from different political families, we will present different positions. The bottom line is that we all defend the interests of Irish citizens and the citizens of the European Union.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_410">I welcome Mr. De Rossa. I am disappointed that we do not have a title for MEPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">It is useful for Senators and the Seanad, as an institution, to discuss the Convention. This is the first of a three part process where we can listen to and debate with the members of the Convention on the Future of Europe. It is also important in the broader public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">We listened to Mr. De Rossa with interest. Among the political chattering classes there is an interest in the ongoing debate on the European Union but among our constituents, since the passing of the Nice treaty, the debate has wound down. There will be a bridge to cross in a few months time when we want to sell the concept of a new treaty of Europe to the people. We are all in favour of the Union which we take for granted but, as we learned in the debate on the Nice treaty, when there is serious structural or institutional reform, doubts will creep in.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The work of the Convention is valuable and it is important that it is kept in the public eye. The Forum on Europe has been working effectively but its message has been disseminated to a small number of individuals, those who will always tune into debates on the European Union and attend forum meetings. We must ask how we can extend the debate to the hundreds of thousands completely unaware of it, the people who will have to be engaged when we are making the final decisions on the future of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The role of the Convention is straightforward. It must put in place a mechanism to bring the European Union closer to its citizens and keep it effective and efficient while giving us a positive role in the wider world. We talk about a united states of Europe but at present we are trying to find a common European approach to the situation in Iraq and we can see how difficult that is. The issue will, I hope, be resolved in a peaceful fashion but the desirability of a common European approach is obvious. Reaching agreement, however, is very difficult. Mr. De Rossa would be the first to recognise that it is a challenge to engage the public and help to chart out a vision for the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Irish members of the Convention all have their own views but there has been a convergence of the Irish position. The country has done well out of EU membership and we wish to continue to play a major role. We want to see the accession countries getting a fair crack of the whip. That should be our starting position as we seek a balanced treaty that recognises the European social dimension, an area to which Mr. De Rossa is personally committed. We must also ensure the economic development of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">This debate is helpful. We should not underestimate the task we face in selling to the public our vision for the European Union. We know there are doubts and fears unless politicians give the lead. These debates are helpful but much more will be required in the weeks and months ahead.</p>

        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_417">I welcome Mr. De Rossa and thank the Leader of the House for making it possible to discuss this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I had to think before I came into the House. Even though I am a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I still have problems with many of the major issues. Since the referendum on the Nice treaty the Convention has been established and gathered momentum. I pay tribute to the Irish delegation. Its members do Trojan work on our behalf and work as a team, although they do not always sing from the same hymn sheet and differences occasionally emerge.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">If I was standing in front of a classroom full of students, I would have to ask myself how I would address the issue of the Convention. How would I break it down? The Convention is about formulating a new treaty. We are seeking a new integrated approach that combines all of the treaties in a readable and comprehensible manner that will stand the test of time. How do we do this?</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The Convention was established with 105 members and 102 alternates. Its membership was then divided into 11 groups. What does each group talk about? It talks about that word that I dread, "subsidiarity", which I do not understand. If I said "subsidiarity" to the public with no explanation, it would think I was talking nonsense. I have thought long and hard about its meaning. Mr. De Rossa can correct me if I am too simplistic but subsidiarity is how best to make decisions at the appropriate level. Issues can be dealt with at local, regional, national or European level. That makes sense. Why do we have to use the word "subsidiarity"? Why should decisions be made in Brussels which can be made in the Oireachtas, at regional level or in my local council?</p>
          <p eId="para_421">That led me to consider the role of the national parliament in the decision-making process. As a result of the Nice treaty referendum, it was decided that all proposals from Brussels would have to be monitored initially at our own level and that we should send early warning signals to the European Union in relation to matters we intended to work out and resolve at national level. In that regard, I compliment the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and its sub-committee on the work which has gone into scrutinising proposals emanating from the Union. That work is ongoing. The sub-committee has devoted a substantial amount of time and effort to deciphering the huge volume of material coming from Brussels. That is a good move and I welcome it.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">In the final analysis, we must inform and reassure the people that we are representing them and that they are aware of what is happening in Dublin and Brussels. We must be mindful of this responsibility. Up to now there has been a certain disconnection between what happens in the European Union and the Houses of the Oireachtas and the public perception of that whole process but we have moved a long way. I am also aware of many other working groups in operation. I could continue for much longer but I am conscious of time constraints.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The outstanding EU issues include tax harmonisation, the election of the Presidency and getting the best provisions in the new treaty in order that Ireland will not only have an economic platform but will also be complemented by social cohesion. We should bear in mind that pooling our sovereignty does necessarily refer to defence policy alone. It also involves considering how best we can combat international terrorism and crime while also promoting peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Perhaps I will have an opportunity to intervene in questions later. I had hoped to refer to some other matters, ach beidh lá eile chuige sin.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_425">I join in welcoming Proinsias De Rossa to the House. The generosity of approach is demonstrated by the fact that representatives of different parties are working together in a common purpose as well as having nuances of difference. That is an important message. Mr. De Rossa has been one of the first on the left of Irish politics to recognise the advantage of the European movement and advance it accordingly, as he has done courageously. I compliment him on his work in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">I wish to focus on a few issues which require attention, including the charter of fundamental rights. It has been a matter of great delight in recent months to observe the fundamental change in the Government's attitude in that regard, to the extent that it is now prepared to support the idea of the charter being part of the treaty. That is crucially important to those in the trade union movement and civil society who look to a social Europe. However, what I do not quite understand – perhaps Mr. De Rossa will comment on this – is, if we embed something in a European constitution, how that trickles down to being important to an individual Irish citizen. Is there, perhaps, a need for national or subsidiary legislation or can one simply claim one's rights on the basis that the charter will now be part of the treaty? If it was to be part of the treaty, would it have similar effect as personal rights in the Irish Constitution? I would appreciate some clarification, although I realise there are no absolute answers to such questions at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">With regard to the approach to sustainable development in Europe and the issue of peace, I cannot quite grasp how these matters will be dealt with. I share Senator Ormonde's concern in relation to the problems of vocabulary and understanding. Perhaps it is just the teacher in me but there is a great need to clarify certain issues, starting with sovereignty and neutrality. Irish people must recognise that when we joined the United Nations, we were no longer neutral. We take a political position on issues and there is a political neutrality which we share within the United Nations. Military neutrality is a different matter, in terms of taking military action in support of some objective. Moral neutrality is yet another concept; morally neutral countries are hardly a model we would ever pursue, in the sense of not having a view on the most corrupt regimes in the world. That debate on the whole issue of neutrality has not yet taken place and it must.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">There is another issue which is not helped by language problems. I am not sure if there is a French word for "confederation", other than <i>“federation“</i> for the English “federation”. In the English language there is a very clear difference between a confederation and a federation. Every time Mr. Chirac or others use the word “federation”, shock waves run through Europe. However, if there was a distinction between a federation and the looser arrangement of a confederation, there would be very clear differences of nuance which would be of great importance to Irish people in coming to terms with the concept of being Irish within a broader European Union. That is another debate which has yet to take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I do not understand the concept of co-decision-making. I am not sure I would wish to be on the receiving end, if I had authority to make decisions. Not understanding how it works, it bothers me.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_185">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_431">Partnership is a very focused arrangement. It is certainly not co-government, as the secretary to the Cabinet might, perhaps, say. Neither do I like the idea of co-decision-making. Somebody must be in charge. I listened carefully to Mr. De Rossa's statement which did not describe co-decision-making. He also used other nice words such as "consultation" but I am not clear as to the precise meaning. I am not sure I like the idea of co-government. I prefer to know who is in charge, who took the decision, made the mistake and is to be held responsible. In co-decision-making, one might have to aim in two directions at once which does not appeal to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I wish to comment on the "senate tier", which is an important issue. In using the word "senate" there is a certain problem of vocabulary in that people relate it to the Seanad or the US Senate or whatever. The real problem relates to the absolute authority of the European Commission. Some take the view that the Commission could be subsumed into a body which would consist of two political people from each member state who would be elected on a somewhat similar basis to the US Senate but with a completely different remit or terms of reference. It would give political involvement in the first pillar in a manner which might bridge the democratic deficit which, in the eyes of some, was created by the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I look forward to Mr. De Rossa's response on these and other issues. I thank him for his input to this debate and the Leader of the House for facilitating it.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_434">I join other speakers in welcoming Proinsias De Rossa to the House and thanking him for his overview of the Convention, giving all sides of the story even though, in some respects, it may not correspond to his own political views. The overall concept of the Convention on the Future of Europe is, undoubtedly, an excellent and very welcome development. With EU enlargement on the agenda, such a Convention is timely.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The governance and management of the Union are important issues which must be reflective of the membership of the Union, current and future. I have no difficulty in supporting these principles, once the approach is reflective of the membership. The Convention has a very serious task in hand and there are important questions to be asked. To use a European phrase, one must ask if it is taking a bottom-up approach, which means that they are listening to the people, or taking a top-down approach where they are telling us what is good for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The recent Nice treaty referendum taught us some valuable lessons. The Convention should listen to some of those lessons, one of which is that understanding of and interest in EU affairs is obviously quite low in Ireland. Eurosceptics can generate considerable support with simple, and sometimes false, slogans, whereas those people who support the European concept must put forward their arguments in an analytical way to get their points across. Ireland and most other countries have also shown tremendous pride in their constitutions – this was also reflected during the Treaty of Nice debate – and expect full democratic process.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Based on the above points, we must send out a clear message to the Convention on the Future of Europe. In my opinion the public perception is that unfortunately the approach of the Convention is top-down. This approach is not the correct one.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">It has also been stated that there are controversial signals coming from the Convention. I want to mention three points. The workings of the Convention, and especially the Praesidium, are too secretive; with the publication of the draft constitution, the people are asking whether it is the intention to replace the Irish Constitution; and there are also concerns regarding reports that countries like Ireland will have to accept the constitution or opt out. It is essential that we debate these issues and bring clarity to them. I welcome the initiative by the Leader in starting this process. From today, we should set down a clear marker that we will demonstrate transparency and democracy and will fully debate these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">One of the biggest unsolved problems of the EU institutions is communicating what they do to the citizens of Europe. It is obvious that their efforts to date such as websites, brochures and information campaigns have not worked. Given that the EU will expand from 15 members to 25, and that the Convention is proposing to change the rules, what plans has the Convention to inform, and more importantly convince, the citizens of its benefits? This is an important issue for us politicians as we will be the people on the doorsteps answering the questions on these issues. Second, the big six countries, Germany, France, Italy, UK, Spain and Poland, will make up 74% of the population. The remaining 19 countries make up the balance. How is the Convention proposing to convince the 19 that its work is in their interests?</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_187">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_440">Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an méid atá ráite ag Baill eile a chur fáilte roimh uachtaráin mo pháirti, an t-Uasal De Rossa. Ceapaim go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo úsáideach agus go mbeidh sé mar pháirt den díospóireacht mhór náisiúnta agus b'fheidir idirnáisiúnta i rith agus tar éis an Choinbhinsiún.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">This afternoon's debate has been interesting so far, but in some ways a little depressing. As in much of our recent discussion, the focus here has been almost one of frustration. It is almost as if we see ourselves positioned between what is happening in Brussels and in national debate. We are not really forming part of a national debate. We are not offering our views as to various issues arising in Brussels; we are simply saying that it is terribly frustrating to be stuck here and we are going on about the information deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">From other Senators I sense a frustration that we have not succeeded in stimulating any social debate beyond these Houses, and I am sure that is true. However, we need, and have a responsibility, to express our own views. Perhaps if there were more disagreements or more cut and thrust between us, then we might actually succeed in exciting a little more interest beyond these Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I found the past few weeks fairly depressing, particularly in the context of common foreign and security policy, but at the same time it illustrates a difficulty which, I suppose, in our heart of hearts we have always known existed. If you put the Foreign Affairs Minister of the member states into a room and give them almost any substantive issue of foreign policy, they can come up with a common position, and we saw some evidence of that last Monday in Brussels. There is not a huge amount of disagreement on substantive issues, including Iraq, but none of us seriously believes that Prime Minister Blair would be looking to send British troops into Iraq were it not for the fact that George Bush wants to do it. That is the serious fault line and the serious problem with the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">One issue we clearly have not come close to sorting out is our relationship with the United States. Sometimes this does not matter. Frequently we have common interests. Frequently the interests of individual European countries – Atlanticist-minded countries and those of us who are not members of NATO – coincide, but we have seen much evidence in the past few weeks of the serious existing dangers and difficulties when they clearly do not coincide, either in terms of what we perceive as being our interests or in what we want to do about them. That is a real problem for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">It also points out clearly the difficulties with Irish neutrality. Ireland is the only country describing itself as neutral or non-aligned within the EU which is taking what is essentially seen as a pro-US, pro-George W. Bush line. Politically we are aligned clearly with the NATO countries of Europe and aligned therefore against some countries which are actually members of NATO but are taking a more distinctly independent line.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">As of now it is clearly not possible for the European Union to take a line which is independent of the firm and decided wishes of the United States and of the White House. That surely must be where we try to move forward. We need at least to determine for ourselves where our interest lies in having and waging and being capable of implementing an independent foreign policy. No doubt the rapid reaction force must form part of that. We cannot run before we can crawl. We must determine what are our common interests and clearly they must lie in the security of our own Continent, but we must also imperatively develop an independent capacity to do something about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">I was in some doubt about what happened in the last Gulf War. On balance, the bottom line is that Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and there was a clear legitimacy in getting him out of there.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I do not support what is happening now, nor does my party. I deeply resent the fact that the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy position, one which, incidentally, is clearly supported by the people of Europe, is simply being stopped because George W. Bush and the White House do not want it. Our leaders need to develop the political will, not only to sit in a room in Brussels and develop a policy but actually to implement it when the United States does not want us to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">There are other points which divide us such as the development of a social Europe and perhaps even tax harmonisation. I have not had an opportunity to develop those points but I wanted to give vent to my frustrations and depression on that one current issue.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_453">You have been kind, a Chathaoirligh. I did not say there is supposed to be one minute for the lesser players in this debate, but I am saying it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I am delighted that Proinsias De Rossa could come here. He and I shared a platform one lovely August evening in Donegal at the Magill school at which I suggested that he and the other players in the field should come here because the matter of the Convention was just beginning to burgeon. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, will be here the week after next and then Deputy John Bruton will be here. We are looking forward to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I thank Proinsias De Rossa for coming and responding with great alacrity and enthusiasm. I was pleased to hear the clear message that people have so many different views and that we must consider how to accommodate them. We all explicitly or implicitly asked how we, as citizens, are to become comfortable with Europe and how Europe will become comfortable with us. That was the original question in the debate, not just on this issue but on Europe also.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The Joint Committee on European Affairs is doing great work, travelling to Castlebar and other towns and inviting young people to meet its members. The Forum on Europe is also doing great work on its travels. I regard this debate as another step in the process of letting people know what is happening in Europe. It is very easy to sit back and admit one does not know what the Convention is about because it does not mean anything to one but it will mean a huge amount to everyone of every age. It is up to us to provoke a debate if there is not one and ensure that whatever we say or do provokes a debate, because it is about all of our futures and, even more importantly, those of our children.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">I bet you have. Mr. De Rossa spoke about his feelings about the social side of what was happening in Europe and how he and others fought to have their own agendas included. What is encompassed in this social dimension apart from what we know already? The European Union has always been strongly in favour of equal pay, since the time of Dr. Paddy Hillery, and has led the way on other developments such as maternity and paternity leave. If it were not for the Union, we would still be waiting for equal pay in some professions.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">When Mr. Pat Cox, President of the European Parliament, came to the House, he gave a vivid illustration of what, in his view, fundamental European rights were all about. His argument was that if one went into an Irish national school, one should see on one poster the fundamental rights of the Irish Constitution and on another the fundamental rights of every citizen of the European Union. Is that the view emerging from the Convention at this stage? I thought it was a vivid and simple way of communicating people's rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">It is very important that any charter of fundamental rights or new constitution that results from the Intergovernmental Conference is put to every country in Europe. To have countries vote on this is very important because it demands that we, as politicians, put the case to people and make arguments. We are in a unique position in that since 1973 we have put all treaties to the people. Is there a unified view coming from the Convention on how we might go about ratifying the results of this process in 18 months or two years?</p>

          <p eId="para_467">I thank Proinsias De Rossa for coming to the House. Apart from the hard work done by him and his colleagues, people do not appreciate how much contact they have had with the different forums here – the Forum on Europe, the Joint Committee on European Affairs and so on. We appreciate the extensive feedback into the system coming from those who represent us at the Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">We can talk about architectural issues such as double hatting and so on, which are all important from the point of view of the workings of the Union, but the core question is whether the future complexion of the Union will be a federalist one or a continuation of what it is at the moment, an association of sovereign states which pool some sovereignty in the interests of their peoples. Mr. De Rossa did not use the word "constitutional" but rather the words "constitutional treaty", which are quite distinct. Will that constitutional treaty steer us in a so-called federal direction? There was some disquiet when we saw Article 1 which mentioned competences being shared on a federal basis. I do not have any difficulty about this way of doing things globally within the Community but if there is to be a classic federation, with division of powers and so on, we will have some serious problems. We should look very carefully at the future direction of the Convention.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">Perhaps Mr. De Rossa will elaborate on the extending of the Petersberg Tasks, as Senator McDowell mentioned. Second, how does he see something like last week's decision from the European Commission which, independent of all member states, negotiated a huge change <i>vis-à-vis</i> the USA in terms of data protection and the submission of individual data? I do not want to talk about the issue but about the competence of the Commission which needs to be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Without betraying any confidences, will Mr. De Rossa tell us about the mood and feeling of the Convention which are important? Is it confrontational or collaborative? Is there a feeling that people genuinely want to get a job done that desperately needs to be done?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_201">

          <p eId="para_472">I thank all the contributors, some of whose questions were quite challenging in terms of dealing with them in a precise way. The big challenge for the Convention is communication of the ideas being debated in a way that is not prescriptive but that leaves people the opportunity to examine them from different perspectives. I have different views from others on many issues, although I do not necessarily believe I always have the correct view. People need to consider issues in a way that leaves open the possibility of their agreeing with a position that at the moment they believe is a little too far out for them. We will not make progress in Europe unless we are willing to make those changes. It is equally true that we need to defend certain positions. Debate is the important thing about the Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The Convention will not conclude on what we will be voting on in a referendum – it is a mechanism for giving national and European parliamentarians, national governments, accession states and the social partners a forum in which to debate a range of issues within a certain context and present their combined wisdom to all 25 Governments of the European Union. We hope they will take on board most of what we consider to be worthwhile. The Governments of the European Union will draw a red line through X or add to Y and finally the peoples of Europe will make the decisions on whether they accept the work of the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference. The key point is that the Convention is only one but a significant part of a process because it is creating a momentum. As I said, the fact that a number of member states have decided to beef up their representation at the Convention is a reflection of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Is it a good or bad idea for all member states to hold a referendum? It would be a very good idea. On the margins of the Convention, lots of little groups of different members come together to promote various ideas. One such group is promoting the idea of a Europe-wide referendum. That may take many different forms, but we have no way of obliging Germany to have a referendum. Germany will run 1,000 miles from the notion of a referendum, particularly in light of the experience in the 1930s and the rise of Hitler. Other countries in Europe have had similar experiences, resulting in similar knee-jerk reactions to the idea of a referendum, although that is not to say they will not take that route some day.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">There is no way for us to oblige states to hold referenda, but we can encourage them to do so. Various delegates to the Convention have suggested that the member states they represent would hold consultative referenda on the treaty because they already have constitutional provisions in place. For example, Belgium has to go through its layers of regional and national governance before an EU treaty can be finally ratified by the national parliament. This is a broad consultative process which ends up as a ratification by a national parliament and, in terms of debate, is arguably a more effective means of ratification. Bearing in mind the diversity of Europe, the bottom line is that we cannot oblige states to fit into our shoes. We must respect the concerns, interests, experience and history of other states in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The Senators dealt with the issue of explaining complex issues well. As politicians, we are constantly faced with the problem of conveying complex ideas in which we are engrossed and of which we have a fair degree of understanding, but when one goes to a local community hall to explain a complex technical issue such as incineration, for example, how does one get the point across? The same difficulty applies to the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">As a result of the diversity, we must find some terminology which is commonly understood across Europe. The term "subsidiarity" is eurospeak, but it is understood by the parliaments and governments across Europe, so it is common coinage at that level. Perhaps the problem relates to the lack of usage of the term in our own political discourse. If we had more discussion about subsidiarity between local authorities and national government, perhaps people would immediately understand the issues. Developing and deepening our political discourse on how power is exercised is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">In a submission I made to the Convention, I made the point that subsidiarity is required not only between the EU and the member states, but also between the states and their regions. There was a major hearing in the Convention a month ago at which the Committee of the Regions made a submission about how it wants to be engaged with European decision-making. There is a real debate on this issue. Ireland has one of the most centralised government systems in Europe, where local authorities have little power and where there are no regional authorities, other than the make-believe ones relating to European funding. This is an area we need to develop further.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The pooling of sovereignty is a fundamental issue which goes to the heart of what Europe is about. However, it must be borne in mind that it is voluntary. We have voluntarily agreed that we will pool sovereignty in certain areas. Our Ministers attend Council meetings to discuss issues which may or may not become directives. If directives follow, we have agreed within the Council process to share our law-making capacities with the other member states in order to create, for example, an environmental directive which will apply equally to Ireland, Britain, Germany and Poland because effective action cannot be taken by national governments alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">On its own, Ireland is not in a position to protect its coasts from oil tankers which might break up. We need strong European legislation to allow us to do so. We can make all the laws we like, but they will not apply to the UK, Germany or Spain if there is no corresponding European legislation. The sharing of sovereignty is the key to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The evolution of the EU has bred a uniquely hybrid federalist, inter-governmental system. It is not like the US, German or Belgian systems; it is a unique European system, based on our diverse histories and social and governmental systems, in which we agree to share our power at certain points. The European Union is already federalist to some extent and, from my political perspective, it ought to be more so because I define federalism as a decentralisation rather than a centralisation of power. Real federalism is about only doing those things one needs to do at central level and doing everything else at national or local level. We will not achieve that level of ideal federalist structure in Europe within the next couple of generations, if ever. We will continue to evolve on the basis of the hybrid that is already in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The debate on the Convention asks whether we will disturb the existing balance if we shift it. How does one disturb that balance between the Council, the Commission and the Parliament in a way that ensures each retains an equal right within the system? I advise against getting too uptight about terminology. Let us look at what it means and argue from that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">The only reason I am drawing attention to it is that it has an introduction signed by the leaders of the SDLP and the British and Irish Labour Party groups in the European Parliament, namely, John Hume, Simon Murphy and me. This is a charter of fundamental rights which was prepared by a Convention similar to that which we have on the constitution of Europe. It is set out in simple language that ordinary people can understand and is a model of brevity. It deals with a range of issues from human dignity, right to life, right to integrity of the person, prohibition of slavery, enforced labour, non-discrimination and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">The idea is that these simplified rights would be incorporated as an integral part of a new European constitutional treaty and would then apply to any actions taken by the EU or a member state on foot of an action decided by them within the context of the EU. They do not cut across rights in the Irish Constitution in any way. This applies where the Irish Government has agreed to share law-making in certain areas at European level, but not otherwise. It does not, nor could it, affect the Irish constitutional ban on abortion because it is inconceivable that an Irish Government would agree to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">One of the processes of the EU involves consultation and co-decision with the European Parliament. The Commission is the only body with the right to initiate a proposal, usually on the basis of background discussions with the Council and the Parliament. The proposal will be sent to the Council which can amend it, if necessary, before forwarding it to the Parliament. The Parliament can also amend the proposal and return it to the Council. The Council may agree with some of the proposed amendments and return it to the Parliament, which can then outline further objections and return it to the Council. If the Council does not accept the Parliament's amendments at this point, it is obliged to meet the Parliament and negotiate a compromise on the issues at stake. If agreement cannot be reached, the entire process returns to stage one, without passing go and without collecting €200. There is an incentive for both bodies to reach agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">There are problems with the system in that it is not an open process. The negotiations between Parliament and the Council need to be opened up. This is important as it gives the elected representatives of the people a hold over what the Council may or may not do.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The Commission has no power other than that given to it by the Council or the treaties. The Council has agreed to give a mandate to the Commission to negotiate on trade matters with the United States and within the WTO, etc., but the Commission must return to the Council with any proposals it seeks to agree on. The Council must approve what the Commission has negotiated. The democratic gap is that the European Parliament is excluded from this process. That is not to say other aspects do not need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">By and large, the Commission can take no action unless a directive agreed by the Council and the Parliament empowers it. For example, Ireland had a row with the Commission about budgets. It was a row about a decision made by ECOFIN that certain guidelines would be complied with and Ireland, as one of the countries that agreed to those guidelines, felt it was not in its interests to comply with them at that point. The Commission could only act on the basis of the power given to it by the treaties or the Council. The Commission has an important role in policing the implementation of agreed policies. There are many examples of how this has been dealt with in Ireland and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Senator Minihan asked if the convention operated a top-down or bottom-up process. That this impression exists is, in part, a failure on the part of the media in the way it has not reported most of what is going on and how it reported some of the debates. The convention has been in place since March 2002 and will conclude in June, but the public debate on it is only beginning to open up. We can all take a share of the blame for this. There are six Irish representatives on the convention and six youth members also attended it. An Intergovernmental Conference will be held when the convention concludes its work and it is important that the momentum is maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">It is emphatically not a top-down process. The main criticism of the Praesidium and how it operates comes largely from the Euro-sceptics within the convention. They do not want the Convention to succeed, nor see any evolution of the Union. How many party organisations would open their executive meetings to the press? It does not happen and it is unrealistic to argue that the Praesidium should have an open door policy when it is trying to tease out issues. The Praesidium will not make the final decision; it is for the Convention to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">A question was asked about the big six countries. I think the population of the 19 small states makes up slightly more than 50% of the population of a 25-member EU. In any event, there is no way six states can make a decision within the Council. While co-decision issues require a minimum of 71% of Council votes, a majority of states must also agree to it and there must also be a balance of population. There is a triple lock on decision making on QMV. While I, like Senator O'Rourke, have attended a number of meetings, I have yet to meet a Minister who attended a Council meeting where a vote took place. I am not aware of any time when a vote took place at the Council. The constant pressure is to find consensus. Europe will not work if it operates on a basis of states being pressured into corners.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The value of QMV is not that a decision can be passed by a vote of 71% of those present, rather that there is an incentive to reach a decision. If there is a requirement for unanimity, as there is in many areas of policy-making, those that disagree can block everything and refuse to budge. If QMV is in place, every state will have to engage with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Senator McDowell raised the question of the relationship between the EU and the USA. I do not believe that there can be a peaceful world without a solid, friendly and co-operative relationship between Europe and the USA. This relationship must be based on equality and recognition that there is an international legal framework within which we operate. I will be travelling to New York and Washington next week with a delegation of MEPs to discuss the Iraqi issue. We will seek to meet people of various political stripes to talk to them about what we believe needs to be done. The European Parliament's position, adopted by motion a few weeks ago, is that there should be no unilateral military action against Iraq. If there is to be military action, it must be decided by the Security Council but more time should be given to the inspectors to reach a peaceful resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Senator O'Rourke asked how to present Europe so that people feel comfortable with it. Senator Brian Hayes raised a similar point. It has to be on the basis of people recognising that the clean air they breathe is at least partly the responsibility of all Europe.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">It is because people in Britain have agreed to do certain things when they manufacture goods to prevent pollution getting into the air. That applies across Europe. We need to promote the reality that Europe gives added value to the quality of our lives. It is true with regard to health and safety at work as well as in a range of other areas. We need to get that point across. There is great emphasis in the schools' transition year course on Europe and the role it plays in our lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Senator Ryan asked about extending the Petersberg Tasks and the clarification of competencies. No major extension is being proposed to the Petersberg Tasks. There is, in a sense, a clarification. The Petersberg Tasks were formulated before international terrorism was seen as a threat and before it emerged on 11 September 2001 in the United States. The idea is to see how the Petersberg Tasks can cope with a situation where states increasingly have to protect themselves against that type of attack and what role the Union plays in that area. This is where the concept of a solidarity clause arises. It is not the same as a mutual defence clause. If, for example, the UK believes there is a threat of biological attack and Ireland has a service, be it medical or otherwise, that could be of assistance, we would make it available. There would be other implications as well. However, it is an under-developed idea at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">People who are interested in this issue should read the report of the defence working group, of which I was a member. I argued strongly against the idea of a mutual defence agreement, where each country would have an obligation to respond in the event of an outside attack on a member state. I argued it from a pragmatic point of view. I believe it will not carry. There are other arguments for and against it, but I believe we are sidelining a range of other issues by getting too deeply involved in a debate about something which is unlikely ever to happen.</p>

What does Mr. De Rossa believe the issues will be in the European elections next year in the context of the Convention's work and the debate that is starting on it? Until now Ireland's emphasis was on this country being economically backward and socially under-developed. That has changed and Ireland is now a major player economically in Europe.

          <p eId="para_512">I want to avoid getting into a debate akin to a debate on how many angels can sit on the head of a pin. I will avoid discussing the definition of federalism. The best definition I have is the decentralisation of power where action is taken at the central level only when it is necessary. I have given a few examples of that. The obvious example is the euro. There cannot be a European currency unless there is some level of co-ordination of economic policy at European level. It would not be possible for each of the 25 member states to have their own economic policy. The currency would collapse. We need centralised decision-making on this issue and are aware of the value the euro has given us. I made the point that I do not believe there will be a fully federal system in Europe for a few generations, if ever. Europe is too diverse to end up with the type of system that is in place in, for example, the United State.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">That links into the question of diversity raised by Senator Henry. One of the first commitments in the articles of the treaty will be to maintain the social, economic, political, linguistic and cultural diversity of Europe. There is a huge strength in that and it is important it is defended and maintained. That is an absolute commitment proposed in the articles of the treaty and the amendments tabled to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_518">On the issue of the European Union being too bureaucratic, if there are to be 25 member states trying to find a common position, it is inevitable that it will entail bureaucracy. It is impossible to have a Europe that works unless there are various levels of bureaucracy. The important issue from an Irish perspective – I made this point to the Joint Committee on European Affairs – is that it is essential that Oireachtas Members, particularly those who are members of committees examining European business, have the resources to do the job effectively. There is no point, as I have often done, in dashing into a committee with a few notes on the back of an envelope. European issues cannot be examined and tracked on that basis. Senators and Deputies need the support and resources to do the job effectively.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_221">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_520">I am pleased to speak on the Second Stage of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2003. This is a short Bill aimed at facilitating the early submission of a draft risk equalisation scheme for approval by the House, as required under the Health Insurance Acts 1994 and 2001. The need for the further provisions set out in the Bill arises from consultations held with the Health Insurance Authority and matters raised in the course of preparing the detailed risk equalisation scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The Bill has two main provisions. One provides a broad immunity from liability for damages for the Health Insurance Authority when discharging its statutory functions in good faith. The other is directed at ensuring that the temporary exemption from risk equalisation, which has as its objective the encouragement of competition, is available only to new entrants to the market. The other provisions of the Bill relate in a minor way to the procedures that will apply under risk equalisation arrangements and to funding advanced for the establishment of the Health Insurance Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The Health Insurance Authority's principal functions include managing and administering risk equalisation. Under the Acts and the proposed scheme, the authority will also have a key role in determining when conditions are considered to warrant the commencement of risk equalisation payments between insurers. I acknowledge the constructive contribution made by the authority since its establishment in February 2001 to the development of proposed arrangements for risk equalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I do not propose to go into great detail about the need for risk equalisation to support the operation of community rating in the voluntary private health insurance market going forward. This has been extensively discussed in the House. I am satisfied that providing for such a measure is warranted and I trust that most Members will support this draft scheme which strikes a balance between maintaining community rating and facilitating competition. A draft scheme, which will be submitted to each House for approval, is the subject of detailed contacts with the European Commission. I will refer to this important dimension to preparations for risk equalisation in more detail later.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">At the general level, the objective of risk equalisation is easily appreciated. It follows logically that, in a market where the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover apply, there must be a provision to share risk between competing health. These common good principles curb the usual commercial instincts and incentives that insurers have to select good risks and avoid or discourage bad ones. For these principles to be sustainable, they must be supported by a balancing mechanism that enables insurers with worse than average risks to be compensated for the disproportionate level of the sick and elderly in the insured community they must cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">From the perspective of insurers, risk equalisation addresses the competitive imbalance that can occur as a result of risk selection, whether this occurs due to deliberate actions by insurers or inadvertently because of the more mobile nature of the young and healthy and employer-paid insurance. In effect, risk equalisation seeks to tackle risk selection as a source of competitive advantage. This is equitable given that the usual insurance levers of underwriting and risk-based pricing are not available to competing insurers.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The consequence of risk selection is that the <i>per capita</i> claims cost and, consequently, premiums begin to rise for those insurers who are left with a higher proportion of less healthy individuals. This is a breach of the solidarity principle, which is fundamental to genuine community rating. Risk equalisation addresses this by limiting the extent to which certain healthier people, by benefiting from lower premiums, or their insurers, by taking a higher profit margin, can gain at the expense of other health insurance consumers. In short, risk equalisation aims to equitably adjust differences in health insurers' costs that arise due to variations in risk profiles.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The detailed preparation of a risk equalisation scheme has been a complex matter which has involved considerable actuarial expertise and legal input. Earlier I acknowledged the very constructive part played by the Health Insurance Authority in connection with work done by my Department on the development of a detailed scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">It has also been necessary to approach the formulation of the scheme in a manner that takes account of considerations that apply at EU level. These relate to matters such as observance of general EU legal principles of necessity and proportionality, competition rules and creation of the Single Market. It is widely known that plans for the regulation of our health insurance market have been the subject of fundamental differences with the British United Provident Association, BUPA, which entered the market in 1997. Given this and the fact that the operation of this country's private health insurance market is subject to EU obligations, the regulatory measures to be implemented have attracted close and recurring interest on the part of European Commission services.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">My Department has kept the Commission advised of proposed regulatory arrangements. Although the Commission has formally accepted, in principle, Ireland's entitlement to have specific legal provisions in the interest of the common good in voluntary health insurance, as allowed for under the third non-life insurance directive, it has emphasised the need for necessity and proportionality in any measures that may be taken. Furthermore, ongoing representations and complaints by BUPA have resulted in the Commission revisiting the matter on a number of occasions up to and including the present time.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Further to a complaint by BUPA, the European Union's Competition Directorate General is considering a detailed submission made by my Department. This submission makes the case for the necessity of risk equalisation in a market operated on the basis of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, and that it does not constitute state aid under EU competition rules. It remains my Department's aim to obtain an early decision from the Directorate General on the latest complaint and complete the risk equalisation regulatory framework immediately thereafter. It is contending to the Directorate General that it maintain its previously expressed view that risk equalisation does not give rise to particular state aid concerns. While the experience of European Commission services revisiting the matter of risk equalisation on a number of occasions has impinged on the process of implementing a scheme, I characterise recent contacts with the European Union Competition Directorate General as being positive and constructive.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">As I said, this is a short Bill and while some aspects are technical, its provisions are relatively straightforward. Section 1 provides for interpretation. Section 2 arises from a request made by the Health Insurance Authority that it have protection from suit for damages corresponding to the statutory protection given to other public regulatory bodies. Accordingly, the provision gives a broad immunity to the members of the authority and its staff where they are engaged in the discharge of their functions in good faith. It has been drafted having regard to a similar provision in the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Section 3 amends Part II of the Second Schedule to the Defamation Act 1961. As part of its functions, the authority will be required to make reports and recommendations on the question of commencing financial transfers between insurers under a risk equalisation scheme. The effect of the provision is to add the authority to the bodies which have qualified privilege in respect of a copy or fair and accurate report or summary of any recommendation that the authority may produce. Again, qualified privilege of the same nature is contained in the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Section 4 refines certain procedures that will apply in the steps to be taken after a risk equalisation scheme has come into effect. The limited changes being made arise from consultations with the Health Insurance Authority. The first subsection deals with the requirement for the authority to include in its report to the Minister a recommendation whether he ought to commence risk equalisation payments under a scheme. The legislation, as it stands, makes it clear that recommendations by the authority are for that purpose alone. The amendment is entirely consistent with the current position but clarifies that the authority shall not include a recommendation on the matter in a report where the Minister has already exercised the power to commence risk equalisation transfers under a scheme. The health insurance legislation already contains a provision requiring the authority to submit annual reports with respect to the operation of a scheme, once risk equalisation payments have been commenced. The legislation provides that the Minister shall cause such reports to be laid before each House.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The second subsection relates to the giving of advance notice to parties, by either the authority or the Minister, of its proposed recommendation, in the case of the authority, or the proposed exercise of his powers to commence risk equalisation payments, in the case of the Minister. As the legislation stands, notice in such instances must issue to all registered undertakings which are also given the opportunity to make representations. However, the legislation provides that a scheme may include a provision allowing restricted membership undertakings such as the occupational schemes that apply in the cases of gardaí and prison officers to opt out of risk equalisation. It should not, therefore, be necessary to give notice to undertakings about proposed developments relating to the commencement of transfers under a scheme where such an option may have been used.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Section 5 is concerned with the arrangements in place to facilitate and encourage the entry of new insurers into the market to provide greater competition and choice for consumers. The legislation provides for insurance undertakings which have not yet commenced business to avail of a three year exemption from risk equalisation. The purpose of this is to allow new insurers to establish a critical mass of customers and recover start-up costs before being liable to make any payments in respect of risk equalisation that could arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The provision in the Bill retains this measure. The main purpose of amending the existing provision is to avoid a possibility that the exemption could be availed of by a subsidiary or some other form of associated company of an existing undertaking. This approach is considered desirable in order to remove any possibility of an issue of avoidance arising in the arrangements. As there has not been any indication that an associated company of an existing undertaking was intent on or interested in availing of the exemption, the amendment is most appropriately regarded as a precautionary one. It aims to ensure the exemption will only apply in circumstances where the added value for consumers of private health insurance is a genuine increase in the choice of insurers and greater real competition in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">As I said, the section retains the three year exemption for new entrants. However, it contains provisions aimed at securing a clearer indication of the commitment and serious business intent to actually follow through on entry to the market on the part of insurers which decide to serve a notice of exemption in the future. In that regard, it requires insurers to be registered with the Health Insurance Authority before serving a notice of exemption and that they commence business not later than three months after the date of the notice. Neither of these is an onerous step and it remains in the hands of the new entrant insurer to decide the timing in relation to becoming registered and subsequently serving a notice of exemption.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Section 6 relates to financial arrangements made in relation to the Health Insurance Authority at the time of its establishment. The ongoing operational costs of the authority are funded by the proceeds of a levy on the premium income of registered insurers. The levy is currently set at a rate of 0.14% of that annual premium income. However, the legislation allowed for the Minister to advance funds to the authority and, during 2001, sums slightly greater than €500,000 were advanced to it in respect of initial costs. As the legislation stands, it is obliged to repay the amount advanced. It considers that costs incurred in its establishment should be borne by the State. The authority is a public body and was established to carry out a public service in relation to the common good aspects of health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">This section maintains the option of the Minister effecting repayment of the €500,000 provided towards establishing the authority. It is clear that the provision is an enabling one and does not mean that part or full repayment will automatically be waived – this will be looked at strictly on its merits.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I commend this short Bill to the House for early enactment with a view to moving rapidly ahead with the introduction of a risk equalisation scheme. The scheme, which will follow enactment of the Bill, will meet national requirements for sustaining the operation of the core common good principles of our voluntary private health insurance system, together with taking account of European Commission concerns about necessity, proportionality and competition.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_222">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_541">I welcome the Minister to introduce this short and relatively straightforward Bill. When we talk of health insurance, we think of the VHI and BUPA. The VHI has been in business for about 40 years. At this time we should remember the late Mr. Tom O'Higgins who was instrumental in introducing the VHI which has certainly been very successful. In some countries there are many more private health schemes. In Australia I believe there are up to 20. I am glad we have good insurance schemes because in the United States there is a two tier system under which people close to death who arrive at a hospital are asked if they would like to pay by cash or credit card.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Here we have an aspirational equality of care. There is equal access to public health services which, unfortunately, does not and will not happen. While we have a value for money audit, we are throwing money at the problem. There is accountability and value for money as well as economies of scale. As the Minister knows, this is becoming a major issue with expensive technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">There are also blockages in the system, such as waiting lists, too many staff employed in administration, a shortage of nurses and an excessive workload for nursing staff. A key issue is the role of consultants, without whom our hospitals are nothing. Consultants face the demands of allocating beds and juggling their private and public patients. If the Minister can get to grips with the role of consultants in hospitals, he is a genius.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Private health care is a fast track to treatment. People have been relatively satisfied with the return from VHI premiums and, more recently, from those of BUPA. The danger is that the huge increase in premiums will reduce the number of people who can afford to pay them. This could become a serious problem because it would cement the two-tier system in which the rich receive the best treatment quickly. At the same time, it would increase the number of people dependent on the public purse. The result would be increased waiting lists and the perpetuation of the "beds in the corridor" syndrome we are currently experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Health insurance plays a vital role in the provision of hospital services in that it complements public health services. However, the public-private mix, which is an Irish solution to an Irish problem, is not a real solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">While researching the insurance market, I discovered the two cornerstones of the health insurance market. Community rating means that all members pay the same premium, irrespective of age, sex, health or other factors. Unlike the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> car insurance, this has the benefit of spreading the burden across the membership. Risk equalisation is fundamentally fair and means a company that cherry-picks from a particular group – for example, the 25 years to 35 years age group – as BUPA has done in a limited way, must pay an equalisation levy to other companies which do not engage in such practices. In our case, the VHI, where the average age of members is 36 years, receives the levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Open enrolment, which means entitlement to join a health insurance company for life at any age, is balanced by the ability of the insurer to impose a degree of loading or a delay. This means a person may not join a scheme one day and claim insurance the next.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">It is also interesting that employers are not permitted to insure only healthy staff because this would undermine the solidarity between generations, which underpins community rating and spreads the burden. When BUPA entered the market, community rating was a contentious concept which was supported by the VHI and resisted by BUPA. The Government was in favour of BUPA entering the market to open it up because the VHI held a monopoly at the time. BUPA has now done so and additional new entrants will help to open the market further.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Dublin now has six health boards. In 1975, the city had just 95 administrators. This figure has risen to 11,000, whereas Manchester has just 3,000. We have all heard proposals to deregulate and privatise the health insurance market. This would create a two-tier system in which some people could afford to pay, while others, the public patients, who are also the responsibility of the State, could not.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">One cannot be too critical of paying patients. They pay for, expect and generally get a reasonable service. I assume they also help subsidise the public health service. Ireland's approach to health care is based on a public-private mix, which is not bad if managed properly. I have already referred to the problems in the private system in the United States. I cannot imagine what happens to a person with no health insurance there. Having watched the television series "ER" on occasion, I am glad we have several players in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">I am uneasy about the treatment purchase scheme which takes people abroad – for example, to Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom – for treatment. Last week I learned through the media that a patient who was about to travel to Liverpool for a hernia operation lived within sight of Beaumont Hospital. It is difficult to believe that people who live just yards from a hospital are being sent abroad for treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Another storm is brewing as a result of the State's decision to provide consultants with insurance cover for public work only and insist that they insure themselves for private work. It comes as no surprise that consultants oppose the move.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">I welcome the fact that the Bill, according to the explanatory memorandum, "amends the provisions concerning application of the limited exemption from risk equalisation for new entrant insurers to the market." It also "allows for the Minister for Health and Children, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to waive the repayment of moneys advanced to the authority at the time of its establishment." Is the figure in question €508,000? I agree with the authority's case that the costs incurred as a result of its establishment should be borne by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I welcome the Bill because I believe the scheme established as a result of its enactment will meet the national requirements.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_223">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_555">Tá fáilte roimh an Aire don Teach. Bille an-ghairid é seo ach an-tábhachtach ag an am céanna.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I welcome the Minister. This is a short, but important Bill which meets the demands of those who preach social inclusion. The concept of risk equalisation as contained in the Bill amounts to social inclusion in practice. It will ensure that one section of the community, that comprised by older people, will be treated in a fair manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">With luck, we will all grow old and it is a fair bet we will need health care more frequently than we did when we were 30 or 40 years younger. The Bill will preclude insurers from cherry-picking the young and able as opposed to the old and disabled. Asking younger members of the community to pay a premium to compensate for the loss incurred for older members of the community is the fair and correct approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">I strongly support the Minister's commitment to maintaining the operation of our voluntary private health insurance market based on the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. I also agree that we should make regulatory provision for a scheme of risk equalisation as a necessary support to community rating.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">In discussing health insurance, it is important to note a particular statistic. In 1979, slightly over 21% of the population availed of private health insurance. That figure now stands at a little over 48%, which gives us an idea of how important private health insurance has become. It is important that fair play prevails if there are new entrants to the health insurance market. The Bill ensures this.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">The Department of Health and Children has completed the preparation of a draft scheme to be submitted for approval by each House of the Oireachtas. The Minister made reference to this. The Department has also made a submission to the European Union's Competition Directorate General making the case for the necessity of risk equalisation in a market operated on the basis of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, and that it does not constitute state aid under EU competition rules. That is another important point which should be stressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Given the increasing use of health insurance in our society, it is essential that the private health insurance market is properly regulated and monitored. In that regard, I welcome the role of the Health Insurance Authority. It is vital that everyone who wants to avail of health insurance should be able to do so. The principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover should be strongly adhered to at all times. Furthermore, for the Health Insurance Authority to be effective it is essential that it is brought into line with other independent regulators. There has to be a level playing pitch. Accordingly, I welcome the provision of immunity from damages in the context of the good faith statutory discharge of its functions enshrined in section 2.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I further welcome the application of the Defamation Act 1961. This is very important because we are living in a time when mothers are suing brothers and everyone is suing everyone else on the same basis as the provision of immunity referred to in section 3.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Risk equalisation is an essential component of the health insurance area and will be implemented by both the Minister and the Health Insurance Authority subject to certain thresholds. If the community is split between health insurers in such a manner that one health insurer has relatively more younger policyholders, comparatively speaking, than other policyholders, the principle of inter-generational solidarity breaks down because premiums paid by the younger policyholders with one health insurer are not funding the claims of the older policyholders with the other insurer. If that does not take place, the concept enshrined in the Constitution that we cherish all our children equally will be out the window. It is clear that this would cause difficulties, not just for the older policyholders with the latter health insurer but also for the market as a whole. In this regard, I welcome the social inclusion provided for by risk equalisation. I welcome the contribution the Bill makes to developing a health insurance system which is both efficient and socially inclusive.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_564">I welcome the Minister and the Bill. He must be fed up with the phrase "risk equalisation" because it has been around his neck ever since he took up office in the Department. I hope that when the Bill passes speedily through the Houses, the risk equalisation regulatory framework is brought forward rapidly because it is very important. The Bill is important, not just to the nearly 50% of the population who have private health insurance but also to the Department of Health and Children because if the expense of insuring oneself with a private health insurance company becomes too high, people will fall out of the system which will make the strain on the public system even greater.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">It is important to point out, however, that in many cases there is not much difference between the private and public waiting lists. In the not too distant past I tried to get appointments for patients with dermatologists and orthopaedic surgeons who specialised in back complaints and the waiting list was about the same. Recently, I had a patient who needed an abdominal scan and under the public waiting list the patient would have been seen in a shorter period. That was welcome in that case because the woman involved did not have any private health insurance. There is a myth that one is treated more quickly on the private waiting list. I am sure I am speaking to a discreet audience and that no one will tell people to drop their VHI or BUPA insurance and thereby cause even more problems for the Minister but it is a fact that there is a good deal of congestion in both areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">We had to bring forward a framework of risk equalisation and competition in the health insurance area, although I am glad Senator Feighan mentioned the recently deceased judge, Tom O'Higgins. If any of us could say we had established an institution like Voluntary Health Insurance, which has worn so well for 40 years, we would be very pleased. I am one of those who has been both a subscriber and a patient and a doctor who was paid by it and I have found it extremely satisfactory in all aspects.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_568">I strongly recommend that people take up plan A or B because one pays a great deal of money for the hotel accommodation further on. A large amount of what people need is covered by the more minor plans which I hope people will take into account. It was extraordinary that children were insured under plans D and E when there was no private accommodation for them. People are being a bit flaithiúlacht with their money, although they have complained about the increases in costs. There have been large increases recently. The VHI's costs increased by 18% while those of BUPA increased by 14% but medical inflation is very expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I am interested to hear the Minister say that while he has to make allowances for other insurers who might want to come into the market – they have to be given a three year exemption before they take on risk equalisation – no one else is trying at the moment. This is an area in which it must be very difficult to make money, although I am interested in the fact that the VHI has to produce its accounts every year. Perhaps I have simply failed to get them but I have been unable to find any accounts for BUPA Ireland. I believe that is because it comes under the BUPA UK body and is treated as a type of subsidiary. I would like to know how it is getting on because it is difficult to give an answer when people ask which is the better group to join. It is difficult to compare one scheme with another because they have all become so much more diverse. I wish there was some way we could examine BUPA's accounts but that does not seem to be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">It is important that we try to bring the problem regarding BUPA and the VHI and risk equalisation to a satisfactory conclusion, although I realise that is not the Minister's fault. I do not know who the director general is but matters appear to fall into a black pit and take forever to come out of it but we have to try to come out of it fairly rapidly because those of us who are in the VHI are subsidising those in BUPA, which is getting the younger customers, while the VHI, which is rightly an ongoing scheme and does not throw people out when they are old – Senator Glynn would agree we are all getting older—</p>

          <p eId="para_581">I doubt if that would happen. I, too, welcome this short Bill. I do not intend to go through it as other speakers have made relevant points but will refer to a few areas. The Health Insurance Authority has a five member board. When I looked up the membership this morning, I was impressed by the way the board is financially weighted and by the actuarial and pension information available. I immediately thought this would be a terrible Bill to read through. When I got around to doing so, however, I found it was not that difficult. This is a short Bill which contains some important amending provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">There are two main players in this sector – the VHI and BUPA. As other speakers have said, it is touching that we are having this debate on the day of the burial of Tom O'Higgins, the Minister's predecessor. The late Mr. O'Higgins and the Department showed great foresight in establishing the VHI. Perhaps I am being kind to them, but the young Fine Gael Senators present may not remember BUPA coming on the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">Other speakers have gone into detail on risk equalisation, etc., but my parents, who lived to a ripe old age, were members of the VHI for 40 years and insured us as children. We got huge service from the VHI. Like Senator Henry, I praise the organisation and give credit where it is due. My parents reaped benefits from the VHI that were a thousand times greater than what they paid out in premia. I pay high premia for myself and my children and when I grow old I hope I have the comfort of knowing the VHI will be there for me. The Bill provides a mandate for equality, regardless of age or gender.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I do not mean to open a can of worms for the Minister, but something has always puzzled me when in hospital. One signs on the dotted line as a patient for the services one is about to receive and, when discharged, one hears no more until one receives the little slip saying the bill has been paid. It would be nicer if one did not have to sign a claim form when one enters hospital and if one's consultant or team of doctors came to visit one on the day of discharge to say: "This is what we have done for you – we have put your nail back."</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_590">I listened to the debate about competition, health insurance and related matters and then I saw the complexity of what has to be done in terms of risk equalisation and preserving both community rating and lifetime coverage. It is as well to consider whether competition via multiple insurance agencies is necessarily the best route. I do not have an ideological issue about competition; I have no problem with it in many cases where one has a real market in commodities or services without extra overtones. However, I am sceptical when it comes to health care</p>
          <p eId="para_591">If one went through a first year economics textbook one would find so much that is different about health care that the assumptions on which an efficient, competitive marketplace is supposed to operate would fall apart. That is what the Minister is learning from all the lobbying that is taking place. There is a strong suspicion that the second company in the Irish health insurance market is not in a position to make money, but that it ultimately will have to deal with risk equalisation. It has fought a ferocious battle on this issue with intensive lobbying, as the Minister knows, localised in the Cork region to persuade those in that area of the threat to jobs if risk equalisation comes is forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I still hold many left wing views, but I have never had a problem with competition. With regard to the development of the health insurance market in the United States – which has the most expensive health care system in the world – that country spends 13% to 14% of its gross domestic product on health care. This means that one dollar in seven of the GDP of the richest country in the world is spent on health care. What is the outcome? They have lower life expectancy than virtually all the European countries, Ireland excluded. I blame the Minister for many things, but Irish people's life expectancy is the result of factors other than the bad health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">People in America have a low life expectancy and there is a high infant mortality rate. It is estimated that 40 million American citizens do not have health insurance, but there is a ferociously competitive health insurance industry in that country. In many instances, decisions which should be made by medical experts about where people should go and what treatment they should receive are made by people in the insurance industry. Few terms are more calculated to raise the ire of Americans than that of "HMO", which refers to health maintenance organisations. These are universally loathed and if they make the wrong decision, they cannot be sued due to a clause in the legislation governing their operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">There is a major issue at stake here with regard to EU competition policy. In France, this area has developed with a multiplicity of insurance companies evolving at around the same time. We are now grappling with the issue of having had a State monopoly which was unaccountable in many ways. Approximately two years ago, the then Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, was in the Seanad for a debate with Senator Ross, who has a bee in his bonnet about the VHI. Senator Ross was in particularly eloquent form and we learned that the VHI had 400 employees and 40 cars; not vans, but motorised vehicles for the use of their staff. The Minister of State was as taken aback as we were and he undertook to return to the matter but the election intervened.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">There was a lack of regulation, transparency and accountability which has nothing to do with the current Minister. On the other hand, we all know that if one goes into a private hospital and one has reasonable VHI cover, there is an argument as to whether 90% of the tests, each of which commands a small fee from the health insurance agency, is necessary. There is a need here for medical accountability to justify that.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Judging from the Minister's contribution and some unstated issues, the competition route is consuming a disproportionate amount of his time. Grappling with risk equalisation is taking up someone's time to judge by the toing and froing to the EU—</p>

          <p eId="para_601">The idea that competition is the best route to providing efficient health insurance is wide open to debate. EU competition policy, which is ideal for so many areas, should not stretch into an area where people are not able to make free choice and where risk equalisation and community rating comes in the equation. We are moving so far from a competitive market that we must ask if we are going through a charade of a competitive market to meet a charade of a competition policy. In the end nothing better will be available than was previously the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Any evaluation in the financial press of the comparative costs of VHI and BUPA will state that it comes down to individual preference. I have not seen any authority write with any certainty on the costings of each body and state that one is better than the other. There is an argument that the existence of two insurance companies means neither can take advantage of consumers. I would not be so sure because one leap-frogs the other in terms of increases. If one gets an increase, the other will follow within a period long enough for it to claim an advantage and short enough to claim the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">In the long term we should think if we want to create a situation where there is a multiplicity of health insurers. This is not consistent with the views of my party but I am sceptical of competition policy and competition in health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The Minister mentioned the role of the authority, saying that it will make recommendations on whether or not to commence risk equalisation payments under a scheme. What is the necessity for then saying that the authority shall not include a recommendation on the matter in a report where the Minister has already exercised the power?</p>

This Bill is appropriate and important because it introduces competition to health insurance. BUPA and VHI hold a monopoly.

          <p eId="para_611">Statistics prove that men do not look after themselves, be they young or old. They think they are indestructible, that nothing will break. Senator Feighan will agree that soccer is the only forum where private insurance companies target young men. That forum presented my only opportunity to think about health insurance and the chance that something might go wrong with my health. A large percentage of men are introduced to health insurance by their wives or, in Senator Feighan's case, his mother.</p>

          <p eId="para_623">The Minister stated that this is a short Bill to facilitate the early submission of a draft risk equalisation scheme and it appears innocuous. When the primary legislation for this was introduced in the other House, it was a matter on which I spoke at length.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">I take on board the geographical argument made by Senator Ryan about health insurance. BUPA is based in my area but every single contributor to the debate should have at the core of his or her argument the need to improve competition in health insurance in all areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">If the late Deputy Jim Mitchell had faced the restrictions we are putting in place for health insurance when he introduced competition into the airline industry, there would be no Ryanair and it would cost €500 to fly from Dublin to London. If new providers are to enter the health insurance market we must be careful about the legislation we introduce and I am not happy with this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The Minister described it as a short Bill, simply putting in place further provisions for risk equalisation. Why is the Government once again amending the health insurance Acts? It seems to be pursuing a strategy of strangling competition through the imposition of a risk equalisation scheme. That is the essence of this Bill. Risk equalisation can only be justified in the context of protecting the VHI in advance of allowing that company to be sold off.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">We have debated this matter over many hours in various committees and the Minister appears to have rather firm views. I have the gravest doubts about risk equalisation and I do not buy into the spurious argument concerning what is called "cherry-picking". When one asks the reasons for introducing risk equalisation, the simplistic, instant response is that it is to prevent cherry-picking. The consumer is not interested in cherry-picking but will buy into the best package available, irrespective of whether that is provided by BUPA, VHI or any other company. So be it. We should not be concentrating on protecting one company but on strengthening competition in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The Minister referred to our position in relation to EU competition law. In reply to a parliamentary question in the Dáil on 21 November last, the Minister said his Department had proceeded on the basis of the findings of the relevant EU directorate that risk equalisation does not give rise to state aid concerns. However, the <i>Irish Medical News</i>, in its issue of 17 February this year, quoted from the Minister's letter to the EU, which was released under the Freedom of Information Act, in which he said that the competition directorate had advised Department officials at a meeting in Brussels in March 1999 that it did not have particular state aid concerns about risk equalisation. On the basis of that reading, everything seems fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">However, I also refer to a letter from a senior Commission official to the Irish permanent representative on 20 July 1999 stating that the Commission's views on risk equalisation at that stage were based only on oral explanations offered and pending a detailed scrutiny of the proposals. That differs substantially from the Minister's statement that the Commission did not have particular state aid concerns in relation to risk equalisation. The Commission official went on to stress the need for continued vigilance to ensure that any future reforms of Irish private health insurance continued to take account of considerations stemming from EU law.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, stated on 21 November 2002 that a copy of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2000, which provided for revised risk equalisation arrangements, was forwarded to the EU directorate for information and did not give rise to any further queries. At best, the Minister was being rather economical in terms of the whole picture, having regard to the fact that, some months later, a senior Commission official stated that the Commission services did not know the contents of measures under discussion and, therefore, could not take any final position on their conformity with EU law.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">All is not as clear as the Minister would wish us to believe. The EU has not given any green light or <i>carte blanche </i>to risk equalisation. That does not surprise me as I believe the concept of risk equalisation poses the most serious doubts about competition across the market. In a further communication in November 1999, the same EU official said that a final decision of the Commission services regarding the conformity of the Irish private health insurance regime cannot be taken as long as the process of reform is in course and until the final details are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Clearly, as I said, there is no green light from Europe for what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill with regard to the concept of risk equalisation. Final judgment is suspended. However, a judgment has been made by a person of some significance who is a European expert, former director general of competition policy and former head of legal services, Professor Klaus Dieter Ellerman. In his view, which was cited in the Dáil by former Deputy Des O'Malley in December 2000, there is no doubt that risk equalisation in the private health insurance market is an unlawful state aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I ask the Minister to be a little more clear-cut as to what he is trying to achieve in this Bill. I ask him to explain, to my satisfaction, why he considers the risk equalisation mechanism so desirable. Will it aid competition or stifle it? If risk equalisation is as positive as the Minister claims, is it not rather surprising that, against this so-called perfect backdrop, no further companies have been willing to enter the health insurance market? By comparison with other EU countries, we have very few health insurance companies operating in Ireland. I suggest that is because the issue of risk equalisation causes the greatest possible problems to small companies. My concerns and doubts about this concept when it was originally introduced have certainly not disappeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">I wish to see competition in health insurance. Every citizen of this State should have the opportunity to purchase health insurance, whether from VHI, BUPA or any other source. There is a role for all of those companies but if we try to tweak the market or create a false market, competition will be stifled and, in the long run, the consumer will suffer. While the airline industry may not be the best example, we have seen what happened in the absence of competition in that sector and the blockages which were put in place – and are still kept in place by some people – in an attempt to stifle competition. When competition finally burst through, the consumer was the primary beneficiary. I believe the same principle applies to health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">While it may sound fine to describe this measure as a short Bill aimed at facilitating the early submission of a draft risk equalisation scheme, I see it as a short Bill aimed at stifling competition, propping up the VHI and keeping any further competition out of the market. That is a bad move for the consumer, the health market in general and future competition. I ask the House to take those concerns on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Why should we fear competition? Why should we rush to introduce very false, artificial mechanisms to keep the big operators big and keep out the smaller companies. Is there any other industry or system in which the smaller players are expected to hand over 10% or 20% of their income to the bigger players? I find that absolutely bizarre. The explanations given in 2000 and 2001 were not satisfactory. I am concerned that we are going down a very dangerous route where competition will be stifled and the consumer will be hindered.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_637">My position on this issue is rather similar to that of Senator Bradford. When I first heard of this equalisation scheme, I regarded it as pure protectionism, aimed at stifling competition. On first reading the Minister's speech with regard to the draft risk equalisation scheme, I misread "draft" as "daft" and was overjoyed that the Minister was on our side. In fact, I have changed my mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I listened carefully to the debate. I grew up in a business in which we encouraged competition in every case. I accept the examples we have heard about today, that what happened when we introduced competition, particularly into the airline business, has benefited everybody. Yet we heard for years that there should not be open competition in one particular field or another for various reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">My first experience of having to put in stipulations regarding competition was when I was in An Post. I discovered that if we allowed total competition, then the low cost operator would only compete when it suited. In other words, the couriers would deliver in Dublin city at the same rate but would never have delivered in the countryside where one gets a letter once a month. I realised that this question of open competition needs to be a little tenuous. Maybe we have to consider that there is a difference and there are occasions when we have to take something into account. It seems that community rating must take this into account. Therefore, when I looked at whether we should be encouraging competition, I realised that there may have to be a different solution under certain circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">It has been interesting to listen to what has been said here. We are very anxious to make sure that every citizen is capable of having health insurance. It seems to me that will not happen unless we tamper with open competition and say that we must find a solution to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I am not sure that this is the ideal solution. I am not sure the Minister believes it either, but it is the best solution that he has been able to come up with on this occasion. Therefore I feel we have to support it until we can come up with something better.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I would love to think that, as in other areas, we could have competition from many other parties in health insurance. At present, there is only the VHI and BUPA and it looks as though it is unlikely that we will find others easily coming into this marketplace. If we open the doors to normal competition which we should encourage, we will find that we will not be able to cater for some people, particularly the elderly. The younger people tend not to get ill. With normal competition, those who join will be able to come in at a much lower rating and a provider like the VHI, which is stranded with the older population, will not be able to survive in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">This is one of these occasions where I must go against my normal commitment to encourage competition. There is no better solution than this at present. Let us accept this, as it is. There may be amendments on Committee Stage which would improve this Bill but at this stage I support the Minister in what he is attempting to achieve.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_644">I thank the Members of the House for their comments and views on the Bill. I am grateful for the broad and informative discussion of its provisions which has taken place in this House. I will consider the points made in the context of the preparations for further discussion on the Bill in the course of the coming week.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">I greatly appreciate the support and analysis presented by Senator Quinn. He is quite right on the issue of risk equalisation. The scheme has been rated by independent examinership and supported by the Advisory Group on the Risk Equalisation Scheme and by the Irish Society of Actuaries. That indicates where we are coming from in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">There were many others who expressed support for the Bill. I appreciate their comments and their expression of support for community rating and risk equalisation, and the contribution of private health insurance for the delivery of our overall health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">It was interesting to note the remarks of Senator Henry in so far as one will appreciate that she has a good knowledge of the marketplace. She made a number of factual points, particularly on the instances in the area of the public hospital system where one may be able to get speedier access to treatment than in the private system. I am delighted to hear this. Where at one stage the opposite was the case, we are starting to see the tide turn in that regard. The national treatment purchase fund has also helped to improve our capacity at public level, as well as of course utilising the private system.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Senator Henry also spoke about an interesting statistic which she quoted. She said that 80% of the population were covered by Plan B insurance, either by VHI or BUPA. In answer to the question of whether BUPA produces separate accounts for its branch operations in Ireland, I can say that they are not required to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">There were a number of other comments by Senators Feeney, Ryan and McHugh. All in all, they welcomed the two main provisions of the Bill, providing a broad immunity from liability for damages for the Health Insurance Authority when discharging its statutory functions in good faith, and of course the encouragement of competition. I welcome the comments made on the other provisions in the Bill relating to procedures which will apply under risk equalisation arrangements and funding advancement for the establishment of the Health Insurance Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I want to touch on Senator Bradford's comments. I think he misunderstands the Bill. I might even quote what the Minister said, which puts much of what Senator Bradford said into perspective. The Minister stated that the latest position is as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Further to a complaint by BUPA, the European Union's Competition Directorate General is considering a detailed submission made by my Department. This submission makes the case for the necessity of risk equalisation in a market operated on the basis of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, and that it does not constitute state aid under EU competition rules. It remains my Department's aim to obtain an early decision from the Directorate General on the latest complaint and complete the risk equalisation regulatory framework immediately thereafter. It is contending to the Directorate General that it maintain its previously expressed view that risk equalisation does not give rise to particular state aid concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">I hope that adequately answers Senator Bradford's points in a number of areas. The Minister has made it clear, and I am happy to confirm, that we are dealing with the Commission. A large part of the Minister's speech, other than the part I cited, clearly clarifies that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Senator Bradford, in fairness, stated he was not in the House when the Minister commenced his Second Stage contribution. I ask the Senator to study what the Minister has said and the Official Report of this debate, which will indicate that other people had a better understanding of the content of the Bill. If he still has concerns at that stage, I invite him to make contact with our office and we will clarify any misunderstandings.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">By and large, those Senators who have had an opportunity to consider the Bill, and who did take the opportunity of studying it, welcomed what we are trying to do in it. I thank them for their contributions in this regard.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_656">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_657">That Seanad Éireann, welcoming the allocation of €9 billion in health funding by the Government this year and mindful of the objective of delivering quality services and value for money with these resources, calls upon the Minister for Health and Children and the Government to take early and decisive action to reform the management structures and financial accountability of the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">This year the Government will allocate just over €9 billion of public expenditure to the health service, nearly three times the level of resources allocated just before the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil coalition Government took office in 1997. Nearly one quarter of all current spending is devoted to the health service and the rate of increase has been extraordinary. During the years of exceptional growth no other area of current spending received such additional resources or was given such priority. Nearly 100,000 are now employed in the health service. While more can always be done in the health sector and the people rightly expect the Government to stretch itself and do more, the full picture of what is happening in the health service cannot exclude the tremendous increases in resources devoted to the sector in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Controversy and political points are always made about the marginal increases in funding, relative to previous years, in particular areas. While this is to be expected, no rational policy discussion can ignore the volume of current spending, what it is we are trying to achieve and what new spending and services we would like to introduce. No rational policy for any area of public spending requires continued increases of 100% every four years or so. This is especially the case in areas like health or education which take up large parts of the current budget. Behind the political rhetoric, public representatives who have a serious interest in health policy accept this. If we are spending one quarter of current Exchequer spending on the health service, we owe it to the public, whose money it is, to make sure we are spending it effectively. We are obliged to ensure we are managing and accounting for its resources well. As public representatives, our job is to require health management and administration to be focused on outcomes and results for the users of health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The welcome increase in funding since 1997 has shown clearly how ineffective are the management structures and accountability of the health service. In previous years, when resources were not so available, we could have argued that the problem was lack of resources but that argument is now hollow. Clearly, the problem is not resources but rather how these public resources are planned, managed and accounted for. Is the €9 billion spend delivering everything we can expect it to? Do the 100,000 who work in the health service use their talents effectively and are they well-managed and focused on service delivery? Is there clear and accurate public accountability for this level of public resources? Fundamentally, does the system work? Clearly, the answer is "No". It neither works as we expect it to nor as the public deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">This is not a reflection on anyone because thousands of fine people work in all parts of the health service and they want to be effective in their work and the services they provide. It is instead a reflection of what is now a dysfunctional system, a collection of often unrelated institutions, agencies, decision-makers, boards and advisory bodies. The Government has recognised that there is an urgent need for review and action to address the problem of the health system being less than effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">In 2001 the value for money audit that my party particularly sought identified serious deficiencies in the capabilities of health boards to develop service plans, manage value for money and implement performance management models. A big gap in terms of data and management information was identified. In essence, health boards were often more focused on administration than real management.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Efforts at effective management at national and regional level were dissipated by the proliferation of organisations and the absence of management capabilities on boards. The value for money audit did not make a strong recommendation about health boards and agencies but the issue of what to do about them was highlighted in An Agreed Programme for Government as a matter of urgency. The programme states: "We will seek the completion of the report on health agencies and management structures by the end of 2002 and will move forward on the principle of removing unnecessary overlap of functions and minimising delays in implementing service improvements." The report by Prospectus Management Consultants is nearing completion and I understand its recommendations are likely to come before Government soon. It is vital that this report and others nearing completion in the areas of financial accountability and medical manpower are far-reaching and courageous in their conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">We have too many health boards. They do not provide effective governance or management structures for public money in the health service and are not delivering the valuable local and community input into the service that people want. There is too much inconsistency in health planning and delivery and too many agencies in the service. What we need is rationalisation. The public needs to know who is deciding what and why. The taxpayers and users of the services are paying for this, not the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Many reports over the past decades have been acted on only partially or minimally. We now have major funding for health and it time for major reforms. The system is not working well. Not only will it be unable to respond to increased funding in future, it is not using well enough its existing €9 billion funding. When evaluating these reports the Minister and the Government should think big and look beyond the pressures from interest groups and individuals which inevitably arise when change is proposed. Change is difficult but it must be embraced. It brings uncertainty and people's fear of change is often greater than their dislike of present problems. Organisations and systems do not welcome change, even when people within them know that something is wrong with the status quo. I have no doubt there will be objections from well-meaning people and organisations, from clinicians, managers, administrators, representative groups and public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">I urge those groups to look at the wider picture, and to regard the Government's proposals, when they are presented, as opportunities for improvement for the people we serve rather than as threats to their position. Above all, those groups should reflect that the health services cannot be sustained and developed if they remain as they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">A first principle in medicine is do no harm. In policy making it is said, ‘If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Let us agree that the health system is broken and needs fixing. It is futile to argue about how or where it is broken and who is at fault. Doing nothing is not an option. Reform is absolutely necessary and that means reform for us, not only for other people and other groups. I urge the Minister and the Government to implement the required changes rapidly. Delays waste time and money.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">In 1996, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Noonan, announced the plan to establish an Eastern Regional Health Authority. It was another three years, however, before the legislation giving effect to the ERHA was passed. This structure has not worked as well as was hoped because it created another layer of governance and management,</p>
          <p eId="para_669">I have no doubt that reforming the Health Act 1970, which set up the health boards, and the raft of secondary legislation governing health agencies, will be complex. It must be done carefully and correctly. We cannot afford three years or more of analysis, consultation, drafting and debate. In this motion, we are urging decisiveness in policy implementation. I am confident that the Government will be decisive and that it wants to address the problems identified in the value for money audit, as well as those we encounter in our work and the issues that I expect to be highlighted in the imminent consultancy reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The review of agencies and management structures is a key part of the Government's health strategy. Although the strategy set out over 100 actions, the media most frequently judge it by the number of new hospital beds provided. If one looks closely at the analysis of our health system and its numerous anomalies, one will easily conclude that the most important strategic actions on health policy will be reforms of management, financial accountability and medical personnel. These are the areas addressed in the forthcoming consultancy reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">System change is strategic and we seldom have the chance to implement it but this Government will have the opportunity to do so. In the coming months we can initiate strategic change in our health service. That is what the Government's health strategy and policy should be judged on.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I am confident that the Government has the will and capacity to meet that test. I urge the Minister to embrace the process rapidly and begin the reforms and make the political decisions necessary to flag our intention in this regard. I believe that the Minister has the ability to do so and I hope he will embrace that challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The Progressive Democrats look forward to an intensive and focused debate on these issues in the coming months. Moreover, we look forward to action on strategic change that will make a real difference in the services we provide to the public, funded by public resources.</p>

          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_675">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p eId="para_676">To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_677">"Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its abject failure for almost six years to reform the health service, to ensure value for the enormous sums of taxpayers' money spent and for failing to show the political leadership or decision making capability to guarantee and sustain an equitable and quality health service in the future."</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Senator Minihan has put forward an eloquent and necessary motion. I stand back from it, however, to move this amendment. It is like the good cop bad cop routine. The Progressive Democrats Party has suddenly realised that there is a problem in the health services. No previous Government has had over five years to deal comprehensively with the health service, with huge budgets at its disposal. We are now as badly off as we were when the Government parties took office almost six years ago. It has done nothing to arrest the decline of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The health service is the most important service of all but it is also the most neglected. I can recite a litany of its inadequacies. In the last four and half years the Government recruited 4,000 administrative staff but only 2,000 nurses, which demonstrates an unusual sense of priorities. The scandal of the waiting lists is a horror. The state of the nation's health is equally horrific. Ireland has the highest rate in Europe of death from heart disease, which accounts for almost half of all deaths here. The rate is almost twice the EU average. One third of deaths of people under the age of 65 are caused by cancer. This is the third highest death rate from cancer in Europe. Many of those who die are awaiting so-called elective treatment. We can improve our health care in these areas while ensuring that the significant advances we already enjoy are maintained and built upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Double standards exist in Ireland today; if one pays for health care, one will live longer and in less pain while those on low incomes will suffer. This is unjust, unacceptable and untenable. There must be a comprehensive, high quality health service available to all based on fair criteria, not the size of a person's bank balance. Citizens cannot be confident of appropriate treatment when they are ill. Major health care service providers have not justified the trust placed in them by citizens. The poor, elderly and many others suffer second-class treatment or no treatment at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">That the Government has shown a glaring lack of leadership and direction in solving the critical problems of the health care system is obvious. Despite the increased investment in health over the past five years and the various waiting list initiatives, the reduction in waiting lists since 1997 has been a minimal 1,000 persons per year. Add to that the fact that 57% of people on waiting lists are waiting for a bed in one of the Dublin hospitals where numbers on the lists have risen by 16.5% over the past five years. Many of the national specialty hospitals are based in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">More worryingly, the most recent waiting list figures available are from June 2002, before the post-election cutbacks. We have to wait until mid-May to find out the number of people on waiting lists as a result of post-election cutbacks and the withdrawal of the national treatment purchase fund. It is outrageous that the Department's information systems are so antiquated that it takes four and a half months to establish how many people are awaiting a hospital bed. Four out of ten children who need cardiac surgery have to wait the promised six months, seven out of ten of those awaiting ear, nose or throat surgery have to wait the same length of time, as do eight out of ten children awaiting plastic surgery.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">Tá fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. In any circumstances that have existed for 30 years, it is important to look at how the Government has performed and what it has achieved. To borrow a well-hackneyed catch call, a lot has been done, there is more to do and we must ask how we can improve on it. I support the motion tabled by the Progressive Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">As a member of a health board, having worked for a health board and having spent almost 24 years in public life, it would be remiss of me not too look at both sides of the coin. We must look at what the health boards have achieved and endeavour to do what must be done. In the context of human living there is no such thing as utopia.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Today's conventional wisdom is that structural reform means fewer health boards. By Irish standards the health system is vast and complex. Reducing the number of health boards will not be a panacea for all our ills; health boards are only one element of the health service and it is important that the roles and responsibilities of those involved in any future system should be clearly defined. Issues of governance will also arise. Is the future system to be a tightly controlled centralised model and what role will local democracy play?</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Funding has been increased by 154% to almost €9 billion – a 6% increase on last year. While there has been a welcome increase in the level of funding for health and social services, the current level of spending is not excessive by international standards. This funding has resulted in an increase of 17% in hospital activity since 1997. More than 970,000 in-patient discharges were treated in 2002. Contrary to statistics offered by the Opposition, waiting lists are down by 22% nationally.</p>

          <p eId="para_691">This increase is delivered in a hospital system where, it is acknowledged, there is a need for a significant increase in the number of acute beds, as articulated in the national health strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">The reduction of the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals through the development of a range of community-based services is another great achievement. The number of in-patient residents in psychiatric hospitals fell from 20,000 in 1960 to 4,256 in 2001, a huge achievement by any standard. Those people are living a normal life consistent with their capacity to do so. This has been achieved through the health board system.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Health boards have developed a number of specialist services in recent decades, such as child and adolescent psychiatric teams, consultant-led substance misuse teams, psychiatry of later life teams – where there is a centre at St. Loman's Hospital in Mullingar – and specialist teams for persons with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">In terms of numbers, the Midlands Health Board was the smallest in the country until recently when it overtook the North Western Health Board. The board of which I am a member has brought a number of new services on-stream while living within its budget. We have heard much about the dental services and I am delighted the industrial relations matter has been resolved. Thanks to the services of our consultant orthodontist, the board has eliminated the waiting list for orthodontics in two of the four counties it covers and is well on the way to eliminating the waiting lists in the other counties.</p>

          <p eId="para_699">Health boards have developed strong working links with non-statutory agencies. In the area of intellectual disabilities, they have put in place the required consultants under the enhancing of partnership framework. Health boards have put the necessary structures and service level agreements in place to discharge their responsibilities in the area of food control. Boards have developed their capacity to work in an inter-agency manner through a number of national, regional and local fora, such as the county development boards. Health boards operate within a relatively well developed accountability framework, although I accept there is a debate about that. However, there is no such thing as utopia and there is nothing that cannot be improved. We should always challenge decisions, particularly in the area of health. We should even challenge our own decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Health boards have made significant progress in recent years in developing community care services, such as home support services, day care services, supports for carers, health screening services, public health nursing services and therapy services, such as occupational services and physiotherapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">One of the Senators mentioned staffing. The staff drive and deliver the service, but there is a misconception about them. There were 68,000 staff in the health services in 1997 and 96,000 in 2002. It should be noted that this increased staffing level includes 340 extra consultants, 5,800 nurses – not the 2,000 quoted by Senator Feighan – and over 600 training places. Just over a week ago I was delighted to present the second batch of graduate nurses to the Midland Health Board. The board also has an intake of psychiatric nursing trainees.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The national task force on medical staffing was examining the implications of introducing a consultant provided service and reforming the development of non-consultant hospital doctors to meet EU requirements. The task force made it clear that it will not be sufficient to simply look at the number of medical staff. It must also consider delivery of services throughout the hospital system and have full regard to the interactions with primary care and long-term care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">In the past Ireland's health service has held up well, given that the system has remained largely the same at its core for over 30 years. However, it is now time to examine the structure. There is nothing so good that it cannot be improved. This motion says, in essence, that the health boards have delivered well in the context of services. Questions are being asked about accountability and services. Many of the administrative positions that have been referred to are for secretaries working in accident and emergency, for consultants and for other services. They are, therefore, front line service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">It is not my intention to criticise anybody. Every one is providing a service. The question is whether we can do it better.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_709">No. This was highlighted in the recent debate on agriculture. Members from the Government side read prepared scripts they had never seen, not to mind written.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">We are more than a year into the new health strategy and we have seen little that benefits people. This is particularly so in Carlow, the only county in Ireland with no hospital. The town of Carlow is constantly growing but it has been neglected. There are poor step-down convalescent facilities there. The town has been waiting more than six years for a ten bed extension to the district hospital, which I discussed with the Minister yesterday, and it has also been waiting for a 13 bed extension to the Sacred Heart hospital for many years. This is unfair to families in Carlow who must travel 50 miles to a hospital in Dublin or Waterford to visit relations and endure the stress and trauma this causes. Even when their relatives are recuperating, they must continue to travel long distances. People in Carlow are realistic. They realise there cannot be a hospital in every town and village, but they do expect to have step-down convalescent facilities. They are entitled them.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The previous speaker referred to the health boards. I welcome the Minister's announcement that he will reduce the number of health boards. However, initial reports suggested that he planned to remove public representatives from the health boards. Public representatives are not the problem. Public representatives are elected by the people and are accountable to them. Somebody once said that medicine is too serious to be left to doctors. The last thing we need is a group of consultants in an area looking after their own departments and not keeping the bigger picture in mind. The beauty of having public representatives on health boards is that they will see the bigger picture, both in geographical terms and in terms of human resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Money is not the problem in the health services. The current Government and its predecessor proved that by substantially increasing spending on health. Unfortunately, problems still exist. Recently I encountered a lady who needed to have a tooth removed. She was told she would have to wait until November to have it done. That is what is happening. She went for private treatment and had the tooth removed the next day. To expect somebody to wait for 11 months with a toothache is unrealistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The Government has failed to address the problems in nursing. I attach great importance to the nurses in the health service. The last speaker mentioned the 96,000 people employed in the health sector. I would appreciate information on the number of nurses and an exact breakdown of the categories of staff. I have a sneaking suspicion that many of them, particularly those employed in recent years, work in administrative areas. They are not needed there. It only creates further layers of bureaucracy. We have greater need of nurses, consultants and doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">I compliment the health services on the great work they have done in the area of mental health. Carlow is the location of St. Dymphna's psychiatric hospital, which has done great work with its patients. Many of them have been moved out into the community, which allows them to live a more regular lifestyle. That is a welcome step. However, there are many more new challenges in health. I recently attended a meeting in Carlow on autism. This problem has huge implications for the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science. The issue of assessment must be examined. Parents are still being forced to have their children assessed privately for dyslexia and autism. The Minister should give this matter particular attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Will the Minister talk to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs about the dental dispute and make her see sense? Will he ensure that the people who paid PRSI contributions and had to pay dentists in the last few months are given a refund, to which they are entitled?</p>

They praise the Minister for putting €9 billion into the health service, but then seek early decisive action to reform the management structures and financial accountability. What have they been doing for the last five years? There have been numerous reports. Indeed, there have been more leaks than reports. There are leaks in the newspapers every week.</p>

          <p eId="para_718">The Government may not be able to control leaks but it can certainly control the management of the health service, the subject of the Progressive Democrats motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Senator Glynn said €9 billion was not a major amount by European standards to invest in the health service. He referred to the work of the health boards and said they should not be abolished. The Progressive Democrats say they should. There is double speak surrounding the health service while patients suffer. What is the Government doing about it? Many areas of the health service have been improved and the Minister probably does his best but it is not enough where the public is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">We talk about removing political representatives from health boards, although we do not even know if the boards will be abolished such is the level of double talk on the part of the Government parties on the issue. That said, the Minister knows that the medical profession is more political than public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">There is greater bureaucracy in the health service than before. There are more administrators than care workers. The motion tabled by the Progressive Democrats praises the investment of €9 billion in the health service by the Government. Never before has so much money been invested but, as was suggested by a Senator on the Government side, it is not being managed properly for which responsibility rests with the Government. The Progressive Democrats are criticising their own Government. They are trying to have it both ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The people will decide on this issue when it comes to local, European and general elections. Prior to the previous general election Fianna Fáil Deputies and prospective Fianna Fáil Deputies in every constituency promised that certain services would be made available. The chickens are now coming home to roost. I hope the leak regarding radiotherapy facilities is incorrect because we received more promises from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that radiotherapy services would be made available in Waterford Regional Hospital. I hope those facilities will be delivered by the Government because we need them. The regionalisation of such facilities is part of the health strategy and the programme for Government. Will it be another one of those promises that will be forgotten once the general election is over?</p>

It has not done this and had no intention of doing so. It is frightening that in this day and age people who are ill will be treated in our hospitals, if they are lucky enough, based on the amount of money they have in their wallets, not on how sick they are. That is the health service being characterised by arch-conservative right-wing politics in this country since 1997. Never has it been as bad as this. Occasionally we get quasi-acknowledgements of how bad it is. However, we now have to listen to the rubbish in this House this evening where we are told by the minority partner in the Government that it is doing a wonderful job.

We hear excuses as to the reason it is not in place from Senators on the other side of the House but it is just not good enough. It is a disgrace that a scheme which can detect such a serious illness has not been extended nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Last Monday night in Bantry in west Cork I attended an information meeting called by a voluntary service provider in the area of disability called CoAction. CoAction deals with some hundreds of people with intellectual difficulties and children with special needs. It provides a range of resources and services. In recent years it has primarily been driven by volunteers. These wonderful people have met 20% of its annual expenditure in recent years through fundraising. Unfortunately, the organisation is talking about making people redundant and cutting its services because the Government has reneged on a commitment given to it in 1997 to give €1.5 million per annum to fund the core part of its services. That results in the people concerned having to implement harsh, nasty, cruel cuts because the Government does not care.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The Book of Estimates, which was bandied about before the horrendous budget that followed late last year, is now coming home to roost. It is hitting the most vulnerable and the worst-off in our society. What kind of Administration stands idly by and contemplates buying a government jet for €40 million or €60 million while it can see organisations like CoAction in west Cork starved of funding? That is not something to be proud of but something to be ashamed of. Senators, who table a Private Members' motion to the effect that the Government should get a clap on the back, want their heads examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">I accept the Minister is a busy man and that a number of representations will be made to him concerning CoAction. However, I hope he will find it in his heart to use his political resources to give €1.5 million per annum to organisations like it. I particularly ask him to address service providers which work for those with disabilities. The horror being inflicted on families with children of special needs is unthinkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The dogs in the street know our health system is on the point of collapse. The Government needs to wake up and smell the coffee. For once Fianna Fáil should not concentrate on entertaining its builder and developer friends from the elitist sections in society at the hospitality tent at the Galway races. It should come off its high horse and look at the ordinary men and women tricked into voting for a right-wing arch-conservative Administration on the basis of a plethora of lies last year.</p>

Senator Browne talked about somebody waiting six months to have a tooth extracted. I do not know what type of treatment he is talking about. He should wake up and check his facts. He talked about nursing. He should check what the Minister and his Department have done in providing extra places in our nursing schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">To use a well borrowed phrase, there is a lot done, more to do. During a previous debate here involving the Minister a few hours ago, we heard Senator Henry praise the public health service over waiting lists. She has said it is now easier to be seen as a public patient than it is as a private patient. I take my hat off to her for acknowledging this. We have all acknowledged it and are aware of it. Every day I hear good stories from people who have received excellent care in our public health service. When I come in here, I am subjected to total rubbish from the Opposition, about which I get annoyed.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">The Minister has been there since January 2000. I remember the day he was appointed. It was around 26 January 2000, the day my father was buried. From working in the health service, I know at first hand how the Minister is viewed. I said this last week and I am sorry for repeating it but it warrants repetition. The Minister is well recognised and appreciated by both patient and medic, in particular by the medics, the consultants. I now have to listen to the Opposition shouting all sorts of nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">I do not recognise Senator Browne's depiction of waiting lists in paediatrics as this is one of the areas where there is no waiting list. The Minister will shortly introduce competence assurance for all medical practitioners. This will have a very positive impact on patients. I have experienced at first hand his great interest in the area of enterpise liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">We should be sensible and harbour no illusions that €9 billion is not a wonderful sum to invest in the area of medicine in one year. The nature of health care means it will continue to absorb funding. We all know from media reports that the Minister is constantly knocking at the Minister for Finance's door seeking more funding. I would go as far as to say he is one of the best Ministers for Health the State has had or is likely to have. I agree with everything Senator White said in praise of the Minister.

          <p eId="para_798">The motion tabled by the Progressive Democrats Senators shows their lack of confidence in the Minister. Their consitituents and voters have been urging them to take action on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">Health care is in a state of chaos. The health status of the population leaves much to be desired. We have the highest rate of death from heart disease and one of the highest mortality rates from cancer in the European Union. We have the lowest life expectancy at the age of 65 in the EU. There is growing evidence of a huge discrepancy in health status across the income scale, with those on low incomes suffering most.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">As Senator White acknowledged, we have a two-tier system. Elderly patients in many hospitals are waiting several months for heart operations they could have overnight if they had €15,000. Operating theatres and hospital beds have been closed in several health board regions due to funding shortages. As a member of the Midland Health Board, I speak from experience. Although we reluctantly adopted a service plan, the board still faces a major funding shortfall.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">A number of elderly people in my area have been placed in institutions some 50 miles from their homes because accommodation is not available in local nursing homes. We are in a sad and sorry state when elderly people are forced to live far from their families, relatives and neighbours in the twilight of their lives. I have visited some of them and have a list the length of my arm with names of people trying to return to my native County Longford from other counties. I contacted the Midland Health Board just today asking that it do something to facilitate these people. Is it a caring society which forces elderly people to move out of their locality into environments to which they are not used? This is killing off some of our elderly people.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_803">I again ask the Senator to have manners. We have chaos in our casualty departments as patients in serious distress are left lying on trolleys and in corridors. This is the position in hospitals in the Midland Health Board region and other health board regions. As local politicians working on the ground, we are aware of this because representations are made to us day and night.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">I have heard of patients, who have been taken into casualty units at 4 p.m. and are still lying on trolleys in corridors two days later because there are no beds available. The Midland Health Board allocated a complement of 12 beds to the Longford-Westmeath Hospital in Mullingar, but the Minister and his Department failed to provide the staff needed to operate them. These beds would provide treatment facilities for the people of the Midland Health Board region. It is scandalous.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">People are appalled by the way they are being treated. VHI premiums have been increased by 18% since the Government was re-elected. I know several people who are due to have hip replacements, yet cannot be accommodated. Having to wait longer is having a serious knock-on effect on their health. They should be looked after. We could all find ourselves in a similar position at some stage in our lives. It is important we care for our sick and elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Since returning to office, the Minister has increased charges for patients attending accident and emergemcy units without a doctor's letter and raised the thresholds for the drug refund scheme. Why, when the number of care staff in most of our health boards runs into hundreds, do the administrative staffs number thousands? Our health boards have chief executive officers, deputy chief executive officers, assistant chief executive officers, administrators of one kind of another, Irish officers, yet they cannot administer community services and initiatives because of shortfalls in certain areas. I plead with the Minister to look after the sick and elderly in society and take action to ensure our current problems do not deteriorate further.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The people are justifiably angry. They were lied to in the run-up to the general election when several Ministers denied that health cuts were being planned. What has happened since? The health service has been eroded left, right and centre. We, on this side of the House, will no longer tolerate it. I can guarantee the Minister that when the Fine Gael Party is returned to office, it will reinstate a proper health service that is the envy of Europe.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_351">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_808">I am pleased to have the opportunity to put in context the investment and reform programme the Government has been promoting since the launch of the national health strategy in November 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">It is a matter of record that there have been significant increases in public investment in the health services in recent years. In 2003 the Government is investing €8.9 billion of current and capital expenditure, representing an overall increase of 154% since 1997. As a percentage of GNP, gross non-capital health expenditure now stands at 7.45%. The more than doubling of investment in health spending over the period 1997 to 2003 marks a significant achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The range of services provided within the health system is almost unique by international standards, covering everything from health promotion, disease prevention to acute hospital treatment and a wide spectrum of personal, social and community services. One of the problems in showing effectiveness and outcomes of investment in the health area at the macro-population level is the time-lag between the investment and the measurable effect in terms of life expectancy and/or premature mortality. However, there are improvements to be pointed to in the system and it would be remiss of me, and unfair to our highly skilled and committed workforce, not to illustrate some of these achievements.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">The overall aim of the health strategy is to improve the health status of the nation. That means helping people achieve their full health potential. This may mean medical interventions aimed at cure or the putting in place of supports to improve individuals' health, personal well-being or quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Immunisation is an area where effectiveness is relatively easy to measure and the outcome can be seen in a matter of a few years or even less. Recent successes have included the introduction of the haemophilus influenza type B vaccine in 1992, given its role as a significant cause of meningitis. Since the introduction of this vaccine, the incidence of this condition has reduced tenfold and is close to the point of eradication. An immunisation campaign against group C meningococcal disease was launched in October 2000. The aim of the campaign was to immunise all children and young people up to 22 years of age against the disease. The result has been impressive. In 2002, 14 cases of group C meningitis were reported, compared with 139 cases over the same period in 2000. This represents a 90% reduction overall. However, this success did not come cheaply. The costs of the group C meningitis programmes were in the order of €80 million for initial start-up and €10 million ongoing revenue funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">This clear and quickly obvious link between intervention and outcome is the exception rather than the rule. There are areas where the full health impact of investment is less easy to measure. However, it is important to understand the impact of investment and the capacity of the delivery system before we begin to talk about system efficacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">A particular feature of policy development over recent years has been the development of highly focused disease or condition specific action programmes. Leading examples include the cancer and cardiovascular strategies, addressing the two main premature killers.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">Since 1997 there has been a cumulative investment of €400 million in the development of cancer services, well in excess of the £25 million initially envisaged in 1996 to implement the national cancer strategy. This funding includes an additional €29 million allocated in 2003 for cancer services this year. That investment will ensure that this year we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in areas such as oncology/haematology services, oncology drugs and symptomatic breast disease services. This substantial investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts, together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">There has also been investment in the development of symptomatic breast disease services. A total of €30 million has been invested in these services alone since 2001. The benefit is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred, with in-patient breast cancer procedures increasing from 1,336 in 1997 to 1,829 in 2001, an increase of 37% nationally. We can also show dramatic increases in chemotherapy and radiotherapy services throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The increase in activity levels has been quite dramatic in all these fields over the past few years and one has to ask how we were treating cancer before this level of investment. The bottom line is that previously we were not treating cancer adequately – and that is not to say we do not have more to do. Obviously increased investment is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">We have introduced a national breast cancer screening programme, BreastCheck, on a phased basis and have achieved an uptake of over 70%, which exceeds international standards in programmes of this kind. We are also putting symptomatic breast cancer clinics of excellence in place with attention to geographic spread.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">We anticipate that the reports of the National Cancer Registry Board will enable us to show, over time, the link between the type of treatment provided and outcomes in an Irish context. I hope to return to the House to debate the evaluation of that cancer strategy or the formulation of a new one. We will have an evaluation of what happened over the past five years. The critical issue is outcomes, survival rates and reduction of mortality.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Heart disease is the single biggest killer in Ireland. The implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy will have a significant impact on heart disease, an everyday reality for thousands of Irish people and their families. The Government has committed a cumulative €54 million towards its implementation since 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">This has supported a wide range of new regional services and initiatives and created almost 800 new posts, four out of five of which are professional staff. The process of appointing 17 of 25 new consultant cardiologists is also under way. This will bring the total number of consultant cardiologists up from 29 to 46. The range of services being sponsored from within this funding is broad, including health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, hospital care, cardiac rehabilitation as well as information systems, audit and evaluation.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">There have also been substantial improvements in acute services. Of the 3,000 beds committed to in the strategy, 520 were funded in 2002 and the remaining beds will be brought into use shortly. Based on provisional figures provided to my Department by health agencies, for the first 11 months of 2002 there was an average of 12,219 acute hospital in-patient beds available. Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting times for public patients in 2002. The total number of children waiting for more than six months for in-patient treatment has fallen by 24% between June and September 2002. On the points made by Senator Feighan about cardiac surgery for children, we have made dramatic progress by sending children abroad, with the agreement of the consultant in Crumlin hospital, to Johns Hopkins Hospital in the United States and to England. That has resulted in a dramatic erosion of the waiting list, particularly for children awaiting cardiac surgery, while we are building up capacity in Crumlin in terms of the additional operating theatres.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The total number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialties covered by the waiting list initiative has fallen by 15% between June and September 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">The hospital system has continued to improve its productivity. A total of 968,000 people were treated last year as either in-patients or day patients in acute hospitals. That is an increase of 5% over the 2001 figure, which was an increase of 6% on the 2000 figure. Since 1997, the number of patients treated in our acute hospitals has increased by 23%. An internationally accepted measure of acute hospital efficiency is the proportion of day cases and the picture in that regard is impressive. In 2002, day cases were up 14% over 2001. Since 1997, day cases carried out in Irish hospitals have increased by 44%. Some of our Dublin teaching hospitals have passed the 50% mark and are now treating more patients in a day case setting than as in-patients. In this regard we are up with best international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, the dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment. Funding of €43.8 million has been provided in 2003 for the waiting list initiative and a further €30.75 million has been provided for the national treatment purchase fund. To date, approximately 2,300 long waiters have received treatment under the national treatment purchase fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">In 2002, a primary care task force and steering group were established to drive implementation of the model. In 2002, the task force selected ten locations throughout the country for the putting in place of implementation projects in line with the primary care model. The projects will enable the new model of a multi-disciplinary based primary care team to be demonstrated in action and refined as necessary. Funding totalling €8.4 million is being provided for the projects in 2002 and 2003. As the ten projects are developed, more than 80,000 people will benefit from having direct access to an improved range of services provided by their primary care team.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">To complement the primary care model, it was envisaged that in the short term, general practice co-operatives would be established on a national basis so that effective out of hours services would be available in all parts of the country. The funding provided for out of hours co-operatives in 2002 totalled €17 million. Each health board region now has GP co-operatives in place and these are being progressively extended board-wide. Negotiations are ongoing on further expansion this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">There has also been substantial investment in continuing care services since 1997. For older people this has meant enhancement of nursing home subvention schemes, the provision of additional home helps, improving community-based services and services provided in community hospitals and day care centres, additional respite care and support for carers. For people with intellectual disabilities and autism, service developments provided for included, in 2002 alone, over 100 new residential places, 75 new respite places, 600 new day places and the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements. For people with physical disabilities, in 2002 alone investment was provided for the enhancement of home support services, therapy services, up to 100 additional posts as recommended in the sector's service audit, 500 rehabilitative training places and 15 guidance-assessment staff in the health boards in the area of rehabilitative training.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">We all know that there are benefits to be gained from investment in the health service in terms of overall economic development. However, assurances that money is being spent effectively and efficiently are crucial. The strategy recognises that further spending can only come in the context of improved efficiency and that investment decisions have to be based on sound information and evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">The introduction of the service planning framework has provided an opportunity to enhance the way in which health services are planned in terms of addressing changing needs and ensuring the best possible quality of care is provided for the resources available. This is a major advance in the health system, linked as it is to statutory accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">Last year saw a set of performance indicators conjointly agreed between the health boards and the Department being put in place to enable better performance and accountability in the delivery of health board service plans. These indicators will be built on in moving towards a stronger focus on performance at all levels in the health system. A high level steering group and project team made up of representatives from the Department of Health and Children and the health boards were recently established to further develop and enhance service planning and performance measurement in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">This framework provides a foundation for further reform but it needs to be enhanced. In isolation it cannot achieve the order of reform necessary to really improve overall system functioning. Much more needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">One of the issues which came to the fore during the consultation process on the health strategy was the complex structure of decision-making, roles and responsibilities within the health system – many involved in the national consultation process which led to the strategy commented on this. Other issues included the many layers and intersecting roles, and the lack of consistency in the development of systems and the application of schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">It has to be acknowledged that the present structures in the health system evolved from a model developed over 30 years ago. During that time the size, range of functions and complexity of managing the system have all grown dramatically. There have been significant enhancements to the original health board model through the Health Acts 1996 and 1999 as well as considerable changes to the internal structures of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. A number of new advisory and executive bodies have also been established in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">One of the main conclusions in the strategy was that while the system had served us well in many respects, some significant concerns remained. These include the need for stronger co-ordination and integration of functions and services; greater consistency in access to and delivery of services; and greater clarity around levels of decision-making in the full range of organisations, particularly, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the role of the Department and the requirement for “whole system” effectiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">A number of strands of reform are being formulated in respect of the health system – first, the undertaking of an audit of structures and functions in the health system, to which there is a commitment in the health strategy. The audit will also deal with the commitments in the strategy in relation to the establishment of a national hospitals authority and a health information and quality authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">A second strand of analysis relates to the work of the national task force on medical staffing. This review is concerned with preparing a plan for the medical staffing of acute hospitals based on the recommendations of the report of the medical manpower forum in 2001 and the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors in 2001. Part of its work is concerned with examining the practical implications of moving to a consultant-delivered hospital system that would dramatically change and improve the quality of service to patients. This is likely to include reference to the future configuration of hospital services – in other words, deciding which hospitals will provide what services in a consultant-provided context.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">A third strand of reform to be drawn together with these two is the work of the commission on financial management and control systems in the health system being undertaken on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who established the commission, on which the Department of Health and Children is represented.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">I will elaborate on the work in relation to the audit which is now at an advanced stage. Action 114 of the strategy was intended to support organisational development in helping to clarify roles and co-ordinate the work of different organisations. Specifically, the audit was commissioned in order to ensure clear lines of accountability and communication between each part of the system; no overlap or duplication between organisations; and a proper alignment of the structure as a whole to the vision and objectives outlined in the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The outcomes sought are to ensure the structures in the system are the most appropriate and responsive to meet current and future service needs; constitute an adequate framework for overall governance of the health system; achieve an effective integration of services across all parts of the system; adequately represent the views of consumers in the planning and delivery of services; and focus on the principles of equity, accountability, quality and people-centredness and the national goals of the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">My Department commissioned Prospectus Strategy Consultants in June 2002 to undertake the audit. The preliminary response of the consultants was to identify the need for the consolidation of structures within the health system. It is important to acknowledge that the findings and recommendations of the consultants must be considered in the context of the considerable achievements of the system I have just outlined. These achievements are an indication of the commitment at individual, professional and corporate level within the system. It is important to be clear that the findings relate to systemic problems and in no way reflect the considerable expertise, skill and dedication of the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">In summary, the consultants found a number of barriers to achieving the improvements sought in the strategy. They also identified the need for strengthened frameworks for governance and accountability as well as the need to develop and enhance supporting processes to secure improved planning, integration, delivery and evaluation of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">While a final draft of the report is pending, it is already clear that the need to significantly reform the existing delivery structure will be put forward as a major proposal. This will include the development of a unitary delivery system involving considerable consolidation of existing agencies; the configuration of services into two broad pillars, one centred on acute service delivery and the other on primary, continuing and community care; and the development of large-scale shared services. This unitary system is being advanced as the most appropriate way to support the individual strengthening of each pillar within the system, while at the same time providing for a more structured approach to integration processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">The proposals also include the development of an improved system of governance and accountability which clarifies and creates appropriate boundaries between the delivery system and the Department of Health and Children. This is intended to allow the Department to focus more actively on its role in policy development, population health planning and the monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the delivery system on health status. The proposals emerging will support the commitments made in relation to reform of acute hospital services and the likely changes required, in terms of configuration, anticipated in the health strategy. They will provide a more adequate unitary approach to the delivery of hospital services which, in turn, will support the more even and consistent introduction of consultant-delivered services.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">It would also be imprudent to suggest that the gains from changes in system structures and function changes can be achieved without continuing investment in the health system. There are several reasons for this, the principal one being that healthcare is expensive. We need only look at the increased frequency and volume of MRIs in recent years as a classic illustration of technological advances in healthcare There are also an ageing population and higher levels of public knowledge and expectations, combined with pay and non-pay inflation, which make it expensive just to stand still. From a cost viewpoint, there is a cruel paradox in the fact that the more successful the outcome, the more expensive it gets. When we appoint an oncologist, the service will improve and the treatments increase, as will the expenditure. That is what is happening in many of our acute hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Important factors to be considered include demographic projections for Ireland which suggest that by 2011 the population aged 65 years and over will have almost doubled to an estimated 767,300 and constitute 16.4% of the population. This is a factor of major significance in planning for the provision of acute hospital services.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Demand for health care is increasing as a result of better education, increased expectations, economic prosperity and technological advances in health care permitting earlier and improved diagnosis and treatment. Many successful medical interventions are now made in middle years, yielding longer life expectancy but also, typically, dealing with the onset of further illness later in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">The need for continued investment relates to the current deficits in the system which must be improved to achieve the changes we seek. Hundreds of millions of euro have been invested in developing infrastructure under the national development programme –€2 billion has been committed between now and 2006. Notwithstanding the significant funding of capital projects in recent years, there is still significant investment required to upgrade facilities such as the Central Mental Hospital, Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin, radiotherapy services and a variety of other facilities, especially those providing care for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The full development of information and communication technology capability is identified as a prerequisite to improving monitoring and evaluation of services, improved health impact assessment, and, in turn, better value for money. Report after report has identified this as a major system deficiency. There is a need for up-front support of structural reform of the nature being contemplated. A national reform programme will result from the current proposals and that will also require investment. We must continue to invest in the system if we are to keep pace with the changes and at the same time deliver the potential yield from the radical restructuring of the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The Government is committed to taking early and decisive action on reform of management structures and financial accountability. The first stage is the finalisation of the two key reports, the audit of structures and functions and the report of the commission. The Minister for Finance and I will be submitting the reports to Government for decision in an integrated manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">I am confident that there are gains to be made from a radical restructuring of the system in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and value for money. The proposals now being advanced, however, are a considerable challenge to everyone in the system. I will not understate the enormity of the task ahead. There are no quick fixes for the change we envisage undertaking in the coming years. In addition, I must reiterate that the potential of the system can only be realised if we continue to invest as we reform.</p>

        <speech by="#KateWalsh" eId="spk_352">
          <from>Ms K. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_852">I am honoured to be here for the Minister's address. I add my voice to that of Senator Minihan.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">By allocating just over €9 billion to health this year alone, the Government must now institute change in the State's health services. We have established that the problems besetting our system are not financial but managerial and administrative. As we examine ways in which the health system can be reformed and improved, we must remember that at all times the patient is our first consideration. The greatest help to any health service is the level of care administered to patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">We are spending €9 billion of taxpayers' money on health this year. We owe it to the public to make sure we are spending it effectively. The public, the patients and their friends and relatives pay for the system and deserve the best we can offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">One reason why the current health care system is failing patients is that it is not fully utilising the skills and services of the professionals employed. Employment in the health services increased in recent years and currently stands at over 100,000 – a dedicated team of nursing, medical and administrative staff. These people are caring, committed and dedicated professionals who are highly skilled. They work in our hospitals and provide GP services, work as midwives and community care nurses. They are extremely hardworking but the health service as currently organised does not make full use them.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">It is important to stress that any reform of the health service is not intended to undermine front-line staff. We want to give them the best possible opportunity to make a real difference in patients' lives. The health service cannot be sustained if we leave them as they are. If we are to get real value for money, use people's skills to the maximum and deliver patient-centred care, the Government must take immediate steps to reform the health service.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_857">I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the fine job he is doing. Without a shadow of a doubt, he has the toughest job in the political spectrum and faces demands on a daily basis. He is man with the commitment, drive and ability to deliver in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">I welcome the motion put down by our colleagues in the Progressive Democrats. It would not have stood up six years ago because the system did not have the resources for reform. That we can now talk about reforming services, management structures and financial accountability and follow the €9 billion put into the system is a reflection of the achievements of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">I am glad to see that the Opposition, in the amendment, has acknowledged that major resources are being put into the system. Heretofore Opposition Members would have given the credit to the global economy. That is the general thrust of the argument in the good times. In bad times, credit falls back to the Government. That is par for the course but some consistency in these debates would be welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">The motion reflects on the €9 billion the Minister has put into the system. It is the largest investment ever in health, an increase of 134% on the 1997 figure, and represents 7.7% of GNP. In any terms, that is a huge contribution. The health services have benefited in the past four years from sustained increases in funding. There are more staff than ever – numbers have increased to over 90,000 from 68,000. There are those who argue that these extra staff work in the administrative field with too few at the coal face but if resources are put into the front-line services, back up is required to administer them.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Within a framework of reform, we must get the balance right between the administrative set up and medical service provision. When looking at the cost factor, one must remember that we cannot look at it like a business. We cannot get rid of people from the personnel department because it is top heavy. If one consultant does 1,000 hip replacements in Cappagh at a cost of €20,000 and his counterpart performs 1,000 at a cost of €30,000 in the Mater Hospital, the consensus might be to go with the consultant charging €20,000 per thousand, but that might not be good value for money. The more expensive consultant might be dealing with patients in their 90s who have a much higher cost factor in after-care. He may use a better product in the hip replacement procedures he carries out. He may be a better consultant or a better surgeon, putting greater thought and effort into the job. In a medical context, the fact that he is doing so at a less expensive rate is not necessarily the issue. In considering cost factors and cost-cutting measures, we need to be careful how we proceed. We must not always seek the cheapest option.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">The total number of people treated in acute hospitals increased by 6% last year. That represents an increase of 48,500 patients in one year, which is massive by any standards. The threefold increase in funding during the past six years, substantially brought about by the current Minister, has made additional demands on resources. A total of €43.8 million will be provided in 2003 towards shortening waiting lists and reducing waiting times. Senator White referred to the fact that she had the privilege of being able to have an MRI scan when she saw fit because she could pay for it. The Minister has gone some way towards dealing with that issue through the treatment purchase scheme by bringing closer to people on public waiting lists the ability to have their operations much earlier than would otherwise have been possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">A recent television programme showed a prime example of that scheme in operation, with the television cameras following a patient from Beaumont Hospital to England and back and showing the excellent treatment he received. In a subsequent interview, that patient was totally satisfied and described his experience of the scheme as being "as good as it gets". The Minister is to be congratulated on that scheme and not bombarded with criticism.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Between 1998 and 2001, the number of nurses and midwives increased by 6,000. The health strategy provided for an extra 10,000 to be trained during its lifetime, which was another massive undertaking. In addition, there has been a 59% increase in cancer treatments. That is the single most effective tool which has been put in place. Chemotherapy has increased by 86% in overall terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">On services for people with disabilities, an area which is dear to my heart, the Minister has made a massive commitment. I acknowledge that we are seeking more money from him, but what other sector is not doing likewise? We make our submissions on the basis of sustainable arguments and, on that basis, I hope additional funds will be forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">If I have any criticism, it would not be directed at the Minister but rather at the system and would relate, in particular, to the reform of the health boards in 1996. I never agreed with those changes. In my opinion history will judge them the result of a poor decision, which led to the creation of a further layer of bureaucracy and made it more difficult for people to get what they need. The changes were unfair to those who were obliged to deal with the new system after their introduction because these individuals were not trained and did not understand the financing of acute hospitals or voluntary agencies. Being left at the coalface without the required understanding, they were unable to grasp our approach in terms of financial requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I will conclude by providing an example. Let us consider a situation where the total payroll in 2001 was €10 million and where standard incremental and national pay increases were awarded on foot of Government decisions. The payroll increased from €10 million to €11 million as a result, but when the additional €1 million was sought from the authorities, an allocation of only €10.5 million was forthcoming. From where would the remaining €500,000 come? That is a crazy situation. It may be that people's focus in the early stages was incorrect, that money was spent in the wrong areas and that difficulties arose as a consequence. That is where system failed and I look forward to the changes the Minister will introduce in order to reform it.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">I welcome the Progressive Democrats' motion and I compliment that party on bringing it forward.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_354">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_869">I thank the Minister, Deputy Martin, who spent considerable time in the House earlier today dealing with legislation and has remained here for virtually the entire debate. I acknowledge that as a measure of his commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The Minister recognised that some significant concerns remain. Listening to what the Opposition had to say, one would get the impression that it is entirely wrong to suggest that certain things should be done in the future. If the Government was to accept the Opposition's approach, which would involve living in some form of time capsule, nothing would be done. A common feature of this debate and of a recent debate on agriculture in Fine Gael Private Members' time is the complete absence – during four hours of discussion – of a single concrete proposal regarding what should be done. We heard a lot of thunder, which may sound impressive from a distance but is of no practical value.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The Government is not immune to accepting good proposals from any quarter, as has been demonstrated over a considerable period. The situation has to be viewed in context. It is entirely appropriate for Members on this side of the House, as occurs frequently in the course of debates on this and other subjects, to put forward proposals for future implementation. I acknowledge that the Minister took the substance of the motion totally on board when he stated in that the Government is committed to taking early and decisive action on the reform of management structures and financial accountability. I am pleased that he has fully accepted the thrust and sentiments of the motion. He said he is confident that there are gains to be made from a radical restructuring of the system in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and value for money. We could not have expected more than that in response to the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The national health strategy, which I believe was one of the most innovative and radical documents in the health sector for many years, has been delivered on. The Minister has enumerated the events which have taken place with regard to the adoption of the strategy as well as outlining the matters which remain to be implemented. The Progressive Democrats are pleased that the treatment purchase fund has kicked in and is having a positive effect. The Minister referred to GP co-ops, which have been highly successful. It is clear that progress has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">This debate is not about the quality of staff in the system or the quality of care which the system provides for people who are ill. I totally reject the statement made earlier that Ireland has the worst health service in Europe. I suggest we have one of the best health services in the world in terms of treatment of people who are ill and in need of urgent attention. We still have people in the health service who provide a high quality of care and commitment and who, accordingly, should be encouraged. The system within which they have to work is a different issue. That system is obviously unsatisfactory and must be improved, as is the Government's intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">It is relevant to ask if all stakeholders in this system are willing to participate fully in its reform, in bringing it forward and making sure it delivers. The point was well made by Senator Kate Walsh and others that the focus must be on the patient. If consultants, management and politicians focus on the patient, everything else will fall into place. Senator Minihan quite rightly spoke of the focus being on administration rather than on real management. We have to move beyond that situation in terms of what the patient requires.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Politicians in this House have been just as territorial about this debate as are consultants, administrators, etc., about their areas of expertise. We have managed to see the mote in every eye except our own. Members have repeatedly spoken of the lack of one health facility or another in their respective areas. The focus always came down to a Member's area. That is very clearly indicative of the deficiency in the health board system. We cannot close a hospital or have rationalisation within the system because there are too many vested interests working to ensure that this will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The Minister went directly to the core of the issue when referring to technology, which is now at a state of development and cost which precludes delivery at every local centre throughout the country. That is impossible in relation to MRI scans, to which particular reference was made. There are more cars in this country than ever before and the people are more mobile than ever. We cannot locate some of these facilities in every area. Would it not be better to buy four helicopters and close down a few hospitals? Would that not be better in terms of delivering the leading edge technology required to ensure that people who are under grave threat can be protected?</p>
          <p eId="para_877">I heard a very courageous statement by Professor Bonner of the Institute of Obstetricians of Ireland the morning after a particularly bad tragedy was being used to make nakedly political points. He had the courage, in the teeth of the difficulty, to state that we have to accept that some of these services can only be delivered at national level or at regional level, that they cannot be delivered at local level. That is the measure of the cost of technology that we are dealing with.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">Senator Browne was right about this. To be fair to him, he was the one person who said we cannot have one in every town. That is not to say that there should not be post-operative care and that people should not be able to go back to their communities when they are recuperating. That is a different matter. When it comes to acute care and leading edge technology, we must accept that it will have to be delivered in a few specialised centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">I have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister in his attempts to deal with this complex and difficult situation and in his difficulties in dealing with the stakeholders, but I do not have any reservations about his commitment or his capacity to do it or about the fact that he will do it. When Senator Feighan asks why is there no senior orthodontist in Roscommon, I ask if it is required that there should be a senior orthodontist in Roscommon.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_881">Several Senators began by stating they were members of a health board and then went on to defend the system. I am not saying that there have not been good people or that the politicians do not do their very best for the people in their area. They do, but the local interests are dominant. Unless it is treated on a national basis or on a regional basis, I cannot see where the advances will come.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">There are very dedicated people working in this service. I suppose those of us who are old enough regret the fact that they probably do not have that vocational aspect which was so evident 20 or 30 years ago, but we must accept that those days are gone. There are still people who are of that nature. Perhaps there are fewer or perhaps it is a measure of our age that we think there are fewer, but it is that type of dedication which will really solve the problem at the end of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">It is appalling that the cynical use of a personal tragedy should be used for nakedly political reasons and that people should be manipulated when they are in the throes of the most appalling personal problems to make political points. That has been done, not once but several times. We must act on the reports. We must accept that in some circumstances public representatives have acted in the same self-serving way as some others who are within the system. There is the question of the influence of personal liability insurance, but that is a debate for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">I would make one final appeal, which perhaps is more appropriately directed at the Minister for Health and Children than to the Minister of State, Deputy Callely. If there is one thing I would like to see done in this coming year, it is something concrete for people with intellectual disability. I and the people in that sector accept that an immense amount has been done, but it is the European Year of People with Disabilities and the Special Olympics will be held here, and there must be money for emergency services in that area.</p>

I reiterate the comments of Senator Dardis in thanking the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, for staying so long this evening and for giving such a great outline of his activities in the Department. No company, industry or sector in this society could grow at the level at which this Department has been growing – when one looks at the figures mentioned here of the money which has been pumped into the sector and the numbers employed in it over the past five years – without asking if it needs reform. The system is working on a basis set up in the 1970s. We do need to reform it.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">I am grateful to the Minister. He addresses our motion quite clearly by saying that he is setting up an audit of the structures, the medical staffing and the financial accountability.

I can guarantee that he will have our support in reforming and in continuing to invest in this Department.</p>

This is from the left philosophy – a proven failure. He did not try to say that we should adopt the Romanian or former Soviet Union policy of health. What we heard from the Labour Party was blatant Finlayism.

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_381">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_918">I expressed surprise earlier that the self-professed parties of reform such as Fine Gael and the Labour Party were opposed to the ending of the dual mandate. I am afraid that on this occasion they are what the Labour Party is pleased to call "the conservative parties".</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I do not wish to conduct a seminar on the political philosophy of Garret Fitzgerald, but his excellent book <i>Reflections on the Irish State</i> deals with issues like the dual mandate. Dr. Fitzgerald considers that the combination of the electoral system and the fact that the vast majority of Deputies are also members of councils creates many problems. His primary concern is the knock-on effect for Ministers, up to and including the Taoiseach, who have to spend more time on constituency work than most of their European counterparts. That is not to say that a certain amount of this work is not positively healthy, but it is a question of proportion and balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">One often hears the adage, "all politics is local", which was thrown at me on a recent local radio programme by a Fine Gael Senator. It is true in the sense that all politics has a local impact, but it is also a bit glib. If all politics really is local, what are we doing in this House and what are our colleagues doing in the Dáil? If we followed that rationale, we would be better off on county and town councils rather than bothering with Leinster House. In this regard, we sell ourselves a bit short because, if we are dealing with all the local politics – and this applies more to rural Deputies and Senators than their urban colleagues – who is dealing with the national or international issues? I am not just referring to Iraq and the Convention on the Future of Europe, but to budgetary matters such as tax and social welfare which affect everybody. Is it not legitimate that voices be heard from every part of the country on the issues common throughout the country rather than just those relevant to particular constituencies?</p>
          <p eId="para_921">One can have legitimate arguments about elected mayors. This system clearly works well in some countries, like, for example, France where mayors have considerable prestige. One must take account of the political culture in every country. There is an egalitarian ethos among councillors in this country, much like that of the Presbyterian Church which does not want elected archbishops but rather a Moderator who changes each year. Being chairman of a local authority or Lord Mayor of Dublin or Cork is a fairly demanding job and there are benefits in giving people a term. The system works quite well and is popular. I do not know that there is any public complaint about the existing system. While I accept it is a matter for debate, the right decision has been taken on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">The clauses in the Bill relating to access of Oireachtas Members to local authorities are vague. I hope there will be a more concrete recognition of the <i>locus standi</i> of Deputies and Senators regarding making representations and receiving information and assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">My memory of local elections goes back to 1985 when Fergus O'Brien was Minister for Local Government. A reform package is always brought forward just in time for the local elections in an attempt to motivate people, yet when one looks back, one wonders if much has changed. I would like to see more devolution and decentralisation. I do not mean establishing an office down the country to administer something for the whole country; rather, more decision-making powers should be given to local authorities, where appropriate. I have never been convinced of the efficiency of toing and froing to Dublin and the number of bureaucrats involved in matters to do with housing and schools. Central government holds too tight a rein on power.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">It is important that where local authorities have powers, they do not abuse them. There may be an explanation for this but I am concerned about the events in Loughrea as reported in today's newspapers. It would be very wrong if land was rezoned simply to get more money from the NRA where money is already short enough. Perhaps that is not the proper explanation but clarification is required.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_925">I second the amendment proposed by Senator Bannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">I believe the Minister is personally committed to local government reform and hope we get the chance to debate a substantial reform measure some time during his tenure. He does not pretend this deals with local government reform, rather it is a mechanism to bring an end to the dual mandate. I would like to see a more substantive package.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">My comments on the dual mandate are in the record of the other House. For many years I have believed that if we want to take politics seriously and have strong local government, we must accept that one man or woman cannot properly do two jobs. The work of a local councillor is now a full-time job. I welcome the indication from the Minister that he is considering introducing a proper salary for local representatives. The sooner that happens the better but there is enough work to be done at local authority level to make it a five day week job.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">There have been numerous debates on local government reform during my years in the Oireachtas in which we have heard the finest political platitudes. It is with regret that I say there has never been a meaningful attempt by any Government over the past 15 to 20 years to promote local government reform, the promotion of which would mean that the Oireachtas would have to transfer some of its power to locally elected representatives. When one examines the various committees which work in tandem with local authorities such as county and city enterprise boards, partnerships and area development groups etc., there is a huge amount of work that could be more effectively done at that level if a more hands-on approach was adopted by local councillors. This cannot be done at this time because it would be asking part-time politicians to do full-time jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">I would like to see a system of politics that would allow people to feel politically fulfilled by serving at local government level. If we are to be honest, most of those involved in local government aspire to serve in the national Parliament and see local government as a step on the career ladder – it should not be this way. Our system of local government should be strong enough that a career in it should be as laudable as it is in many European countries. The tough and painful political decisions must be taken centrally if we want to make this happen. We could talk until the cows come home about our electoral system but that is for another day. It is part of the problem that must be addressed if we are to have a form of national politics that will mean national debate and national decision-making.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Some of my colleagues have addressed their concerns about the constitutionality or otherwise of the ban on the dual mandate. While that will, presumably, be tested, I would be grossly hypocritical if I said anything other than the time has come for us to decide we can only do one job and realise that we are not super-politicians. I look forward to progress in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">I fully support the Fine Gael amendment. We need to grasp the nettle and take on board the wider issue of making local government real, meaningful and strong. There are hundreds of people in communities who would love to play a role in local government but there is no meaningful role for them. Local government has virtually no power. The majority of time at local authority estimates meetings is spent debating the final few thousand euro. How different this is from the estimates debates which took place in local authorities during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s when local councils had genuine power. We have gone backwards rather than forward where local government reform is concerned. If local government is to matter, it must be given additional powers and responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">In recent weeks the Minister spoke about the possibility of giving councils the power to consider local taxation. There are councillors in all parties who object to everything and they jumped on the usual bandwagon. However, if they are to demand extra powers, they must be willing to take on extra responsibilities. In recent weeks when the Seanad discussed waste management, the Minister pointed out – I cannot disagree – that in some areas councillors were simply unwilling to take hard decisions. That problem needs to be addressed. It is not a problem in my local authority where we have taken hard decisions on waste management.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">I look forward to the day that the work and worth of the councillor are such that he or she will be working almost full-time in local and community politics. When that day arrives, it will inevitably mean that he or she cannot be an active member of Cork County Council and simultaneously a Member of the Oireachtas. It will not be possible to do the two jobs properly. That will require courageous leadership in the Oireachtas. It will demand of politicians at national level the courage to transfer power, responsibility and decision making to local authorities. All Members demand decentralisation. Therefore, let us now practise political decentralisation and make local government real and strong, as it was to some degree in the earlier part of the last century. Local health services were run by the local councillors no less effectively than they are run by the health boards today. Look at the success of the vocational education committees which are sustained by local government. This shows what can be done if we have the political initiative to let it happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">We are missing a great opportunity to drive local government forward. The local elections will be held in 18 months and, unless we can make local government real, there will be a disappointing response from the public. Local elections are due to held in parts of Britain. I understand local elections are not held throughout the country on the same day but in different parts on different dates. Present indications are that turnout will be approximately 20%. That is a shocking indication of what happens when local government appears to be irrelevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">I urge the Minister to look at the broader picture that needs to be addressed. There is a willingness among the public to respond if we are prepared to give leadership.</p>

        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_936">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. What others discuss, this Minister does. This is a rare opportunity for Members of the Oireachtas to address, once and for all, the separation of local and national government. I have been involved in local politics for 24 years and heard <i>ad nauseam</i> about the need to establish local government in its own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">As president of the AMAI, I headed an all-party committee which drew up a report on the reform of local government. One of the recommendations was recognition of local government in the Constitution. The objective was to give a realistic basis to the concept and existence of local government. That was done. Many on all sides of the political spectrum bemoan the fact that local government powers have been lost. Why are they lost? The reason is that when local elected representatives have powers, they do not have the bottle to use them. They take decisions about taking no decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">Responsibility comes with power. If people want power, they will need to have the power to raise money and the authority to spend it. That is power. In 1988, when I had the honour of being chairman of Westmeath County Council, it introduced a system of paid parking to bring much needed money into the coffers of the local authority, to implement certain traffic calming and regulatory measures and to turn over car parking spaces in the town. However, the minute the heat came on, people jumped ship. That is what has us in the current position.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">This Bill is an opportunity. I appreciate that people on all sides of the political spectrum will be concerned about their positions as local authority members who hold the dual mandate. While I do not share that view, I respect those who hold it. Since the arrival of better local government, SPCs, area committees, county development committees, county development boards, strategic policy and so forth, membership of a county council and county borough council has become a full-time job. There was a clear recognition by the previous Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that this had to be addressed in some fashion. Hence the introduction of the representational allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">I remember when the allowance was announced. The Minister said it was in recognition of the work of local representatives. It was most welcome and a ground breaking decision. The current Minister, Deputy Cullen, has indicated that in the future there will be full-time local authority members. It is axiomatic that it will happen. It is happening already and if people are working full time, they must be looked after in the established manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">I wish to comment on our system of local government. Some time ago I was a member of a deputation to the European Union. One of the then Commissioners told us we had the most centralised system of local government in the Union. It is time colleagues on all sides of this House had the courage to draw a dividing line between local and national government. I accept that the delivery of services by a Member of the Oireachtas is pertinent to local authority matters. That is a fact of life. The Minister will have already heard in the course of this debate that there will have to be a definitive enshrinement, whether in legislation or regulations, of the rights of access by Members of the Oireachtas to local authorities. They must have rights in relation to documentation and all that goes with it. That is most important. It must also apply to health boards and vocational education committees. Members of the Oireachtas have an established national role which we must discharge. If the people who sent us here see this as our extended role, who are we to deny it?</p>
          <p eId="para_942">I am nominated for the Seanad by the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland. There are a number of municipal authorities which serve bigger populations than some of our county councils. They are not county borough councils; some are town councils. Will the Minister ensure that they are given a more relevant role than they have at present? Apart from the five borough councils, towns like Bray, with a population of 30,000, Tralee, Ennis, Mullingar, Athlone and others have a definitive role to play in local government, and this must be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">On local taxation and fundraising, there are people who, at the time for deciding on estimates for the year, oppose everything and are in favour of nothing. When the estimates committee meets and when decisions on statutory estimates are made, they will vote against everything. At all other local authority meetings, they table motions to spend hundreds of thousands of euro. These are the people who say to the Minister that he is removing their powers. I regret to say it, but they do not have the guts to pass a vote of sympathy not to mention vote through financial measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">On the issue of directly elected mayors and chairmen, I have been lobbied by members of the three representative associations – the Local Authority Members Association, which represents councillors, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and the General Council of County Councils, which represent the corporate bodies – and have not heard anyone advocating the concept of directly elected mayors. When the Minister announced his decision, I was surprised by the number of non-Fianna Fáil members to whom I circulated who were happy to receive it. As would be said in another forum, with that I rest my case on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">One is at a disadvantage at this stage in a debate because most of what one wants to say has already been said. Nothing is perfect and there probably will be teething difficulties with the legislation the Minister has brought before us. He will probably have to review certain aspects of the Bill and I do not doubt that he will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">We have an opportunity to give local government an opportunity to be an established entity in its own right. Let us think about the county councillors who elected 43 Senators to this House and who are discommoded on a weekly basis because they must hold meetings on days suitable to us, regardless of whether they are suitable to them. It is good enough for us, if we fail to be elected to the Dáil, to canvass them for their vote in order to gain election to the Upper House. However, it is not good enough for them to hold meetings on days that suit them. It is time we complimented our electorate – county and county borough councillors and the other local authority members who nominate some of us – because they are the people about whom I am concerned.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_384">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_947">I welcome the Minister. I hope he has warmed up after his trip to Strokestown on an extremely cold day last week. He saw at first hand and is aware of the commitment of councillors.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">I learned about the vagaries of politics a little over four years ago. I sometimes wonder if I will ever learn. I grew up in an urban area, in Boyle town, and saw how people were disenchanted with the political system. They did not care. Senator Bradford alluded to the fact that there is a lack of enthusiasm for politics in urban areas which fortunately does not exist in rural areas. I had no great interest in politics. I was an activist involved in the local football club and the chamber of commerce and I was interested in whatever I thought was positive for the area. When councillors or politicians canvassed for votes, I prayed for rain, although I could say that in more undiplomatic terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">Nonetheless, I went before my convention four years ago and became involved in what I now believe to be the only game in town, namely, politics and representing one's constituents. I was proud to have been elected to Roscommon County Council. I did not realise the importance of a county councillor and the difference he can make. He has the ear of the county manager, the respect of county council members and can do things for his area. As someone elected to Roscommon County Council in 1999, I am disappointed that I will not be able to stand for the council again. I am disappointed for the people who elected me to the council. I was subsequently elected to the Seanad and will not resign my seat to stand for the county council.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">The Bill is a disappointment and is not a part of real local government reform. Two years ago I praised the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, for introducing directly elected mayors. It is an insult to the electorate that his Bill abolishing the dual mandate and introducing directly elected mayors, which was not allowed to proceed because of political circumstances at the time, is being replaced by this Bill which does not allow for directly elected mayors. Of what is the current Minister afraid? There should be directly elected mayors in Dublin, Cork, the major towns and all county council areas. The Bill shies away from that. Directly elected mayors have been a huge success in London and other cities. The absence of a provision for them is one reason I am disappointed by the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">I pride myself on being a local politician because all politics is local. As a Senator, I may not have the same influence with the local town clerk, county manager, county engineer or director of service as I would have as a county councillor. Therefore, the people in my town who elected me to the county council may not receive the same service for which they elected me.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">It is difficult to find someone who would say that I cannot stand for public office. I do not want to raise the constitutional argument because this will stand or fall on its own merits. However, there are people, such as doctors and those who hold other occupations, who are able to stand for election to local authorities and county councils. It is because I am a Member of the Oireachtas that I will not be able to stand for the county council.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Value for money was referred to. I do not get paid a salary for my council work but that work accounts for 90% of what I do politically. While I do not want to be paid, I want to provide a voice for the people in my area. Considering those who are standing down, it will cost €1.4 million extra to fund the county councillors who will step into my place. It is not about money. While I have heard we will get compensation, I do not want it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_955">That remark is not necessary. The compensation figure being bandied about is €5,000. I have only been a member of Roscommon County Council for less than four years. Some have been members for 25 or 30 years. I do not want to get into the costs involved. It is not right to offer a derisory amount on a take it or leave it basis to anybody who has been in a job for that long.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">No doubt Government Deputies and Senators will vote for this and I may have to accept the Bill will be passed. While I acknowledge I will not be able to stand at the next council election, I appeal to the Minister to permit directly elected mayors because this would help democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">There is a cosy cartel. I am not casting aspersions or suggesting the councillors cannot do the job but they do not want Deputies and Senators coming down and giving them grief. Part of the Department has been instrumental in ensuring Deputies and Senators will not stand for office because once we are out of the way they will be able to do what they like. I have only been a councillor for four years but we will get rid of a wealth of experience when we eliminate the dual mandate. The Minister is doing a good job and is enthusiastic about what he does. If he must eliminate the dual mandate, I ask him to permit directly elected mayors.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_387">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_958">I welcome the Minister. This debate has been flogged to death and I thank the Minister for putting it to bed once and for all. It started in 1990 when Ministers and Ministers of State were prohibited from holding a dual mandate. In 1994 all Oireachtas Members were precluded from holding key positions in local authorities. There was a long discussion at the time to outline where we should go from there. The same debate took place during the discussion of the 2001 Bill when I said the time had come to end the dual mandate. I say that with some grief. While I said directly elected mayors should not be introduced, I had reached the stage where it was becoming physically impossible for me to do two jobs at the one time.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">As a grass roots person, I loved being a county councillor. I wanted to deal with the issues as they arose on the ground because all politics was local. That is where the core of politics is and it is very gratifying to do something for a person in one's area. I have chosen this road and I am now a Senator. I found it difficult to do the job I wanted to do because I was a professional. I wanted to be as much a professional as a county councillor as I was as a Senator. I had awful problems doing the two jobs and realised it was time to make a decision. While I did not like the decision, I realised I could not do the two jobs. The Minister has outlined this issue which has been reflected on all sides of the House. We have to make choices between the two hats and the implications are colossal.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">There is now a divide between the local and national interest. When speaking about one of the sections in the Bill, the Minister talked about us having access to information. This might mean access to the agenda but that means nothing. Some local authorities have access through the Internet. Any member of the public can get the ordinary information on the Internet but a member of the council has detailed access. The Minister must ensure access means availability to the same kind of information county councillors have. This must be spelled out. Some Deputies who are no longer councillors have told me they do not have real access. When they telephone to inquire about a planning reference, they are told whether it has been refused but do not get the reasons. A local authority member will get the details. When introducing the guidelines, the Minister must make sure access means getting the same information as county councillors have.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">I am sorry that I had to leave the council but that was my choice. I would have preferred to do the two jobs if that was possible. While I prefer to deal with the public, I also like my work here. I understand councillors also want us off the councils as we were dictating when meetings should be held because we were not available on certain days. That was not fair to non-Oireachtas Members. I felt I had no right to lay down ground rules about meetings. I cannot be in the two places at the one time and cannot be selfish. I had to decide how I wanted to shape my career in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">There will be such an influx of new councillors that I will have an awful job to get to know them, which causes me some apprehension. However, I will find a way around this. I am sure the Minister will make sure that we will not lose access to the councillors who form our electorate. I feared I would lose contact with the councillors, whom I love. The local councillors schooled me and let me know what politics were all about. Most of us have gone through this. Being a member of a local authority is the greatest schooling we can get. It lets us feel the pulse of what is happening on the ground. Understanding the procedures at councils helped me understand the procedures here, which are very similar. There is much knowledge to be gained. I encourage the public to become involved in local government. The Minister has indicated he will introduce changes in the funding and power structures of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">We have come a long way since I started in local government in 1985 – other Senators can go back further than me. Back then, we did a considerable amount of work for nothing. I would do it again because I am not involved in politics for the money, although I also like it. I entered local government because I considered it a vocation and liked being involved. My local authority gave my first breath in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">Having said that, local government is becoming a professional and absorbing career. Unless we make it worthwhile, young people will not give up their careers to become involved. The number of meetings held every week is extremely time consuming. One cannot do two jobs at once. County councillors cannot hold down another job. I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing a little latitude. I congratulate the Minister and look forward to working with him in shaping the future of local government.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_965">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue. In the spirit of the maxim that all politics is local, I am raising a local issue. As spokesperson on the environment for the Fianna Fáil Party in the House, I thank the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, for his presence.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">I am interested in efforts to have a sewerage scheme in the town of Tuam extended to Airglooney which was the site of an Irish Sugar factory which provided employment for more than 1,000 people in its heyday. It is good news for the people of Tuam and surrounding areas that some industrial development is taking place on the old site.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">One of the reasons for the delay in the scheme has been the construction of a significant amount of housing along Ballygaddy Road. From my inquiries to the local authorities and the Department, I have become aware that many queries have been raised concerning the total number of housing units to be provided in recent years. I understand that as many as 700 new houses are planned for the new route and proposals have been made for further housing estates. There are also more than 250 old houses on Ballygaddy Road and in Airglooney, some of which are old sugar factory houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">Various costs have been given for the sewerage project. With an initial value of some £1.2 million, I presume the cost is now heading for €2 million. The decision of the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to place the Tuam scheme and others in the county on the list was a welcome development. We are very anxious, however, to have the scheme extended to Airglooney.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">There are about 40 warehouses on the Airglooney site and about 70 acres of land which could be developed if the sewerage scheme was to be extended. I particularly welcome the fact that Tuam Engineering (Hynes) Limited is completing part of it, thus making a major local contribution to the estate. I hope the scheme will be extended as it would give a lift to Tuam. I thank the Minister for the interest he has taken in water and sewerage schemes in County Galway and hope we will be able to make further progress in the future.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_970">I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. As he is aware and has acknowledged, the provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support social and economic objectives has been and continues to be a major focus of Government spending. The unprecedented increase in investment by my Department on water and sewerage schemes under the current and previous national development plans has made a key contribution to economic growth which has benefited every part of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Total investment in water and sewerage facilities over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will amount to almost €4.4 billion, of which more than €3.8 billion is earmarked for major public schemes. This investment is aimed at supporting economic and social development, employment generation and the achievement of high environmental standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">In April 2002 the second phase of the water services investment programme under the current NDP was announced. This phase covers the years 2002-04 and is a continuation of a rolling strategy that will be progressively advanced up to the end of the NDP in 2006. The total allocated for Galway city and county under the current phase of the programme amounts to nearly €350 million in respect of some 46 schemes. The approved schemes include major sewerage projects for Galway city, soon to be completed, Clifden, Headford, Barna, Athenry, Ballinasloe and Kilronan as well as stage two of the Tuam main drainage scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">There are also major water supply schemes for Galway city, Carna-Kilkieran, Tuam regional water supply scheme, phase two, as well as regional water supply schemes for Clifden, Costelloe, Loughrea and Ballinasloe. These are the biggest of the schemes but many more towns and villages in the county are also covered and will benefit from the major push to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to a modern standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional serviced residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to meet housing needs at a number of key locations around Galway city and county. The proposal in relation to Airglooney is one such scheme. Countrywide, services to facilitate the provision of some 50,000 serviced sites have been provided and schemes to serve a further 50,000 sites are in progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The serviced land proposal in this case envisages an extension of the existing Tuam sewerage scheme on Ballygaddy Road, which, I understand, includes Airglooney and was approved for funding at an estimated cost of €1.1 million in 1998. However, the approved proposals were subsequently modified by Galway County Council in favour of a larger and more expensive scheme. My Department has received certain information requested from the council on the revised proposals but some further details requested from the council earlier this month are awaited. The outstanding information is needed to enable my Department to reach a decision on the revised proposal and see how both the overall Tuam main drainage scheme and the extension on Ballygaddy Road can be best advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">I have listened carefully to what the Senator has said. My Department will act promptly when it receives the outstanding information from Galway County Council to ensure he is able to deliver the scheme to his area.</p>

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_977">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue. I ask the Minister to give an early indication of the provision of deficit funding to provide for the replacement of the Orchard Centre, Gort, County Galway. This centre was established approximately 20 years ago. At the time of the disastrous fire, there were 50 people placed there. Of these, 30 were residential patients while the remainder were day care patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">I wish to thank the Brothers of Charity for the tremendous work they have done at this centre over the years. It is difficult not to underestimate the value of the centre to the many adults with special needs in the area who did not have any service in the past. The centre serves a catchment area from Kinvara to Loughrea – this includes Gort town and the wider area – and the loss of such a service in this tragic way is a severe blow to the many people who avail of it and also to the staff who have worked in the centre for so long and given such commitment to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">I pay special tribute to the nursing staff and the caretakers who, in difficult circumstances, evacuated the centre on the night of the fire. As a result of their actions, there were no injuries or loss of life. I also thank the fire services in Loughrea and Gort for their tremendous work in bringing the fire under control at an early stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">This centre provides training of a high standard for elderly people. It also provides physiotherapy and other services, including a small element of work training facilitated by local manufacturing industry, which provides therapy for people who still want to work on assembly of a very light nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">I ask the Minister to ensure that the Department would make a quick decision to provide funding, through the most appropriate agency, so that new services can be put in place at the centre. At present, the 30 residential patients are provided with accommodation in four rented houses and while that is a suitable stop-gap measure, it is important that they should be placed in a new centre in the near future. The assessors have moved in and I understand it is not possible to reconstruct or renovate the existing building. It will be necessary to provide a new purpose built premises to provide a full range of services in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">What is required in this instance is deficit funding. There will be no completely new cost to the Department, the Brothers of Charity, the Western Health Board or all the agencies combined. It is of the utmost importance that the deficit funding to which I refer is provided in order that these people can return to the quality of life they have enjoyed over the past 20 years. Some of these patients have been at the centre on a long-term basis and they have become accustomed to the services provided. It is vital that the Minister would give an indication that the work could commence at an early stage on a replacement building so that the services built up can recommence in the near future.</p>

        <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_391">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_983">I thank Senator Ulick Burke and other Senators and Deputies – including Senator Kitt and my good friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy – who have raised this issue with me. I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the Orchard Centre in Gort, County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">I wish first to express my sympathy to all those concerned with the centre. It has been a traumatic few weeks for the individuals attending the centre and for those working with them. Thankfully, there was no loss of life and no one was injured, which is the main concern when events of this nature occur. Like Senator Burke, I also compliment those on duty on the night of the fire.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">I understand from the Western Health Board that since the fire, the Brothers of Charity Services, which provides the services based in the Orchard Centre, has made arrangements for an interim programme to be delivered to those attending the centre along the lines mentioned by Senator Burke. The programme is being delivered in four rented houses and at one of the service's own houses. The fact that this interim service was put in place within ten days of the fire is due to the tremendous efforts made by the staff of the Orchard Centre and the significant support that has been forthcoming from the people of Gort. I am happy to record my thanks to all concerned for their dedication and total commitment in the provision of such services.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">With the interim services in place, I understand a working group has been established to review the programme delivered in the Orchard Centre and the facilities which will be required into the future, based on the changing needs and wishes of the service users. Senator Burke referred to a built-on site, but I would make the point that the working group is now reviewing the programme which will be required into the future. It may, therefore, not be a question of simple replacement.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">I have also been informed by the Western Health Board that it is too early to say whether the existing building will be restored. I understand that while the risk assessor has not yet completed a report, it is believed the insurance cover is adequate to meet business interruption costs and a replica of the former premises but perhaps that is not what is required to be put back on site. Like Senator Burke and the other Senators who have an interest in this facility, I would like to see the provision of a facility that will be required into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">At this stage, the question of immediate costs associated with the delivery of an interim programme would appear to be covered by the insurance provision. Costs associated with the provision of a replacement facility will only be clarified when the working group has had an opportunity to examine the needs of service users. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work undertaken by everyone involved with the centre in recent weeks to put in place the interim services and begin the process of rebuilding the services. I wish them well in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">I do not believe that funding is an immediate problem. The insurance company has been very forthcoming in that regard and if I can provide further assistance on this issue, I will be happy to do so.</p>

          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_991">I thank the Minister for coming before the House to take this matter on the Adjournment.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">I am aware that negotiations are ongoing with Cork City Council regarding the proposed sale of a portion of the lands at the Camp Field, Collins Barracks, Cork. I welcome the fact that the Minister appears to have taken on board certain concerns regarding the long-term future of Collins Pitch and Putt Club and the playing pitches in the Camp Filed. The purpose of my seeking to have this item discussed on the Adjournment is not to get into the specifics of that deal, but to focus on one aspect, namely, the situation regarding the existing residents in the Camp Field.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Currently, six of the nine officers' married quarters are occupied and to date the only information these residents have obtained regarding the proposed sale of lands, including the houses, has come from media reports. To the best of my knowledge, where quarters were previously disposed of they were offered for sale at market value to the incumbents. In this case, however, it is rumoured that they are being offered for sale with vacant possession. I understand that a number of these residents of these six occupied quarters would be glad of the opportunity to purchase their respective property, which in many cases has become their family home, at the market value. Needless to say, this period of uncertainty is most distressing for the families concerned because they have received no written communication of any nature concerning the implications for them and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">The Minister was good enough recently to meet with members of Collins Pitch and Putt Club, and I thank him for that. However, in the case of these residents there has been absolutely no communication. There is a human dimension to this issue as we are dealing with families and I seek urgent clarification on the following issues. Are the quarters, which are currently occupied on an open-ended owner-occupier basis, now deemed to be surplus to Department of Defence requirements and therefore identified for disposal in accordance with departmental policy? If so, will these properties be offered initially for sale to the present occupiers at a price determined by the Valuation Office in accordance with departmental policy and precedent?</p>
          <p eId="para_995">If the properties are sold over the heads of the existing residents, what kind of notice to vacate or alternative accommodation will be offered to them? The Minister should not only answer these specific questions but also communicate with the residents regarding the future security of what have become their family homes.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_394">
          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_996">As the Senator is aware, on 15 July 1998 the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which were considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the context of the Pricewaterhouse Report regarding the rationalisation of military institutions generally. The Government remains fully committed to this important programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">In tandem with barrack closures I have had the question of the sale of further property surplus to military requirements also under ongoing examination to fund much needed investment to meet the equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces. The funds raised from the disposal of properties are being invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and essential new equipment. The amount expended on the barracks reinvestment programme alone amounted to approximately €68 million to the end of 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">The strategic focus of the investment programme for the period 2000 to 2010 is the acquisition of a broad range of equipment in order to achieve a balanced increase in operational capacity throughout the Defence Forces. For the reasons I have already outlined, I have decided that the Camp Field, Collins Barracks, Cork, will be disposed of and arrangements for disposal of the property will be put in train as soon as possible. In this regard my Department is in discussions with Cork City Council. My intentions concerning the disposal of this property were conveyed to the military authorities in March 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The Camp Field comprises approximately 16.5 acres. The sports ground, which will be retained for military use, comprises an area of approximately 7.4 acres. The area to be disposed of therefore comprises approximately 9.1 acres, which is made up of officers' married quarters, tennis courts and the pitch and putt course. Collins Pitch and Putt Club occupies the pitch and putt course under licence from my Department and I am confident that a suitable arrangement will be worked out whereby they will continue to do so following disposal of the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">The occupancy of the officers' married quarters is governed by Defence Force regulations. Personnel occupying married quarters do so as permissive occupants and not as tenants and are obliged to vacate the quarters when required, as provided for in regulations. There are nine officers' married quarters located within the Camp Field and, as the Senator outlined, six are occupied. All officers occupying these quarters will, in accordance with Defence Force regulations, be given sufficient notice to vacate same well in advance of the disposal of the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">It will be appreciated that it is incumbent on me as Minister for Defence to ensure that my Department's property portfolio is managed in a manner which provides an appropriate level of holdings to support the accommodation, training and operational requirements of the Defence Forces, while at the same time disposing of properties deemed surplus in order to fund essential investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">Naturally I am anxious to ensure that all the occupants are contacted in due course. I am in negotiations with the local authority to complete these arrangements. The other aspects of the issue will be dealt with not only in accordance with Defence Forces regulations but in the most humane and understanding way possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">The Seanad adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 February 2003.</p>
