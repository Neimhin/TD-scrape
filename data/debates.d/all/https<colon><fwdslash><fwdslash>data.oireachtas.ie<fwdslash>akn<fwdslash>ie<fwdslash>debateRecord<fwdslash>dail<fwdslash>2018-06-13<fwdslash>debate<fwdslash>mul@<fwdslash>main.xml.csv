#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	2	When Tusla takes a child into care, it may do so either by way of a court order under the Child Care Act 1991 or by way of a voluntary care arrangement whereby there is consent from the child's parent or guardian. Every case is unique. There will be some cases where voluntary care is the most appropriate response and others where it will be necessary to have a more formal arrangement using a court order under the Child Care Act 1991. Voluntary care is an important option open to Tusla and may be used to help struggling parents and protect vulnerable children. Voluntary care is also utilised where parents require some form of short-term respite, or where a parent may be ill or seeking treatment for a particular condition. Its application in these circumstances is particularly useful. Approximately one third of children in care at any one time are cared for under a voluntary arrangement. It is important to emphasise that voluntary care is based on parental consent. The child's parent or guardian is entitled to have an input into the care that their child receives and they have the power to withdraw their consent if they are not satisfied with the care their child is receiving. Importantly, it also makes it easier for struggling parents to entrust the care of their children to Tusla when they need help. Voluntary care can facilitate a co-operative relationship between parents, Tusla and caregivers, and this can be positive for the child and his or her family.  Tusla introduced new practice guidance last year on the use of voluntary consent for admission to care. This provides social workers with clear definitions of voluntary consent and the process for determining capacity to give consent. Timely and understandable informed consent sets the stage for social work services and assists with providing all involved with an understanding of the process and associated realistic expectations. The guidance also stresses that consent to a voluntary arrangement should only be sought if it is fair and proportionate in all circumstances, which is important.

That equates to 2,026 children. As the Minister explained, the parents agreed to have their children taken into care for various reasons. In these cases, Tusla must consider the parents' wishes on aspects of how the care is provided. The reason I tabled this question is that some of the caregivers have a number of issues where voluntary care orders are used.Such issues include getting birthday cakes for the children in their care or having the children's hair cut. Caregivers feel that they have little engagement in the decision-making process. Empowering People in Care, EPIC, has made a number of representations, including to the Minister, regarding voluntary care orders. It believes that little or no progress is being made. What steps is the Minister taking to address the types of simple, minor issue that I have mentioned? Is the Department taking steps to ensure appropriate court orders are sought for children in care?

There is a new practice guidance to assist with the issues the Deputy identified. Voluntary care provides that the best interests of the child should be the determining factor. Voluntary consent should not be used indefinitely if that is not in the child's best interests. It should only be sought if it is clear that reunification with the child's parents or guardians is possible. Under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, we made a commitment to review and reform the Child Care Act 1991. My Department has initiated that work and engaged with Tusla and other State agencies. The work will address a broader and higher level than some of the issues the Deputy raised, but I am aware that, in a family or home situation, questions on whether parental consent is needed for such matters can sometimes arise. I hope the new practice guidance will assist in that regard.

It is regrettable that 45% of children in care have been the subject of voluntary care orders that have lasted for longer than five years. The Minister mentioned that orders were meant to be temporary, but no one can say that "temporary" means "five years". We need to discuss the negative impact of placing children under voluntary care orders for longer than 12 months. Everyone will agree that reunification should always be the goal, but there must be a measurable goal. This is not just about the children's best interests; we must also consider the caregivers. There must be a clear pathway in order that caregivers and Tusla can know where they are going. The fact that 45% of children in care have been under voluntary care orders for longer than five years means they are not successful.

She stated that they have not been successful. While I appreciate the sentiment she is expressing, circumstances change and family units are different. We do not necessarily know when a child will require support in the form of a voluntary care order, under which parents give their consent and work with carers. From what I can tell, the issues the Deputy is raising are coming from the carers, in particular. Under voluntary care orders, they require support in terms of training, contact with Tusla, etc. I appreciate those issues. In the reforms that it is in initiating, Tusla will meet those concerns.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	7	This relates to St. Patrick's Guild. Will the Minister make a statement on the matter?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	8	On 29 May, I announced that Tusla had identified 126 cases where births were illegally registered between 1946 and 1969. The cases were identified during an analysis of adoption records that were transferred to Tusla by the former adoption society, St. Patrick's Guild. As the information that an incorrect birth registration has taken place is life-changing, the State has a responsibility to reach a high level of certainty that this has happened before it contacts the individuals concerned. This threshold has been reached in the case of the 126 St. Patrick's Guild files. We are all aware of the seriousness and sensitivity of this issue. People have the right to their identities. They have the right to know of their true origins and, where we have clear evidence, we have an obligation to tell those affected. Some may know, but for others, it will be entirely new and difficult information to receive and absorb. There will be a social worker-led process of making contact with those affected who can be identified. This includes the birth mother, the person who was incorrectly registered - the child - and the people who participated in the incorrect registrations and subsequently raised these children as their own. Each of the 126 cases has been assigned to an experienced Tusla information and tracing social worker and work has commenced on tracing the individuals concerned. I emphasise that the process will be measured, sensitive and carried out at the pace of the individual affected. There will be no sudden phone calls or unannounced visits to people's doors. The process of offering contact and supporting those affected will be handled carefully and take account of the requirements of the individuals. I am confident that Tusla is prioritising these cases and committing the necessary resources. However, I reiterate that the only information available at the commencement of the process was contained in records that were in most cases more than 50 years old. The process of tracing people will take some time, but it is expected that Tusla will be in a position to start making contact with individuals at the end of this month.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The sampling process will address the Tusla and Adoption Authority records to see if a major trawl of these is likely to yield hard evidence of incorrect registrations. Tusla found evidence in the St. Patrick's Guild records primarily because of the term "adopted from birth" that was placed on index cards. If this marker had not been present, it would have been difficult to identify even the 126 cases. We do not know if such a clear marker, or indeed any marker, will be found in other files. It is my view that we must first judge the likely incidence of cases that can actually be identified, through the initial analysis, and the scale of them. I will then be in a position to judge the next steps that may be required.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	9	I thank the Minister for her response. People were not shocked by the scandal. For many years, survivors have spoken about illegal adoption practices and many journalists have exposed those practices. To have proof finally is welcome, but we have read that, in addition to the 126 affected adoptions that it has reported, Tusla has raised concerns about a further 748 cases in St. Patrick's Guild alone where there were no adoption orders, changes had been made to names and cash payments were made to the guild. While I understand that an additional sampling exercise is under way, I have concerns about it. It is only an initial exercise, but we would not accept a sampling exercise in respect of any other organisation accused of what I believe was child trafficking. Will the Minister confirm that Tusla will hold a full and thorough investigation into St. Patrick's Guild?

I understand that it was from this number that, following Tusla's deeper analysis and cross-checking with the Adoption Authority and General Register Office, GRO, with a view to ensuring a high threshold of evidence of illegality was reached, the 126 cases emerged. Regarding a further analysis, I have asked the independent reviewer to oversee a targeted sampling process of relevant records held by Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, in the first instance to see if clear evidence can be established. I have appointed Ms Marion Reynolds to oversee this work. Ms Reynolds met Tusla, the AAI and officials from my Department yesterday to initiate the process. There are 150,000 records at issue, of which 100,000 are currently in the custody of Tusla and the AAI. That is where this work will start.

How many people are affected? Are the records of other organisations or societies being investigated? Is Tusla committed to obtaining all of these records?There is great concern that these files will go missing or be destroyed. Will the Minister commit to an investigation that will cover all agencies, individuals and homes involved in adoption in this State and also the estimated 2,000 children who were sent to the United States and supposedly illegally adopted there?

There is no question about that. At the same time, I am also saying that it is critical to take this one step at a time. After it had identified the "adopted from birth" signifier on the index cards, it took Tusla a number of months to ensure, through the cross-registration process, that we had evidence of illegal registration. However, that is in regard to the records that are held, particularly those which fall within the jurisdiction of the State. As the Deputy has identified, there are other records outside of that and we need to get those into the possession of the State in order to move forward with further analysis. I am aware of that and those are issues at which we are now looking. We have an openness to moving forward in that regard. However, we must proceed one step at a time in order to do this right.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	13	The ICGAG was established in 2013 by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The purpose was to assess existing provisions for safer and better Internet strategies. The report of the group included a number of recommendations which have application across various Departments. The Deputy will appreciate that I do not have lead ministerial policy responsibility for Internet safety. In the circumstances, I do not propose to comment on the individual recommendations in the report. However, I have significant responsibilities, as part of the cross-Government approach, in respect of ensuring that the Internet is a safer place for children. In this regard, the Children First Act 2015 places statutory obligations on organisations providing relevant services to children, including the preparation of a child safeguarding statement. My Department will be amending the Children First guidelines to include a specific reference to online safety in the preparation of the statement before the end of the second quarter of 2019. It is also important to ensure that the voices of children and young people are heard and acted upon when we make decisions on Internet safety. In this context, my Department undertakes and supports a wide range of consultation and participation processes with children and young people through Dáil na nÓg and Comhairle na nÓg. My Department also provides funding to three national youth organisations which provide online safety resources for the youth sector. They are: the National Youth Council of Ireland; SpunOut.ie, Ireland's youth information website; and Youth Work Ireland. Parents have a crucial role in ensuring that children are safe online. Providing information and services to parents is part of the role of my Department, particularly through the Child and Family Agency and community and voluntary sector organisations. This will be a key focus for the Department in the coming years. I will be outlining steps in that regard in the early years strategy. In terms of Government action, the Department of the Taoiseach is currently developing an action plan on online safety. This will take into account the recent report of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, which we will discuss later, as well as the concerns highlighted in the report we are currently discussing. I am fully committed to playing my part in a co-ordinated cross-Government approach to dealing with the issue.

Does she envisage implementing any of the key recommendations that it will contain? I am acutely aware that numerous Departments other than hers are involved in the protection of children online. However, I request that she, as an Independent Minister in Cabinet, use her voice in the context of the proposed digital safety commissioner. The appointment of a digital safety commissioner is long overdue. It is five years since the report was produced and a great deal has changed in that period. Despite the work of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, the good work that has been done regarding cybersecurity and the advent of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, I am not sure whether parents are aware that the digital age of consent has increased to 16. In that context, there are children as young as eight on Snapchat. Is the Department going to roll out any measures to ensure parents are aware that the age of consent is now 16 or has it considered that?

Given that we discussed these issues at the committee, she knows I am open to the idea of appointing a digital safety commissioner. If that is what we ultimately decide is the best way to move forward, then let us do it. In terms of the action plan that has been compiled and is being readied for publication in the Department of the Taoiseach, there are some actions in it that it has been decided to implement initially to see if they prove sufficient in terms of the way in which we are currently operating but also to bring matters one step further. If some of those actions do not work, I know there would be an openness to moving forward. For example, it may be the case that, in the context of the action plan, we could establish a new national advisory council on online safety in order to provide a forum for expert stakeholder input and advice for Government and to create a single online access point on government.ie as the authoritative source on information and online safety. As the Deputy points out in the context of my role, I have identified a number of ways in which the Department is supporting that work with parents and children.

The Government is not in control; it is the providers, such as Snapchat and Facebook, which are in control. Regrettably, when hateful speech is put up or when bullying is taking place online, there is no way to deal with it and it has to go through a process whereby the industry judges whether the relevant material should be taken down. Due to the fact that we do not have a regulator in place to ensure that the entire industry is working to the same rules and regulations, we are letting down our young people at this time. The appointment of a digital safety commissioner is long overdue. The Minister plays a huge role in her independent capacity within Cabinet. She is in an influential position to influence the Taoiseach, who has been found wanting in this regard. I know that the respective Ministers, Deputies Zappone and Naughten, are committed to this. I plead with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, for the sake of the children of the country, to push Government forward to regulate this sphere.

Who knows? Perhaps that is what we need. As stated, I am open to that and I am persuaded by some of the arguments the Deputy is putting forward. At the same time, although the Deputy does not have sight of it, there is an action plan that is coming out shortly in regard to a number of other measures that are going to be put in place in light of what is already going on. Are we completely, utterly and wildly out of control in the context of what is going on with children online? I do not think so. That said, there are still many issues parents and children are worried about and about which the Deputy and I, as public representatives, are concerned. This is a very big challenge; of that there is no question. However, an increasing number of actions will be implemented in order to try to bring this under control, apart from what we are already doing.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	20	I attended a meeting on Sunday of 55 LGBTQ parents and 20 of their children. They are affected by an issue which a majority of people in society are not aware of - and probably a majority in the LGBTQ community are not even aware of - whereby, despite three years having passed since the passing of the Children and Family Relationships Act and the advent of marriage equality, children of same-sex married couples are still unable to have both their parents registered on their birth certificates.I understand that the commencement of the relevant sections is not the Minister's responsibility and I appreciate her taking the question, which is on the impact this is having on the rights of these children. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of children who are currently affected and as time passes, more and more will be affected and more and more serious issues will be posed.

My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has responsibility for Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, which make provision for children conceived through the assistance of a donor and provide legal clarity on parental rights and responsibilities. While I understand that officials in the Department of Health have prepared draft regulations to facilitate the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, they have identified in the course of that work a small number of technical drafting issues in the legislation. These issues are currently being explored by officials in the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General. If it transpires that amendment is required through primary legislation, the Minister for Health has undertaken to facilitate same as a matter of urgency in order to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the regulations necessary to commence Parts 2 and 3 as soon as possible thereafter. At the same time, the Department of Health is preparing guidance documentation to accompany the regulations when commenced. I understand that the Minister for Health will imminently make an announcement on his plans to resolve the issues which have arisen with the commencement of the Act. As such, I am confident that the outstanding issues relating to these important Parts of the Child and Family Relationships Act will be resolved.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	22	I say to the Minister and, if he is listening, to the Minister for Health that this is an urgent matter and we would like an imminent announcement on it. It is having an impact on people's lives now. Couples are getting pregnant without realising that this is going to be a problem. It is something they realise only during the course of their pregnancies or, in the case of some people to whom I have spoken, only when they have turned up to register the birth of a child. All of sudden, they realise that the form has a space for "mother" and a space for "father" and that one cannot simply cross out "father" and have two mothers. I was contacted by Leanne when she and her partner, Nile, to whom she is married, needed to get a passport for their baby. Eventually, they had no choice but to put just one of the parents' names on the birth certificate. They were not able to register both as parents. That has an ongoing impact and as time goes on, it will present real difficulties. Leanne sent me the following: Nile and I created our baby together. We went through the process that every couple do with the intent of creating a human. I willingly signed up to love and care for someone for the rest of my life. Is this not what makes a family? This month we celebrate gay pride. The theme is "We Are Family". How much of a slap in the face is this to all same sex parents out there? Instead of celebrating our first pride as a family, we'll be marching and protesting for our rights. Again. I hope all my friends and family will join us. I know you all voted for equality 3 years ago and I'm sorry to have to ask you to fight with us once again.

I was fully aware of and delighted to hear that the Deputy was at the meeting on Sunday. I spoke to the director of LGBT Ireland on Sunday night to hear how the meeting had gone. I am deeply conscious of the experiences of parents like the couple the Deputy identifies and of the urgency of the matter. Many of these people are my friends and I am concerned as much about those who have been couples with children for years as I am about those who are about to have children. I spoke to a couple only last evening who said to me that their children, who are younger kids, believe they are a family because of the passing of the marriage equality referendum. That is what they know and that is what they understand. The concerns lay in particular with the parents. Those are the concerns I am aware of and I acknowledge the urgency of the regulations, which need to happen soon.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	24	Has any analysis been done on the impact of this on the rights of children? As time passes, parents may separate or the tragic death of one may take place. What would be the impact of that on a child in this situation who has only one of his or her parents registered officially before this situation is resolved? I welcome the Minister's agreement that this is urgent. I understand that LGBT Inclusion has written to the Minister for Health seeking a meeting to get an update. In response to an answer which offered a briefing from the Department, I have sought to have that take place to get the latest information. Unfortunately, many people out there have been asking questions and been told over a long period that commencement was about to start, although some issues were identified. The Minister will therefore forgive a certain scepticism or wariness until we see what the plan is. While I accept there are real technical difficulties, it is vital that the Government takes whatever steps are necessary to put this in place given the passage of three years since elected representatives in the House passed the Act following the endorsement by the people of marriage equality. If possible, that should be done before the summer recess.

This is a critical issue and I appreciate greatly the Deputy raising it. The Deputy's question about research on the impact on young people reminded me of the first piece of research I had on children expressing what it meant for them to be children of LGBT families but not recognised as such. This was prior to the marriage equality referendum and it was called "The Voices of Children - Report on Initial Research with Children of LGBT Parents", published in 2010 by Marriage Equality, an organisation I helped to found. It is a terrific document still and it describes how children felt about not being acknowledged and recognised as families. Having said that, and having consulted with the people to whom the Deputy is also speaking, including those who have written to me and a number of my friends, it may be useful to do some additional research on children's perspectives as the children of LGBT parents and on the impact it has on them. There may be possibilities to do that under the national LGBT strategy, which I am about to launch during the week of Pride. I appreciate the urgency of this matter and I thank the Deputy again for raising it. It is why I am trying to describe the fact that an announcement will take place soon and that the Department is already preparing regulations to put in place once the legislative issues have been sorted.

I note that the Minister told Deputy Mitchell that she was open to this, but the key point is that this is an ageing community and there must be urgency in carrying out the exercise. It must be extended to include all, not just a sample.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	27	As I indicated earlier, I have asked an independent reviewer to oversee a further analysis of relevant records held by Tusla and the Adoption Authority in the first instance. The purpose of the exercise is to see if clear evidence of illegal registrations is evident in other records. The first meeting to commence this process took place yesterday and I expect the analysis to be completed four months from when it is initiated. In that regard, I understand that methodological matters are currently being finalised. Given the volume of records involved, we must first judge the likely incidence of cases that can actually be identified through this analysis. I will then be in a position to judge the next steps. Records which are not in the custody of either Tusla or the Adoption Authority cannot be included in the analysis at this stage as the State does not have possession of them. The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 is the statutory mechanism necessary to bring these records, estimated at about 50,000, into the custody of the Adoption Authority. I am meeting colleagues from both Houses this afternoon to explore how we can progress this legislation as quickly as possible. The extent to which children were simply placed with couples and their births registered as if they had been born to them is but one of the major issues that we need to examine. The work of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes will be important in dealing with a range of other adoption-related matters. The commission is examining adoption practices in the cases of mothers and children who were resident in the institutions within its terms of reference. The commission is also required to examine the interaction of mother and baby homes with other institutions, organisations and individuals who had involvement with children from these institutions.For example, it is examining the practices and policies within adoption societies involved in the placement of children from these institutions. This will provide important insight into any irregularities or illegalities. I want to get to the truth. The further analysis, which has commenced, together with the ongoing work of the commission, will be important for our initial steps. I reiterate that I am open to furthering those steps.

The incidence of the criminal, illegal registration of births has been known by society for a long time. One of the points that must emerge from an extension beyond a scoping exercise is the huge numbers of people involved. This is not speculation; the evidence is known.Conall Ó Fátharta wrote in yesterday's edition of the Irish Examiner about the 748 cases on top of the 126 cases and the knowledge that existed in adoption agencies. The AAI gave information to the health committee in 2014 that said there were thousands of illegal adoptions at that stage. It cannot be a lottery for the people at the centre of this whereby one of their samples might get picked and they get an answer. There may be people who do not even know that they require an answer. We need to be extensive in the research because much larger numbers of people are affected by this. These cases have gone long beyond the records of St. Patrick's Guild and the other institutions. It has been known for some time that we needed to secure those records. The key issues are to stress to the Minister the urgency of the situation and the need to extend the scope.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	29	I acknowledge the Deputy as a champion of this issue, and all the work she has done with advocates, which has brought us to this point. I met a number of the advocates recently and one of the key messages coming from them is the sense of urgency that is required. When considering where we go from here, particularly with regard to the records we have as well as those we do not, the right way to begin is a targeted approach with the 100,000 records I mentioned. One of the reasons for this, apart from the fact that trawling through 100,000 records will be a significant and labour-intensive job, is that from a research perspective we should take this one step at a time to see if the methodology being developed will work to help us uncover evidence of the illegal registrations. Perhaps it might not do this and as time passes there will not be the huge numbers the Deputy has indicated. I do not necessarily disagree with the Deputy but there may be other ways to try to get at the truth apart from the methodology currently being developed.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	30	We will discuss the scoping exercise this afternoon and I am sure every Member's input will stress the urgency. In the interim, however, there are older and vulnerable people who, in some instances, do not have months or years to wait for that process. In this context the expertise of a person such as Sharon Lawless, who produced "Adoption Stories" for TV3, is important. People like her, with few resources but with an open heart and a will to find answers through DNA testing and so on, have been able to give people answers when they were told there was no information to be had in other quarters. We need to tap into resources such as DNA. Mandatory counselling should be provided to support people in this process and a method to reach out to affected people and those who will be affected must be put in place early on in the process. We should not wait for that. It requires not just urgency; it requires a beefing up of resources in those areas as well as in record searching and in extending the scope. It is incumbent on all of us to get behind this to make sure the resources are delivered for that.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	31	I would be open to all those suggestions and I thank the Deputy for them. We need to consider all of those aspects in the context of the research and the identification of the evidence, as she said. I agree that we may need to go about these in other ways, especially from the stakeholders' perspective. It may be the case that little information emerges following the initial four months of using the methodology, and we may need to consider a different approach to reviewing the files. If that is the case, engagement with stakeholders could be critical. At the meeting I held with stakeholders - and the Deputy will be aware of this because she has also spoken with them - a number of related issues and concerns were raised such as falsified addresses and dates of birth by birth mothers, the importance of baptismal records, the use of obviously false addresses on records and the potential to identify trends. To follow up on information such as this and to seek information from these people and organisations, who are familiar with the system and are experts in the field, may be a more appropriate way to go about this research. Subsequent to my announcement, I was contacted by a number of people who suspect they were illegally registered. We must also take on board those contacts and those questions as part of our research moving forward.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	32	I am conscious of claims that the State knew for many years about illegal registrations, and that successive Governments should have done more to address the issue. What has been lost in the debate is the fact that, while there seems to have been an awareness of this illegal practice, we had no clear proof of what happened, other than in a few individual cases where documentary evidence was found. It is vital to point out that illegal registrations were deliberately concealed and that either no records were kept or else they appear to have been deliberately falsified. In these circumstances, it was difficult to find the truth. The St. Patrick's Guild records were the first source of a considerable number of cases where clear written evidence was identified. I announced this on 29 May as soon as I was satisfied about the strength of the evidence in these cases. While the AAI has previously reported concerns about a number of cases it was aware of, the threshold of evidence of an incorrect registration, which is required if persons are to be notified, had not yet been reached. While engaging with Tusla and the AAI on the evidence emerging from the St. Patrick's Guild files of illegal registrations, I requested that the authority revisit the cases about which it had concerns, and to conduct a validation exercise on them to establish if a high level of certainty could be reached that an incorrect registration had taken place. I await the outcome of this validation exercise from the authority. If further confirmed cases emerge, they will be added to the same process as the 126 confirmed St. Patrick's Guild cases. In addition, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters is examining adoption practices in the cases of mothers and children who were resident in the specified institutions within its terms of reference.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	33	I thank the Minister for her reply but I challenge her assertion that prior to this there had been "no clear proof" of this criminal action other than in a handful of cases. In 2013, the AAI said that there may be thousands of cases, which is not clear proof, but it also said that there were hundreds of illegal birth registrations. The authority knew this from its own audit and work on the issue. This was brought to the attention of departmental officials. Given there was clear proof on more than a handful of cases from an authority no less than the AAI, which is the key body, why was more not done at that point?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	34	When preparing a reply for the Deputy's important question, the information from the AAI was that, between 2010 and now, it has been contacted by 141 people looking for information that the authority did not have.Who are these people? They are children who suspected they were adopted, mothers who gave their children up for adoption and relatives who were aware that family members were adopted but the AAI could find no official records or adoption orders relating to their cases. It checked with the General Register Office and discovered that in 75 cases the individuals concerned were registered as the children of the people who raised them. The AAI is now cross-checking with Tusla that other parties connected with the individuals in question, that is the 141 people, were not in touch with the latter regarding its information and tracing service. For example, a mother who had given birth may have contacted the AAI and a child may have contacted Tusla. I am indicating now that hundreds of people had come to it and that it did a certain amount of checking but could not establish the level of evidence needed in order to move forward.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	35	I wish to ask Deputy Zappone, in her capacity as an Independent Minister, about her comment that successive Governments should have done more. I agree with her but it is a mild comment in the circumstances. She has sat at the Cabinet table with the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the current Minister, Deputy Flanagan. The former Minister said that all adoptions since 1952 had been carried out legally on the basis of the 1952 Act and subsequent legislation. That was a false statement. It was repeated twice by the current Minister. They could have easily verified the situation by having an audit of all the files. They consistently refused the request of adoption campaigners to the effect that such an audit be carried out. I ask Deputy Zappone, who is an Independent Minister, to make a further comment on the track record relating to this matter.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	36	The Deputy has laid out his position on that commentary and it is on the record. On the matter of what I, as an Independent Minister, have done regarding the evidence presented to me in recent months, I moved as quickly as I could to ensure that they continued to do the research in which they were engaged and that the cross-checking took place. I also brought people, including representatives from Tusla, the AAI and my officials, to the table many times in order to determine that we had a level of evidence that was never the case previously. When they did that, I moved to facilitate the possibility that Tusla would be able to support and begin a process of contacting these people. This was in addition to the research we have identified and with which we are moving forward. That is what my job is as an Independent Minister in this Government.

#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	38	The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 has passed Second Stage in the Seanad. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the Bill seeks to respect the rights to identity and privacy, which sometimes conflict with one another. Given the constitutional context, striking the balance between these rights is proving challenging. It is important legislation for many people. Previous attempts to introduce a Bill, dating back as far as 2001, failed. I am conscious of Deputies' interest in this important issue and of our shared desire to move matters forward. It is essential that the Bill progresses as quickly as possible, particularly as it will place the information and tracing service on a statutory footing for the first time.  It will also protect relevant records by bringing them into the custody of the AAI. It will create offences for the concealment, destruction, mutilation or falsification of such records.  The Bill impacts on people who are the subject of illegal registrations, as well as adopted people. Officials are currently reviewing its provisions, in the light of the recent evidence emerging on illegal birth registrations, to ensure that it is robust in addressing this issue. If additional amendments to the Bill are required to ensure this, that can be addressed as the Bill goes through the Houses. My intention is that the Bill will be enacted by the end of the year. Earlier this week, I met advocacy groups. That was an informative and helpful engagement. As the Deputy will be aware, I am meeting my Oireachtas colleagues today for a briefing session with a view to progressing the Bill to Committee Stage in the Seanad as soon as possible. I look forward to working with Members of this House and of the Seanad in order that all of us who wish to see this Bill implemented as soon as possible can work together to achieve that goal.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	39	The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill will, quite correctly, give adopted persons, birth parents and relatives a legal right to an information and tracing service. It is frustrating that the legislation has not been progressed in the past 12 months. I am not saying there is a particular reason for that. We are all aware the process is clogged up. Has the Minister spoken to the Attorney General or has he provided a legal position, information or guidance on this very complex matter? There are the issues relating to the rights of birth parents and those of the adopted persons. A bridge needs to be built and we must find a pathway to enable us to enact this valuable legislation. Has the Minister heard from the Attorney General on this?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	40	I have spoken to the Attorney General twice in the past month - I also had engagement with the previous Attorney General - largely in the context of the urgency of this matter. A number of amendments will have to be brought forward on Committee Stage. There are two areas that are the most difficult to resolve and I have been working with Senators and hearing their responses in respect of these. In terms of the advice I am receiving, the first of these relates to the compelling reasons as to why birth mother information should not be released and what is the constitutional issue in that regard. I have also received advice regarding the introduction of an undertaking or a statutory duty on the part of all persons involved committing to not contact other parties unless they agree to be contacted. Those are the two primary issues that still have not been resolved. In terms of meeting advocates and my colleagues, I am trying to push the boundaries as far as we can in order to ensure that the apparent conflict of rights can be resolved so that we can get the Bill implemented as soon as possible.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	41	I agree with the Minister that we have to push boundaries if we want to enact this legislation. It might not be perfect at the start of that process but it needs to move forward. What she announced two weeks ago was not new because this legislation has been around in various guises. There is a need to progress to Committee Stage. Has the Attorney General given the Minister any guidance or will he give the Oireachtas committee guidance on the way we can work with her to move forward with the legislation? It is urgently required and there is frustration about the lack of progress on it. We must have empathy for the parties on both sides. How can we all work together to get this legislation through?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	42	I appreciate the Deputy's comments. I would make two points. First, in light of the announcement that was made, things have shifted considerably in terms of there being a wider public awareness. That is not to say there was not awareness or that many people were not shocked. In light of that growing public awareness, the number of people who are contacting me and the stories we are hearing in the media and in different forums have ensured there is a greater urgency for all of us to get this resolved as soon as possible. It has also perhaps changed the context a little in that we should have more space to ensure that what we are doing is right and good in terms of that conflict of rights. The Attorney General and his officials are open to meeting me and my officials in the context of what I learn from the Deputy and the advocates to consider these issues as we move forward, perhaps even in a more intensive way than was the case in the past.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16625	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	43	My question relates to Scouting Ireland. Has the Minister been provided with an update on the work of Ms van Turnhout on her assessment of the governance of Scouting Ireland?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	44	In April of this year I decided to withhold all further funding to Scouting Ireland until such time as I could be satisfied that the organisation's governance standards met the required level. This followed publicity surrounding an incident of alleged sexual assault and concerns raised about how this serious matter was handled by Scouting Ireland. Having made my decision to withhold funding, I met representatives from Scouting Ireland on 19 April to discuss the standards of governance within the organisation. The leadership of Scouting Ireland provided assurances to me at that meeting that they were involved in a governance project and reforms in the way they do their work. The project focused in particular on governance at board level. They informed me that these reforms would be put to their membership at a meeting this month. In May, as Deputy Sherlock referenced, I appointed Ms Jillian van Turnhout as an independent expert to examine governance and related issues within Scouting Ireland. In accordance with her terms of reference, she was asked to provide me with a clear assessment of Scouting Ireland's governance arrangements, including the organisation's plan to improve governance. She is completing her assessment and I expect to have her final report shortly. I will examine the content of the report carefully. I need to be satisfied that Scouting Ireland is taking the necessary steps to provide the assurances I need. Based on the outcome I will make a decision about the restoration of funding. I cannot and will not compromise on issues that impact on the safety of children. Scouting Ireland must be in compliance with the legal requirements of the Children First Act 2015 and related legislation. I want scouts and parents throughout the country to know that I and the Government have a strong regard for the organisation and the generosity and dedication of the 13,000 adult volunteers involved. I want to acknowledge that Scouting Ireland provides exceptional engagement for the 40,000 children and young people who are members nationwide. In light of this and following the final report I will be in a position to make a decision.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16625	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	45	I welcome the Minister's response. I understand that the Minister cannot give us an exact date by which she will receive the report. I hope she will keep the House and individual Members who have a particular interest informed on this issue. Moreover, I hope that when the report comes before her, she will keep an open door in communicating with us. I fully accept the Minister's answer. Has the Minister been made aware of the fact that there are many good people within Scouting Ireland who believe they have not been communicated with with regard to some of the governance or change management procedures under way currently, especially in respect of the proposed new national structure? I have written to the Minister and asked if she would communicate with Ms van Turnhout with a view to hearing from reasonable and rational voices within Scouting Ireland who wish to make their views known officially to Ms van Turnhout on some of the concerns they have in respect of the current process. Will the Minister do her best through her good offices to facilitate that, please?

The staff and board have been engaging in and trying to finalise a reform process in recent months and weeks. I received the email in question and I have asked my officials to pass it on to Ms van Turnhout and for her to take account of the contents in making her decisions in that regard. As Deputies are aware, Ms van Turnhout is an independent person working with the organisation. I believe the most appropriate course was to send her Deputy Sherlock's request and to bring it to her attention. We are all conscious of the fact that time is passing, that there is a funding issue and that these things need to be resolved as soon as possible.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16625	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	47	We are very much aware that there is a funding issue and that there are time constraints as well. However, it is vital that the vast bulk of the ordinary members of Scouting Ireland, the people who volunteer at weekends, have confidence in the process that is under way. Everyone is mindful of the fact that taxpayers' money is being used to fund this organisation. Everyone within the organisation bar none must have absolute confidence in the process under way at the moment. It is important because certain voices have not been heard heretofore and they should be heard.

That is why I have taken action in respect of the information he has shared with me. Decisions need to be made in that regard. As the Deputy is aware, these questions are being raised by some people who are coming to him. My understanding is that there is ongoing communication between the members, staff and the board on this reform project. Perhaps some people believe that they need to have more of a voice in respect of what is going on there. I hear what the Deputy is saying in that regard. My understanding following my meeting with the organisation is that it undertook a long and engaged process. It is a membership organisation and that is how it has decided to approach the matter. Again, I am happy that the Deputy has raised these issues and I have passed them on.

Will the Minister make a statement on the matter?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	50	Deputy Rabbitte is speaking particularly about the two-year preschool ECCE programme. I am satisfied in recent years at the way in which the ECCE service has been delivered, especially by the providers. As time has moved on we have increased the number and time period within which the service is available to children throughout the country. I am satisfied that the planning has been undertaken by the Department in concert with the providers. There is terrific engagement and ongoing communication with providers through the early years forum that I established and these features were evident prior to the forum as well. They are also evident through Pobal's engagement in identifying the number of places required in the various parts of the country and the ways in which providers are offering the services. Some participate in the ECCE scheme while others participate in the ECCE scheme and provide after-school services as well. There is a need to build more places and spaces as more children are born in various parts of the country. That is why we continue to roll out the capital investment programme. There is increasing need on the part of providers to ensure that continuing professional development is provided for. Again, that is why the Department has offered increases in the learner development fund. The service is largely demand-led. Certain statistics can lead us in that regard but I am confident that we will continue to do the work that has been done in recent years.

I tabled that question following the capital grants announced in the past week. I referred specifically to Mountbellew Community Childcare Centre. I may have referred to Mountbellew Community Childcare Centre on the floor already. The centre is like many others in that it is in a rural area but can supply a service to areas like Galway or Athlone.This year that crèche has been oversubscribed in the sense it will have to let go three staff because it cannot facilitate 16 children this year as it was not fortunate enough in getting a capital grant. In the past the crèche had used a national school room but because the numbers have grown in the national school room it now does not have the space. It is a community crèche in which the Government invested heavily. I have a concern around capacity. There is a capacity issue in my colleague Deputy Smyth's constituency of Cavan-Monaghan as well. It is not just in isolated areas; we have issues around it and I wonder how we can address it.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	52	I accept what Deputy Rabbitte is saying that clearly there are certain areas where capacity is not completely being met. My answer initially was generally in terms of the way we are planning and delivering. The difficulty and challenge has to do with the demand. Who can ever predict how many children will be born etc. except that we do our best? There are predictions but how accurate they are and how well we can work in each county and each context with the needs of each particular crèche and provider is the issue. I appreciate that. I am not necessarily saying that there are not places and times such as the incident Deputy Rabbitte mentioned or the one in Deputy Smyth's vicinity as there will be those problems, but the best we can do is to engage, to hear that and to see how to resolve that - as the Deputy knows there can be lots of different reasons why capacity cannot be extended in those different settings - and that is the promise I make and I know the way my officials continue to work with others.

In fairness, Deputy Sherlock has been here all day and I have to take his Question No. 45. I will abandon the 30 seconds for introducing the question.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16625	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	55	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for being a fair-minded and decent man. I am asking the Minister whether she is satisfied that the school completion programme is operating effectively.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	56	I thank the Deputy. As he is aware, the school completion programme has been under review. It has been identified that reforms are required and Tusla has been working on proposals and analysis of how that needs to be the case. I have received those. I have been engaged in a very intensive and deep process of trying to identify the best possible way to move forward in terms of the issues of human resources, governance and the programmes that are delivered themselves. I am in the middle of that process and I want to get it right. That is the first thing. Second, in the context of the acknowledgement of the need for reform, at the same time I have met with a number of school completion co-ordinators, their principals and other members of the schools both in my constituency and throughout the country and I believe that in the circumstances and in the context of that acknowledged need for reform, they are continuing to do an excellent job with the students and the people they serve.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16625	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	57	I am not satisfied with that answer, to be very honest about it. There are 470-odd primary schools. There have been cuts in counselling services. We have heard wonderful words like "review" and "reform" but I have not heard anything that I can say is meaningful. The school completion programme is not operating properly currently: it is operating sub-optimally. We need to hear something a little bit more robust and definitive from the Minister on what she is actually doing. She has had reports, proposals and analysis on HR and governance. I and the House want a straight answer to this question on what exactly it is that the Minister proposes to do. What is the current budget? Are there further cuts proposed to the school completion programme? Will there be an increase in the budget? How is it proposed to recruit more staff for the school completion programme? I have not heard any of that from the Minister in the reply.

We are getting close to making some decisions in terms of a different type of engagement in that regard. Second, on governance, these are the issues that are still in front of me, working with principals and stakeholders. As the Deputy knows, I have held a number of meetings. I do not have a magic wand to say that right now there are changes that I am ready to go with but that does not mean that we are not working on them. This issue has been around for a long time and we will get it right and that is what I am determined to do.

The Government is committed to supporting parents in caring for young children at home in a range of ways. Within the remit of my Department, a number of schemes provide support to parents whether they work full time, part time, or stay at home. For example, from September of 2018 all children aged from two years and eight months will be entitled to access two years of free preschool through the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme. Some 114,000 children are expected to benefit this September, many of whom will be children of stay-at-home parents. The current targeted childcare schemes are available to families where parents are in receipt of certain social welfare payments or medical cards, again many of whom are stay-at-home parents. A universal childcare subsidy is available to all parents of children under three, regardless of whether parents are working or not. The affordable childcare scheme, ACS, which is under development, will make childcare subsidies available on the basis of family income and will be available to stay-at-home parents. More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents. A child benefit payment of €140 per month is available to all children. Budget 2018 increased the home carer tax credit to €1,200 per year. There has also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years. Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016. In 2017, there was an extension to maternity leave and benefit to mothers of babies born prematurely. Currently, my Department is also drafting a cross-Government early years strategy. The strategy will include a range of measures to support families given the fundamental importance they play in shaping children’s outcomes. I look forward to updating the House on those developments later this year.

It would be good if we could be updated, particularly on budget policy because we are in the middle of the budget process now in the sense that Departments are negotiating with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on whatever comes in October. Is the Minister looking for any major initiatives other than the existing ones in this budget process? If there are, how will she ensure that it will not make it difficult for parents who want to stay at home in terms of creating an environment where increasingly the incentives promote a different approach? It is not that people are pitting one parent against the other, far from it. Every family and parent needs support in their own circumstances but when we have a system that disproportionately favours one choice over another there is a concern that it makes it difficult to take that choice. Can the Minister give any indication within the budget process, separate to the early years strategy, whether she expects to introduce measures in this year's budget and if so can she give some outline as to what those new additional measures might be?

Any increase in the home tax credit would be important. Like him, I would like to hear about any further measures the Minister has to help and facilitate parents to do a valued job. Is the Minister in discussion with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on any measures she might introduce for stay-at-home parents?

I have done that because of the value the Government places on parenting and the provision of support by families for children. I have been asked questions about this year's budget and other measures. I have begun initial discussions with the Minister for Finance but I am in the middle of them and I will not indicate right now all of the measures I am trying to secure. I am committed to providing supports for all families, including those with stay-at-home parents. The child care infrastructure I have set up enables women to have the choice to move into the workforce and have their children cared for. Many women do not have that choice given the current expensive cost of child care. There is potential to improve the measures for stay-at-home parents, particularly in relation to what we have identified as ways of supporting families and children in the upcoming early years strategy. We recently had an open debate about that. I will publish the strategy later.

It focuses on those at risk of developing poor outcomes. At the core of the initiative is a desire to foster persistent curiosity among those working to improve the lives of children and young people. The QCBI aims to support key groups working with children, young people and families to know what works, how it works and to provide an evidence-supported approach to the application of this work. The QCBI innovation fund, amounting to €2 million, was developed by my Department to support prevention and early intervention innovations that build on existing data and evidence. We aim to improve outcomes for children and young people aged up to 24 years who experience disadvantage. All proposals are expected to have a strong professional development and-or coaching and mentoring component. Four applications were made from County Kildare: Foróige - the Strengthening Families programme for Kildare and west Wicklow; County Kildare Leader partnership - Mojo project to support young men; Kildare Youth Services and Curragh and Newbridge Garda youth diversion project; and Kilcullen community childcare and education centre - breakfast and afterschool service expansion. Each individual application has been assessed against the transparent criteria outlined in the guidance document. The outcome of each application will depend on the quality and proposed impact of the initiative outlined in the application form, the ability of the measure to support diverse innovations across a range of community, contexts and practice areas and the number of quality proposals received. All the applications received under this funding measure have been assessed by an expert evaluation panel assigned by the Department. Our aim is to notify applicants by the end of this month.

I previously raised with her the fact that County Kildare is playing catch-up in terms of investment in what is one of the largest youth populations of any county. As the Minister will have witnessed during her visit to County Kildare to open The Hive youth facility in Kildare town when she met all the agencies and groups, there is good collaboration between them and they work well together. The application from Foróige is an example of that in that it involves Foróige leading the project on behalf of an inter-agency group to create a dedicated and co-ordinated post to further develop the Strengthening Families programme. I launched the evaluation for the programme last year. It works and we must be able to extend it and provide it in other locations. The application from the Kildare Leader programme is for the Mojo project. Young men aged between 18 and 24 are getting involved in it with an open mind as it does not have the stigma attaching to HSE-run projects. The Mojo project is working well in Kildare town and it was previously in Athy. We need the project in Newbridge, in particular, and in other locations. The Kildare Youth Services educational support programme for early school leavers is important, as is the Kilcullen community childcare facility, which does fantastic work in the greater Kilcullen area. The inter-agency collaboration in Kildare must be recognised. Any money the Department gives to the four projects will be well spent and well received by the large youth population we have in the county.

It sounds like the applicant organisations can meet the criteria but, as he will be aware, I am not the one who makes the judgment in that regard. This particular initiative was largely focused on looking at innovative projects for children and young people and how we can use what we have learnt from our history to assist them in the future. Significant resources are being expended on projects but I believed it was important to continue the innovation alongside that, which is why we set €2 million aside. That is the reason the projects outlined by the Deputy and other Deputies who are present have had the opportunity to access the additional money for ongoing innovation.

One of the principal goals of the 2018 early years and school age capital programmes, as in previous years, has been to assist childcare providers in creating new additional places where demand for those exists. The decisions in respect of the 2018 capital funding programmes were delivered to providers on 1 June, following a thorough and impartial appraisal process overseen by my Department. A total of 398 individual services throughout the country have been offered funding as a result, to a total value of €6.87 million. A total of €3.87 million of that amount has been allocated for the creation of new early years places in 85 separate projects. This funding will result in the creation of a total of 1,950 new places nationwide - 697 of which will be for zero to three year-olds, and 1,253 of which will ECCE places. In addition, €750,000 has been allocated for the creation of new school age childcare places in 45 separate projects. This funding will result in the creation of 807 new places in school age services. The 2018 capital programmes generated extraordinary demand within the sector. As a result, only applications of the highest quality were successful on this occasion. However, services that narrowly missed out on funding have been added to a short capital reserve list. Those will be considered for funding in the event that any of the successful applicants are not in a position to use their funding. I am pleased at the level of interest in developing early years and school age places. I would like to continue this type of capital funding in 2019 and beyond, in order that we meet the demand for places in the coming years. I will carefully consider the level and quality of sectoral demand for all strands of funding, as well as all constructive feedback on this year's programmes in the development of capital funding for 2019.

In any grant scheme there will be some disappointed applicants.In previous replies the Minister gave a commitment to have a widespread consultation with both community childcare providers and private childcare providers on the 2019 capital grant scheme. More grant aid is required to assist in the expansion of some existing childcare facilities. Some such facilities in my own area, particularly the community childcare facilities, need to literally double capacity to meet demand. I ask the Minister to try to put in place a scheme with larger-scale grant assistance to make it realistic, obtainable and feasible for community childcare providers in particular to extend and enhance existing facilities and meet the demand that exists in their localities. In a substantial town in my constituency, there is only one community childcare provider. It has to double its capacity and it is looking forward to the Minister announcing a scheme with larger-scale grant assistance later this year.

One of my absolute priorities is to ensure there are enough moneys for a capital provision in order to increase the capacity for the childcare infrastructure I am overseeing. The consultation and engagement with stakeholders is really critical, and I believe my Department does a very good job at that. I am very happy to take note of what the Deputy has said in terms of his particular area and projects there he wishes to represent, and we can engage further with him on that. However, the commitment to increasing the capital available is integral to my work as a Minister and that is why, in terms of the negotiations with the Minister for Finance on the national development plan, significant funding will be available as we move forward in terms of capital investment in childcare places.

Before so doing, I remind Members that during Leader's Questions yesterday, a number of Members sought clarification as to whether it is in order to raise in the House a matter that is currently before a judicial tribunal or commission of investigation. As Members may be aware, Standing Order 59 deals with matters that are sub judice. This is drafted in such as way as to protect the ability of Members to discuss issues of general public importance, even in circumstances where there are proceedings before a judicial tribunal. However, in paragraph 3 it clearly stipulates that "a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the Dáil to encroach on the functions of the Courts or a Judicial Tribunal". It also places an onus on Members to avoid, if at all possible, comment which might, in effect, prejudice the outcome of proceedings. My predecessors have ruled on this issue previously and in certain circumstances have allowed very limited discussions on matters of public importance, which were being examined by judicial tribunals. In applying Standing Order 59, a delicate balance is to be achieved between, on the one hand, a matter of general public importance to be raised, and on the other ensuring that there is no overt encroachment on the work of a judicial body. It is a balancing exercise that must be conducted on a case-by-case basis, which respects the role of parliamentarians to discuss matters of general public importance, the rights of persons appearing before a tribunal to a fair hearing and the ability of a tribunal to complete its work expeditiously and in accordance with due process. As Chair, my role in applying Standing Order 59 is to ensure that the functions of courts and judicial tribunals are fully respected by this House, and I look forward to the continued co-operation of all Members in that regard. 
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	72	I thank An Ceann Comhairle for that clarification on Standing Orders. Before I start, on my own behalf and on behalf of Fianna Fáil, I wish to extend deepest sympathies to the family of the late Rory Kiely, the former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, who passed away this morning. He was a very popular Member of these Houses and a legend in GAA administration. He was chairman of the Limerick county board, and this could be Limerick's year in many ways; the team is doing very well so far. Mr. Kiely was enjoying the hurling this summer. He was also a former chairman of the Munster council. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis. We will have an opportunity at a later stage to give longer tributes.  The Irish public has been genuinely shocked at the CervicalCheck scandal and the treatment of the women at its heart, in terms of non-disclosure in particular, which has resulted in women being forced through the courts. Without the bravery of Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhathúna and others we may never have known the full extent of what transpired. The drip-drip release of information from the Department of Health, the HSE and CervicalCheck via the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Health compounded that sense of shock and anger. Promises were made, perhaps in haste, in terms of a redress scheme that has not fully been realised, support packages, and mediation which would avoid the necessity of people going to court. We learned this morning that a fourth very ill woman is in court at the moment on this very issue. We were also promised a scoping inquiry that would conclude at the end of June. The progress report produced by Dr. Gabriel Scally will add to that anger and frustration, particularly regarding the manner in which documentation was released by the various bodies, namely, the Department of Health, the HSE and CervicalCheck. More than 4,000 documents were released over two days between 6 June and 8 June and documentation was provided in a format that was essentially unsearchable according to Dr. Scally. He stated it was disappointing and unclear why documents that originally were prepared in electronic format were not available to the inquiry in that format.  Those factors will add to the anger and sense of shock that people feel already about this issue. It should be remembered that the Minister himself was only told about the Vicky Phelan case very late in the day. Indeed, we learned about the substantive and intensive negotiations and discussions between all the bodies for over two years on this issue. There is a discernible pattern in this regard. Dr. Scally is now saying that he will conclude his report by the end of the summer. I have doubts as to whether he will, given the terms of reference and the amount of work he has to do. The Dáil is adjourning on 12 July, which I do not agree with. I believe we should consider whether that is the best course of action. Will the Taoiseach consider cutting to the chase by rolling the Scally inquiry into a commission of investigation?At the current rate of progress, we are looking at a commission of investigation starting in November if we are lucky. Putting Dr. Scally and his team on a statutory basis in the form of a commission of investigation might be the most effective way to give teeth to the investigation and to ensure there is no more messing, no more withholding of documentation and no more of the kind of stuff that has gone on so far.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	73	This is a difficult and emotive issue and has caused concern throughout the country, not just among people who have been affected and their families, but among women in general, and women, in particular, who avail of cervical screening. I believe the Government has taken a lot actions in a swift manner. We established a serious incident management team to go into CervicalCheck and deal with the issues there. We established a scoping inquiry, asked Dr. Scally to do his work, and secured agreement on a cross-party basis for the terms of reference of the inquiry. We secured agreement with doctors to enable women to have a free visit to their GP and a repeat smear test if they felt that was necessary or wanted that done for reassurance. We have appointed a team comprising members of the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology. This team is going back over all of the old slides and smear tests of the women affected to make sure they are quality assured and to find out if abnormalities were missed and if there were abnormalities that should not have been missed. We have also put in place a package of practical supports for women and their families, extending from medical cards to access to experimental medicines, assistance with childcare and so on. Delivery of that is still under way, and in each case it is a tailored package. Public health nurses and others have met individually with women and their families to discuss with them what type of supports they want. Because the supports are individual and tailored, it is taking time to put them in place, but that is very much under way. In addition, we have accepted Dr. Scally's recommendation for a payment to be made to women right away to cover some of their expenses arising from dealing with his inquiry. We have also confirmed the Government's decision to move to a more modern form of cervical screening using human papillomavirus, HPV, as the primary test. That was planned anyway, but we are going to press ahead and become one of the first countries in the western world to do it.  Dr. Scally was appointed by the Government to do this work, and the terms of reference were agreed by the Oireachtas. Should it be the case that anyone obstructs the work of Dr. Scally, they will also be obstructing the Government. I want to make it very clear to any agency or public body, if it is not already, that we expect full co-operation with Dr. Scally and his team and will accept nothing less than that. The Minister for Health met Dr. Scally in recent days to assure him that if he runs into any further issues, he has a direct line to the Minister to deal with them. I note from yesterday's statement that while he expressed enormous frustration with the speed at which he received documentation and the format it came in, he said he was broadly content with the interaction he was having.  Regarding the Deputy's suggestion of rolling this into a commission of inquiry, we would have to give that proper consideration. One of the advantages of having a scoping inquiry is that even though it was only set up a few weeks ago, we already have a progress report, an interim report and findings and recommendations related to one of the terms of reference. Those recommendations are in the process of being implemented. While it is intended to have a commission of investigation once Dr. Scally has finished his work, it is important to bear in mind the consequences of such a commission. If we had set up a commission of investigation set up, we would not have had that progress. We would probably find that the investigation would run much more slowly and that, because of the statutory nature, everyone would have a lawyer. We have found on a number of occasions that it takes months to set commissions of inquiry up and a year or two years before they complete their work and produce findings and recommendations. The point of the Scally inquiry was to have initial an scoping inquiry to quickly find out as much as we could and do as much as we could before a commission was set up, because that will probably take more than a year if not two or three, as they always do. Many women, unfortunately and sadly, do not have that time.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	77	I thought it would take me a minute to give the expression of sympathy at the beginning, which I did not get. However, I take the Ceann Comhairle's point. The problem is that this process will take much longer. I am curious that the Taoiseach used the phrase ,"while it is intended", in respect of setting up a commission of investigation. Is he committed to setting up such a commission or not? We need to know. Dr. Scally's report states one may be established, whereas the foreword refers to his work as a scoping inquiry prior to the establishment of a commission of investigation. I have great time for Dr. Scally. I do not know the man, but he is working earnestly and so on. However, a statutory inquiry provides teeth. There is a pattern here. The Taoiseach's own Minister did not know what was going on about this issue because he had not been told. The Committee of Public Accounts had to drag fairly basic documentation out of the Department and the HSE. Officials had been discussing this for two years, yet information could not be made available to the Oireachtas or the Minister until the committee forced it out of them. We now have 4,000 documents that were sent over two days in an unsearchable format. Does that not ring alarm bells? We need to consider - and I ask the Taoiseach to consider this - whether it would be more effective to roll it into a statutory commission, rather than waiting for until November or December to get to the end of this inquiry and moving on to a commission of investigation.

I do not want there to be any ambiguity about that. Members have a lot of faith in Dr. Scally. He has done a good job so far and many of the women with whom he has been in contact have a lot of faith in him. He has asked that he be allowed more time to conduct his scoping inquiry. It is appropriate that we allow him that time, particularly because he wants to engage individually with more of the women affected and their families. Of course that is going to take a bit of time. I have not spoken to him personally, but Dr. Scally has said to the Government that he believes that he can finish this work by the end of the summer. We should allow him to do that. This is a scoping inquiry, which will get to a lot of the facts and make a lot of recommendations, which we can then implement immediately. We will then move on to the commission of investigation. Even if we were now to decide to fold the work into a commission of investigation, we would still need a scoping exercise anyway. That has been necessary in the past. The best way we can get answers, results, recommendations and action quickly is to allow Dr. Scally to do what he has been asked to do by the end of the summer and allow him to produce his recommendations along the way, which he is doing. My apologies for going over time again.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	79	On Friday 8 December, the Taoiseach told the Irish people that the backstop agreement was "rock solid and cast iron" and that his Government "protected what it sought to protect and achieved what it sought to achieve". Paragraph 46 of the December joint report states the agreement is "made and must be upheld in all circumstances, irrespective of the nature of any future agreement between the European Union and United Kingdom." Paragraph 49 states that while it is Britain's intention to achieve these objectives through an overall relationship with the EU, which every Member will support, the UK will propose "specific solutions to address the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland" - or a backstop - should this not be possible. If there was no agreement between Britain and the European Union on trade, there is some certainty for businesses on either side of the Border and for the people in Ireland that there would be as much alignment as possible with the rules of the customs union and Single Market.  The Taoiseach's cast-iron guarantee is in tatters. A paper was published by the British Government a couple of days ago which essentially took the backstop off the table and turned it into a UK-wide extension of the implementation period. It is time-limited, and as Mr. Michel Barnier said, "Backstop means backstop". We have an extraordinary situation where we had something on the table that was a real and tangible political agreement, but that has been turned into something entirely different because of internal wrangling in the Tory party. We have to hold the Taoiseach to account, and the best way to do so is on the promises he makes and the benchmarks he sets. He said this was cast iron. How could he say that if there is still wrangling over what it all means, and the British Government has come back with proposals which essentially take it off the table? The Taoiseach also said that he wanted to see real and substantial progress by June.Nobody could argue with a straight face that we have seen real and substantial progress. In fact, it is quite the opposite because we have gone backwards. However, the Taoiseach is prepared to allow the farce to continue whereby the Irish issues are now in the melting pot in what will be very tough negotiations when the real pressure comes on in October. That is not what we were told; it is not what we were promised. The Taoiseach knows my party wants the Government to succeed on this issue because we all want the best for Ireland. We are in a very difficult place, however. What will be the Government's approach at the June summit? Will the Taoiseach hold firm to the commitment he made and will he ensure that there will not be any moving on from these issues until we get the real and substantial progress we were promised?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	80	Yes, we will hold firm to the commitments we made and we expect the United Kingdom Government and others to hold firm to the commitments they made. In December, a political agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union that gives us a number of guarantees and assurances - for example, on the common travel area, for ongoing PEACE funding for Northern Ireland and Border areas and with regard to citizens' rights - was reached. I do not think anyone is doubting these at present. They are all very much cast-iron guaranteed. I also used the term "bulletproof" regarding commitments on the Border. In addition, I said it was the end of the beginning and not the beginning of the end, that we needed to be vigilant and that we had to insist that the guarantees we were given were written into the withdrawal agreement. That is where matters stand. In March, the European Union - all 27 member states together backed by the EU institutions - produced a draft text of the withdrawal agreement, including a protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland, that put in legal form everything we achieved and secured in December. Last week, the United Kingdom Government produced a paper which represents a small step in the right direction but which I do not believe to be adequate. It is at very best a partial solution to part of the problem. It deals with customs, which is welcome, but not with regulatory alignment, which is essential to avoiding a hard border. In many cases, perhaps not all, regulatory alignment will be required. Even though it is not in the written text of the UK's amendment, it seems to imply that there would be an expiry date sometime in 2021. This is not something we can accept. The whole point of a backstop is that it implies it will exist unless and until there is a new treaty between the EU and the UK that makes it unnecessary. That is where we need further movement and concessions from the UK Government between now and the forthcoming summit. If we do not get it then, quite frankly, nobody will be able to say that sufficient progress has been made. We will need to intensify the negotiations in the months ahead to ensure that happens. What the European Union is very firm on is that we are not going to be in a position to discuss long-term issues, such as the new trading relationship and the new arrangements that will exist between the UK and EU, until such time as the withdrawal agreement and the backstop are agreed.

That is the issue. We said in December that this is simply a political agreement - and, yes, that is important and substantial - and we welcomed the progress that was made. However, we were also wise and advised the Taoiseach not oversell the agreement and to work on getting the legal clarity and framework that would provide certainty. The reality is - I think this is genuinely lost on the Taoiseach - that the British Government has essentially taken the cast-iron guarantee off the table. In the paper it has written the British Government has restructured matters in order to write the North out of the script and turn what is a backstop or permanent solution in the event of no deal into an extension of the negotiating period. What will happen in the event that there is no deal? What will happen then for Ireland? The paper published by the British Government does not say that, it says it is time-limited. This is a real problem. We have to hold Taoiseach to account and the way to do so in the context of this issue is to encourage him to hold the British Government to account and to ensure that the latter does not resile on commitments it gave in December. The Taoiseach and his European Union counterparts do this at the forthcoming summit. While the Taoiseach says that this will happen, what real and substantial progress needs to be made - separate from what is in the paper published by the British Government - between now and the summit for him to be able to say that real and sufficient progress has been made?

We secured a political agreement in December and we will secure a legal withdrawal agreement by October. That is exactly what I am focused on and what the Tánaiste and all of our teams are focused on also. That is what we intend to do. We need to bear in mind that dealing with Brexit is not solely a matter of considering North-South issues and Northern Ireland issues. They are of paramount importance because they are issues of national interest, but the east-west element is also important. If someone is a farmer, involved in the agrifood sector or involved in tourism, a small Irish SME that exports to the UK or a big multinational company exporting to the UK, actually having the latter in a customs arrangement or customs partnership with the European Union is to our advantage. That must be borne in mind. If the UK can produce solutions that allow us to avoid a hard border, not just North and South but also east-west, that is positive.

Thankfully, we are not used to such events happening. In the aftermath of what happened, I assisted other locals in organising a very large public meeting that was held in Cahersiveen. It was attended by many public representatives and, very importantly, by our Garda superintendent, Flor Murphy, from Killarney Garda station and the local sergeant, Michael Murphy. We appreciated very much their attendance because the locals want to work with the local gardaí. More than 500 people were at the meeting, which was a great testament to the concerns the locals have about the well-being of their area. The area comprising Cahersiveen and south Kerry in general - including places such as Sneem, Castlecove, Caherdaniel, Waterville, Ballinskelligs, Portmagee, Valentia Island, Glenbeigh and Foilmore - is beautiful. We want to protect it and make it as safe a place as it always has been for the people who live there and those who visit. It is probably the most beautiful part not just of Ireland but of the western world and we want it to stay that way. Unfortunately, as was identified at the meeting to which I refer, more resources are needed. We had our own dedicated superintendent in the Garda station in question for many years. We had more gardaí available there for many years. We had a second sergeant. I welcome the fact the very able, capable and hard-working local sergeant will be assisted by another sergeant in the near future. However, I want the second sergeant to be put in place as soon as possible. Serious consideration should be given to putting a full-time superintendent back into south Kerry because the superintendent, Flor Murphy, has an amazing amount of work to do in the Killarney area due to the fact that it is so busy. It is my humble opinion, and that of the locals, that having to cover south Kerry and Cahersiveen is too much of a workload for one person. There is a great case to be made for putting a second superintendent back in the locality. The people there deserve this. On the night in question, 500 people turned up at the meeting. I appreciate the fact that local gardaí and the superintendent were present and answered all of the questions put to them. The people want reassurance. They want to ensure that their children will be safe. I compliment the Garda because a number of raids have been carried out since the meeting took place and these have resulted in illegal drugs being found and confiscated. We appreciate that very much. In the past, we have been let down in the context of resources. Gardaí are doing excellent work but they need more assistance and more resources to be made available to them.

I extend my condolences to their families and to the Fianna Fáil Party. There will be a time in the future when we will be able to give more lengthy tributes to those two men who gave great service to our country and our politics. I thank Deputy Michael Healy-Rae for raising this important issue, which I know is of great concern in south Kerry. I agree with him that south Kerry is surely one of the most beautiful parts of Ireland and, indeed, the world. I will long remember my days as Minister of Transport, Tourism and Sport and being able to spend a lot of time in Kerry and experiencing the beauty of that particular county. I am of course aware of the brutal murder of Mr. Robert Elston, who died after receiving serious stab wounds following an altercation in Cahersiveen on 23 May, and the Minister for Justice and Equality has briefed me on the matter. I understand the Garda immediately mounted a full investigation that has led to an individual being charged and brought before the courts. The Deputy will appreciate that as it is now a matter before the courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment much further. However, this reprehensible act destroyed a family and has, understandably, left the community of Cahersiveen and wider south Kerry in complete shock. I know the House will join me in extending our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Mr. Elston. As the Deputy mentioned, a large public meeting took place in Cahersiveen on 5 June, with members of the community coming together to voice their concerns, particularly in light of recent events. I understand members of An Garda Síochána were also in attendance to listen to the contributions. The Government remains committed to ensuring An Garda Síochána has the necessary resources to tackle all forms of crime in our communities, including in south Kerry. Approximately €1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda for 2018, which will lead to investment in new equipment, whether it is information and communications technology, cars or other vehicles. It also means we will have 600 more gardaí than when this Government of Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance and Independents came into office. The manner in which those extra gardaí are to be deployed is of course a matter for the Garda Commissioner and it is up to him to decide where superintendents, inspectors and gardaí should be located. The best people to determine such matters are the gardaí who provide the services.

I asked him to comment solely on the resources. In speaking about extra recruits coming from Templemore, I point out that when recruits come, they can only go to a number of places. They are Killarney and Tralee, and they are not allowed to go to Cahersiveen or places like Listowel. New gardaí are welcome but I want there to be more dedicated gardaí put into the Cahersiveen Garda station. It is only right, sensible and prudent, taking into account the vast area, and having our own dedicated superintendent, as we had in the past, is justified. When they were there before, they were not idle and they had plenty to do. They will have plenty to do again in keeping law and order in the locality. It is what the locals and visitors deserve. People who have businesses and who have families only want to live their lives and raise those families in a safe and happy environment, as it was before. We want it to be such a place again in future.

The Killarney district has 107 gardaí assigned to it, including one superintendent and 18 gardaí are assigned to Cahersiveen Garda station. They can call on back-up from national regional units, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support unit and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. As of 31 March, there were also 55 vehicles from the Garda fleet allocated to the Kerry division. I appreciate that the Deputy's specific request has been made sincerely. As I stated, it is ultimately up to the Garda Commissioner to decide where gardaí should be located, how they should be deployed and the different ranks involved. Given that this is such a serious matter and I know the Deputy is so sincere, I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to relay the request to the Garda Commissioner for his consideration.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	87	A year ago this week the Taoiseach took office and told us of his vision of a republic of opportunities. That anniversary coincides with a visit from the UN special rapporteur on adequate housing, Ms Leilani Farha. Ms Farha had one clear message, which is that Ireland is failing abysmally when it comes to housing. The Taoiseach speaks of the republic of opportunities but this morning, the Ombudsman for Children speaks of thousands of children being denied the most basic opportunities. The ombudsman described the position of almost 10,000 people in emergency accommodation, saying it was "shameful", which it is of course. There are no opportunities for those struggling to keep a roof over their head and there are certainly no opportunities for those with no roof over their head. It is all about survival. I have no doubt the Taoiseach will point to the Rebuilding Ireland report but Ms Farha clearly pointed out the lack of a coherent housing strategy. The evidence of this has been stark and in the past four years alone, just 818 local authority were built, with 396 of those last year. This happens because Fine Gael's ideology is to focus most of its efforts on the private market approach. A housing seminar hosted by the Simon Communities on Monday heard that, in total, the State had transferred over €1 billion to private landlords in housing supports. This is not a housing strategy but is a market-led approach designed to put the State at arm's distance from responsibility. We have not enshrined the right to housing either constitutionally or legislatively. It is not a far-fetched concept as 81 other countries have adopted the concept of a right to housing. It does not mean that everyone could demand a house but rather that the State would be obliged to create strategies that would develop housing in a way that ensures affordable and accessible opportunities available to all. It would change the narrative and the focus. Instead of housing being viewed as a commodity, the Government would recommend housing first and foremost as a home. This is not pie in the sky and Ms Farha is able to point to real working examples in countries and cities that have jumped on board with her recommendations. Barcelona is foremost among these with the Barcelona manifesto. Ms Farha has also worked in Portugal, which has implemented housing strategies that aim to eradicate homelessness by 2028. Meanwhile, we are continuing a path that has proven not only to be ineffective but damaging. Does the Taoiseach accept that in the year since he took office, homelessness has worsened and housing has become increasingly inaccessible and unaffordable to both renters and potential purchasers? Has the Taoiseach considered a constitutional or statutory obligation for housing that may be necessary to address what is an unprecedented housing crisis in the country? Will he consider extending a formal State invitation to Ms Farha to visit in an official capacity and work with the Government to develop strategies that will prioritise the delivery of adequate and affordable housing for all?

The Deputy mentioned a legal right to housing and it is currently being considered by the all-party finance committee. I very much have an open mind on this but as the Deputy rightly indicates, 81 countries not only have a statutory right to housing but they have a constitutional right to housing. In many of those countries there are severe housing crises and very serious problems with housing and homelessness. In some cases they are much worse than what we have here. I am sure that a statutory or constitutional right will not build a house for anyone. We need to build more houses and the solution to the problem is increasing housing supply. In the past year the number of planning permission applications increased by 30%, as did the number of commencement notices; 18,000 new homes have commenced construction in the past year.

This would be an important thing to do in the development of strategies. We do not have a coherent housing strategy: we have primarily a market-led and very expensive response. Ms Farha pointed out some very tangible solutions in other areas, first and foremost in respect of the private rental sector and greater supports in that regard. She gave the example of a foreign investor tax to make it less attractive for private equity firms to commandeer vast amounts of housing for profit and put them out of the reach of ordinary citizens. She talked about our Constitution protecting private property but supposedly being balanced by the common good. However, we rarely see the common good coming to the fore when it comes to housing. Will the Taoiseach extend that formal invitation? Furthermore, what strategies to reduce homelessness can he point to that will achieve the development goals to which we signed up?

I know the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has met with Ms Farha. At the time, she had not had the chance to read Rebuilding Ireland, so perhaps, as part of that engagement, we could get her views on Rebuilding Ireland. She certainly said a whole-of-government approach is needed. If I recall correctly, when I heard her interviewed on "Morning Ireland" or on one of the other radio programmes, she pointed out that, very sadly, housing and homelessness issues are a problem being grappled with by governments all over the world. I think she held out Finland as a stand-out country that is doing things differently. Regarding strategies that work, we think the Housing First programme is working. We have appointed a director of Housing First. More than 150 tenancies have now been secured through Housing First. As a result, the most recent figures show a very significant reduction of approximately 40% in rough sleeping on our streets. I think this is in part a reflection of the strategies that are showing some results, but we have much to do.

Part 4 of the Act concerned the facilitation of full open disclosure by medical personnel in our hospitals and in our health service generally. The Act has not yet been commenced. It is a very poor reflection on the Government that we pass legislation and the delay in then commencing the relevant legislation means very little happens. Will the Taoiseach indicate to me when he expects Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act to be commenced and also when the patient safety Bill will be brought before the House?

I will have to check with the Minister for Justice and Equality if it is still on schedule but I have not heard otherwise. It is necessary to do more than pass laws. Open disclosure requires guidelines for staff and training. This is why a commencement order was put on it. One of the many things we have learned from the CervicalCheck controversy is that it is not as simple as policies and laws. A process of open disclosure was embarked on very slowly in respect of CervicalCheck but was mishandled. It was not clear who was to do the telling, for example. The information was passed on to clinicians. One quarter passed it on to the patients; three quarters did not. This one example shows why we need to do much more than just pass new laws; we actually need to train staff and have very clear guidelines as to who is supposed to do what and when.

If he is ready, I wish to make my contribution. The programme for Government contains a commitment to build further capacity in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. Yesterday, the annual report of the Ombudsman for Children was published. It showed there was a shocking shortage of staffing, and the impact on children and young people in the service is highlighted. In my constituency of Waterford, I have met a number of families in recent times who have seen their young children placed in adult psychiatric wards because we do not have the facilities in the region. The report highlights in particular the lack of CAMHS consultants who provide out-of-hours cover in ten HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas, the south east being one. This is absolutely shocking. The Taoiseach's Government, in its programme for Government, committed to increase capacity, yet we have a report from the Ombudsman that says the opposite is happening.

The mental health budget now stands at over €900 million, up €200 million since 2011. The current focus when it comes to child and adult mental health services is on two things. First is the recruitment of 114 assistant psychologists and 22 staff psychologists for primary care services. As it stands, 111 of the 114 have been recruited and are in place as well as 20 of the 22 staff places, so we are doing well on recruitment in that area. Second is the extension of seven-days-a-week services. They already exist in some parts of the country but it is intended to extend them to all parts of the country this year.

The Coalition for Publicly Funded Higher Education has today published its own survey which shows that 90% of people want increased investment in higher education. Last week, we saw the continued fall in the international rankings of Irish universities. The Cassells report has been published but we have no funding plan for the sector yet outlined by Government. The Coalition for Publicly Funded Higher Education has today called for €199 million in next year's budget. The Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, told the student leader of DCU that student loans were off the table. Are student loans off the table? When will the Government outline a clear long-term plan for funding higher education in the State and commit the required funding over time?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23831	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	133	As the Deputy knows, in the last budget we expanded the Exchequer provision by €50 million. We also provided an additional €50 million from the National Training Fund, and in future years we will increase the fund, trebling that amount over the next three years. In addition, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has provided a trebling of our capital budget for higher education over the next four years and, in the context of the longer ten-year period, has provided €2.2 billion, compared with a €100 million provision for a four-year period that was there before that. Therefore, very substantial increased investment is being provided in the higher and further education area.

Higgins recently addressed the International Labour Organization in Geneva and remarked that it was the first international organisation that the Free State joined post-Independence, the implication being a deep-seated commitment to workers' rights that, unfortunately, was not reflected in the actions of the Free State at home, which repressed workers engaged in struggles. Does the Government plan to transpose Article 2 of Convention 98 of the ILO into Irish law? Specifically, I refer to the following: "Acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisation under the domination of employers or employers' organisations...shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference."I raise this in the context of the impending strike tomorrow, organised by members of Mandate at Lloyds Pharmacy, which I and my colleagues fully support. As well as the issues of pay, sick pay and zero-hour contracts, a worrying dimension of the dispute is the bogus company union, funded by the employer, in direct contravention of the aforementioned article.

Behind that story, there are families. One such family company is that of Bobby O'Farrell & Sons, established in Thurles in 1989, and dozens of other small companies, often family-owned, which worked as subcontractors and are not being paid. They are owed huge sums of money, which leaves them unable to pay their suppliers. These are excellent trading companies that employ people, in this case since 1989, and there are many such other companies in Tipperary. We spent years here trying to have the Construction Contracts Act introduced but has it been enacted at all or does it offer any protection for subcontractors? They are the backbone of our economy. They pay the bills and employ people locally and they are the ones that deliver the projects. These big companies could never deliver the projects without the support of these small companies in Tipperary and all over the country.

It is a very serious fallout for those individuals. I have personally expressed my sympathy with them. We have 11 projects which we must now proceed to finish. Some are under the Dutch Infrastructure Fund, DIF, which has the responsibility for retendering. That is at a very advanced stage. In respect of our own school projects, we are drawing up the schedule of costs and will retender. On the protections that have come into those school contracts, they are effective in that they have given subcontractors more rights but they are not 100% foolproof. They provide for more regular payments and they provide rights for the subcontractor to stop or block the contract. Those provisions are effective in giving more protections but as we have seen, they are not 100% effective where a company goes into liquidation.

People want the facts relating to the cytology labs, information related to matters such as the tendering process, the nature of the contracts, the accuracy rates and whether one laboratory might have a higher than average rate of false negatives. Those basic facts from which everything else flows need to be put into the public arena The Taoiseach himself drew a distinction between what he called negligent and innocent false negatives. That is a very important point in respect of how we proceed. It is worrying that the report published yesterday talks about that area as being in the fourth module of the exercise which Dr. Scally is undertaking. Surely that information should be produced first because in its absence, the women affected are left in the dark. They do not know whether their case is as the result of negligence or not. Will the Taoiseach consider discussing that with Dr. Scally and seeking that factual information and the data to be made available as early as possible?

They are saying that this is a big job. We had hoped it could be done within a few weeks but they are telling us it will take a few months. They are the experts, the cytologists and pathologists who know how to do this, and they are saying that it will be a bigger job than anticipated.

Earlier, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae referred to a particular serious homicide in Kerry but it seems as though almost every day of the week sees an appalling murder or homicide. As Deputy Bruton, who is sitting beside the Taoiseach will know, there are areas in constituencies where there is a growing breakdown of law and order. Is it not a culmination of seven and a half years of constant cutbacks in the security services and An Garda Síochána that we now have growing lawlessness? It is astonishing that Fine Gael is presiding over this growing lawlessness and appalling homicides and criminal behaviour. What is the Taoiseach going to do about it?

As is often the case, the Deputy is out of date and misinformed. The number of gardaí has increased by 600. There are 600 more gardaí in the force since the start of 2017, since this Government came to office. We are on target to meet our objective of increasing the size of the Garda force to its highest ever, 21,000, including members of An Garda Síochána, the Garda Reserve and civilians. When it comes to resources, whether in justice, health or education, they are at all-time high levels.

For a person seeking a house, it is infinitely preferable to get a local authority house rather than to rent a house under a scheme such as housing assistance payment, HAP. First, it provides secure tenancy for life and second, one can aspire to purchase the house from the local authority if a proper tenant purchase scheme is in place. How many local authority houses have been built in the past three years?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	154	From a policy perspective, we would prefer not to rely so much on housing assistance payment. However, previous Governments outsourced responsibility for social housing building to the private sector almost exclusively. When that sector collapsed with the financial crisis, there was no one there to build houses and we had to get back into the business of building social housing. Under Rebuilding Ireland, 50,000 new homes will be added to the social housing stock. However, until 2020 and 2021, there will be more people housed through HAP than in social housing. In those last two years of Rebuilding Ireland, we will place more people from the social housing list into new homes in the social housing stock.  The number of units provided by direct build by local authorities and approved housing bodies was about 2,400 and will be about double that number this year, including some of the units built under Part V provisions. This is not like 20 or 30 years ago. There are several different delivery streams of social housing, including the approved housing body sector, local authorities, long-term leasing and acquisition. All those measures together, as well as the opening of voids this year, will bring almost 8,000 new homes into the social housing stock. The rest of the people on the list who we need to help will have to rely on the housing assistance payment. Last year we helped around 26,000 new tenancies, both families and individuals, through taxpayer-supported social housing supports. That was 23% more than we had intended. Rebuilding Ireland is working. We are ahead of our targets. However, as the Taoiseach pointed out earlier, there is a lot more work to do.

The average rent in Dublin is €1,527, in Meath, Kildare and Wicklow it is €1,104, in Cork and Galway it is €1,000 and for the rest of the country, it is €791. If one compares the maximum rent that is allowed to people who qualify under HAP and the rent allowance scheme, the rent is greater than the allowance in every single county.In other words, in Dublin the maximum rent allowable under the scheme is €1,200. In counties such as my own county of Kerry it is €575. People who qualify for the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rent allowance scheme simply cannot get properties they can afford. We are in a dilemma. Unless the Minister increases the allowances under HAP and the rent allowance scheme, none of these qualified applicants will be able to get a property. I ask the Minister to review it in light of the figures published yesterday in order to give people an opportunity.

The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, released its report for the first quarter of 2018 on rent measures and the rent index and it included some very interesting results. There was a national increase in rents of 0.4%. That is the smallest increase we have seen in 12 months. In Dublin rents increased by only 1% and it was 1.1% in the previous quarter, the last quarter of last year. We are seeing a slowdown in rent inflation. Interestingly in Kildare, Meath and Wicklow we actually saw rents falling. What that means in practical terms is that if one is renting a house one's rent will have increased by approximately €1 over the last three months and if one is renting an apartment it will have increased by approximately €18. We accept that rents are still too high. I accept that. However, there is an uplift of 20% for people who are accessing the housing assistance payment and one can get an additional uplift if one has more family members. If one is at risk of homelessness the uplift is as much as 50%. As a result of bringing in those additional uplifts we are seeing that the HAP is working. We are securing tens of thousands of people into HAP tenancies and every week many more begin receiving HAP.

In the case of Laois-Offaly, I got figures just over two weeks ago which tell us that there are 1,850 children in the area awaiting occupational therapy. Some 1,022 of those have been waiting more than 12 months and some of them have been waiting for more than two years. There are 291 children in the constituency waiting for physiotherapy. The figures are outrageous. I understand that the Taoiseach has completed his first year in office this year. The Government is just over two years in office. The figures are at an alarming high. People and families who need access to these services are beating our doors down. As a doctor the Taoiseach knows that early intervention is the key to helping these people to go on to live independent lives and to be able to contribute to society and have a fruitful life. I appeal to the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Health what he, the Department and the HSE are doing to address this, particularly in respect of occupational therapy in Laois-Offaly. I know the Taoiseach will not have that exact figure now, but I would appreciate if he could come back to me on it.

We have a recruitment programme under way for additional occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists but we know from the bitter experience of recent years that more staff and more resources often does not make much of a difference.

I am dealing with a number of cases in my constituency of Dublin South-West. There are 95 others ahead of a child in one such case. The child has been waiting two years and has now been told it will be another year. The HSE in Dublin South-West asked for extra resources in the budget but the budget did not cover that request. We are talking about three years for a basic thing like speech and language therapy. The Taoiseach spoke earlier about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. That is fantastic but here we have the most vulnerable and they are not getting access to services. They are having to wait three years. The Minister for Education and Skills is here. Is there any possibility of extra budget resources for this? Clearly the system is broken in this area and we need to do more in this regard.

The Deputy says that there is no social house building programme. Some 50,000 new homes will come into the stock of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland. We will build double what was built last year this year, which itself was a tripling of what was built the year before. If we are going to have a debate about housing let us stick to the facts.

In the month since I raised this in the House, the problem has worsened. It is not just a matter of statistics. In one month, the number of people in my area, CHO 7, has increased from 650 to 724. These people have been assessed by the HSE as needing home support services but none is available. People are being informed that they will get home support services only as they become available. This effectively means when somebody moves into long-term residential care or dies. I raised this a month ago but the figures have worsened. I do not expect the Taoiseach to have a specific answer but I appeal to him to address this. This is happening on his watch. It has not happened like this for quite a while but it is getting out of control.

I appreciate that the Deputy raised it with me a few weeks ago and I share his concerns about it. There has been an increase in resources for home care this year. I am not clear yet whether additional demand has exceeded the additional supply or whether it is a problem of recruitment. I understand that, in some areas, it has been difficult to recruit home care staff, which causes a problem even when resources are in place. It is a matter of determining whether it is a case of resources not being deployed properly and efficiently. In the medium term, we will have to move to a statutory scheme similar to the fair deal scheme. That will take too long for people who are currently on the list so I am having this examined at the moment.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	227	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the law relating to civil liability.This is an important Bill, which I hope the House will fully support. Part 4 of the Civil Liability Act 1961 sets out the procedure for fatal injuries actions taken by next of kin. Such actions are taken to establish liability for a death that was caused wrongfully and, in some cases, to provide financially for the dependants of the deceased. The law distinguishes between the measurable financial loss suffered by a dependant where the deceased was contributing to the income of the household, on the one hand, and compensation for mental distress resulting from the death of each family member on the other. Compensation for mental distress, known as solatium, is capped by statutory instrument by the Minister for Justice and Equality. In 2014, that was capped at €35,000. However, where medical negligence in the provision of treatment to a pregnant woman results in the loss of her pregnancy, solatium is not available. There is no compensation for a mother for mental distress on the loss of an unborn child. She may recover damages only for any injury to her own health. The other family members, including the father, are not regarded as having suffered any damage or loss. According to section 49 of the Act, the law relating to civil wrongs applies to an unborn child for its protection in the same manner as if a child were born at the time, but only where the child is subsequently born alive. A person can sue for injuries suffered as a result of wrongs done to him or her while in the womb or in the process of being born. A person with cerebral palsy caused by difficulties in labour may recover damages under this rule but if those wrongs result instead in the death of the child, section 58 does not apply, nor does Part 4 of the Act. One purpose of the Bill is to extend Part 4 to provide both recognition and a remedy where family members who suffer as a result of the loss of pregnancy caused negligently can have some recourse. This is a simple Bill. Where there is proven medical negligence, for instance, if a child is born with cerebral palsy, a personal injury claim can be made. There have been many of those cases. Where a child is born and dies subsequently, however, a fatal injury claim can be processed where there has been negligence. What this small amending Bill will do is address the anomaly where there is proven medical negligence and the child is stillborn. This is to allow the family to have access to modest compensation. I propose €75,000 in such circumstances. I am bringing forward this legislation because of two people who are sitting in the Visitors Gallery, namely Derek and Mignon Underwood from Wexford, who approached me some time ago regarding their case. In 2012, they lost their child, Conor, who was stillborn as a result of proven medical negligence. It took them two years to fight their case. The HSE admitted negligence. It took another 21 months to deal with the matter. We all know what we are talking about when it comes to the State Claims Agency. It took 21 months, in a case where liability was admitted, for this issue to be dealt with. In that scenario, it took four years of fighting. In total, the family has been looking for justice following the loss of Conor for six years. The Underwoods are not interested in this to obtain any form of compensation for themselves. They went through the courts and won in the High Court. It has been acknowledged that what happened to both of them was wrong and there was negligence. The reason I am introducing this Bill, which we will call Conor's law, is to ensure that no family that finds itself in the unique circumstance I have described will ever have to go through what the Underwoods went through and fight the way they had to fight. We must provide a legislative basis to deal with this anomaly in cases where medical negligence has been proven. In that context, I ask the Government and other Opposition Deputies to support this short Bill. Furthermore, I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could examine whether there is a mechanism whereby, through the Department of Justice and Equality, the Bill might be progressed in conjunction with other legislation.

The national risk assessment is an annual exercise which aims to ensure a broad-based and inclusive debate on the strategic risks facing the country. One of the lessons of the recent crisis is that Government did not pay enough attention to dissenting opinions and the national risk assessment provides an opportunity for an open and inclusive conversation on risks. It focuses on the identification of risks and is not intended to replicate or displace the detailed risk management and mitigation that happens across Departments and agencies in regard to individual risks. This is the fifth year the Government has produced the national risk assessment and it has highlighted important issues since first published in 2014, including one of the earliest official acknowledgements of the risks arising from a potential Brexit if the British people decided to vote "Yes" in the referendum. As with previous years, my Department, working with the cross-departmental steering group, prepares the initial draft. It also reflects feedback from an open debate in April where representatives from business, media, research and education institutions, civil society groups and the public sector were invited to discuss a draft list of risks. Following approval by the Government on 22 May, the draft was laid before the Oireachtas and published for public consultation. The draft includes some new risks this year including the impact of social media on public debate, and the risk of overheating the economy. Existing risks have also evolved. For example, the risks arising from Brexit have developed significantly and remain very prominent, while other risks include international uncertainties on tax and trade, climate change, access to secure energy supplies and our capacity to meet skills needs. The increasing pace of change means that disruptive technological trends are a risk to many sectors of the economy, while infrastructure constraints and housing supply and affordability issues are risks despite policy responses being implemented. The draft national risk assessment is available on my Department’s website and the deadline for submissions is 20 June. There has been a very encouraging response to the draft, and the Department would welcome all feedback including from Members of the Oireachtas. Following this public consultation, the list of strategic risks and the report will be finalised and published in July.

I would like to concentrate on one of the new risks that has been identified, namely, that of the economy overheating. I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and we have discussed that matter at length. I get a sense sometimes that economists who missed predicting the previous economic crash want to make sure they do not get caught out again and that they are getting ready to predict the next one. As we ramp up our spending on construction significantly, there is no doubt there is a risk that this can have an impact in terms of overheating. Will the Taoiseach indicate how much analysis has been done on the risk of not investing in the housing sector, where such investment is so badly needed, and in key infrastructure projects such as those outlined in Project Ireland 2040, including in respect of roads, hospitals and schools? We have had the lost decade and we have to restore investment levels. We will be taking a big risk if we do not make the necessary vital investment in key infrastructure in order to allow people to work and live well into the future. The economists to whom I refer also presume that we will continue the boom-to-bust cycle. It would be a major risk if the spending decisions that are made have more to do with short-term spending strategies rather than key infrastructure projects. We want to move away from that boom-to-bust cycle. I would be concerned about commitments and promises from the Opposition. We have examined Fianna Fáil's proposals and discovered that they will cost €1.5 billion for 2018 alone in terms of extra Government spending. We must look to see how we can mitigate all these risks to stop us returning to the boom-to-bust cycle. We do not want to return to the mistakes of the past, we want to ensure that we invest in key infrastructure.

We will not have time to discuss it at length but I would like to focus on one particular aspect, which rightly identifies the supply of housing as one of the most immediate domestic challenges facing the State. Sinn Féin acknowledges that there is no easy-fix solution. Unfortunately, we are dealing with legacy issues of past Fianna Fáil Governments and the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government, which failed in terms of housing, and the absolute determination of the more conservative parties to stop building social housing and outsource it to the private sector. The reality is that, by any yardstick, this Government has failed in the context of housing. The Minister was asked about that earlier and he became very defensive when discussing the facts. He might be able to throw figures out in terms of some modest improvements in home building but nobody can argue that the Government has done anything near what is necessary in order to deal with the housing crisis. Will the Taoiseach indicate the additional measures that will be taken by the Government in this regard?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	237	When we look at the documentation, we see that there are two very different national risk assessments. The first is a general and quite political assessment drawn up under the supervision of Ministers and the second is a very focused and expert one drawn up by the emergency management services. The striking thing about the risks identified in the general document is how often there is an attempt to say that everything is in hand or to avoid specifics. For example, there is no proper quantification of fiscal risks and all we have to go upon are the anonymous briefings the Minister for Finance has been giving to journalists about how he is saving the nation from a reckless Opposition. In the context of Brexit, surprisingly, the draft does not mention the impact of the current stated objective of the European Union in the negotiations. Michel Barnier has stated that the European Union is offering a comprehensive free trade agreement but not continued membership of the customs union and the Single Market because these cannot be accommodated within the British red lines. According to the Copenhagen study, this will represent a permanent loss of 4.3% of our GDP. Can the Taoiseach confirm that according to the information available to him, the current offer of the European Union to the United Kingdom is in line with that and will therefore cost €2,693 per person? That is the impact using last year's figures so the impact will be bigger. Regarding the other risk assessment by the office of emergency planning, again, it is a clear representation of the threats. It has been drawn up in line with the guidelines put in place by Deputy O'Dea over a decade ago and this format has been very effective to date. Can the Taoiseach tell us if he has examined this risk assessment, which was completed last year, to ensure that sufficient resources are in place to meet the highest priority threats? The overall emergency management plan created by Deputy O'Dea has been effective and the only change in recent times has been the increased prominence of politicians in press conferences. Can the Taoiseach tell us what happened to the new emergency planning document? I was informed two and a half years ago that it was ready for Government approval.

It is a very broad canvas and it is difficult to ask specific questions on so many strategic issues. We have other opportunities to deal with issues like Brexit and so on but I want to ask about two. First, an area I am increasingly more concerned about relates to our commitments in regard to climate change, not only the physical impact - we have had two status red storms in Ireland during the past winter with very significant damage to us - but also because we will be subject to very serious fines due to not meeting our international commitments on greenhouse gas abatement. We need to get serious about that now. We have no prospect of meeting the targets unless we set out a clear strategy. I am interested in the Taoiseach's views on how that matter is to be addressed. Second, external interference in our democratic process is an issue we raised yesterday but is one we should not let go off our agenda. We need to have a robust mechanism to ensure that external forces do not manipulate any elections we have into the future.

This is a very real risk but one which we should not over-exaggerate.The enormous political challenge over the next couple of months, or perhaps the next year, is to break the cycle of boom and bust that we have had in Ireland for generations, the procyclical economic policies that slash taxes and increase welfare and spending when things are going well only to take it all away again when things are going badly. We should do the reverse. We should balance the books, start running a small surplus into the future and start paying down our debt so that when the economy slows down, as it inevitably will, or when there is another recession - that might be far away but it might happen - we will be in a position to increase spending and cut taxes, which is what should be done during a recession. That was not possible in the past because of irresponsible economic policies and I am determined that it should not happen again. There were two features to the overheating that occurred previously. There was a credit bubble, with excessive lending by the banks to the construction industry, in particular, and to people buying homes. That does not appear to be the case currently. I do not see evidence of a credit bubble. Second, extra day-to-day spending was funded with windfall taxation from stamp duty. It was a huge mistake by previous Governments to commit to extra current, ongoing spending across the board that was funded by a temporary windfall in taxation from stamp duty. We must bear in mind the vulnerability of corporation tax receipts and not allow ourselves to repeat that mistake. We are nowhere near that yet, but corporation tax revenues are buoyant and we should not make the mistake of using them, as they might not always be available, to fund long-term commitments. We should use the buoyant receipts from corporation tax for items such as investment in infrastructure, as Deputy Heydon mentioned. He is spot-on in that regard. We must increase infrastructure spending in transport, housing, schools, universities, healthcare facilities and climate change. That makes both economic and social sense. Our spending on public infrastructure is up 18% so far this year, and it will increase by another 25% next year. We are tackling some deep social problems, for example, the social housing shortage and the general housing shortage. We are also removing bottlenecks to future growth by investing in transport. That makes good economic sense. Continuing to increase our spend on public infrastructure, road projects and school projects will not cause overheating. Other errors may cause that. In terms of the facts about housing that were mentioned by Deputy Cullinane, I will not go over the debate we had earlier. We all acknowledge the housing shortage and the crisis that exists with homelessness. I acknowledge that there are more people in emergency accommodation today than there were a year ago. I am not in denial about the challenge we face in that regard. However, one fact the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, did not mention in the debate earlier is the figures that have just been released on rents. They show that rents increased by just 1% in the last quarter and by 1.1% in the previous quarter. That is two quarters in which rent has increased by approximately 1% as compared with a year-on-year increase of approximately 7%-----

The 600,000 tenants who have not experienced a significant rent increase in the past year or so know that. The risk assessments on Brexit are real and serious. It all depends on the type of Brexit, whether it is a hard Brexit or one where the UK stays in the customs union and is aligned with the Single Market. There are many different scenarios and the period of transition, if there is one, will be important in that regard. None of the many analyses I have seen to date indicates that even a hard Brexit would put Ireland into recession. They indicate that in all the scenarios for Brexit our economy will grow more slowly than it might have otherwise and employment growth will be less than it might otherwise have been. The issue is the opportunity cost as opposed to triggering a recession or a downturn. However, we must be wise to even that possibility because it represents a major change in our economy and our trading relations. That is the reason the Government is working so hard to ensure we continue to have the closest possible relationship with the UK after Brexit - that there is a transition period and that things change as little as possible after it. That is where we are at the moment in the negotiations, but they are not easy negotiations. The office of emergency planning has worked very well. I have no difficulty crediting the former Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, with establishing it. A great deal has been learned from the various emergencies it has handled. The chairperson, Mr. Sean Hogan, and his staff have done a good job. I noted a slightly snide remark from the Leader of the Opposition about Ministers being more prominent at press conferences and so forth.

I was pleased to welcome the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Charles Michel, to Government Buildings on Thursday, 24 May, where we had a constructive and friendly meeting.  Belgium and Ireland have excellent bilateral relations, including strong trade relations. We are also like-minded on many EU issues and we discussed how to further intensify our co-operation across the EU agenda.  This is particularly important in light of the debate on the future of Europe, where both of us are positive and ambitious. We both believe that we should implement agreed measures in areas that directly benefit our citizens' daily lives. For example, we wish to complete the Single Market, the capital markets union and the banking union. We want to rapidly progress the digital Single Market. We also want to develop our relations with other parts of the world.  Prime Minister Michel and I discussed the Brexit negotiations in advance of the June European Council and the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and all that flows from it - peace in Britain and Ireland, power sharing in the North and ever closer North-South co-operation.  I thanked the Prime Minister for his strong, ongoing support regarding our unique concerns and highlighted the need to ensure the commitments and principles agreed between the EU and the UK last December are translated into legal text of the withdrawal agreement.  After Ireland, Belgium is one of the countries most likely to be adversely affected by Brexit due to its strong trading relationship with the UK. We both agreed that we want the future relationship between the EU and the UK to be as deep, close and comprehensive as possible, while insisting that there be a level playing field, fair competition and that the integrity of the Single Market be protected.  The Prime Minister and I discussed a range of other EU issues, including the EU budget. We agreed on the need to ensure continued funding for agriculture, cohesion and research and development, and to be open to looking at other areas if they bring additional European value. We both support the EU enlargement process.  We exchanged views on transatlantic relations, where we agreed on the need for a strong EU response to US tariffs. We also acknowledged the long-term importance of the relationship. We have a united front on relations with Russia.  We agreed that the EU should reinvigorate its relations with Africa to develop a dynamic and political relationship that produces results.  Prime Minister Michel had some other engagements during his visit to Ireland. I was pleased that he took the time to visit the Border region, where he was accompanied by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and where he had the opportunity to speak with people and see the Border at first hand. My meeting with Prime Minister Michel was part of my ongoing bilateral engagement with EU and international counterparts, which remains crucial on Brexit and other important EU issues. In this context, I look forward to meeting the new Prime Minister of Spain, Mr. Pedro Sanchez, tomorrow in Madrid.I am also scheduled to meet the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, in Dublin on 21 June and the Austrian Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, in Dublin on 9 July. In addition to such scheduled bilateral meetings, I meet and speak regularly with my EU counterparts at formal and informal meetings of the European Council and also of the EPP, where I use every opportunity to advance Ireland's interests. I attended the most recent EU summit on 17 May, the week before my meeting with the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Michel. I will, of course, attend the next meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 28 and 29 June.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	251	The main issue of discussion with the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Michel, was Brexit and the other EU matters that will arise at the June Council. Most of us are now deeply concerned about the way the negotiations on Brexit with the United Kingdom are unfolding. Did the Taoiseach raise the following matter which might have had some consideration with the Belgian Prime Minister and will he raise it with the new Socialist Prime Minister of Spain when he meets him tomorrow? I refer to the potential of extending the period of time for the completion of Article 50, in other words to move beyond the 29 March 2019 deadline if it was felt there was an advantage to having further time. Has that been given any consideration? In terms of the strategic importance of trade with the United Kingdom, as the Taoiseach has rightly said, Belgium will be one of the member states that is significantly impacted. Up to now we have maintained a very strong sense of solidarity across the EU 27. Many of us were concerned that when we reached the trade section of talks, if we had not got the Irish Border matter resolved, there would be pressure put on us to ensure that the final settlement would be agreed because trade would be so important. Was that matter broached with the Belgian Prime Minister and was there a clear sense of that continued solidarity? On the discussions on Africa, migration is a highly significant issue. It has caused political upheaval and the rise of nationalism and populism in many countries. Did the Taoiseach discuss with the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Michel, and will he discuss with other EU leaders the notion of an EU Marshall-type plan for Africa to ensure people have economic prospects in their own home countries?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	252	As the Taoiseach said, the core of his discussion with other governments has rightly been on the issue of Brexit and Ireland has benefited from significant solidarity from our European partners. When we look back over transcripts and reports of the Taoiseach's words in recent days, it is striking how far he is willing to go to avoid admitting how a critical deadline set by him is being missed. It is unfortunately the way of these things that the Taoiseach will probably respond by saying that this is somehow the Opposition's fault. For six months we have been told in this House and recently in Dundalk that we needed substantial progress on a backstop legal text by the end of June, and that this was, according to both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, "a very important date from an Irish perspective". We were supposed to have locked down the bulletproof, concrete and ironclad backstop text by 22 June. We were told that continuing the negotiations would require significant progress on the backstop text. Is the Taoiseach standing over the claim that the backstop as interpreted by him is bulletproof, concrete and ironclad? Can the Taoiseach confirm that it is his position that the talks will proceed without any significant progress on the backstop text? Given that Michel Barnier has formally ruled out the UK proposals, which the Taoiseach welcomed and clearly preferred, does he accept that a new approach is required? In particular will he support a Northern Ireland-specific permanent proposal rather than continuing to focus solely on the overall deal? We were told last year that delinking Ireland from the final negotiations on the withdrawal text was vital. The Taoiseach can keep claiming that it does not matter, but he cannot keep claiming that it has not happened.

In his discussions with the Belgian Prime Minister did the Taoiseach get into details of how best to protect Ireland's interests? What synergies do we have with Belgium on that? I understand that Belgium may have a different demographic with more of an urbanised culture. I ask the Taoiseach to update us on that. Was trade with Asia discussed as part of the briefing, given the success of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, with Irish beef now going into China? The Asian population of 4.5 billion represents 60% of the world's population. While we may compete with countries in selling products to that market, smaller countries with significant economic relationships with the UK and which are facing risk may have some synergy regarding trade with Asia. If that has been discussed, I ask the Taoiseach to update us on that and if not, perhaps he might propose to do so.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	254	Did the Taoiseach discuss the issue of multinational tax evasion with the Belgian Prime Minister? I say that because it was reported late last year that $221 billion worth of profits were shifted offshore from Belgium to tax havens around the world, which is obviously a matter of very serious concern to the tax authorities. That equates to about half of Belgium's GDP. We might be discussing it with Belgium this week as yet more evidence has been uncovered showing Ireland's role in the international network of tax havens. US and Danish economists have pointed out that more profits are shifted to Ireland because our tax code is riddled with loopholes than to all the tax havens in the Caribbean combined. This is further evidence that Ireland is a tax haven and is part of an international architecture of tax avoidance and tax evasion which is costing tax authorities around the world about €200 billion annually, which is absolutely starving tax authorities of revenue needed for vital public services.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	255	Deputy Howlin asked whether it would be possible to extend the Article 50 deadline beyond 29 March 2019. I understand that is possible under the treaties, but could only be done by unanimity - it would require all 27 member states to agree to it. Currently the United Kingdom has not asked for it and I do not see any benefit in offering it at this stage. I believe the UK needs to make decisions and choices. The British continually seem to have internal debates among each other. While there has been some improvement in recent months, very often the policy of "having your cake and eating it" seems to be at the centre of the UK's requests of the European Union. Some decisions need to be made by the United Kingdom Government. Putting off a decision does not make it any easier. I would rather not talk about extending that deadline at the moment. As I have said, the UK has not requested it and so I do not think we should even consider it at this stage. We did have a conversation about an EU Marshall-type plan for Africa. I have an interest in the matter and I discussed it in my speech to the European Parliament earlier in the year. Chancellor Merkel is also very enthusiastic about it. Belgium has history in central Africa, as do we but coming from a very different perspective and history. Both of us are very much of the view that part of Europe's external efforts in the future should be focused on Africa, in order to build up Africa as a trading partner and also to remove some of the push factors that cause mass migration from Africa to the European Union. We spoke about how if we get it right, the Africa of the future could be a little bit like Asia now, a continent where 1 billion people have been lifted out of poverty and a continent with which we now want to cut trade deals rather than provide aid to. That will require not just aid but assistance with governance, democratisation and so on.As is always the case on European issues, there can often by agreement on sentiment and policy but when it comes to agreeing to increase budget contributions people are less enthusiastic. Ireland is one of the countries that is willing to increase its budget contribution to the European Union. Deputy Neville asked if agriculture and trade was one of the issues discussed at the meeting. We discussed the impact potentially on the ports of Zeebrugge and Antwerp which receive a lot of trade from Britain and Ireland as well. We are very much aligned in our wishes that countries neighbouring the United Kingdom retain trading arrangements that are as close to what they are now. We also discussed Mercusor. The House will be aware that Ireland and France have expressed real concerns about the impact a free trade agreement with the Mercusor countries could have on our beef industry. What I did not know until the meeting was that this concern is shared by the Belgian Government because Belgium also has a large agriculture sector and a very important and sensitive beef sector. These talks are ongoing. We do have allies in taking the view that a free trade agreement with the Mercusor countries would benefit all economies in Europe but we must also protect sensitive sectors such as the beef sector. We had that discussion and agreement over a working lunch. I reiterate that the deadline for the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol is and always has been October. I said this last March when the European guidelines were issued. We do need to see real and substantial progress by the June summit. The European leaders - the prime ministers and presidents - will determine at that meeting whether they believe real and substantial progress has been made. While the UK's proposal last week is welcome and is a small step forward, it falls short. Without more from London, as things stand today, I cannot say that we have achieved real and substantial progress but there is still two weeks between now and the summit.

My Department has responsibility for the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  The National Economic and Social Council statutory basis is as a body under the framework of the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006. This framework is no longer necessary and Government has agreed that it should be dissolved and the NESC itself placed on a statutory footing. This work is ongoing and is the only legislation being prepared in my Department.  The role of NESC is to analyse and report on strategic policy matters relevant to Ireland's economic, social, environmental and sustainable development.

I am interested in hearing if that legislation is going ahead and, if so, when it will be published. More importantly, the Taoiseach told us some time ago that there are a number of contingency plans across all Departments in the event of a hard Brexit. Obviously, these contingency plans have not been published as of yet. Presumably, the Taoiseach's Department has such contingency plans. Do they include specific legislation that might need to be enacted in that eventuality? The Taoiseach previously offered a briefing on the contingency planning across Government. What is the status of that briefing such that those of us in opposition might know specifically what is being planned in the event of a hard Brexit?

Are they to be filled and does the Taoiseach know by whom they will be filled? I particularly urge the appointment to those vacant positions of people who have ideas on how to deal with the current housing and homelessness crisis. The NESC recently published a report on the property sector. Is there anything in that report which the Government is considering responding to from a legislative point of view? The NESC report proposals on how we might begin to address the current housing and homelessness disaster are good. Is the Government taking any cognisance of them?

Can the Taoiseach say whether his Department has any role in ensuring priority is given across Departments to legislation? For example, can he say whether he is frustrated with delays in producing legislation in the health area? It has taken eight months to draft the home building finance Ireland Bill, an initiative in respect of which €750 million was allocated in last October's budget. Not one penny of that funding has been spent despite that we are experiencing a major housing crisis. The vulture fund Bill brought forward by Deputy Michael McGrath is still outstanding, as is the parole Bill brought forward by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan. These are Bills that have all-party support yet they are being continuously delayed. Is there a plan to increase the number of skilled drafters available for necessary legislation? By any yardstick, performance over the last three years in terms of the drafting and passage of legislation has been very poor.

We could have been in here on Wednesday and Thursday last legislating. As the House proposes to adjourn on 12 July - which I propose to challenge with the Business Committee - a lot of important legislation will not be passed prior to the summer recess. There are inquiries under the remit of the Taoiseach's Department. I presume work in that regard is ongoing and that there are no issues arising in regard to the IBRC inquiry of which the House needs to be informed.

We have a very firm position in that regard. Also, as such a levy would reduce the corporation tax revenues coming to Ireland, it is a proposal we cannot support. On the NESC legislation, it is going ahead but it is not a legislative priority. The NESC is functioning well without that legislative change. We will do it but other Bills are taking higher priority, including, for example, the legislation around abortion and also the home building finance Ireland Bill, which was mentioned by Deputy Martin and which was passed at Cabinet yesterday. I am not sure if it has been published yet but it is ready for publication. On the vacancies on the NESC, I think they have been filled. There are two sets of appointees, namely, the sectoral appointees and the independent experts who I appoint. I signed off on appointments in both regards some weeks ago. The independent experts are in the main people from an academic background. Two of them are from Ireland, one is from Northern Ireland and the other is from outside of Ireland. On the report on the property sector, I think it is a good piece of work. It is worth reading. The areas in respect of which I think it speaks most clearly are the need for a new approach to land use and land management. Government will take that on board. We propose to establish a land development agency.

There is a lot of work done on contingency planning for Brexit. We should be in a position to publish some of that, probably in the next couple of weeks. As is always the case we would be happy to offer a briefing to party leaders on that.  On the delays in producing legislation the record should show that 70 Bills have been enacted by this Oireachtas since this Government came into office, which is not bad for two years. It is important to recognise that. For the first time we are seeing a decent number of Private Members' Bills becoming law, not as many as I would like but six have become law in this Oireachtas, which is probably more than in the past five or six Oireachtais combined, so we are seeing a trickle of them coming through. That is not bad for a minority Government and one that does not have the ability to use the guillotine. That slows business up quite a lot because legislation that is being filibustered is causing other legislation to be delayed. Members of the Opposition who are involved in delaying legislation have to take responsibility not just for the legislation they are trying to slow down or block but also all the other legislation behind it that is being slowed down as a result. I am frustrated just as other Deputies are with the slow pace of legislation. There are several issues. There is a need for more parliamentary draftspeople. That is being examined. There is also a need to streamline the way we manage Private Members' Bills and the Ceann Comhairle is working on that with my office and others. Departments, which should be producing good legislation that will become law and make a difference in people's lives, are now spending a huge amount of time responding to Private Members' Bills that everyone knows will not become law and that have been put down largely for the purposes of calling a press conference or making a press statement. Poor quality legislation coming from the Opposition------

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	273	I am raising the issue of the Rebuilding Ireland home loans scheme. As people are aware, it is a mortgage scheme for first-time buyers backed by the Government. It is now available through all local authorities. A first-time buyer can apply for a Rebuilding Ireland home loan to purchase a new or second-hand property or to build his or her own home. Up to 90% of the market value of the property can be borrowed. That is the background to the scheme. As the Topical Issue matter I tabled states, I wish to discuss the credit policy 2018 and the Rebuilding Ireland home loans scheme. The wording I submitted deals with the secrecy attached to the credit policy 2018, under which applications are considered. The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, is aware that well over 600 or 700 applications have been made. There is, approximately, a 50% refusal rate among those who have been assessed. Citizens in a democracy have a right to know how the decision to refuse their application was made. The appeal mechanism is merely internal within the local authority. There is no external appeals mechanism. There is no method for appealing to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or to the ordinary Ombudsman as to how the local authority conducted the appeal in respect of an application.  There is no external appeals mechanism whatsoever and that is all the more reason that citizens should have access to the criteria under which their application was considered. They could then put in an appeal, even if it is a poor mechanism in the first place because it is internal to the local authority. No doubt it will be dealt with by somebody who was not on the credit committee. I submitted a parliamentary question asking for a copy of the criteria in view of the number of refusals of which I have been made aware. In the reply of 14 April 2018, I was told that it was a commercially sensitive document, it was not in the public interest to publish it and it would conflict with the economic interests of the State. The document remains confidential on that basis. That is not acceptable. I think the Minister of State knows that. If the Government has learned anything in this day and age, it is that citizens, and the rights of citizens, must be respected. In this case, citizens' rights are being infringed. The Department needs to come into the 21st century. It must know it cannot deal with citizens' information in a secretive manner. The members of this Government must surely have learned that. How can a person put in an appeal if he or she does not know the criteria according to which his or her application was refused in the first place? The current semi-appeals mechanism, internal to the local authority, makes no sense. There should be a mechanism everywhere in the State so that an appeal can be put in and it is known what the appeal is against. People are appealing on the blind, however, and the idea of a commercially sensitive document by which one's application was judged is nonsense in this day and age. It would not stand up to objective scrutiny anywhere in terms of the rights of the applicants.  I am asking the Minister of State to reconsider the old 19th century approach whereby nobody is entitled to question the decision of a local authority. Local authorities make commercial decisions all the time. They put contracts out for tender and people know the criteria under which contracts are awarded. If people did not know the criteria applied the process would be deemed invalid. This ridiculous requirement for commercial sensitivity around how applications are judged should be removed.

I feel somewhat disadvantaged because the wording in front of me is slightly different from the wording submitted by Deputy Fleming. I thank him for raising the issue nonetheless. Following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the house purchase loan and the home choice loan, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, introduced a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, earlier this year to replace the existing schemes. The new loan scheme is being implemented in accordance with the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans) Regulations 2018. The regulations broadly set out the criteria for eligibility for loans, the maximum values for properties which may be purchased under the new scheme, as well as the duties of local authorities and borrowers.  The new loan enables creditworthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range where they cannot obtain a mortgage from a commercial lender. Long-term financing, provided by the Housing Finance Agency, has enabled the Rebuilding Ireland home loan to be provided at low fixed rates of interest. These low interest rates enable local authorities to act as lenders to eligible individuals who find themselves in this situation and enable them to purchase their own home. The loans are provided by the local authorities and the applications are assessed by the Housing Agency on their behalf. Each local authority must have in place a credit committee, which makes the final decision on applications for loans. There is also an appeal procedure in each local authority in order that those who are not satisfied with a decision regarding their application can have the decision reviewed.  The Housing Agency undertakes a detailed credit analysis, based on credit information furnished by the borrower, such as employment history, salary and financial statements; available information, such as the borrower's credit history, which is detailed in a credit check; and an evaluation of the borrower’s credit needs and ability to pay. The agency then makes a recommendation to the local authority as to whether a loan should be made to the applicant, which is then considered and decided upon by the local authority’s credit committee. The regulations provide for the Minister to issue a statutory credit policy, giving detailed guidance to local authorities for the processing of loan applications and the making of loans under the regulations. This updated document replaces the credit policy that was in place for the previous local authority lending schemes, which have now been superseded by the new home loan scheme.  I am aware that the Deputy has in the past raised the issue of publishing the credit policy. The revised policy is an internal document designed to provide written guidance to local authorities for managing and processing loan applications. Decisions by local authorities as to whether to advance a loan to an individual are taken on a case-by-case basis within the criteria as set out in the credit policy. As such, the policy is a commercially sensitive document, as would be the case with any other lender. Therefore, it would not be in the public interest to publish it, as this would conflict with the economic interests of the State and could seriously compromise the ability of local authorities to lend in an effective manner or otherwise impair their functions in this regard. On this basis, the Minister intends to continue the approach, which has been in place in respect of credit policies that governed previous local authority loan schemes, and treat the credit policy as confidential.  The operation of the new home loan scheme is still at a very early stage. However, the Housing Agency has indicated that by the end of last month, it had received a total of 1,150 valid applications from local authorities for assessment since the launch of the loan scheme. Of these, 876 have been assessed and 52% of the applications which have been assessed have been recommended for approval. The Department has been working closely with local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and the Housing Agency to ensure that the new mortgage scheme is understood, accessible and operating as effectively as possible, particularly to address some initial teething problems that arose. Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has met the chief executives of the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency. The Department has put in place a number of measures to ensure that information on the scheme is widely available. The dedicated Rebuilding Ireland home loan website includes a helpful frequently asked questions document and a borrower information booklet, which may answer any questions people may have.

If another Department was operating a scheme and its rejection rate was 50%, with no appeal to the Ombudsman or the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman available, the Minister of State would not be able to stand over it. He should ask his officials to come into the 21st century. There is no level of commercial sensitivity involved in this. People have only sought a loan from the local authorities because they have not been able to get a commercial loan on the open market. The local authorities are a place of last resort for them. As for the rejection rate, the Minister of State stated the Housing Agency undertakes a detailed credit analysis and considers credit history, ability to pay and the borrower's credit needs. That should be spelled out in the criteria and people should be informed which element of the criteria they failed to meet. The idea of having secret criteria about which people will not be informed and which will not be shared does not make any sense in this day and age. I note it is a substantial document. We have had enough of public bodies refusing to tell the public, particularly people dealing with the public bodies, that they cannot have access to information. Personal information and the reason for decisions are being concealed. Public bodies are refusing to pass on information. If the Minister of State has learned anything from the actions of another Department in recent months, he must know that there is no basis for a public body operating in secret when it comes to the information of citizens. Those days are over. That manner of operating might have been valid in the last century. It is not acceptable now. Any independent person looking at this could not stand over it. This scheme is failing because it is disjointed. The Minister of Finance answered a parliamentary question I had tabled last night on the help-to-buy scheme, which suggested that people who are divorced and who previously owned a house cannot access that scheme. Those people, thankfully, can avail of this scheme in special circumstances. We have two schemes which are designed to help people to buy houses. The Department is saying some people are eligible but they are then refused, and they are then allowed access to this scheme. There is a lack of joined-up thinking between the State agencies on this matter. The fact that the Ombudsman and financial ombudsman have been excluded from any independent review says it all. This matter must be revisited.

I disagree slightly with Deputy Fleming in the sense that when one is dealing with the private information of citizens, there are reasonable circumstances in which that information must remain private. That certainly applies to financial information. Two freedom of information requests for the credit policy were submitted to the Department in March but were refused under the Freedom of Information Act on the grounds that the documents were commercially sensitive and that their release would be contrary to the financial and economic interests of the State. Perhaps a balance can be struck regarding the rights of citizens to access their own personal information but equally, commercial sensitivity is attached to lending decisions by whatever organisation - in this case, an arm of the State - makes that decision. It may well have other impacts on the wider public good. I will speak to officials about the possibility of whether there can be some meeting of minds but the information is quite sensitive and its release could have other negative effects.

I refer to the failure of the supply of water to between 4,000 and 5,000 citizens in that community in what I can only assume was a predictable incident for which some sort of contingency plan should have been made. I would also like to highlight the pretty much abject failure of Irish Water to adequately communicate with citizens in the particular part of Skerries that is affected. My phone started ringing on Thursday evening in respect of water outages. Those outages resulted in numerous houses losing their supply completely. Irish Water stated that this was because the houses were on elevated ground or at the extremities of the network. Information has now been provided to locals, including by individual Irish Water engineers, to the effect that there might be a missing link within the network in that part of the community. I find this unacceptable. Planning permissions were granted and hundreds of thousands of euro have been parted with by dozens of families in recent months and years, yet they cannot rely on the basic principle that the State will supply them with water. On their behalf, I find what is happening completely unacceptable. I would like to see cogent and deliverable plans put in place as quickly as possible so that a recurrence of this problem can be avoided in future. If that means an alteration to the capital plans of Irish Water, so be it. I absolutely insist that this matter be dealt with adequately, efficiently and speedily, so that we can ensure that this does not happen again. All that happened was that it did not rain for two weeks in the northern part of the county and all of a sudden thousands of homes have lost their water. I find that totally unacceptable.

I am quite disappointed that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is not here for this debate, particularly as we are talking about water outages affecting, as Deputy Farrell mentioned, hundreds of houses and thousands of residents. This has not just been happening since last Thursday. We have regularly had issues with regard to water supply and water pressure in the area. The standard of communication from Irish Water has improved in the past two days, which is welcome. I have spoken directly with the chief executive, Mr. Jerry Grant, on a number of occasions. I understand that Irish Water is now proposing to provide a booster pumping station in the area in order to deal with the issue once and for all. As a result of the fact that the 30-inch main in Swords is being replaced, there is a reduction in the water supply and an increase in demand because of the warmer weather. However, this situation has obtained since last Thursday. It is becoming an issue of health and hygiene that affects young families, many of them in the areas of Barnageeragh, Hamilton Hill and Town Parks. Water is an absolute right. It is a necessity. It is required. I am asking the Government to back up the commitments that Irish Water, through its CEO, Mr. Jerry Grant, gave me to the effect that it will carry out whatever capital works are necessary and invest whatever money is required in order to rectify this problem once and for all. In the interim, we need measures that will ensure that the supply is constant to this part of Skerries in the north of my constituency. I need a commitment from the Government that it will financially back the request from Irish Water in order to ensure that any capital works that are required to rectify this problem once and for all are carried out. Residents will be meeting Irish Water this evening. I welcome that. We need to improve our communications in that regard and we need to quickly rectify this problem once and for all for the good of thousands of people in north Fingal.

While restrictions in supply have now been lifted somewhat, this comes with the caveat that they could be reapplied should the need arise. That is very difficult for people with young children, for older people and for those who are sick. The fragility of our water system is there for all to see. We saw it in Drogheda last year and we have seen it in many other areas throughout the country. As a national utility, Irish Water is tasked with fixing our antiquated water infrastructure system. The company says that the problem in Skerries is due to the low level of water in the Thomastown Reservoir due to the recent dry spell and to a number of networking issues. I understand that it has not rained in a couple of weeks, but I do not accept that as a reason for the water in the reservoir to drop to such a low level. I have lived in Skerries for approximately 40 years. I have lived through numerous heat waves and dry spells but I have never before seen such a catastrophic failure in our water system. There has to be another factor to this, and I believe that there is. I think the main issue lies in the other networking issues to which Irish Water refers. The company needs to come clean on this. Separate to the general water problems in Skerries associated with the levels at Thomastown Reservoir, there is a particular problem in the newest estates of Barnageeragh Cove and Hamilton Hill. Both are on the edge of Skerries and located on higher ground. They have been impacted most severely, with no supply at all during the so-called restricted supply periods. This can only be due to poor water infrastructure design which has not taken account of the terrain in the estates. I accept that they are on high ground but explaining a failure of water supply by saying that a community is located at the extremities of the network is not an acceptable response from Irish Water. The network should be able to provide any planned estates with the same level of water security as homes central to the network system.

I know this because my home has been affected. It gets worse the further up the hill one goes. There are young families, particularly in Barnageeragh and Hamilton Hill, who are having serious issues. For people with small children, it is not good enough to get 12 hours' notice of a water shortage. Sometimes they do not even get that. I echo what the other Deputies said, namely, that any alterations in the capital plans that have to be made should be made. I do not think it is acceptable to say to people that their water supply cannot be guaranteed because they live on a hill. Certainly, that was not said to them when they were buying their homes. They have the same right to an adequate supply of water as anybody else. It is disrespectful to refer to water restrictions and water shortages when many are experiencing a complete cessation of supply. If the sun is shining, it is supposed to be a good thing. It cannot be the case that if one happens to live in Skerries, the sun shining means that one cannot have a shower in the evening. That is just not acceptable. It is not right. If a booster pump can be put in place, that should be done. Equally, measures to address this need to be taken because more building is planned. Skerries is a fast-expanding town. That is a very good thing. More building is planned even further up the hill in question. What will the Government say to those families? It is not acceptable that families with young children have to go to tanks or go to Swords and elsewhere to source bottled water, particularly when one considers the number of young families affected. The Government must be mindful of the fact that there have been 20 separate incidents in the past 18 months.

What does that tell us? It tells us that people in our constituency have endured a nightmare for the past week, while the rest of the country was celebrating the good weather. These are not water restrictions; there is no water at a location within a 30 km radius of our city centre. Where would you get it? There are parts of Africa that do not stand over such inadequate infrastructure. That is why we are here. That is why we all gave notice of this matter without checking with each other, because our constituents have been severely affected, and not only now. As the other Deputies said, this has been an ongoing problem which has reached acute levels in recent times.Frankly, I found it insulting to listen to Irish Water representatives on the radio earlier in the week telling us that there is a problem, demand is exceeding supply, and to conserve water and not to run power hoses. This patently failed to deal with the issue of why this particular problem was occurring in this part of Skerries. Meanwhile a local festival was going on in another part of town where there were no water restrictions or water shortages. This is an infrastructural deficit as a result of poor planning decisions, which must be examined, and account must be taken of this in the light of the other development going on in the area. On top of this, we need to identify a solution because this is an ongoing issue. Residents familiar with the area have pointed to the groundwater studies undertaken in the area years ago and the substantial Thomastown aquifer near the reservoir, which could be tapped into to provide an alternative groundwater supply and end this nightmare for young families and older residents in our community.

The ongoing issues with the water supply in Skerries have been prominent for the past week. Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level. Irish Water, as a single national utility, is taking a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment. The company recognises that many decades of underinvestment have led to a legacy of deficiencies in our drinking water and wastewater treatment plants and networks. Its water services plan published in October 2015 sets out a strategy over 25 years to ensure the provision of clean, safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for economic and social development. The first ever water services policy statement, prepared in line with the Water Services Acts, which was recently launched by the Minister, outlines a clear direction for strategic planning and decision-making on water and wastewater services in Ireland. It sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of quality, conservation and future proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans. It will provide the context in which necessary funding and investment plans by Irish Water will be framed and agreed. On foot of the water services policy statement, Irish Water’s forthcoming strategic funding plan will set out the costs of providing domestic and non-domestic water services and the recovery of these costs. It will distinguish between operational and capital expenditure, and provide projections of income over the multi-annual period, 2020 to 2024. Subject to its approval by the Minister, Deputy Murphy, the strategic funding plan will feed into the allowed revenue determination for Irish Water by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, as the economic regulator of Irish Water, and, ultimately, feed into annual Estimates and the budgetary process. The water supply issues in Skerries and elsewhere are a consequence of legacy underinvestment, which has been exacerbated by a lack of planned asset management and maintenance programmes. Furthermore, Irish Water has confirmed that the recent dry spell and increased seasonal demand are contributing to the reduced available supply of treated drinking water for Skerries and surrounding areas, while increased demand, in particular from Rush, has led to reduced levels in the Thomastown reservoir. Consequently, the company had to impose restrictions on the water supply serving Skerries and surrounding areas. Irish Water has asked those customers who do have full supply to conserve water by refraining from watering gardens, washing cars, using power hoses and minimising their use generally. Every small effort to save water will contribute to maintaining supplies and benefit the entire community by reducing the likelihood of further restrictions. Irish Water, together with Fingal County Council, is investigating the possibility of network reconfiguration to provide flows to the areas worst impacted by the restrictions, namely, those at the extremities of the network and on higher ground. In the longer term, the company is examining an option to provide a booster pumping station on the feeder main to the Thomastown reservoir to increase its capacity from about 2.8 million l per day to 4 million l per day, subject to full evaluation of the pipe capacity for the increased pressure. This option will require detailed planning, design and construction and, therefore, will be targeted at 2019 delivery. With regard to the Deputies' comments, the Government will financially support the measures Irish Water deems necessary to ensure people have access to proper water in Skerries and the surrounding areas. As part of the review of water supply infrastructure across the greater Dublin area, other strengthening of the strategic networks is planned over the next two to three years to give greater resilience in the system, for example, to enable greater flexibility between the Fingal and Dublin city supply networks in this area. Consequently, Irish Water is exhausting all avenues in implementing a series of actions to address the challenge of water supply and minimise disruptions to the communities in Skerries, as well as longer-term plans to ensure a sustainable resilient water supply.

I have to ask the simple question: what happens next month, the month after or the month after that while Irish Water is planning these improvements? The Minister of State mentioned there was an infrastructural deficit and poor maintenance, but I would like to know who is responsible for this. Was it the local authority prior to 2014? Was it a failure on the part of Irish Water to make submissions to planning applications over the past four or five years? Was it a failure on the part of the local authority in approving occupation or commencement orders for planning permissions that had been granted? If the residents who forked out as much as €500,000 for properties in Skerries and who have no water for a sustained period were informed of that, perhaps we might be in a different position. I accept what has been said by the Minister of State, and I accept there are planning issues associated with the infrastructural requirements, but that will not resolve the problem in the short term. Short and long-term resolutions are needed to these issues. The Minister of State has not put the timelines on the record of the House. I would be interested to hear whether they are available to him. He might be able to interject and provide this support to residents in the community.

I received much of the Minister of State's response from Irish Water yesterday. I say this to show it has not moved on further. We need to focus on short-term measures. My understanding is Irish Water is examining a reconfiguration immediately of the existing network. The booster station, which will increase capacity to 4 million l a day, could be delivered in 2019, according to Irish Water and the Minister of State but what can we do now? This happens in certain areas throughout the country on a regular basis, but being selfish about Skerries, there is, and has been, a health issue. I have spoken to people with young children. There is a serious hygiene issue; it is not just an inconvenience. It is also an issue for the businesses in the town. Will Fingal County Council consider rate rebates for the period they have not had water? Skerries is a town with many restaurants, hairdressers and bars. They have gone to additional expense during this period. I agree with Deputy Farrell that a detailed timeline is needed. What are we doing now to make sure there is a robust supply in the interim while Irish Water delivers a solution for 2019, according to its statement? Will the Minister of State pursue this with the Minister? Along with colleagues, I will make sure this remains on the agenda in order that we know clearly what will happen next and that we can see improvements, with the water supply returning to full capacity without further delay.

I was informed by the Irish Water managing director, Mr. Jerry Grant, earlier this week that, "We have identified a need for a booster pump to increase the supply to the Skerries reservoir and that will be put into our work programme." I hope that means doing it with immediate effect and leaving it in place to meet ongoing need for as long as the networking issues remain. The reservoir levels in Thomastown need to be stabilised as a matter of urgency. The engineering failures that leave estates on the edge of town and on higher ground with problems need to be resolved. The Minister of State does not need to worry about people conserving water and not using power hoses. They are doing this anyway. They need water to drink, wash and keep their homes in a sanitary condition. They are carrying water up to their attics to facilitate water flow through their homes. They need the basics to be delivered and they need them now. I look forward to a plan of action. It needs to be comprehensive and delivered without delay, and not in the longer term as the Minister of State's reply suggests.

It is regrettable that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is not here to take it, particularly as it is very serious. There is not much in the form of commitment to a timeline for people, although we welcome the commitment that this will be financed. It should be borne in mind that more houses are being built as we speak. As a result, this problem will possibly only get worse unless there is an intervention to ensure that water levels at the reservoir can be stabilised and that supply for young families can be guaranteed in future. There is a persistent and ongoing problem with water pressure and my neighbours and I must all have additional pumps in our homes because of that problem. That is before any additional houses are built. Will the Minister of State advise the communications people that it is not acceptable to tell people to conserve water? We are already doing it and it is a bit insulting to people to say that. As a community, we are already trying to make that contribution.

For the rest of us, the legacy underinvestment and people having to conserve water during dry spells applies in all the areas in which we live. We have not had to endure what the people in Skerries have had to endure for the past week. That is the nub of the matter - they have not just endured this for the past week, it has been the worst part of the problem but it has been evident for a period. We must address the fact that the usage of the reservoir is more than the rate of recharge and the system cannot cope with the number of houses using it. Somebody made a decision and it was not the people who are enduring this problem. Whoever made the decision to which I refer must be held to account for it and for other decisions to use the same network. The rate of recharge must be increased by using appropriately treated groundwater. We are in the unique position of having a high-yield aquifer right beside the reservoir in Thomastown. For God's sake, it could help to recharge the reservoir and we need to do it now. We must take on board all of the other points made by the Deputies present.

Local authority boundaries correspond with district electoral divisions and are not necessarily natural geographic boundaries, so gains may be made. The shorter-term response is that Fingal County Council and Irish Water are looking at the possibility of network configuration for the areas worst affected, namely, those on the extremities of the network. I do not have a specific timeframe but I will endeavour to get it. Deputy Daly mentioned the Thomastown aquifer and it is not in the documentation but I will certainly bring it back to the officials. It is interesting that all Deputies agree that this is not a completely new matter as there have been problems on the extremities of Skerries for a long time before the recent dry spell, as Deputy Brendan Ryan notes. I have heard Members' comments on timeframes and I have been told that Irish Water and Fingal County Council are investigating right now the possibility of network configuration for those worst affected areas. In the medium term the actions will concern the interconnection between Dublin city and Fingal and the boosting of the reservoir in Thomastown, as well as the aquifer.

Looking at any statistics for the past month or year, the hospital has been at the top of the list regarding people waiting on trolleys. There is no sign of that letting up, even during the summer when one might think things are going to be a bit easier. We simply cannot allow this to continue and face another winter, or perhaps more than one, before we get the promised 96-bed unit. We absolutely need interim solutions now. Such solutions exist. For example, we could open all the available beds in the area. A number of us have raised the idea of a modular unit. It is essential that the level of staffing is sufficient for the needs of the people in the mid-west. I do not have time to get into the statistics involved but a senior clinician, Dr. Gerard Burke, has demonstrated that there is an inequality in the number of whole-time equivalent acute hospital staff in the mid-west compared with other regions. It is estimated at 10.16 per 1,000 in the mid-west, with the national average being 11.4 per 1,000. We are understaffed and under-resourced. We absolutely need a solution and funding in the service plan and forthcoming budget to ensure this matter can be addressed quickly.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	291	There is constant and recurring overcrowding at the Limerick hospital and this is down to multiple factors. There is a deficiency in bed capacity and staffing. Bed capacity at Limerick runs at approximately 97%, when 85% is the maximum at which a hospital can work efficiently. This leads to poorer outcomes for patients and an increased incidence of cross-infection and hospital-acquired infection. The mid-west has a catchment area of 400,000 but it does not have the bed capacity or staffing to deal with that. As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan noted, whole-time equivalent rates in the mid-west are 14% lower than the national figure. This leads to an increase in the standardised mortality rate in the mid-west. It is a shocking indictment of the health service that there is such disproportionality between one area and another. It comes down to retention and recruitment of staff across all hospitals in the region but also arises from deployment of consultants and medical staff across the model 2 and model 4 hospitals in the region. There is also a deficiency in funding primary care to allow patients to come out of hospital as quickly as possible and the funding of community intervention teams to assist discharge.

I have had personal experience of the workings of the hospital with a person close to me in the past couple of months and I commend the staff on the exemplary work they are doing under pressure. The pressure is felt in the accident and emergency department in particular as bed capacity has not been built behind it. I welcome the initiative to build a 96-bed unit at the hospital. It is long overdue. While it is being designed and built before operation, there will be a shortfall. I ask the Minister of State about the possible use of modular units in Limerick to address that shortfall. I have put down parliamentary questions about that and been told there is an ongoing broad assessment. I have not been given any specifics relating to University Hospital Limerick so I would be grateful to receive clarification in that regard.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	293	On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, I thank the Deputies for raising this very important matter. Let me start by recognising that this Government has approved a record level of capital investment in health at €10.9 billion over the next ten years, which will provide for a major enhancement of the capacity of our health services to meet demand in the coming years. Within this context in February of this year the Department of Health published the health service capacity review, the findings of which now provide the evidence base for capacity decisions. This report concludes that if the required reforms are implemented, nearly 2,600 additional acute hospital beds will be required by 2031. As a first step towards implementing this recommendation, the Minister has asked the Department to work with the Health Service Executive, HSE, to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system that can be opened and staffed this year and in 2019. The HSE is continuing to work on a submission in this regard, with the aim of formulating an evidence-based plan for increasing bed capacity nationally that will form the basis of discussions with colleagues in government on the financing of this important programme of work. Deputies Jan O'Sullivan, Harty and Neville have specifically raised concerns about the plans as they relate to University Hospital Limerick.The need to address bed capacity at University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is recognised by all stakeholders. As the Deputies will be aware, a new emergency department was opened at University Hospital Limerick on 29 May 2017. The €24 million development aimed to provide University Hospital Limerick with increased capacity for emergency medicine to meet the demands of population growth and changing service models and to improve efficiency targets. In addition, 17 new short-stay beds were opened in December 2017 as part of winter measures aimed at alleviating pressure on the emergency department and meeting the growing demand for services in this period. Looking forward, the national development plan includes provision for a 96-bed replacement ward block at University Hospital Limerick. The Minister, Deputy Harris, can confirm that the HSE capital plan for 2018 includes funding to progress the design phase of this project. In the meantime, the HSE is also considering a submission by University of Limerick hospital group to develop a modular inpatient facility at University Hospital Limerick which will have capacity for up to a further 60 beds. A decision on this, as part of the broader work being brought forward by the Department of Health and the HSE to increase bed capacity in advance of this winter and throughout 2019 will be made as soon as possible. We all acknowledge that the challenges we face are significant. Therefore, importantly, this focus on increasing capacity will be matched by forthcoming reforms as set out in the all-party Sláintecare report. This work will be overseen through the establishment in the Department of a Sláintecare programme office, the publication of a detailed Sláintecare implementation plan and the appointment shortly of an executive director for the Sláintecare programme office. I know we have a long road ahead of us, but this is a journey of reform and strengthening of our health services. I will come back in on some of the issues the Deputies raised.

In the context of what she has just said about the fact that work that can be done in advance of this winter is to be identified, I urge that our region be prioritised in respect of both the modular unit and the opening of extra beds. It is quite clear we come out on top of the trolley list constantly. Furthermore, when we talk about the inequality in the provision of acute medical staff, we have the statistics. We are not just talking about unfilled posts; we are actually talking about unallocated posts. In other words, the region simply is not allocated the equivalent number of posts as other regions. We are therefore asking that the mid-west region be prioritised so we do not have to put people through an absolutely intolerable winter, with elderly people lying on trolleys for hours and hours waiting to get beds. The staff do wonderful work, as Deputy Neville said, but they cannot move people if they do not have beds into which to put them. I therefore ask the Minister of State to prioritise our region.

The Saolta west group and the southern group are, I think, getting a disproportionate amount of resources compared to the mid-west, and this is a fundamental issue which is leading to overcrowding in our hospitals. Regarding the Minister of State's reference to the Sláintecare report, it has been published for over a year, but there has been no Government response to it. In the Sláintecare report reference is made to how these issues can be tackled on a national basis, though I am of course particularly concerned about the mid-west. The failure of the Government to respond to Sláintecare is most regrettable. The issue really amounts to beds and staffing. We need more step-down beds in our model 2 hospitals, we need modular units in the regional hospitals and we need enhanced community intervention teams, but we also specifically need more diagnostics. Patients are waiting in hospital for inordinately long periods to get diagnostics, particularly scanning. Unfortunately, our scanning units work on a five-day basis, nine to five, but people require them on a 24-hour basis. We need to look at all these aspects which feed into the issue of overcrowding in Limerick because it is a multifactorial issue. Limerick, unfortunately, is a black spot in respect of bed capacity and overcrowding. As Deputy O'Sullivan said, there are 53 people on trolleys in Limerick today, in the middle of summer, and that is completely unacceptable. There is a specific issue which relates to the mid-west which must be addressed.

Obviously, it is imperative that we get moving on this as quickly as possible, particularly before the winter. Deputy Harty has outlined the statistics as of today, but the statistics were much higher last winter, when there is more demand on services. I have communicated the correspondence from Dr. Gerry Burke to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and am awaiting feedback on it from the Minister. There are modular units going into South Tipperary General Hospital. Perhaps it would be an idea to try to speed this up in order that something could be done in conjunction with Tipperary to try to get this into Limerick before the winter. It takes 26 weeks to build these units off-site. Obviously, there are planning permission issues as well, but all that can be dealt with off-site. Twenty-six weeks is three months, so we still have time to try to get this in before winter kicks in. I would be very grateful if that could be considered.

I assure them that I will raise their concerns, including the point about the modular units, as soon as I can with the Minister, Deputy Harris. The point about the modular units may be of significant help in the coming months. I will also raise with the Minister the request that the mid-west be prioritised, particularly coming into 2019 with some more units becoming available, whether it be through modular units or opening up some of the beds in the units that are not available. I will raise all these points with the Minister as soon as I can.

and— notwithstanding the above, it is incumbent on the Government and the Dáil to use all other measures that could help accelerate the rapid delivery of public and affordable homes;further notes that:— the Central Statics Office identified 183,312 empty homes in 2016;— it must be a matter of urgency to take measures to return to use any and all vacant units, properties and sites suitable for residential use, particularly given that the Government’s Vacant Homes Strategy has delivered only 416 homes to local authorities in 2016 and 2017;— the delivery of social housing on private developments, through Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Part V), has been minimal with only 388 homes delivered in 2017;— the failure of Part V to deliver any affordable homes arises from the reduction of the Part V obligation from 20% to 10%;— slow delivery of residential development by the private sector has almost certainly been exacerbated by land hoarding, property speculation and the drip-feeding of development to keep property prices high;— with market prices of completed units at record levels, the cost of local authorities acquiring the Part V 10% obligation will, in many cases, be prohibitive and generally more expensive than the cost of local authority builds;— according to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, the all-in cost of building a new social housing unit is between €175,000 and €211,000, whereas average prices on the property market are now at €380,000 in Dublin, therefore, the cost of acquiring Part V units is enormously more expensive to local authorities than it would be to build on 10% of land acquired at existing-use-value;— waiting for the completion of units by private developers before acquiring the 10% will also mean, in many cases, a much slower delivery of public homes and uncertainty about the timeline of such delivery if the private developers decide to drip-feed development of sites, or sit on all or part of such sites for long periods of time for speculative purposes, or in expectation of higher market prices in the future; and— the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, has now discharged almost all of its debt obligations through property and asset sales, removing any justification for further disposal of development land or property that could be used to address the current housing emergency, but still controls, as of December 2017, 1,691 hectares of zoned residential land with capacity for 65,399 dwellings, and in Dublin alone controls land with the potential to build 43,075 dwellings;demands a radical shift in policy to address the housing and homelessness emergency which will contain as its central pillar the provision of public and affordable housing on publicly owned land; andnotwithstanding the above, demands in addition:— the establishment of multi-disciplinary empty home and property teams in each local authority, dedicated to proactively identifying vacant housing units, properties and sites with potential for refurbishment as residential units;— that empty home and property teams will, in the first instance, attempt to engage with property owners with a view to working with them to return to residential use the unit, property or site;— that, where suitable units, properties or sites are vacant for more than six months, without good reason, or where a property owner refuses to engage with the empty home and property teams, the local authority shall employ its compulsory acquisition powers to bring these units, properties or sites into use;— that the remit of the empty home and property teams will also include the identification of suitable vacant units, properties or sites owned by Government departments, semi-State agencies or agencies under the aegis of Government Departments, and the power to acquire the property for development as public and affordable housing;— that empty home and property teams shall include officers responsible for identifying suitable units, properties and sites and making contact with owners and all necessary qualified professionals such as architects, engineers, quantity surveyors etc. to ensure the timely return to use of all suitable units, properties and sites;— that empty home and property teams will set out options for vacant units, sites and properties to return them to residential use, which shall include a range of assistance measures;— that in any option where financial support is provided by local authorities for returning units to residential use, these units will be used for public and affordable housing;— that the Part V requirement be immediately increased from 10% social housing to a minimum of 20% public and affordable housing;— that where there has been any State aid for private development, such as the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), Home Building Finance Ireland or Strategic Development Zone designation, the Part V requirement would be a minimum of 30% (40% with LIHAF funding) public and affordable housing;— that all definitions of affordable housing are at a price that is accessible to those on incomes above the eligibility criteria for social housing and below €80,000 per annum, adhering to the standard of repayments being no more than 35% of net income after tax and social insurance;— that, in agreeing Part V arrangements with developers, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will, by regulation, instruct local authorities to prioritise, from now on, the transfer of land option rather than completed units, as the cheapest and most timely mechanism to deliver public and affordable housing, stipulating that the land transfer must be completed within six months of the decision date of the planning permission or the application will be deemed invalid; and— that the Government legislate immediately to change the mandate of NAMA to be a vehicle for public and affordable housing and ensure that it immediately ceases the sale or disposal of development land or residential units on the open market.”This motion is an attempt to ring the alarm bells about what I think is the underlying problem generating the current housing and homelessness emergency and to propose a number of radical but practical actions that could begin to address that crisis. The point we argue in this motion is that the intolerable human misery the current housing and homelessness emergency is causing is not an accident but rather arises from rampant land-hoarding, property speculation and profiteering by investors, landlords and developers and that the Government's policies are actively facilitating this rather than dealing with it and doing what is necessary, which is for the State itself to build in large quantities public and affordable housing on its own land. I think we have debated at length here the human misery aspect of this and the impossibility of the situation that huge numbers of people face, but it really is shameful. There are 10,000 families in emergency accommodation, 144,000 people on housing waiting lists, once one includes HAP and RAS fixed transfer lists, and hundreds of thousands of people paying extortionate rents and effectively locked out of the purchase market. The Ombudsman for Children's report today details many of the complaints coming into the ombudsman's office about the intolerable conditions that children living in emergency accommodation are having to suffer. There is further evidence of the madness of the property market, with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, saying rents have risen by 7%. The CSO figures show property prices rose 13% last year. The Government says it is trying to address all this, but then one considers the facts. Last year, 1,058 local authority housing units were built, there were 799 approved housing body builds and a pathetic 388 homes were delivered through Part V arrangements with the private sector. This is the background to the motion. As for private construction, we do not even know how many houses are being built. There is a major dispute about the number but we know whatever it is, it is abysmal. Goodbody states it is 9,000 but I suggest it is lower than that. There is another piece of evidence which has not yet entered the debate. If we only got 388 Part V units back, that means 3,888 private houses were built in developments of more than ten. While there would have been developments of less than ten units, are we really suggesting that as many as 5,000 to 8,000 units were in such developments? That is not credible. The output is miserable against a background of a catastrophic and worsening crisis.  In this motion, we state the reason for this is because both the State and the private sector are hoarding land and the private sector is simply speculating. Investors, landlords and developers are speculating on land and property prices to inflate the values of their holdings, often to flip them, but with no intention to build the housing necessary to address the housing crisis and they have absolutely no intention of providing that housing at levels that are affordable to the people who need it. The problem certainly is not one of a lack of zoned building land. Local authorities alone have enough zoned building land for 45,000 units. NAMA has enough building land for 65,000 units. However, the delivery on this is pathetic. In NAMA's case, only 7,000 units were delivered of a potential 65,000. Some 50,000 dwelling units could have been built on the land that NAMA sold to property vultures, speculators and so on but only 2,000 units were delivered. It is not just the left that is saying this. Even Brendan McDonagh from NAMA has said there is a hoarding problem.  The Government's measures have actually increased the profits, land values and property prices but have done nothing to force the pace of construction. The Part V requirement was reduced to 10%. When the Government initially announced LIHAF funding, we were told it would lead to 40% affordable housing, a figure that disappeared within a few weeks. Two years later, no affordable housing is being delivered and the Minister even refuses to define what affordable housing is. I believe the reason for that is because the private developers know that if the Government introduced a meaningful definition of "affordable", which was genuinely affordable, it would impact on the ability of the private investors and developers to make profits on those sites. That is why the Minister is not doing so. The Minister has supported changes to regulations regarding single aspect homes, no parking spaces, changes in capital gains tax, changes in building heights, all of which simply inflates land and property values to the benefit of the speculators but does nothing to deliver public and affordable housing.  In this motion, we propose measures to deal with that. First, the Government needs to build social and affordable housing on public land, then it needs to pursue an aggressive strategy to go after vacant sites and empty property. It must resource local authorities to do so and give them the power to use compulsory purchase orders to do so. It must change the Part V requirements in order that we get land for the local authorities to build on rather than leaving it in the hands of private developers to speculate. Finally, NAMA's mandate must be changed immediately. There should be no question of it selling off more land to vultures and investors but instead, NAMA should build directly on that land to provide public and affordable housing units.

Such is the scale of the housing crisis and the speed with which it continues to spiral out of control that we need an emergency programme of public house building to build homes for the many tens of thousands of people who long to have a secure and affordable home. This can be done. New data published this week show that local authorities and NAMA between them own enough zoned residential land to build 114,000 homes. They own three quarters of all residential zoned land in Dublin city, where the greatest crisis is, which is enough to build 71,000 homes. That is local authority and NAMA-owned land, zoned for residential purposes and ready for development. We know from figures recently provided by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government that one-bedroom homes can be built for just €144,000 while two-bedroom, three-bedroom and four-bedroom units can be built for between €150,000 and €158,000, €167,000 and €177,000, respectively. In recent months, Solidarity has brought forward costed plans for public and affordable housing in a number of local areas. In my constituency of Dublin West, we proposed Damastown as a social and affordable project and did the same in respect of Kilcarberry in South Dublin County Council and at the Old Whitechurch Road in Cork city. Solidarity has also explained the various tax raising measures that can be taken to raise the required investment expenditure to the Minister many times. That is without mentioning the Apple revenue.  The Government prefers to protect the financially unsustainable and morally indefensible tax haven status that it and a succession of its predecessors have created over decades. However, the Government is not alone in its moral bankruptcy, it is an international phenomenon. Overnight, we learned that a very modest tax proposed in Seattle to fund housing for the homeless has been crushed by a combination of Amazon, one of the world's largest companies, and its political allies in the Democratic Party. Like the Government, these people think that the interests of corporations must always come before the interests of the 99% and even of the most vulnerable in our society. We know that we own the land and that the land is already zoned for residential purposes. We know that homes can be built at a cost that ensures rents and prices for the completed homes can be affordable for all and we know that the revenue to fund the construction works can be raised. All the component parts required to provide the public housing solutions for which young people and families are crying out are available with one exception, namely, political will. It is not a political priority.  In 2017, under the Minister's watch, the number of homes built for local authorities came to a grand total of 235 across the four Dublin local authority areas. The Minister's failure could hardly be more complete. He continues with his ideologically-driven commitment to market-based pro-landlord policies. A year ago, the Minister said of Rebuilding Ireland that it had "already achieved a great deal with more good things to come". He continued by noting "We’re going to have to keep on driving this but I think we can meet our target soon.” Can the Minister tell us which target he has in mind? If he has a target for creating misery, he has well surpassed it. Rebuilding Ireland has been exposed as the longest love letter to landlords ever written. Billions of euro in public money have been poured into their pockets under the guise of housing policy initiatives, all of which have failed for ordinary people, exactly as we said they would. Who pays for the Minister's commitment to neoliberalism, to landlordism and to developers? It is the 10,000 people in emergency accommodation who pay, including 3,000 children. It is the 800,000 people living in rental accommodation who pay through ruinously expensive rent and it is the more than half a million young adults forced to live with their parents who pay. The crisis is deepening and young people and families are suffering. Many of them are just one rent increase away from losing their home. We need public housing now. The building of public housing on a large scale will be the main pillar of the solution to the housing crisis. As the motion states, there are perhaps 180,000 or more empty residential units in the country but the number of vacant properties that have been returned to use as homes is pitiful. Only 416 houses returned to local authorities in 2016 and 2017. The motion also calls for a change to NAMA’s mandate to make it a vehicle for public and affordable housing, which should have been done from the outset but which now should be done today.These much-needed measures need to be taken to bring a significant number of vacant properties into use as homes, which can supplement essential public house building.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	300	We are now a year into the reign of the Taoiseach. The approach to the housing crisis demonstrated by his Government perfectly encapsulates its approach generally. There are two key elements and sides to the Government of Deputy Varadkar. On one side is a vicious, neoliberal, anti-working class policy that rhetorically demonises and economically attacks working class communities while, on the other, is an extensive spin operation to hide that reality. Housing sums this up. Plan after plan has been unveiled multiple times and to much fanfare. Each one has rested upon the idea of incentivising private developers or landlords to provide housing by funnelling more money in their direction and resolutely refuses to break with neoliberal ideology by investing in building public homes on public land, which has had the consequence of the housing crisis worsening daily. The response of the Government under the Taoiseach's chief ally, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is not to resolve the housing crisis by reducing the number of people who are homeless through getting them into homes but instead to juke the statistics. It sums up the approach of the Government: neoliberalism on the one hand and, on the other, extensive spin to try to hide the reality of what is taking place. Unfortunately for the Government, people are living in this reality and they see right through the spin. There are many different victims of the Government's policy of putting landlord and developer profits before people's need for housing but particular groups are more adversely affected. These include working class people, low-paid people, migrants, Travellers and women. However, I would like to focus on young people. The statistics from the most recent census are stark. In 1991, the age at which the majority of people were homeowners was 26; in 2016, it was 35. In 1991, the age at which two thirds were homeowners was 28; in 2016 that became 41. That census highlighted that more than 450,000 adults were living at home with parents as well as the massive increases in rents. These figures are significantly behind the current pace, with rent increases of approximately 60% over the past five years. Behind those statistics is a human tale of young people who are unable to access secure housing and who are living in precarious and insecure housing conditions with all the consequential impacts on physical and mental health, living conditions, working conditions and so on. I will refer to a particular cohort of young people, which is students. Many thousands are doing their leaving certificate examinations today. In September and October, many will move on to third level education away from home. However, they are now facing a scenario where all the student accommodation under construction is being built by private developers and offered at full market rates. Student accommodation is increasingly unaffordable. There was the phenomenon of DCU students' union being forced to campaign against what was called the "Shanowen shakedown" in which the cost of student accommodation increased from €7,000 per year to €9,000 per year in one year.  A DIT campus survey shows that average rent is €541 per month for students, with many paying more. The figure last year was €508. The consequence of all of that, which DIT points to, is the phenomenon of commuter students - students travelling long distances because it makes economic sense - and all of the associated impacts in terms of their academic and college lives and the impact on the college and third level institutions as a whole. At the worst extreme, there is the growing phenomenon of students living in cars to access third level accommodation. These are the conditions into which they are being put. There is no alternative on offer. What situation are they in after they finish third level or if, perhaps, they do not go on to third level? In most cases, because of the conditions of precarious work and low pay which the Government also encourages, they are trapped at home. They become part of that 500,000 young people who are trapped at home or perhaps, if they are lucky, they may be in a job that is paid well enough to allow them to get into the rented sector, where conditions are also precarious. They face all the consequences of the precarious nature of the private rental sector as a result of the policies pursued by the Government. I would like to address a number of the myths that have been popularised in respect of these issues. When reference was made to forced emigration, the previous Taoiseach regularly used to talk about how young people enjoy travelling. He suggested that is why they were going abroad in the context of mass unemployment. We are now subject to a similar patronising view regarding people's living conditions and working conditions. It is suggested that young people do not mind being in precarious housing or precarious work. They are forced into this as a result of the policies of the Government and the free market system it defends. The other contemporary myth is the reports from daft.ie on rocketing rents year-on-year and month-on-month suggest are only a partial snapshot because in reality many people are accessing housing through social media and so on. Many young people are forced to access housing outside of the regular traditional channels and, because of the demand for housing, landlords do not feel the need to go through daft.ie or whatever. However, they capture the reality that rents are absolutely rocketing. That is a truth that cannot be denied and no one should attempt to hide behind that idea. There is, however, an alternative. When we talk about social and affordable housing and public building programmes, we refer to programmes that are precisely aimed at catering for the needs of young people in their 20s and 30s and aimed at student accommodation, which should be publicly built. The mortgage and private ownership model is failing young people because capitalism, on the one hand, wants people to pay a massive price to access what should be a basic right to housing, while, on the other hand, it pays people less and gives them less for their work. The answer here is public housing.

and— the progression of large-scale mixed-tenure housing projects, with social, affordable and private housing, on publicly-owned lands;— that the Government has also introduced targeted and time-bound measures to limit excessive rent increases (e.g. through Rent Pressure Zones), and to provide further protections and effective support services to both tenants and landlords;— that, in Budget 2018, significant obstacles to building more homes more quickly were removed, by:— investing more capital funding in direct house-building by the State;— removing the Capital Gains Tax incentive to hold on to residential land, as well as escalating penalties for land hoarding; and— providing a new, more affordable finance vehicle for builders through House Building Finance Ireland (HBFI);— that these measures are having a positive impact, with all relevant indicators clearly showing that the supply-based measures under Rebuilding Ireland are working, with latest planning permissions and commencements data up 27 per cent and 23 per cent year-on-year respectively, and house scheme registrations up 35 per cent;— that a new National Regeneration and Development Agency is being established under Project Ireland 2040 in line with the compact growth objective and targets in the National Planning Framework;— the Government’s commitment to addressing the affordability pressures faced by some households, particularly low- and moderate-income households in the major urban centres, through:— the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, which provides long-term, fixed rate mortgages for first-time buyers;— the imminent activation of a new Affordable Homes Scheme that will leverage affordable properties from publicly-owned lands;— provision of at least €25 million infrastructure funding under the new Serviced Sites Fund, with a call for proposals to issue later this month, to deliver lower-cost affordable housing from local authority sites;— the development of large-scale cost rental initiatives in Dublin to help deliver new homes at affordable levels; and— new ‘Build to Rent’ and ‘co-living’ planning guidelines which will facilitate investment and innovative design of more rental accommodation at more affordable rents."I thank the Deputies for the opportunity once again to debate this most important of issues. The motion and the countermotions speak to many different issues. Housing is after all a complex matter. I will use this opportunity to address what the Government is doing in this area. While it is a complex matter, supply is the most important aspect and, until supply hits the point at which it needs to be, controlling issues such as rent, protecting those who are most vulnerable and making sure that we have more than enough emergency accommodation available to the highest standards is equally as important.  This is not like clicking one's fingers. Deputy Paul Murphy talked about ringing the alarm bell. The alarm bell was rung and it was heard. Rebuilding Ireland is the response to that, but as we build more homes we have to make sure that, as they are built, we do not make the mistakes of the past because we are building a home for a person's life and for at least 60 years. If one is going to build, one has to make sure that one avoids the mistakes we made in the past, including building where there is no demand for houses; building where there are no infrastructural connections or services; building where there are no local amenities; building in a way that is not compact spatially and which causes sprawl and all the additional problems that come with it; or building without considering that we are building more than just buildings, but communities as well. For that reason, mixed tenure will be important as we build into the future.  We have to build in the right way and that is a challenge even in the normal course of events. However, we did not experience normal course of events following the collapse of the economy and the construction sector in the years 2007 to 2011. Construction in the economy fell by 90%, and house prices fell by 50% and continued to fall into 2012. That is why we stood down the affordability scheme. In that year, and the years after, affordability was not an issue. Hundreds of thousands of people fell into negative equity. Many continue to be in negative equity, despite recent house price inflation. We are still 20% to 23% off the peak of house prices in the past and while the latest information is that house prices are increasing, there was a dramatic slowdown in the first quarter of this year.If that trend continues, we will see single-digit inflation in the course of 2018. Employment in the construction sector had fallen by two thirds, with a legacy of 3,000 ghost estates. Local authorities were saddled with large land debts. This was the legacy that we inherited. It was what we had to turn around and it is what we are turning around. In 2012, house affordability was not an issue. Negative equity and ghost estates were the issue. We needed social housing then but it had almost exclusively been outsourced to the private sector through the Part V process. That collapsed as well. Getting local authorities back into house building would take time but social house building, looking after the most vulnerable, was our first priority. From almost a standing start with a very low base of delivery in 2013 and 2014, the Government increased the delivery of new-build social houses, with 664 having been built in 2016 and 2,297 last year. The number is expected to rise to 4,409 this year. This increase was because I took the decision last year to build 30% more in 2018 to expand supply rather than compete from existing supply for the new social housing homes. When one includes homes acquired on long-term leases, the figure rises to 7,900 new homes in 2018. I refer to real homes for real people. Social housing is not delivered like it was 30 years ago. New technologies and new streams that complement each other are being used to deliver social housing homes into the stock of social housing and each home is a real home. Almost 27,000 tenancies will be supported in 2018 through these new homes and through the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme. I would not have chosen to rely on HAP so much but, until new homes are built, we have to. Otherwise these people would have no homes. In 2020 and 2021, the final two years of Rebuilding Ireland, we will house more people in social housing homes than in the HAP-supported private rental sector. Therefore, we are progressively rebalancing the social housing stock back towards new-build homes - public housing delivered by the State. By the end of the period of Rebuilding Ireland, 50,000 new homes — real homes – will have been added to the stock of social housing. This is thanks to an additional €0.5 billion that I secured last year, meaning we have a war chest of some €6 billion in taxpayers' money ring-fenced to build social housing directly as a State into the future. Under Project Ireland 2040, we will deliver almost 12,000 new social housing homes a year to 2027 at least. This is what we are doing for social housing supply. One cannot spin these improvements negatively, even though people will try. We are going to double the number of new homes built this year. This is public money going into public housing. That is going to make a real difference for thousands of families, as it did last year and as it will again this year. Vacancy is an important tool but it is not the low-hanging fruit people think it is. The repair and lease scheme, in its first iteration, is proof of that. The buy and renew scheme has proven more successful. People will say we have not got a strategy because we have not published it but, of course, if I did publish one, Members would then say I was just making announcements and not doing the actual work. The work is being done, however. There is a vacant homes unit in the Department and there are vacant homes officers and teams in local authorities. Vacanthomes.ie helps the public to identify potential vacant properties. There are new laws in place to tackle vacancy over the shop. There are new incentives to put vacant units back into use, and CPO powers are being used by local authorities. There are not 180,000 vacant homes to be put back into use, probably not even 10% of that number. We have, however, brought approximately 9,000 social council houses that were vacant back into use since 2014. All are homes for families and individuals to live in. If the ESB figure is massively overstated in regard to new builds, it must be associated with vacant units coming back into use that were not connected for two years or more. Either way, it is new homes being brought back into supply. Of course, social housing is only one part of the supply issue we face. Management of the existing stock is the other. The private market needs to be rebuilt also. Therefore, we have the new fast-track planning process, which has proven its worth over the past year, with almost 3,000 residential homes being approved through it. More than 3,000 student bed spaces were made available - that was only to April of this year. There are new guidelines to promote the building of more apartments - build-to-rent apartments in addition to co-living apartments. We have LIHAF funding of €200 million to open up landbanks to facilitate the delivery of 20,000 new homes by 2021. Home Building Finance Ireland will help small builders throughout the country to build developments with ten units or more. It will be announced very shortly having gone to Cabinet on Tuesday of this week. A new national development and regeneration agency will be established under Project Ireland 2040. The vacant site levy is in place. Last year, I doubled it for the beginning of next year, which will help with land hoarding. By the beginning of 2017 the labour force in construction had increased by least 14%. All these measures have helped to increase the supply of housing and they are working. Planning permissions were up 27% in 2017 by comparison with 2016. Over 18,000 new homes were on site in the past 12 months, up 27% on the previous 12 months. There were just under 20,000 new electricity connections. Vacant or not, these are homes that were not being used by families or individuals but which have been used in the past 12 months. The Central Bank of Ireland is forecasting 23,000 new homes this year and 27,000 new homes next year. Registrations for larger schemes are up 41% on the previous 12 months from March 2017. These figures cannot be disputed. While there is a dispute over the actual build achieved in any given year, I did mandate work last year to make sure we could get a more accurate figure. That work will be completed very shortly. The supply of social housing and private housing is increasing dramatically. When we consider rents and house prices, particularly in Dublin, affordability is a serious issue. It is a serious and genuine concern of the Government. The recent rent index for quarter one from the RTB is welcome. What we are seeing is a dramatic slowdown in rent price increases from one quarter to the next. There is 0.4% rent inflation nationally and 1% rent inflation in Dublin. It was 1.1% in the previous quarter. Perhaps more significantly, we saw a drop in rents in counties surrounding Dublin, namely Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. In practical terms, the average rent for a house in Dublin rose by €1 in the past three months, while the average rent for an apartment in Dublin rose by approximately €18. Rents are still too high in almost every part of the country, but particularly in the cities and larger urban centres. The data show that rent pressure zones are working and we will continue to drive them, but they need to be strengthened. More legislation is coming to bring more transparency, accountability and affordability to the rental sector. That will be a central focus of my work over the coming weeks as we seek to strengthen rent pressure zones, the RTB and the rental sector in general. A lot of progress has been made towards introducing the first cost-rental project of scale in one of our cities. Cost rental will become a major part of our rental landscape in the future. Of course, affordability still remains a big problem when buying, particularly in our cities. That is why, in the coming days, I will recommence the affordability Act in line with the commitment made at the beginning of the year. I issued a call to local authorities for local authority land for the serviced sites fund for affordable housing, which amounts to at least €25 million. It may be increased. This will work in tandem with the affordability commitments that have already been given for sites such as those at O'Devaney Gardens and Poolbeg. Affordability has already been achieved, as under the Ó Cualann model, between the State, through Dublin City Council, and an approved housing body. We are now going to do this at scale. These provisions will allow for the new affordable purchase scheme, which was also signalled earlier in the year. In this regard, we have identified land and finance for 4,000 affordable homes, with an additional 10,000 homes to come on local authority land alone. In February of this year, I launched a new Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which is the new affordable home loan for first-time buyers to access 2% finance for 25 years, offering real certainty of mortgage repayments. It is estimated that this first tranche will provide 1,000 loans to give people who have deposits the opportunity to buy a home and who have been squeezed out of the market because of mortgage affordability. Over 50% of all applicants to date, including 61% of applicants in May 2018, are being approved for this new loan by the Housing Agency. It is worth noting that in the 12 months up to October last year, 67% of first-time buyers in the greater Dublin area, Cork and Galway purchased their homes for less than €320,000. In the rest of the country, 90% of people purchase their homes for less than €250,000. Clearly, however, affordability is an issue in our larger cities. These measures will tackle it. When it comes to people who are sleeping rough on our streets, even though the number is down 40% to just over 100 people, it is still too many. Words about supply and words about protections in the rental sector are cold comfort. We have increased our supports for outreach teams. Through the cold weather initiative, we dramatically increased the number of beds and successfully brought more people into the system. The system of emergency accommodation is operated to the highest standards with our partner NGO organisations, which operate it with taxpayer funding on behalf of the State. There are more than 9,000 people in emergency accommodation, including 1,700 or more families. That is a crisis. It is my first and highest priority. Two reports are imminent and will detail new policy responses that are needed. We will get a chance to debate them in the Oireachtas committee next week. There is still a significant number of families in hotels and B&Bs. One family is one too many. Last year, more than 2,000 families exited hotels and B&Bs, the majority into homes. We have more than 500 family spaces under our new hub programme, with 450 more to come throughout the rest of the year. The time a family spends in a family hub is dramatically less than that spent in a hotel. Presentations in Dublin have stabilised, according to the Dublin authorities. With regard to the motion, of course I recognise there is more work to do. If we are to be successful as an Oireachtas in improving what we are doing when we introduce legislation to improve and strengthen the rental sector, we have to recognise the great gains that have already been made while of course recognising there is more work to do.

Having said that, there are aspects of the motion that I welcome and that I believe we could work with. It is disheartening to come in here every couple of weeks to have more debates on housing, which is crucial. It is like Groundhog Day. The Minister's contribution is not rooted in reality; it is rooted in fantasy. Some Members spoke about obtaining private land by way of compulsory purchase order, CPO. That may be part of the solution in terms of using a stick to acquire vacant homes but the State is the most guilty party for not using State owned land. We have 3,008 ha of State owned land that can deliver 114,000 homes for people. Earlier this week I visited Dublin Central with my colleague, Mary Fitzpatrick. We went to O'Devaney Gardens, which the Minister mentioned. It is a 14 acre prime urban site less than 1 km from O'Connell Street that is zoned and serviced for housing. It has all the facilities including a frequent bus service and a Luas service. It is within walking distance of Heuston Station and the Phoenix Park on the way into town. In December 2016, the Government promised €17.9 million to build 56 units on a site that used to accommodate more than 600 families. In 2016, the Government said that this was the most important housing development in the country. In 2016, O'Devaney Gardens was the most important housing development in Rebuilding Ireland. It was to be the Government's flagship housing development under its much quoted Rebuilding Ireland. When I visited this week with Mary Fitzpatrick, more than two years on from the announcement made by the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister's predecessor, the Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, there were no new homes, no children playing, no builders, no diggers, no hoarding and no construction. There was nothing. Down the road from that the Magdalen laundry site in Sean MacDermott Street is another example of the State's lack of commitment and ambition to deliver affordable homes. It is a 2 acre site less than half a kilometre from O'Connell Street which transferred from private ownership to the State as a form of compensation. What is happening with it now? Dublin City Council, DCC, is proposing to sell this valuable State owned land which is zoned and serviced for housing because the Government has failed to provide an affordable housing scheme. The day after I moved our motion on establishing an affordable housing scheme on 17 May, the Minister came into the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and said he would commence an affordable housing scheme. He has said again that he will do that but when will he do it? When will the regulations come in? How long will we have to wait? I visited another part of Dublin, Ballymun, recently with a colleague of mine, Councillor Paul McAuliffe. The Minister mentioned Ó Cualann. I met with representatives of Ó Cualann and saw vast acres of other serviced land owned by the State that is not developed. More than 700 homes were to be built on the Oscar Traynor Road site in Santry but what have we done? We have asked for expressions of interest but there has not been any building on the site. When we came back into Dublin Central Mary Fitzpatrick showed me State owned property. I want to deal with that element when we talk about refurbishment and putting accommodation back in. I went to Constitution Hill flats, St. Mary's Place on Dorset Street, Matt Talbot Court in Summerhill, St. Finbarr's Court in Cabra and Dominick Street flats, all of which began to be de-tenanted about ten years ago for refurbishment. The city council tells me it has not been given any money from central government to refurbish those properties. I saw hundreds of units boarded up on Monday of this week. I saw ten, 12 or 14 apartments boarded up on the first floor. On the second floor I met families whose adult children and their grandchildren are living in those flats while walking past empty units owned by the State that we can control and do something about that. It beggars belief that we are here talking about this issue again when we cannot even get our act together in terms of the properties we own. It is a scandal. We went to the Herbert Simms designed flats in Chancery House, which are in a brilliant location and fully serviced. The council staff came up and repainted them but has the Minister seen the state of the inside of the flats? I met families who are dealing with condensation, and we are doing nothing about that. The purpose of this motion, which I welcome and to which I have tabled an amendment on behalf of my party, is to get something moving on this issue because nothing is happening. The Minister's contribution earlier was not grounded in fact. It was absolute fantasy. He said the social and affordable housing supply is being dramatically increased. Is he kidding me? We built 396 houses last year and he bought the rest. We are failing on this issue. We need to work together as an Oireachtas to start building homes and stop people falling into homelessness.

I suggest he should be clicking his fingers. He should be getting those houses built. There is absolutely nothing happening in that regard. Since coming into power, the Government has launched Construction 2020, a Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, the Social Housing Strategy 2020, Rebuilding Ireland 2016 and the 2012, 2015 and 2018 plans. Apart from that, there were six separate plans excluding the other numerous relaunches. That was what the strategic communications unit, SCU, was up to. It was trying to give the people the impression that the Minister was doing something about this issue and it worked with some. People are in crisis, not only in the city but throughout this country. I will give the Minister an example from my constituency of a widow who gets up early in the morning and works five days a week. She has a son in college and a girl in secondary school. She has an income of €26,000. She cannot qualify for council housing or a loan. She is being hopped around renting accommodation and when the landlord feels like it, she is pushed out of it. What is happening to people up and down this country is disgraceful. It is a shame, yet nothing constructive is being done about it. The Minister brought forward a package of measures last January to address the question of affordability. However, the package is entirely empty. Three schemes were announced but it is a case of reheating old promises and delivering nothing new. We had the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, the affordable purchase scheme and the affordable rent scheme; I could go on. The Minister, and the Taoiseach, have failed on this issue. They should get to grips with it and stop blaming what happened with Fianna Fáil at the time of the collapse of the economy. He should remember that most of his people at the time were complaining that we were not doing enough in terms of planning decisions and building more houses. He only has to read the Official Report in that regard.

We know what is happening. Rent prices are out of control. That is the case across my county of Wexford, whether it is Enniscorthy, Gorey, Wexford town or New Ross. In particular, vulnerable people - older people, single people and carers - are being priced out of the market. Housing prices are ballooning. Ordinary people are priced out of the market and working families cannot afford to buy a home. We were warned in 2012 that this would happen. When I was a candidate in the county council election in 2014 I was told by Government councillors to stop complaining, that it takes a year or two to build houses and that it would be done. It is now 2018 and houses are still not being built. I want to address three bugbears of mine, one of which is the family income supplement, FIS. If someone wants to go on the housing list, FIS is deemed as an income and therefore many families are over the threshold and cannot get on the housing list. For someone who wants to get a council mortgage, FIS is deemed as a social welfare support and they cannot get a council mortgage. The Government should make up its mind one way or the other. Is it income or a social welfare support? On the housing adaptation grant, €6,000 was the maximum amount available. That was fine up to about two years ago in that if a bathroom needed to be adapted for someone with a disability they would get quotes for about €8,000. Those quotes are coming in now at €16,000 and €18,000. Unfortunately, that is the going rate, and engineers will say that. If a bathroom needs to be adapted for someone with dementia and their carer is on an invalidity pension, that €10,000 of a difference may as well be €1 million. They cannot get it. I ask the Minister to consider increasing the €6,000 maximum amount. He might put it as a percentage similar to the housing adaptation grant. There is a lack of apprenticeships. We also need to allow apprentices increase their skills. I refer to having four men and four women in centres. Upskilling is vitally important. The market is failing. That needs to be addressed, but the Minister needs to step up to the mark.

That is nothing short of a disaster. I note the Taoiseach's comments on homelessness in Ireland being low by international standards. However, even if one person is homeless, that is one person too many. In west Cork, homelessness is not a major problem but that is because three and sometimes four generations are living together in a house, which leads to its own problems.People looking for houses in west Cork have a huge problem. Rents are spiralling out of control, particularly in urban areas, and rent now consumes a huge proportion of take-home pay. This is not sustainable. People on the social housing list are reliant on the choice-based letting system. They go online week after week to no avail. Often there are no properties available. In addition to those who find themselves caught in the aforementioned circumstances, I wish to speak about a constituent I am helping. He unexpectedly finds himself caring for his extremely ill wife. The couple have a substantial mortgage and they are at serious risk of losing their home but they simply cannot keep up with the mortgage payments. The banks are unwilling to renegotiate in any significant way. Fianna Fáil will set out amendments to this motion, following our motion some weeks ago. Meaningful action must be taken on this matter immediately. It is time to forget about the Government's spin and rhetoric, at which it is very good. If it was half as good at providing houses we would not be speaking about this issue today. It is time to make houses available and to enact progressive policy that will alleviate the massive problem many of my constituents are experiencing. The Government is currently sleepwalking through this problem.

He certainly is not codding people on the ever-increasing and expanding housing lists. There is a deplorable record in providing social housing units. The lack of affordable private housing is pushing an increasing number of people onto the housing lists and into homelessness. According to the latest figures for Louth, there were 124 people in emergency accommodation in April. In addition, the current high price of housing reflects a substantial shortage of housing units. Irish building firms are engaged in building large apartment blocks for international fund management companies as the return on investment is high owing to increased rent year on year. Until our indigenous building firms go back to providing affordable housing, with the backing of the State-owned banks, we will not see an increase in the number of houses available for purchase by the ordinary, hard-working people of the country. While the Taoiseach has lauded my local authority, Louth County Council, for its record with compulsory purchase orders and bringing vacant units back into use, there are still 4,506 families on Louth County Council's housing list seeking housing. That is the total of people on the housing list and people availing of HAP. Louth County Council is proposing to build 850 housing units over a three-year period. When one calculates the housing waiting list figures per annum one quickly discovers that where the period of waiting on the housing list used to be eight to ten years in Louth, people going on that housing list today will be waiting for 16 years. If the Minister calls that progress he is codding himself. This is a crisis and we must deal with it immediately.
#JackieCahill	unknown-#JackieCahill-party	unknown-#JackieCahill-dob	unknown-#JackieCahill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	315	Housing policy is one of the key areas where the Government has a direct impact on the lives of the people. The opportunity to live in a family home, where one has protections and rights, has been a fundamental right in our society for generations. A Government that does not honour this fundamental right will ultimately fail its people. By any yardstick, the past two Fine Gael-led Governments have failed the people in terms of the provision of a working housing policy. Families are suffering as a result. The Minister has a responsibility to create a number of housing options but he has failed to do so. He has a responsibility to create a social housing policy that can be implemented by local authorities whereby low-income families can get a house appropriate to their needs at a rent appropriate to their income. This has not happened. Our local housing authorities, the county councils, have been turned into a giant administrative bureaucracy to distribute money from the Government to the private rental sector. Couples whose incomes are not high enough to allow them to engage with the retail banks have been offered Rebuilding Ireland, which is so badly funded and full of so much red tape it will never address the housing needs of the specific demographic for which it was intended. Worse still, it is sending those young couples to a lifetime of housing uncertainty in the private rental sector. Couples whose incomes allow them to source a mortgage with the high street banks are at the mercy of an inflated market, due to the lack of housing supply. The Government must accept full responsibility for that. The final failure of this Government's housing policy is the manner in which it has allowed the banks to ride roughshod over families in mortgage arrears. The banks have no plan other than repossession or to sell distressed mortgages at a knock-down price to the vulture funds. The same banks trousered billions of euro from the bailout provided to them by Irish taxpayers a few short years ago.

This applied to families who had inherited a property from a family member but the property was not fit to live in. The local authority would do up the house, the family on the housing list would occupy it and over a period of five, ten, 15 or 20 years they would repay the money that was spent on refurbishing the house. That solved a problem for that family. To my knowledge that scheme has been dormant for at least eight years. I ask the Minister to reintroduce it immediately as it would get a number of families off the list, particularly in my constituency. The second issue is that, according to the latest local property tax register, there are over 400 estates where property tax is not being paid because they are unfinished and require work to be done on them. There are probably a number of unoccupied properties in all those estates. My low-water estimate is that there are between 3,000 and 5,000 houses in the country that have been built but have yet to be occupied. A small level of investment would put those properties on the market. It is another area where the Minister could get people off the housing list. The properties are tied up in NAMA, the banks and in distressed mortgages. I ask the Minister to establish a specific task force in each county to assess the number of those properties and get them occupied immediately.

Of course, we are all aware that supply is key. We are waiting for it to come into the market and that is a major problem. It is slow, and we must acknowledge that. If we do, we can try to work together to make it happen more quickly. However, there are issues we can deal with immediately. I have been in contact with the Minister's office on a number of them. The HAP and rent supplement payments are causing homelessness. The Minister said that rents have increased by 0.4% in Kildare. The problem is that the rent for a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Kildare is €1,500 and the HAP payment for the family unit to accommodate the house is approximately €1,250, so there is a gap. The family has a choice, either to remain homeless or to get supports from their family to acquire the house. When they bring the letters of guarantee from family members to support them in getting off the street they are not accepted by the local authority under the Department's guidelines. That means they remain homeless. These are issues that could be dealt with immediately to help people in the short term to move from homelessness into a temporary home. We know people on the social housing lists are not being offered houses because there are few available. However, what about people who do not qualify to go on the social housing list? They are marginally outside it because of means. They are in no man's land. They want to provide for themselves but they are unable to access credit or funds to purchase a house. The home loan the Minister mentioned is not working. Statistics show there is a very slow uptake of it and very few approvals. Development of local authority land is key. The local authorities own large landbanks in my county and other counties that could help to deliver affordable housing. The local authorities already own the land and the Government could borrow on the European markets at a little over 0%. That would contribute to bringing down the cost of the houses. I wish to make a final point. The reason the private sector is slow is because of the planning process, which the Minister suggests is helping and fast-tracking it.I have spoken to people in the private sector and if they are applying to An Bord Pleanála for more than 100 units it is taking 14 months from start to finish. I can prove that and give the Minister the statistics to back it up. They are also having difficulty accessing credit. The Minister knows that LIHAF is slow and not working. He knows it is not providing the funding for the land that needs to be opened up for development. We have proof of that in my constituency of Kildare North and it is true nationally. It is not working and not delivering at the rate intended.

I warmly welcome the People Before Profit motion, which we are enthusiastically supporting. I am running out of adjectives to describe the Minister's speeches to the House. I do not say that to be in any way personal. The gap between what the Minister is telling us week in and week out and the reality we are all experiencing in our constituencies is growing ever greater. Let us consider his record. Homelessness has increased consistently since he took office. Child homelessness has increased by a shocking 27% while pensioner homelessness has increased by a shocking 32%. The Minister is wrong in his interpretation of the RTB figures. The board does not agree with him, based on its presentation to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government yesterday. Throughout the State rents have increased by 7.1% in the past year. In Dublin, they have increased by 7.8% in the past year. The 4% cap that applies to Dublin, Galway, Cork, etc. is, therefore, not working. There is no evidence for the Minister to base his comments on quarterly interpretations. The rent cap applies for a year and those caps are being breached right across the country, either because the exemptions are too generous or because people are breaking the rules. The Minister is due to bring legislation before the House which we will support because it will give the RTB more powers of enforcement. However, the Minister would do himself and the rest of us a favour if he correctly interpreted his own agency's figures. While we can dispute the figures, I accept there is an increase in housing supply, but it is not reducing cost. There is no evidence that prices for houses in high-demand areas are reducing. How many affordable homes has the Minister or his predecessor delivered through Government schemes in two years? The answer is "zero". I do not dispute that the supply of social housing is increasing, but the rate remains glacial. Funding is not sufficient, bureaucracy is still far too great and there is a chronic over-reliance on the private sector to the tune of 70% of social housing delivery over the course of the Government's plan - those are the Minister's figures, not mine. The Minister will be 12 months in office tomorrow and circumstances are much worse for thousands of families now. I wish to focus on one of the important parts of the motion, which is vacant homes. It has slightly slipped off our radar in housing discussions, which is a mistake. The first line on the Rebuilding Ireland website refers to 183,000 vacant homes, according to the CSO. I accept the Minister is right; there are not 183,000 vacant homes. GeoDirectory has put the figure at 96,000 and the Minister has said it might be only 10% of the original figure, which would be 18,000. We do not know how many, but we know there are a lot. How many homes has the Government brought back into use from that stock? Based on the reply to the most recent parliamentary question, we know through repair and leasing the number of tenancies created is nine. We know that from build and renew the total is approximately 70. Of the purchases from the Housing Agency, it is about 400. This means that fewer than 500 homes from the 18,000, 96,000 or 183,000 have been brought into play in the past two years. Those statistics speak volumes about the Government's failure. The Minister is also disingenuous to suggest that we are wrong to criticise him for not publishing the strategy. His predecessor, the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, had it almost finished. It was on the Minister's desk. We all made submissions with constructive suggestions, but we have never seen it. I suspect we have never seen it because if the Minister published a strategy, we could then hold him to account for his failure to implement it. We need to see clear targets for every local authority to bring vacant homes back into use, whatever the number. We need dedicated officers in every local authority. Some have them; some do not but they are required. We need a register of vacant properties held by local authorities so that people know the number of properties in their area and clear action plans with greater funding than has been provided to date. We also need a vacant-home tax for those, including banks, who have been wilfully and speculatively sitting on vacant properties and not to punish families in the fair deal scheme or stuck in probate. I fully support the proposal to increase the Part V requirements. I fully support the critique and proposed changes to LIHAF. I warmly welcome the renewed call to amend the NAMA mandate. Without those changes, we will never achieve the level of affordability required. I support the motion and I urge the Minister at least to publish the strategy on vacant homes he claims to have so that we can start to see whether it is delivering anything.

When people are without a secure home, everything else can fall apart. Physical and mental health, nutrition, education, relationships and work all suffer. There is no greater way to rob opportunity or steal a child's future than to make that child homeless. The Government is in large part the architect of the housing crisis. For years Fine Gael has been allergic to State investment in housing. Fine Gael has radically distorted the housing market by the introduction of unfair tax incentives to vulture funds and to international landlords. Of course, for years Fine Gael has had a policy of inertia when it comes to dealing with landowners sitting on vacant properties. However, it gets worse. In the middle of the most grievous housing crisis in generations, the Government is one of the largest owners of vacant properties, and is doing precious little to resolve it. Three years ago, I tabled a parliamentary question to all Departments and State agencies. I discovered that they were presiding over thousands of acres of vacant land and that buildings owned by the State and comprising space totalling 155,000 sq. ft were standing idle. These are not lands owned by NAMA or other development agencies. These are just Departments sitting on land and doing nothing about it. An example of that is the folly of Thornton Hall, a 150-acre site right beside the M50 bought in 2005 for €50 million. The reply to the parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for Justice and Equality stated that the land is being used for the production of potatoes. That shows exactly where the Government is with regard to this crisis. In recent weeks, I tabled another parliamentary question to get an update on those buildings. The vast majority of those that were standing idle three years ago are still idle today under Government ownership. They are vacant, empty and derelict, just like this Government.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	324	I commend and thank People Before Profit for tabling this timely motion. The Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael-led Governments of recent decades have contributed to the worst housing crisis in decades. Some 10,000 citizens are in emergency accommodation, homelessness among pensioners is on the increase, and a total of 3,689 children are homeless. Child homelessness has increased by 7% under Fine Gael-led governments. Almost 150,000 people are on waiting lists with thousands more, including students, paying unaffordable rents. Yesterday the RTB confirmed rents are still increasing and have reached new peaks. Behind these statistics, families struggling to keep a roof over their heads are desperately trying to put together the money to find a home they can afford. Tomorrow marks the anniversary of the Taoiseach's first year in office. Earlier today he listed his successes. He did not - he could not - include the provision of homes for citizens. The stresses and strains on tens of thousands of families are enormous. Everyone should have the right to a home. Mar a deirtear i nGaeilge, níl aon tinteán mar do thinteán féin. An internal memo to the HSE psychiatric teams in Dublin published by The Irish Times warned of the increasing numbers of young women with children taking their own lives as a result of the stresses of homelessness. Yesterday, the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, described this crisis as a shame. It is the Government's shame and also the shame of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, whose one year in office has been marked by abject failure in respect this issue. The Government has failed to tackle the housing crisis at any level, failed to produce a review of the Rebuilding Ireland policy, failed to produce a vacant homes strategy and is failing to build the social homes that are urgently required. The number of social houses to be delivered this year will be lower than last year. The purpose of this motion is to set out a plan to bring vacant homes back into use. In my constituency, Louth County Council has rightly acquired vacant homes through compulsory purchase orders, on which I commend it. The Government promised to bring forward a vacant homes strategy but ten months later there is still no sign of it. There are currently 124 people in emergency accommodation in Louth. Approximately 8% of houses in Louth council areas are vacant. A vacant home strategy, properly resourced and financed, could make a significant contribution towards ending the scourge of homelessness in Dublin, Louth and many other local authority areas. When will the Minister publish the vacant homes strategy? I commend this motion to the House and I ask Teachtaí Dála to support it.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	325	I too commend Solidarity-People Before Profit on bringing forward this motion, which is well drafted and contains a lot of interesting detail. The Labour Party supports the motion. Almost every week when debating Private Members' motions, I and others have mentioned the land in State ownership on which social and affordable houses could be built immediately. I have often mentioned that there are over 700 sites in public ownership. The motion states that there are 1,317 hectares of zoned residential land with a capacity for 48,724 dwellings. As we speak, Government policy is to use most of that land for private development for private profit. Only a fraction of these sites are to be used for social and affordable housing. There is a fundamental difference between the policy of Government in regard to this valuable land in State ownership and the views of members on this side of the House. As we speak, these sites are being parcelled out for profit. We have heard previously from the Minister that this is about mixed tenure. Social and affordable housing is mixed tenure. People who are buying or renting affordable homes are people who have jobs but earning low to middle incomes, which is valuable mixed tenure. We need to provide homes for those people who are being priced out of the purchase market, because they cannot afford deposits or obtain mortgages, and rental market, as a result of rent hikes. It is urgent that the Minister listens to what people have to say and also that this particular part of the motion becomes public policy. Many of us were at the meeting earlier with the representatives of St. Michael's Estate who are arguing for a piece of land in their area to be utilised in this way. What is happening is a shame. The owners of the private sites are sitting on them waiting for them to rise in value so they can make more profit at a later stage and, at the same time, jumping into the publicly owned sites to make profit right now. This is unacceptable. The Government needs to address land hoarding via the types of measures many of us have put forward. The Labour Party has specifically argued for implementation of the Kenny report, which would deter land hoarding, and for the vacant sites levy to be brought forward and increased. It is wrong that public land is being used for private profit while at the time those who own private land are sitting on it. In my opinion, this is the most important issue. Others have spoken about the need for measures in regard to vacant homes, of which there are approximately 183,000. I recently tabled some parliamentary questions on the number of vacant home officers that are in place in local authorities. As I understand it, the staff engaged in this work also perform other duties within the council. In other words, vacant home officers are staff already working in the housing section of the council who are assigned this work on top of other duties. What is proposed in the motion, which I support, is the appointment of staff whose specific job it would be to identify vacant homes in their electoral areas, to find out the reason they are vacant and to go after them by applying, if necessary, a vacant homes tax or utilising compulsory purchase orders. This has been working well in Britain. There are models that are effective. It is a sop to the idea of vacant homes officers that we are giving this duty to staff in local authorities who are already overburdened with work. There are many vacant homes. The voids scheme, which I commenced during my time as Minister, is delivering local authority vacant homes. Given the scale of the current housing problem, we now need to take ownership of privately-owned vacant homes so that people can live in them. Others mentioned rent increases. As I have mentioned previously, Limerick is outside the rent pressure zone, as, I think, is the area represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, yet there was a 10% increase in rents in Limerick last year, which is much higher than the average increase nationally. Earlier this week, the issue of amending the Residential Tenancies Board legislation with a view to broadening out rent pressure zones to areas smaller than local electoral areas was discussed by the relevant committee. The current provision is unfair in a situation whereby a local electoral area includes rural as well as suburban areas. In this situation, the suburban area where people are paying above the national average is deemed a rent pressure zone but the entire area is not. I plead with the Minister to examine this when reviewing the rent pressure zones. The Labour Party has advocated for a change to NAMA's mandate, which I am sure will require legislative change. I was in the House when the NAMA legislation was brought forward by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government. I remember a former Minister of State, Ciarán Cuffe, speaking on it and saying that NAMA also had a social mandate. NAMA's economic mandate has superseded its social mandate and the only way to change this is to change the legislation and give it a stronger social mandate. The economic problem it was designed to solve is pretty much, in economic terms, solved but the social problem is not and this needs to be addressed. Local authorities in Dublin cannot afford to buy Part V homes because, at the market rate less a set percentage, the cost is too high. The proposal that the transfer of land would be preferable to the transfer of homes is an interesting one. In that situation, the council presumably could build cheaper on the land. It is worth looking at. Currently, when developers transfer houses they tend to transfer a small corner of a development such that it is easy to distinguish between social and private houses. I would not like to worsen that situation because it would be even more obvious which are the social houses and which are the private houses. Ideally, under Part V the social houses should be spread throughout developments but the reality is that they are not. There is a real problem with the cost of Part V housing. I recently met some Labour Party councillors from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown who gave me costings for social housing in the area, which was more than what it would have cost the council to build on its own land. This problem is well identified in the motion. I again commend Solidarity-People Before Profit on bringing forward the motion. I hope the response will be positive. We have all been critical of the Minister, and rightly so. What we want is a positive response to what we are proposing in good faith. I hope our comments will be listened to in a genuine manner and taken on board by Government.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	326	I support the motion tabled by People Before Profit, acknowledging that it highlights a specific aspect of the empty homes and sites and seeks strategically to place teams in each local authority as a national approach to bringing these empty homes into local authority housing schemes. Fundamentals must be dealt with in this housing crisis and emergency. The Government needs to provide adequate, well-built, secure and well-supported estates with amenities and services. If this Government continues to rely on developers to deliver the crumbs off their profitable tables the crisis will continue. The UN rapporteur on adequate housing, Leilani Farha, who was hosted here on Monday by Threshold and Simon, said the housing crisis is a global phenomenon primarily because of unregulated real estate speculation and commodification making housing unaffordable even for the middle classes. She said that in developed and developing countries, people are being displaced from their communities. She gives three reasons for this: national governments have receded from the arena of social housing and social protection; the unprecedented amount of wealth being parked in real estate; and the global financial crisis that allowed the predatory buying up of bad debt and hedging, waiting for that bad debt to become lucrative. She said we must step back and ask how we view housing, as a commodity, something traded and sold on stock markets or as a human right. She said it should not be viewed as something to be traded on the stock market like gold, steel or wheat but as a human right. It is enshrined in international human rights law. Ireland has ratified and signed that law and committed to this human right.  Even if the Government uses private developers to build some social housing, they should be regulated to comply with human rights legislation but they are not. It is an ideological issue for the Government not to use public lands for public housing. St. Michael's Estate offers a great opportunity for a pilot scheme. I again suggest the Government needs to look in that direction, support that initiative and provide the capital funding in the budget for 2019 to support the scheme with a view to developing it.

Those of us on this side of the House are told we are negative. I have no hesitation in supporting this motion. Great thought has gone into it. The proposers have analysed the problem and put forward solutions, as we have all done since the day we were elected. If the Minister of State does nothing else he might please read the motion and tell me which part he finds objectionable. It is not based on ideology but makes very practical suggestions. I have said repeatedly in this Chamber that I come from a city where the housing crisis is worse than in Dublin. I know of somebody who has finally been offered a house but he has been on the waiting list since January 2002, that is, for 16 years. This year and next, 14 houses will be built in Galway. The last house built for social housing was built in 2009. I live in a city where there is no master plan. There are public lands in Ceannt Station, the docks and elsewhere and we are leaving it to developers all over again. The senior Minister agreed with me when I raised this at Leaders' Questions and said we need a master plan. There is no master plan in Galway city.  This is not a natural disaster, this is a Government-made disaster caused by specific policies, including those of the previous Labour-Fine Gael Government. It made the most fundamental change in housing policy when it said housing support was now a house. That was an utter twist of language. It is difficult enough to understand the complexity of our attitude to the Irish language but in respect of the language around housing, my mind boggles to think that housing support is now regarded as a social house.  Members are here every week, not to be negative but to use our voices to tell the Government that there is a housing crisis that is now an emergency. If the Government does not declare an emergency, we cannot come up with proper solutions. Fianna Fáil has a golden opportunity. I find myself in agreement with it on certain issues but not on this one. This is the time for it to say it will not support Government policy and to support this motion.

A couple of weeks ago, I told the Tánaiste that according to the homelessness report of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, almost 6,000 adults and 3,700 children are homeless and of these, more than 4,000 homeless adults and almost 3,000 homeless children were based in the four Dublin local authority areas. There are up to 40,000 households on the Dublin housing waiting list. The Dublin Bay North constituency is the worst affected in the country by homelessness and long housing lists. People are pushed into homelessness by greedy landlords looking to cash in on the extortionate rents being charged in cities around the country, by greedy developers who are building homes to cater for landlords, by a small minority of flush professional first-time buyers, but most of all by the Government and its complete and utter inaction on this crisis and on putting the welfare of those 3,700 children ahead of the profit margins of landlords and developers. The Government's over-reliance on the private market and landlords is not working but the Taoiseach and the rest of the Minister of State's colleagues do not seem to care. They seem to think that this affects such a small number of people, relatively speaking, that they can waltz through the general election without worrying too much about this. It will, however, be a major stumbling block to the Minister of State's re-election and that of many of his colleagues. I do not know how many more times colleagues on these benches will implore the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to declare a housing emergency and use emergency powers to compulsorily purchase or lease vacant properties, to build on local authority, or where necessary, private, lands and to reduce rents to affordable levels by imposing serious rent controls linked to the consumer price index, CPI, not the pathetic controls introduced by the last Government and continued by the present Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. It is simple economics in that developers and landowners are withholding supply to push up prices, as they always have done. Due to the lack of affordable rental properties, many households are living in dangerous and overcrowded accommodation. The rental market has become so competitive that there is little hope for people on low incomes or in receipt of State housing supports to acquire such properties. We need a major change of policy in this regard. The motion before us sets out a well-thought out roadmap for how we could achieve a sustainable housing market. We discussed this a few minutes ago at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. The delegation from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which was before the committee said that there are exemplars in other European countries but they have different land use policies which we do not have and which we badly need.

I raised the matter of rural cottages and demountable homes with the Taoiseach over a week ago and the man had not a clue what I was talking about. I do not blame him. He is from Dublin and does not know what is happening or is needed in rural Ireland.  Rural cottages have been a way of life in rural Ireland for years, longer than I can remember, since the 1960s. The person provided the site to the local authority, which built the house for them where they could farm their own land. When they got on their feet, they bought the house back from the local authority.  Between 2016 and 2021, ten rural cottages will be built in County Kerry. There are more than 37 applications but the applicants are being told that they are too far away, it will take too long and the local authority may get them a house in town. These people are providing the site and if the Government has the money and cannot build these rural cottages, I do not know what is wrong with it. If it does not have the money it should tell us because we hear the stories of homelessness in urban areas such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other places. Maybe the Government does not have the money but it should tell us if it does not. People will understand that. Ten rural cottages in Kerry is not enough in five years between 2016 and 2021.  Then there are demountable homes. The Taoiseach did not know about these homes, which are vital in rural areas. A mobile home is brought in and the person is able to stay on the land where he or she was born, bred and reared. A circular was sent out to the local authorities saying that a demountable home could only be provided if a person's existing home was burned down or flooded. The Minister has to get a hold of this. I am taking up the time of someone else but this is very wrong and the Minister of State will have to look into it.

I wish to refer to the tenant purchase scheme. Every week for five years I asked the Taoiseach to introduce such a scheme. He, and the Government at the time, brought in a scheme which debars 80% of people from the opportunity to purchase their local authority house. People may have the money. If, however, a person's house is valued at €40,000, €60,000, €70,000 or €80,000 and even if he or she can prove he or she can pay for it outright - from retirement money or life savings in a bank account - he or she cannot purchase it if he or she is not in full-time employment. I ask that this be changed. It does not make sense. It is outrageous to debar 80% of people. If people are on pensions or other social protection payments, such as disability allowance or unemployment benefit, they are automatically debarred. That is an outrageous. If they can have the capacity to pay, they should be allowed to do so. I support the call to allow single rural cottages to be built, and also that relating to demountable buildings. The Taoiseach was completely confused by the latter last week or the week before. He was looking up at the sky and did not have a clue what a demountable unit is. He had never heard of such a thing. He thought it was something from outer space. It had to be explained to him. I hope he has learned what it is in the meantime because many people in rural Ireland lived in them very happily for a long time. Thanks be to God they were not relying on the Taoiseach to provide them. He would not have been able to do so because he did not know what they were. I want to ensure that they will be provided in the future.

I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for bringing forward this motion. We need immediate action to tackle this problem. The majority of those becoming homeless are in the private rental sector. I refer to huge numbers of my constituents from Bandon, Kilbrittain, Ballinspittle, Ballinadee, Dunmanway, Skibbereen, Leap and Goleen. The list is endless. People are unable to get on the property ladder and have to resort to paying huge rents. It has nearly come to the point that renting is more expensive than paying a monthly mortgage. Why are we not doing more to encourage people to afford and own their own homes? During the negotiations relating to A Programme for a Partnership Government, we discussed a rural resettlement scheme. Depopulation is a worrying trend in rural communities. They do not stand still - they either develop or decline. As the housing crisis in our towns and cities worsens, there has never been a better time to promote rural resettlement. This scheme has been rolled out in County Clare and elsewhere. Can the scheme be applied to west Cork? I refer to areas such as Ballineen, Drinagh, Drimoleague, Curragh, Ballydehob, Crookhaven and Durrus. That is to name only a few of the areas affected by diminishing populations. We have seen the closure of schools, post offices, Garda stations and local businesses and we need to take action to bring people into these areas. Most of them have wonderful community playgrounds and community centres. Let us promote what these areas have to offer, encourage people to live in them areas and ensure that they can afford to do so. There needs to be a plan put in place to source and build affordable housing in rural communities. That would enable urban-based families to move to rural areas through a resettlement scheme. The benefits of country living are endless. Those living in small rural communities tend to have a strong sense of identity and a pride of place. Children would be able to attend rural primary schools where everyone knows each other and class sizes are small. That would also promote the importance of keeping schools open in rural areas such as those in west Cork. Rural resettlement needs to be explored and promoted. It is time that the Government listened and took real action. Young couples are also seeking planning permission. I see that the length and breadth of my own constituency. Everything - every fence and ditch - is put in people's way. It prevents them from getting planning permission, forces them onto the social housing list and gives them no other choice. We find out now that it is an absolute nightmare for people in my constituency to get money from the new Rebuilding Ireland loans scheme, which was supposed to cure all problems. I was convinced or fooled and I advised people, through my constituency office, to make sure to go for these loans. Hardworking young people are trying to make a start and they are finding out now that over 50% of them cannot get the money in the first instance. We are conning people continuously. It is either through planning permission or through false promises of council housing or social housing coming on stream. They are being let down repeatedly by this Minister of State. He has to stand up here for once and tell the truth. The Government is not acting on behalf of the people, whether that is in a rural resettlement scheme or the planning permission to give people a home to start off their life in. They are being continuously let down by this Government. It has turned its back on them. It cannot continue to do that. I ask the Minister of State to stand by the people and do something for them. He should not to go down the road of fooling them with new loan schemes that are not there. The loans in question are certainly not available to the people I represent.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	332	Another week in the Dáil and there is another plea from the Opposition for the Government to tackle the worsening housing and homelessness crisis. There is little I can say today that I have not said before. The Government's housing strategy is simply not working. By any metric, it is failing badly. House prices are skyrocketing, rents are still rising unsustainably and every month new records for homelessness and child homelessness are being set. The ideas outlined in the motion are not new. Many Opposition Deputies have been calling for them for years. We are calling for them again because the Government has not listened. In June 2016, the Committee on Housing and Homelessness issued its final report. It recommended that the State increase its social housing stock by an average of 10,000 units per year. It identified the core root of the crisis as being the lack of building by local authorities and the Government's over-reliance on the private sector. The Government still has not changed its approach. It is still convinced the private sector will solve the housing crisis. In June last year, the Dáil passed a Green Party motion calling for an independent and well-resourced building regulator to protect homeowners. The Government has instead continued with its self-certification regime. In November, the Dáil passed a Sinn Féin motion calling for greater protection and security for tenants. The Government has not made any move to provide greater support for renters. In March, the Dáil passed another Green Party motion calling for the implementation of a cost-rental model of affordable public housing. There is no sign of the Government embracing cost-rental housing on the scale needed to tackle this crisis. The Government has not changed its course. We have heard constant talk of new politics since the beginning of this Dáil. We have seen it in action. We have seen cross-party support for a change of approach when it comes to housing. We, as the Opposition, have provided the ideas. We have called on the Government to take action. Is that not how a parliament is supposed to work? Obviously not on the watch of this Minister of State when it comes to tackling this unprecedented crisis in housing and homelessness. If a change is not made, we will continue to be in a housing crisis for as long as this Government lasts. It is a symptom of incredible short-sightedness to think that the road this Government has been going down on housing can work. The Government has tried its way for too long and it is not working. It is never too late to listen. Start today and commit to taking on board the ideas the Opposition puts forward. Let us commit to working together. This is not a laughing matter. We are talking about an unprecedented crisis in homelessness and housing. We ask him to take on reasonable practical solutions presented by the Opposition.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	338	I raised the issue of housing with the Taoiseach on Leader's Questions earlier today. I drew attention to the comments made by the United Nations special rapporteur on housing who is visiting Ireland this week. Those comments amount to us being told again that Ireland is failing abysmally in dealing with what is now a housing emergency and it is an escalating emergency. Ms Farha said that one of her primary reasons for becoming interested in Ireland was because of NAMA and the unprecedented nature of how it is operating despite the country being in the midst of a housing crisis. Almost 10,000 people are homeless according to the official homelessness figures. We know many more are not being counted. I refer to people we all come across who have been couch surfing for years.Mr. Mel Reynolds, an architect who is very involved in the housing issue, told us recently that NAMA controls enough development land to build approximately 65,000 housing units. Local authorities own zoned residential land with a total capacity of 48,724 housing units across the country. Dublin City Council alone has land sufficient for 18,000 units, while the three outer Dublin councils have enough for 29,000 units, yet in the last four years we have seen a total of 818 social housing builds completed nationally. In 2017 local authorities built 394 units, yet in the same year the State transferred over €1 billion in housing supports to private landlords. The balance of priorities is completely skewed. Mr. Reynolds made that point in real terms when he explained that one year's supply of purpose built social housing is meeting less that two weeks of subsidised housing demand. The sums just do not make sense. At this stage one in three tenancies are in receipt of some form of State rent assistance. It is a cycle of failure and waste, perpetuated by the refusal to acknowledge the fact that relying on the private market to solve this crisis will never work. The State must take responsibility for providing affordable housing that is accessible to all. Ms Farha warned against the mindset that views housing as a commodity rather than the bedrock of a stable and healthy society. Without a secure roof over a person's head it is very difficult for him or her to be a functioning member of society. So many people are in that precarious state. A dysfunctional society is not in anyone's interest, whether one considers oneself left-wing, right-wing or anything in between. Singapore, for example, despite its right-wing Government, has some of the highest levels of social housing globally, to the point that it is so much a part of the fabric of its society it sits seamlessly within the housing sector. The Social Democrats have previously tabled a motion seeking to change the NAMA Act in order to shift the priority of the agency. There are currently seven different issues identified in the NAMA Act, including the restructuring of financial institutions, which are given precedence ahead of the need to address the compelling need to contribute to the social fabric and the development of the State. I urge the Minister of State to consider whether or not he truly believes the balance of priorities within the NAMA Act are fit for purpose given the current crisis. We clearly have sufficient land, so that should not be an impediment. Whatever announcements have been made, the delivery of social housing units has been abysmal. Without that, this crisis is going to continue. We will keep trying to solve it in an expensive way.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	339	A report by the United Nations published one year ago said: "Housing and urban real estate have become the commodity of choice for corporate finance, a safety deposit box for the wealthy, a repository of capital and excess liquidity." That report showed that US $163 trillion is now invested in residential real estate worldwide, which is more than twice the size of the entire gross domestic product of the world. Housing and property is big business and makes big profits, more than ever since the global crash of 2008. It is particularly the case in Ireland. The average yield on Irish property stood at 7.08% in August of 2017, up from 6.54% in 2016 and far, far ahead of the rest of the member states of the European Union. We are now witnessing the rise of corporate landlordism in Ireland. This is not an uncle or an aunt who has inherited a house, but rather big business entering the market and seeking big profits. NAMA has facilitated it, as can be seen in the case of I-RES REIT. Kennedy Wilson, a huge US corporate landlord, recently purchased the Elysian Towers in Cork. The rise of corporate landlordism is shown in the example of the Leeside Apartments in Cork, where a company, Lugus Capital, which is linked to Bain Capital, one of the biggest vulture funds in the world, snapped up apartments in Cork city centre and within days issued notices to quit to residents, who are low income families, many of which have kids and many of which have been resident there for years. That approach is being resisted, but it is clear how the housing needs of the 99% are being subordinated to the capital accumulation of the 1%. This can also be seen in the approach of Airbnb in this country. Airbnb started life as a small-scale host community, where ordinary people engaged in accommodation sharing. Internationally it is becoming a field for landlords and speculators to intervene to make profits on a major scale. Airbnb was a €15 billion industry by the end of 2016. Ireland is no exception to this. We do not have enough information on the issue because Airbnb does not engage in data sharing, but my sense of it is that Ireland is no exception to the European norm. In every city and town in this country it can be seen that there are more short-term lets on Airbnb than on daft.ie for long-term lets. I understand that an expert group is due to report to the Government on that issue soon. Can the Minister of State tell us exactly when that group will report? I look forward to the debate around that issue. The State is being rolled back and housing is being privatised under this and previous Governments. In the 1970s one in five houses in this State were social housing. Today, that is less than one in ten. The UN special rapporteur on adequate housing, Ms Leilani Farha, has been quoted in this debate. I will quote her again. She said, in the course of her visit to Ireland:Evictions continue unabated worldwide, particularly because so many people lack security of tenure. Unregulated private actors are filling the void left by Governments that are continuously receding from the housing sector, thereby leaving unchallenged the prevailing paradigm that housing is a commodity rather than a social good. Ireland is in the throes of all of these phenomena.It could be added that Ireland is in the throes of all of these phenomena in significant measure thanks to the policies of its Government. Ten thousand people are homeless in this State. That is a fraction of the real figure when people who are couch surfing are taken into account; it could be double, treble or quadruple that number. The Government and the Minister have doctored the figures, but it is clear that 10,000 are homeless. At the same time payments are being made to private landlords which will cost the taxpayer €23 billion more over 30 years than would be the case if social houses were built instead. The profits for the investors are locked in, but the young generation are being locked out. This is copperfastened by politics; a Fine Gael led Government, propped up by Fianna Fáil. Both parties are joined at the hip in their support for the market. In Fine Gael some 37% of its parliamentarians are landlords. Some 31% of Fianna Fáil parliamentarians are landlords. The national coalition on housing and homelessness organised a demonstration which was attended by 10,000 people this year, and it will go to the streets again in the Autumn. Unity is required to fight the housing crisis, but it must be unity in support of public housing on public lands and unity against the market, which has failed the people.
#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	340	This housing crisis originated over a decade ago, springing from a particular ideology.That ideology said that the State would build no more houses and it would be left up to the free market. That is why we have a homelessness crisis and a housing crisis today in which nearly 10,000 people are homeless. That can seem abstract to people in this House but it is not abstract to me or to most of my comrades here. People are living in hotels and bed and breakfasts and sometimes in cars, tents and streets. It is completely unacceptable.  I will mention the C-word, which is "class". There is a deep class prejudice in the Government when it comes to housing. The narrative is that social housing equates to ghettoisation, bad people and anti-social behaviour. I reject that and, as a person who comes from a council estate, find it insulting. There are some amazing people who have lived in council houses. The majority of social housing has been a huge success in this country. Of course there are instances where it has failed but it has largely been successful. Under this Government and under Fianna Fáil, social housing has become a dirty word. That is why we have a terrible situation in this country.  I want to make it less abstract and I want the Minister of State to comment on this point, which really gets at the heart of the problem. There is a site in Clondalkin called Kilcarbery Grange. It is a site of 71 acres and it is being sold off to private developers. This land could provide as many as 900 social and affordable homes. It is owned by the State, which is selling it off to developers. The council will then buy back 30% of the houses from the developers. Basically, the council will sell the land, the developer will build the houses and then the developer will sell that 30% back to the council. How does that make sense? The council will have to buy 30%, approximately 290 houses, at market rate. Can anybody make sense of this? I do not know how this makes sense. What the Government is doing, as have successive Governments, is to sell public land off to developers at the height of the worst crisis in the State. That is absolutely unforgivable. It comes down to political choice and political ideology.  Some people do not like using the word "class". I actually like using it. It defines the situation we have in this country, where people are discriminated against on a class basis. If these were 10,000 people from a different class bracket, this would not be the case. The Minister of State knows that, as do I and as does everyone in this House. If this affected 10,000 people from Foxrock, there would not be 10,000 people on the streets or homeless. That is a fact.

The cheap personalised attack is really beneath her. I will try to address individual points that Members have made in their contributions on this Private Members' motion. I arrived at the debate just before the contributions from Members of the Rural Independent Group. They were speaking about demountable houses and rural cottages. We used to call demountable houses prefabs in Kilkenny. I am sure that they were called that in Kildare County Council as well.

I completely agree with them that local authorities building houses or providing demountables on land owned by citizens was a scheme that worked very well and local authorities still provide it. It is still within the gift of local authorities to provide such schemes, and the Members outlined that the scheme still exists in Kerry. I presume they were talking about increasing the funding from the State. However, it is still within the ambit of members of Kerry Country Council to allocate more funding for such measures if they believe that more demountables or rural cottages should be built. I acknowledge Deputy Catherine Murphy's remarks on Singapore. I happened to be there for the St. Patrick's Day events several months ago. I visited the urban planning initiative in the city of Singapore, and it was eye-opening. However, the version of election to government that exists in Singapore is different to what we have in this country. While it is fair to say that private ownership and the free market are significant drivers of the Singaporean economy, a lot of land is publicly owned. In fact, the state owns virtually everything. The military owns about 20% of the landmass of Singapore. While the comparison is interesting on many levels, this is quite different to our method of land ownership in this country. I do not deny the fact that local authorities, agencies and arms of the State own significant amounts of land in this country. On tenants, it is interesting to note that there is a conflict. The Rural Independent Group Members have left but they spoke about tenant purchasing, which is diametrically opposed to the left-wing view of housing stock whereby houses that are built by the State should be kept in the housing pool, whether it is run by local authorities or centrally by Government. That is a philosophical argument that probably has never been properly had in Ireland.  I will endeavour to get Deputy Gino Kenny a specific answer about the lands he mentioned in Clondalkin. I do not have it with me. If I had it, I would give it.

However, I will try to answer the Deputy more fully at a later time. Deputy Gino Kenny' comments on ideology were interesting and in some respects, I do not disagree with him. He said that more ten years ago, there was a change. Indeed there was and the change meant that when the collapse in the economy came and the construction sector collapsed, we were so reliant on Part V provision for many of our local authority houses and so many construction workers left that not only did private house building collapse but we did not have the physical capacity or manpower for public houses either. I could not swear to it, but I believe that ideological change came in one of the Planning and Development Acts that were enacted the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Noel Dempsey was Minister.  In respect of my own home city of Kilkenny and Waterford, the city beside which I live, I absolutely agree. I grew up on a 60-acre farm in south Kilkenny with two bedrooms. Eight people lived in the house. It was my aunt's house. I can assure Deputy Gino Kenny that from a class point of view, there is not as much between he and I as others might think.

I acknowledge the role of social housing and even significantly large chunks of social housing. There is a whole side of Kilkenny city, the western environs, which is virtually all composed of it. One can see by the house design in what era the houses were built. They were largely privately bought out by their tenants and some are now among the most costly houses that can be bought in Kilkenny. I refer to the old cut-stone social houses that were built in the 1920s or 1930s near the Garda station. I think there was a comprehensive decision, and it has been agreed pretty unanimously in respect of some of the larger-scale social housing developments on the south side of Limerick city.Perhaps it is also the case in parts of Clondalkin. I do not know Clondalkin that well. In parts of north-west Dublin city, where the tower blocks were removed and other social housing units provided, the necessary social infrastructure was not put in. It was not so much that the housing itself was a problem but that communities were transferred out of the city into the suburbs and left to their own devices. That happened in different waves in the 1960s and 1970s and into the 1980s. There was a change whereby social housing should be more integrated into every other form of housing. At the time these issues were discussed, I was a Member of the Seanad and there was not much political opposition. I refer specifically to some of the points made, progress is being made in the housing market. I know that at times perhaps it is imperceptible or not fast enough for people, but the indicators in most, if not all, areas are positive for the first time in several years. For example, there were 20,800 planning permissions in 2017, which was an increase of 27% on 2016. In the year to April, there were 23% more commencement notices and a 35% increase in housing scheme registrations. At the end of April, An Bord Pleanála had approved 19 planning applications under the new fast-track arrangements for almost 3,000 homes and 3,600 student bed spaces. With regard to social housing, the Government has ring-fenced a capital programme of more than €6 billion. A significant expansion of the social housing build programme was evident in the fourth quarter of 2017. The construction status report indicated there were 850 schemes or phases at the end of 2017 delivering 13,400 homes, a substantial increase on the 8,400 homes in the programme a year earlier. All of this was facilitated by an investment of €1.6 billion of taxpayers' money, including an additional €100 million provided in December 2017. This year, the Government will allocate more than €1.8 billion to housing programmes, an increase of more than €500 million in 2017. To better co-ordinate the response to homelessness, the homelessness interagency group was established in September, and the Minister recently received a report from the group, which he will bring to the Government shortly. Earlier this week, he also received a report from the DRHE. The content of both reports will be reviewed carefully and I expect him to introduce a number of policy responses to address the issues raised. As the economy continues to progress towards delivering the levels of housing supply needed, the Government is committed to ensuring new homes are accessible and affordable. The affordable purchase schemes were stood down in 2011, but it must be borne in mind that market conditions at the time resulted in house prices falling by more than 50% in some places and there was consequential significant easing of affordability during that particular period. However, the Government recognises we still face challenges with regard to affordability and the rental sector. Some of the recent target measures are helping in this area. We have measures such as the fast-track of planning reforms, and I referred to recent permissions approved by An Bord Pleanála. There is a €200 million investment in enabling infrastructure to service or open up housing land, with proportionate affordability dividends for house purchases, and the progression of large-scale mixed tenure housing projects with social, affordable and private housing on publicly owned lands. First quarter figures indicate the introduction of the RPZs is beginning to have a moderate positive effect on rent inflation. It is certain that rent would be higher without the RPZs and other controls. We are supporting first-time buyers to buy a new or second hand home through the new Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, and 220 applications had been recommended for approval by the end of April. As the year progresses, we expect this to increase significantly. I will endeavour to get a more complete response for Deputy Gino Kenny on the issue he raised.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	352	I will share time with Deputy Boyd Barrett. Before the Minister of State picked up his script and started reading the usual "blah, blah, blah" we get from the Department - with all due respect to the Minister of State, not the Department - I found his contribution interesting. At least there was engagement with the facts, ideology and ambitions related to housing and what they all mean. He made an interesting comment in response to Deputy Gino Kenny about the left-wing view of housing. The much quoted Ms Leilani Farha is not a left winger. She is a rapporteur for the United Nations and her views on housing are quite similar to ours on the left in the House. They are that housing is a human right. In her submission yesterday in Dublin she called on governments to ensure that the markets served housing need rather than investment priorities, and she reminded states that they are first and foremost accountable to human rights. I came across an example of those human rights two days ago. I got a phone call from a woman who headed up a Ballyfermot helping the homeless group. She asked me whether I could do anything as she was outside Tallaght Garda station where a grandmother, parents and four children were locked up because they sat in in South Dublin County Council offices in Tallaght. They had nowhere to go. They were made homeless on 7 June and put out of private rental accommodation. They had been in three counties in as many nights, shifted from Ashbourne, County Meath to Gardiner Street, Dublin 1 to Rathdrum, County Wicklow. They had been ringing all morning to try to get hotel accommodation and could not get any so they went to the offices of South Dublin County Council in Tallaght and refused to move. They ended up in Tallaght Garda station. A file on the mother has been sent to the DPP, with the possibility of her being charged. She will be charged with defending the human rights of her four children. I rang the head of the DRHE who was very helpful. She immediately got onto the family and got them sorted in accommodation on the South Circular Road. What she said that was most interesting was that these are the most difficult people to deal with in homelessness because they are big families. I was in a family of seven and we were considered small on my estate as most families had 12 members. This is a big family nowadays, with four children, and hotels will not take them because they need two bedrooms to be accommodated. I do not know where the family has ended up, but the mother may be charged as a consequence of defending the human rights of her children. Does the Minister of State not feel shame about this fact in this day and age? Does he not feel shame and horror that we live in a world that can spend more than half its GDP on investment in land and property that is just used for speculation and investment and causes much worse human misery than I have highlighted throughout the globe and increasingly here in Ireland? I refer to the comments of the head of the DRHE because we are both agreed on this. I will say to anybody who is being thrown out of private rented accommodation because the HAP is not working and because landlords want to sell up and they have nowhere to go having tried to access HAP to stay put and occupy the premises they are in and not to go into homelessness if they have a family because it is nothing but pure misery and they owe it to their children to stay put. Ms Eileen Gleeson agreed with me because she is at the end of her tether. There is no movement or ability for her to deal with the increasing problem of family homelessness. Many of them are working families. This should make us feel horrified. There are ten acres of prime land in the middle of Inchicore on St Michael's Estate just down the road from where that family is from. The community in Inchicore has worked hard for the past 17 years to try to get it developed for public housing on public land. The people have met all the agencies, all the local Deputies here today and political parties and they are campaigning strongly. I am not sure if the Minister has met them but if he has, he has made a commitment to do so. They have presented him with a model to provide public housing on public land, a major part of which is a return to the public purse because, under the scheme, the State would be able to rent back to couples who are working but cannot afford to live in the lucrative private rental sector. A total of 60% of the planet's GDP is being used for speculation and profit and not for human needs and human rights. The ideology of Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil will not suit making that change.A left-wing ideology is needed in order to facilitate that ultimate change. That is why this is an ongoing battle in our society.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	353	I thank everybody who contributed to the debate, particularly those who are supporting the motion. Earlier, I should have thanked Mr. Mel Reynolds and Ms Orla Hegarty for the briefing they gave us. Many of the facts and some of the ideas in the motion came from them and the Government should start listening to them. To be honest, apart from the brief attempt to engage with the matters by the final Government speaker, we just had the Minister reeling off the usual list of achievements and he did not really engage with the central thrust of the motion. Deputy Darragh O'Brien and I agree that, as noted ad nauseam in this motion and more generally, public land should be used for public and affordable housing. The other specifics in the motion do not in any sense cut against that. We are saying there is a reason we are not getting public and affordable housing on public land or from the private sector. Coincidentally, Ms Leilani Farha came to Ireland this week and her words reflected exactly what is in this motion. That was not orchestrated. Along with the human misery being suffered by those affected by the housing and homelessness crisis, there is another group of people making money out of it. The worse the crisis gets, the more money they make from it. Look at the largest house builder in the State, namely, Cairn Homes. It plans to build 12,000 units but how many social units were built in 2016? A total of 103. Last year, Cairn Homes built 200 units and next year it will build 800. That is pathetic because it owns one of the biggest landbanks in Dublin. The owners of the company sold 2.1% of their shares in 2017 between the three of them for €26 million. The three founders also split €61 million in shares last year and they raked in €4.1 million in wages and bonuses between them. This is the biggest developer in the country and it is drip feeding small amounts of housing into the market to boost share prices and make an absolute killing, and we are allowing it to do so. NAMA has flogged €40 billion of property because of the mandate this Government gave to entities such as Cairn and vulture funds like I-RES REIT. We can go through the list of these institutional investors. Hines is going to build the biggest new development in Cherrywood but it has not built a single unit yet. Some €15 million from LIHAF has gone in but there is no guarantee of any affordable housing from that scheme. Even the social housing being sold back is costing local authorities €250,000 and €450,000 when the site was bought from NAMA for a song. Does Hines state that it builds houses? No. Its website refers to "intelligent real estate investments" and states "We build smart investments". It is what the company does. It drip feeds housing or does not build it at all and the measures being taken by the Government have increased the value of its property and land, encouraging speculation. There has been no answer to the following question, which I have asked several times of the Government. Why did the original 40% affordable housing condition on LIHAF funding get dropped within weeks? If it had been implemented, it would have cut against the profiteering of the private developers. How could they sell property at an inflated price if the State had affordable housing at genuinely affordable rates? This is why the public landbank is not being developed. Why has the Government not provided a definition of "affordable housing"? How can any of the public sites be developed if the Government refuses to define "affordable" while insisting that the housing must be public and affordable? None of the sites at Shanganagh, Oscar Traynor Road or Inchicore can move forward while the Government does not provide a definition. If it did provide one, the profits of these profiteers would be hit. That is the problem - the Government is dancing to the tune of profiteers.

The House will recall that the 1998 Act was a necessary and wholly proportionate response to the barbaric murder by the Real IRA of 29 innocent people at Omagh in August 1998, almost 20 years ago. These robust provisions of the criminal law play an important role in enabling the Garda authorities and the courts to face down the threat from such terrorism. In accordance with the Act, I have laid before the House a report on the operation of the relevant provisions over the past 12 months. I will not take up the limited time by going through in detail each of the sections but I signal to the House that one element of section 9, that is to say, subsection (1)(b), is the subject of ongoing litigation. It was declared invalid by the High Court in February but that declaration is being appealed. The remainder of section 9 is not in question. The report sets out in more detail than in previous years an assessment of the security position and while I do not intend to rehearse that, I will highlight some aspects. There remains a real and persistent threat from republican paramilitary groups on this island, the so called dissidents. These groups vehemently oppose peace and democracy and have spent 20 years trying to destroy the Good Friday Agreement and all it stands for. I am determined that these terrorists will not succeed and the bullet or bomb will not prevail over the ballot box. I refer also to the threat posed by jihadist-type terrorism.The raw brutality of the attacks targeting innocent people that we have seen, including on our nearest European neighbours, is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of all open democracies to this threat. I pay particular tribute to the women and men of An Garda Síochána, who continue to work tirelessly to preserve life and to counter all threats from terrorism. I pay tribute also to the men and women of the police and security services in Northern Ireland, with whom the Garda work closely every single day to enhance the safety of all communities on this island. The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 was a response to difficulties facing the justice system from certain organised criminal gangs behaving as though they were beyond the law. Section 8 provides that four particularly serious organised crime offences should be tried in the Special Criminal Court, subject to the DPP not directing otherwise. Again, I will not delay the House by repeating the detail of what is set out in the report I have laid before the House in accordance with section 8. That report notes that no cases came for trial before the Special Criminal Court under section 8. No one can be under any illusion about the threat that society and the criminal justice system face from organised criminal gangs that will stop at nothing in pursuit of their criminal activities. The Garda authorities are working intensively to bear down on these criminal gangs and to disrupt their activities. The Garda deserves praise for the considerable success it has achieved against these gangs, and with the Government's support that work will continue. As set out in the two reports I have laid before the House, it is the clear view of An Garda Síochána that the provisions in the 1998 and 2009 Acts continue to be most important in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism and serious organised crime. On this basis, on the basis of the information set out in the report and on the advice of the Garda authorities at senior level, I propose that the House should approve the continued operation of the relevant provisions of the 1998 and 2009 Acts for a further 12 months commencing 30 June.
#ColmBrophy	unknown-#ColmBrophy-party	unknown-#ColmBrophy-dob	unknown-#ColmBrophy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	357	I echo what the Minister has said in calling for support for the 1998 and 2009 Acts. It is very important that everyone in this House support them. I call in particular on political parties that have not done so in the past to consider that this is a time to choose. If a party sets itself up as a modern political party and as expert in so many ways on our Judiciary, our policing and our Garda Síochána, it must understand that dealing with the threats we face from organised criminals, paramilitaries and international terrorism is essential to An Garda Síochána and to the security of the State. This is no time for doubts or any kind of harking back to a past, a tradition and a history which caused one to oppose good, solid, sensible legislation that is vital to the protection of the institutions and security of this modern State, which some would seek to govern and be involved with other parties in that government. No party that would not support this would be fit to be part of any government. It is very important, and it is a challenge, perhaps, to some to support, but I call on all parties quite clearly to do so.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	358	There is a certain element of repetition to this. This is the third time I have spoken on these motions since my election to the House and appointment as justice spokesperson. On each of the two previous occasions, I and Fianna Fáil have supported the motions. Without any question, we will support them again today. We support them because, regrettably, we believe they are necessary. We also believe they are a proportionate response to very serious criminal issues that this country faces. We need to address those criminal issues rather than hide from them. I have had the opportunity to read the reports the Minister has placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas. I found them helpful and informative. The first motion relates to the extension of the 12 sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. Throughout the paper laid before the House, reference is made to the current security situation. It should be pointed out that the greatest domestic threat to our security in this country at present is, as the Minister stated, the threat that comes from republican paramilitary groups, so-called dissident groups. Sometimes people forget that there was a period in this island's past when we were plagued by violence. That was prior to the Good Friday Agreement. One of the great political achievements of the 20th century in Europe was the Good Friday Agreement. Many of us, when we were growing up, thought that the violence in Northern Ireland was intractable, that it was not capable of resolution. Fortunately, we have now set the pace for the world in showing that conflicts can be resolved and that no issue is too intractable to be protected from political resolution. Every political problem can be resolved. However, it is important to point out that there remains a domestic threat on this island from dissident groups. Because of this, the legislation we are discussing under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is, unfortunately, necessary. It is also important to point out that the reports refer to the international threat. If one were to ask anyone outside of Ireland what the biggest threat is in respect of international terrorism, he or she would say it is religious extremism. We need to recognise that the report placed before the Oireachtas this evening is not alarming. All it says is that there are a small number of people here whose activities in support of extremism give cause for concern and that the authorities monitor their activities very closely. If we were solely dealing with the international threat, perhaps there would be a strong argument against renewing the legislation. However, in the context of the domestic threat, there can be no such uncertainty. I wish to emphasise something else that is stated in the report. Sometimes there is a concentration on associating religious extremism with the Islamic communities. It is important to note that the following is emphasised in the report that has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas:the extremism underlying this threat is not characteristic of Ireland’s peace-loving Muslim community. Terrorism is not the product of one faith or belief system. The only people responsible for terrorist attacks are the evil people who carry them out.I endorse these comments. We know from the report in respect of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act that 23 convictions were secured in the courts in the period we are talking about and that a further 84 persons are awaiting trial. These are not academic pieces of statutory provision that are not used in our criminal justice system. They are used, and people are convicted as a result of the existence of this legislation. It is also important to point out - not, though, that it is in any way determinative - the views of the Garda authorities. We note that the Garda Commissioner has made clear to the Minister his view that the key provisions of the Offences Against the State Act are regularly used and that the Garda Commissioner considers it essential that the relevant provisions of the Act be extended for a further period of 12 months. Therefore, having read the report, I think any objective assessment of it would lead a person to believe it is necessary for the 12 sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 to be renewed, and I and Fianna Fáil will support their renewal. The other motion before the House relates to the operation of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009. Again, we have a relatively detailed report from the Minister on this matter. One would want to be living in a parallel universe or on a different planet not to be aware that significant gangland issues face not just this city, but indeed the whole country. Unfortunately, the value of human life in this country has been reduced considerably by the extent to which people are prepared to kill other people as part of criminal feuds. Sometimes we seem to refer to this as being a feud involving two distinct groups. Unfortunately, I have no doubt but that these assassinations, as they should be called, will spread. Unfortunately, human life has become very cheap. If one looks at any case before the Special Criminal Court at present dealing with gangland feuds, one will note that there is a potential threat that people who are up on charges or subsequently convicted of charges will interfere with juries. We have seen in the past that witnesses have been intimidated in cases, that organised criminals have murdered journalists in this country and that lawyers are threatened in respect of cases they bring.One cannot hide from the fact that, regrettably, the Special Criminal Court is necessary in this country. If we did not have a Special Criminal Court, there would be miscarriages of justice. Too often miscarriage of justice is taken to mean only those who are wrongfully convicted of criminal offences. However, it also applies when someone who is guilty of a criminal offence is wrongfully acquitted. We need to ensure that does not happen. I was pleased that Deputy Brophy was present for the debate. I wondered whether it was a sign of his elevation to ministerial office. That is not yet the case, but I am sure it will happen.

I looked back at the debate on this issue last year. Many of the contributions, including my own, were relatively repetitive. Sometimes we make the same comments on this motion, but I was interested by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's contribution. He said at the time: "Sinn Féin does not oppose special courts to deal with the very specific circumstances of violent organised criminal gangs which present serious threats to the security of the State." I recall that statement and I detected a change in the Sinn Féin position. Unfortunately for Deputy O'Brien, his contribution did not receive much coverage but I noted the change. It is not for me to dictate what other parties should state in the House, but I detected that Deputy Brophy was making an invitation to Sinn Féin. The message to Sinn Féin is that it is time to choose if it wishes to go into government with Fine Gael.

I will not be a part of the political game between Fine Gael and Sinn Féin. One should look objectively at the matter, be aware of the nature of the trials that are held in the Special Criminal Court and consider this from a non-academic point of view. It can be easy for lobby groups or those with a particular agenda in respect of civil liberties to say that there should always be a jury trial. I am a civil libertarian and believe that there should always be a jury trial but I recognise there are occasions when a jury trial is not feasible. It may not be possible because of the threat posed to a jury. This is not an abstract threat. It is for that reason that I will support the motion as I have done in the past.

Violent, serious organised crime, has become increasingly prominent, and continues to claim many lives, with many more under threat. Since the killing of David Byrne at the Regency Hotel, gardaí believe that they have foiled 52 threats to life related to gang activity. However, there has also been considerable loss of life. Between 2016 and 2017, 22 people died in gang-related killings. Against that background, and the violence, intimidation, drug running and other forms of criminality that go along with such gangsterism, there has been a devastating impact on communities, creating a climate of fear and concern. This is not a situation we can ignore, or lightly dismiss. We owe it to the communities who face this on a daily basis to tackle this head on, to take on these criminals, shut them down and put them behind bars. I recognise this will not be easy. Tackling crime, particularly serious and organised crime, requires a resourced response, a legislative response, and a policing response. The front-line members of An Garda Síochána are doing all within their power to confront this problem. However, contrary to its soundbites, the Government is not putting in place the resources required to face it down. The figures tell us that Dublin has lost almost 100 gardaí since last year, despite what the Minister and the Government are telling us about increased resources and numbers. Dublin has lost approximately 900 gardaí since 2010. Last January, Assistant Commissioner Pat Leahy stated, "Despite the fact that there are new personnel, drainage into specialist units and transfers continue to reduce frontline policing ... We've hit rock bottom." Last December, there was an embargo on overtime for gardaí in Dublin, including the special detective unit. There has been a 40% reduction in community policing, with a greater reduction in some districts. The lack of front-line personnel has hit the ability of the Garda to be aware what is going on in communities, and it is crippling the force as a result. The people who live with such hostility on a day-to-day basis often go forgotten because of the lottery of birth, and working class communities are disproportionately impacted as a result. Were this happening in some of the more affluent suburbs of our cities perhaps the response would be different, and more cohesive. Investment is needed in these communities. Crime can thrive where the State neglects communities, and it cannot be tackled by policing alone. We need targeted and substantial investment in community development, education and employment, particularly in areas where organised crime gangs are recruiting members and where their malign influence is having a devastating effect on social cohesion. Last year, my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O’Brien, called for "a comprehensive review of the emergency legislation in advance of its renewal next year", which would focus on how to modernise the criminal justice system to make it responsive to the needs of Ireland in 2017. I regret that this has not happened. Sinn Féin believes new legislation is required to replace the outdated emergency Acts in place and to create a new legislative and procedural basis to deal with these particular cases. We recognise certain criminal cases are more difficult to prosecute given the nature of organised crime. The opportunity for well organised and well funded criminal enterprises to interfere with trials is greater than in the vast majority of criminal cases, and we are not ignorant of that. The manner in which serious crime cases are tried is not adequate, and we need to offer greater protections to jurors and witnesses to ensure greater success in putting these criminals away. We have always recognised that there may be - and in certain areas there must be - a requirement for specialisation of courts. We have supported the establishment of specialised family and commercial courts. We would consider favourably proposals regarding specialised courts, procedures and legislation for organised and serious crime, where it is shown to be needed. The legislative change required has been debated, and aspects of this change have been considered by bodies such as the Law Reform Commission. There is a need to create a specific offence for jury tampering, as there is no such offence currently on the Statute Book. There is also a need to increase penalties for intimidation of jurors under section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999. There are undoubtedly circumstances where it will be appropriate, necessary, and proportionate to provide for anonymisation of juries and witnesses. The Government, rightly, provided for the anonymisation of witnesses recently under the progressive Domestic Violence Act. I commend the Government on that but a similar provision can surely be made in this regard. This could be provided for via screens in court rooms or, in particular circumstances, through remote location of jurors with video links to courtrooms. It is difficult to understand if the Government is serious about ensuring proper protections, why this matter has never been given proper consideration. In such circumstances, there would also be a need for restrictions on access to jury lists and the abolition of daily roll call of jurors. We would also support this in those instances. We should take all steps necessary to ensure the safety of jurors and witnesses, but the Government has not even considered these matters. Such legislation could have an inbuilt independent review of the legislation to ensure its effectiveness and that it is rights-proofed.  We also need, outside of the legislative framework, to get more serious about tackling serious and organised crime in this State. I urge the Minister to ensure the full implementation of Garda Inspectorate report recommendations on serious crime.There is also a need for an annual national threat assessment. This is a feature in numerous states, for example in Norway, the United States and Britain, that allows for evaluation of threats of international and domestic forms and which has application in evaluating security and serious and organised crime threats. The Irish approach of reports and threat assessments by the national security committee is ad hoc and unstructured. This should be put on a more periodic basis. These current motions relate to the Special Criminal Court and specifically to provisions under the 1998 and 2009 Acts relating to the same. The Special Criminal Court was first established under the Offences against the State Act 1939 during the Second World War to counter what the Government viewed as a threat to the State’s neutrality from the IRA. Its current incarnation dates from May 1972. The reality is that the Offences against the State Act and the Special Criminal Court are ineffective relics of a conflict era which have failed to deal with the new threats posed by organised crime.

We should protect the right to a jury trial and implement the protections I outlined a moment ago to ensure a fair trial and to ensure those guilty can be convicted. Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British Governments have a responsibility to work towards the normalisation of policing and security matters. This means ending the state of emergency under which the Offences against the State Act operates. It is not sensible to perpetuate a situation in which we are relying on an annual renewal of outdated emergency legislation. We are using 20th century tools for what is now a very different challenge in the 21st century. Consequently, we need new legislation and new tools. Last year Deputy Jonathan O’Brien called for an a comprehensive review of the legislation that governs such trials and all related matters. It is unfortunate that suggestion was not taken up. I once again call on the Minister to take on this work. We will engage enthusiastically with him and play our role to ensure that organised crime is given no quarter and that we have an effective policing, legislative and policy response to shut down this threat. I hope that in 12 months' time we are in a position to consider the outcome of that rather than another renewal of archaic legislation.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	370	I thought that Deputy Brophy's remarks were revealing when he said that to be "fit for government" one has to prove oneself by voting for repressive legislation and voting against civil liberties. That is unfortunately appropriate in a state founded in a counter-revolution and in bloody repression of which the political forefathers of Deputy Brophy and party of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, were in charge. We have an uncomfortable 100 year anniversary coming up, that of the massacre of prisoners without trial. That is unfortunately the real history of this State and it shows the need for a revolutionary break with that approach under which civil liberties and democratic rights have been sacrificed again and again in the interests of the establishment. To be clear, we are absolutely opposed to the renewal of the continuing operation of these sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009. Every year for 20 years this House has renewed the operations of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act. It is an annual event which, as Deputy O'Callaghan rightly said, often features effectively the same speeches being given. I have spoken on this motion before, as have Deputies Coppinger and Barry on previous occasions. Former Deputy Joe Higgins was a Member of this House when the Act was rushed through in 1998, one day after the abhorrent Omagh bomb atrocity. That was a horrific act which resulted in more deaths than any other bombing in the course of the Troubles. The establishment at the time used the disgusting attack on the people of Omagh to bring in harsh legislation which has remained on the Statute Book ever since. Joe Higgins was correct to oppose these measures when they were proposed in 1998. The Minister at the time even described it as draconian legislation. We, and people out there, should remember that this law applies to everybody in the State, not just the tiny minority which may threaten to engage or may actually engage in acts of terrorism. The 1998 Act allows the rules of evidence to be changed and for an increase in the length of time for which a person can be detained. The State wants to keep these powers on the books and, even though the provisions are not used regularly, there is a reason it wants to retain those powers rather than to let them lapse. The 2009 Act allows for non-jury trials for certain offences related to organised crime. Let there be no doubt about it, organised crime is a blight on communities. It is particularly working-class communities and deprived communities that bear the brunt of organised crime, particularly in the area of drugs. We support the right to trial by jury. We take that right seriously. We do not think that one can be half a civil libertarian or that one can support the right to trial by jury in some circumstances but not in others. The right to a jury trial is an essential question of civil liberties. Measures are needed to protect juries from intimidation, such as partly exist for witnesses, rather than throwing out jury trials altogether. The Special Criminal Court should be abolished in that respect. There is another particularly questionable aspect to the 2009 Act. Even if one concedes the idea of non-jury trials, the idea that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be empowered to decide how the courts will try these offences, which is the idea that the prosecution should have the power to decide whether to have a judge trial or a jury trial, is clearly repugnant to any basic idea of civil liberties. It is unfortunately the case that when dealing with terrorism or organised criminal gangs the State primarily rests upon and puts forward the idea of repression and suppression of civil liberties. Any quick glance at history will show that throughout the years of the Troubles in the North no amount of repressive measures by the British, Northern or Southern states resulted in the ending of the conflict. Thousands were arrested and interned. Even when there were trials, they would not be what we would consider to be fair trials or to have resulted in reliable convictions. We obviously know of a number of very high profile cases of that nature. The most effective way to overcome terrorism - we should be clear that socialists are absolutely opposed to the methods of individual terrorism - is to build a mass movement built on workers and young people on a cross-community basis. Terrorist methods inflame sectarian divisions and are absolutely counterproductive. The best opposition to that is mass opposition to a return to conflict. This provides a protection against terrorism. It is socialists and trade unionists who have continually held back sectarian conflict throughout the Troubles by bringing pressure to bear on paramilitaries on both sides while State forces have inflamed the conflict with repression. Similarly with organised crime the main offer of the State is repression, which has not worked. Much of the organised crime is involved in the illegal drugs trade. As well as cracking down on those criminal gangs we need to see a complete change in how the drug problem is dealt with. The trade has to be taken out of the hands of these gangs that make massive profit preying off those who are vulnerable and those with addictions. Recreational drugs should be decriminalised, but that should be combined with significant investment in our communities, addiction services and so on. We will be voting against these renewals today because we are opposed to the continuation of attacks on civil liberties by the State and stand full square for people's democratic rights.

We know the reason for the original Special Criminal Court, which came out of the 1939 Act, was to protect Ireland's neutrality during the Second World War and we know of the circumstances of the Troubles in the 1970s. There is a longevity, however, to the Special Criminal Court. It now seems to be enshrined in our legal system and almost normalised as a court setting. That is not acceptable in a modern, democratic, functioning state with a small population such as Ireland has. We know of the overwhelming support for the Good Friday Agreement and we know of the peace that has prevailed in spite of some paramilitary activity. Violence is always regrettable but that paramilitary activity is not centre stage and is not threatening the State so those special circumstances do not prevail.As the Minister has outlined, the main reason relates to a serious terrorist threat to the State and continuing violence on the part of dissident groups. However, this threat has been minimal. An increasing number of the dissident groups have announced they are turning away from the armed struggle. That should be reflected in this discussion. As an aside, I wish to comment on that very undemocratic, unjust system that prevails in the North, namely, the parole commission system whereby there is closed evidence and a lack of access for people to appropriate representation. There are frequent delays and postponements, hence lengthy remands and people being kept in detention, sometimes for over two years, without a charge or conviction and then being released back into society. We just seem to accept this happening just 50 or 60 miles up the road. Why do we continue with the Special Criminal Court? We know the views of organisations such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. The UN Commission on Human Rights has frequently called for the court's suspension. There is an irony in this because we know Ireland has a very considerable reputation when it comes to human rights, yet this is a human right that we are very conveniently ignoring. The criticisms are the lack of a jury and the increasing use of the court to try cases relating to so-called ordinary crime. The Minister mentioned serious gangland crime being used as a reason. I represent the constituency that has been most affected by the recent gangland feud. I acknowledge that there is some support for a special criminal court because of intimidation. However, that intimidation is of the witnesses. There are ways to deal with jury intimidation other than through the Special Criminal Court. We see this in countries that have much more serious gangland crime than that which obtains here. In 2009, the Minister criticised the use of a special criminal court in respect of gangland crime. The best way to cope with gangland crime is to hit the perpetrators where it hurts them the most, that is, their pockets. We saw the recent success of Garda intelligence-gathering in the prevention of murders and attacks, in addition to the seizing of money and goods. This is a much better way of tackling gangland crime. We seem to believe judges are above reproach, beyond fault and perfect in all of the judgments but there are plenty of examples to the contrary. Why is there a discrepancy in their sentencing? We have to work towards eliminating the Special Criminal Court because, regardless of the crime, there is a basic right to justice, which means being tried by a jury of one's peers.

It is a pantomime. That it is does a shocking disservice to the seriousness of the issues involved. We are being asked to renew absolutely extraordinary powers and provisions that apply to suspected organised crime and alleged terrorist offences. We are being asked to allow a special criminal court that admits hearsay evidence on the basis of very low thresholds of Garda evidence to continue in existence. We are being asked to agree to the continued exercise of emergency powers by the State and its agencies. I refer to powers that are supposed to apply only if the ordinary courts are not adequate in order to secure effective administration and the preservation of peace and order. We are being asked to do that without a single detail to support the request. We have been treated to a six-page report without any of the threats being documented, be they domestic, terrorist, national or international. We are treated only to a summary of vague threats from dissident republicans and some absolute boilerplate stuff about international terrorism. That is all we get. Here we are, it seems, in a permanent state of emergency whereby detail does not seem to matter and human rights can be suspended on nothing more than a Government whim. This is despite the fact that I do not believe any reasonable person could today claim that there is a public emergency threatening the survival of the nation. Would the Government ever get over itself? It should be pointed out that the evidence thresholds in the Special Criminal Court are lower than in the ordinary courts. The fact that the word of a senior garda could deprive somebody of his liberty for years or decades is absolutely frightening. There is evidence that the amount of evidence being required by the courts has been getting lower and lower in recent years. They used to look for three or four strands but two are now enough. Other organisations have pointed this out. The United Nations and the Council of Europe have raised concerns about the proportionality of our emergency powers, including this legislation that we are supporting again today. The UN Human Rights Committee has criticised the continuing use of the Special Criminal Court and the arbitrary manner in which the right to a jury trial is denied to suspects in criminal trials, particularly where emergency legislation is applied to suspects in instances that are not related to terrorism. The fact that the DPP has unfettered discretion regarding who is sent before the court is absolutely appalling. We will be opposing these motions strenuously.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	374	Over the years, we have made the usual arguments in here about how this legislation should be altered so the State would not be in violation of its human rights obligations under international law. Obviously, however, the main parties have a different idea. The refusal of succession of Ministers for Justice and Equality to pay any attention to this - despite all the statements from the various human rights groups - suggests that in order to hold the position of Minister, one has to fundamentally disagree with the principle of the universality of human rights. During our debate last year, the Minister invoked the threat of international terrorism as a justification for continuing to have a no-jury court in Ireland. If the Government stopped allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a base from which to create untold destruction in the Middle East and North Africa, the threat of international terrorism to which the Minister refers would be far less significant. Why has the Government not considered this if it is serious about it and really worried about it? That the Special Criminal Court is now being used to deal with the escalation in gangland crimes and murders is a load of nonsense. How do other countries deal with them? In America, they have juries for the same crimes. How do they do it? Other Deputies have mentioned that one of the main reasons gangland crime is thriving is the drugs industry. Why do we not do something about it? What is the point in doing what we are doing? Why do we not consider progressive legislation in Portugal and Switzerland where they have tackled the drugs issue by regulating the industry and taking the gangs out of it? The Government is feeding the gangs with its draconian legislation on drugs and doing no one in this country who suffers at their hands any favours. Human rights groups have been very critical of the expansion of the Special Criminal Court to hear cases relating to organised crime. There is no way on God's earth that we will agree to these motions. The human rights groups also criticised the fact that the court is being routinely used to charge people with the crime of membership of an organisation. This function of the court is particularly offensive as it is riding roughshod over international human rights law. Professor Dermot Walsh eloquently argued the following in the Hederman report in respect of the provisions in the Offences Against the State Act when he stated:There is no requirement for the individual to have gone through a prior act of initiation into the organisation, nor is there any requirement for the individual to proclaim himself or herself a member or for the organisation to claim him or her as a member, nor is there any requirement for the individual to be in possession of property belonging to the organisation or to participate in the activities of the organisation. It is sufficient for an individual simply to be a member of the organisation, and that state of being can be established on the basis of the "opinion" evidence of a Chief Superintendent.One could not make it up. It comes really close to using the criminal law to punish someone for a virtual offence. Given the apparent lack of concern with regard to having this kind of injustice baked into the structures of our legal system, it would seem this annual dance is doomed to continue for some time while the underlying causes of the rising crime rates, inequality, outdated drug enforcement legislation, homelessness and the disparity of opportunity in this country all remain thanks to the continuous failure of Government policy. We came in here in 2011. The amount of policy we have seen implemented here since then that impacts so unfairly on so many sections of our society is remarkable, yet the Government is using this legislation in this manner. It is nonsense.

In recent times, there has been a high level of serious crime and large quantities of drugs have been found.Murders are being committed throughout the country almost on a daily basis. The villains who are perpetrating these atrocities will have to be dealt with, whether in the Special Criminal Court or another court. They have to be taken out of circulation as soon as possible.  In terms of membership of an unlawful organisation, if a superintendent or a chief superintendent believes, based on the information available, that someone should be locked up immediately, I do not see anything wrong with that. What is happening is ridiculous. Drugs and drug lords are causing mayhem in every part of the country. I have said here previously that the Garda needs many more resources to deal with the drugs problem. Drugs are so available now it is like going into a sweet shop; one can get them anywhere. How is that happening? The Minister should use the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act to ensure those people are locked up as soon as they are found guilty of carrying out these serious acts. To go back to the time of the Troubles, we are all glad that the Good Friday Agreement saw an end to those but the country is facing a new challenge, which is dealing with the drugs issue and the drug lords. I ask the Minister to ensure that this Act is used in whatever way he can use it to deal with these villains who are causing mayhem throughout the country.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	376	I am happy to speak briefly on the motion this evening. As the Minister is aware, the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 was enacted following the Omagh bombing in August 1998. It amended earlier offences against the State legislation and contains provisions on the rules of evidence regarding the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation. As the report on the operation of the Act makes clear, the Government of the day moved to ensure that An Garda Síochána and the legal system had the necessary powers to deal effectively with those responsible for these murders and to make clear to all like-minded persons that the State would take appropriate measures to prevent further such atrocities. The Omagh bombing was a truly horrific atrocity as a result of which 29 people, including a pregnant woman, lost their lives. The primary legislation also makes clear that the security threat in Ireland remains primarily from republican paramilitary groups, the so-called dissident groups, which have their origins in the Provisional IRA and the INLA. They rejected and continue to reject the settlement put in place under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, and subsequent agreements, a settlement aimed squarely at securing peace here in the South and in Northern Ireland. We badly need that peace, which is fragile. The concern now about a hard border is fuel for their engines to get them started on a lucrative smuggling trade and other illicit activities along the Border. I want to highlight also the long and painful struggle that the Omagh victim support group has experienced in trying to establish a cross-Border inquiry into the very atrocity and slaughter that gave rise to the 1998 Act we are discussing here this evening. I have visited Mr. Michael Gallagher and his colleagues in the North many times. I brought him here for Leaders' Questions when the Minister's former leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, was Taoiseach. When in opposition, Deputy Enda Kenny brought him to a Fine Gael Ard-Fheis in 2006 where he pointed him out in the crowd, waved at him and told him that he would not get justice under Fianna Fáil but that he would get it under Fine Gael. However, when he came into power, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, abandoned him. I had to bring Mr. Gallagher here so that he could meet him and shake his hand on the corridor but the Taoiseach ran away from him. All Mr. Gallagher wanted to know was whether he was the same person he had met when he was in opposition. The cover up and the shenanigans that went on around the Omagh bombing are truly pitiful. I have met the families involved. I have met Detective Sergeant White and his family. I know a fair bit about that atrocity, which should never have happened. It could have been prevented but it was not. I support Mr. Gallagher. I asked the current Taoiseach, on the day he was elected Taoiseach, if he would try to get justice and meet the Omagh bombing victims and families but to no avail. The shutters came down. It is very unusual that on the one had we have done so much to address the terrorism problem on this island yet on the other, we still have not adequately responded to some of the families directly affected by the violence. We forget about them. We had the debate on the Shane O'Farrell case here last night. Where is the justice in that case? At the time of the Taoiseach's appointment, I asked him to demonstrate more effective political support for the victims and families of the Omagh bombing massacre than his predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, promised but did not do. He literally used them to get votes to get into government, which is despicable. Moving on from that specific issue, I want to finally acknowledge the views of the Garda authorities and the Garda Commissioner, who, as the report on the operation of the Act makes clear, is of the view that the key provisions of this Act are regularly used in the ongoing investigation of terrorist activity. I welcome that. The Commissioner is also of the view that this legislation continues to be one of the most important tools available to An Garda Síochána in the ongoing fight against terrorism. The Garda Commissioner considers it essential that the relevant provisions of the Act should be extended for a further 12 months. However, it is not enough to just have an Act on the Statute Book to help the Garda. It cannot do this unless it has the numbers, the tools of the trade and the basic equipment it needs. In terms of numbers, there has been a 40% reduction in community policing. There was a ban on overtime last December, and the Minister knew about it, but figures were used to say it was next year's money. That was at a time when we are dealing with the most obnoxious, deadly, violent terrorists in this city on a daily basis. A number of gardaí have told us that lives have been spared over this but they are haemorrhaging members. The Minister told me he is going to Templemore tomorrow, which I welcome, but they are all young gardaí who need experience. We are losing the best and the brightest who have the experience. They were ran out of the job because of cuts, restrictions, lack of support from this House in terms of getting adequate funding, vehicles and other equipment.  What happened at the Garda Representative Association, GRA, conference recently was pathetic. We had an officer from the United State of America here. It is pathetic. Members of the Garda cannot get simple tools of the trade to protect themselves when they are in the line of duty on our behalf and that of the public. Marauding gangs are spreading to towns and cities. I have them in my town of Clonmel, although I am thankful for some action taken today. The drugs trade is being run by a mob. Mobs have threatened me because I have asked about legislation here to curtail sulky racing. That is what we are dealing with. They are acting above and outside the law. The gardaí round them up and bring them before the courts but with the revolving door system and free legal aid, they are soon out. I refer to the debate here last night on the Shane O'Farrell case. That person had 52 previous convictions. In a recent case the person had 101 previous convictions but he got free legal aid and bail. We need to wake up the justice system. We need to wake up some members of the Judiciary, so to speak, to ensure they are able to deal with this problem. What is reprehensible is that every day of the week, and there is a silent protest tonight outside Mountjoy, many members of the Garda are accompanying receivers to evict people from their homes. We are getting it all wrong. We are persecuting people instead of putting the rogues and vagabonds and terrorists off the road. Gardaí and members of the regional support unit, RSU, assisted a third force, former British army people, who came down here to evict a family in Balbriggan, and the gardaí stood idly by. It happened, and the Minister knows it. There is no point in him shaking his head. It happened under the Minister's watch. The gardaí were present. The car they had was parked in the Garda station. Those thugs were members of a third force who have no place in this country, no more than the terrorists. Some of them are former terrorists and former militia and they are terrorising people here who are trying to pay their mortgages. That happened. There is no point in the Minister shaking his head. He knows that.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	377	I thank Members for their contributions. I wish to refer in particular to the Special Criminal Court, as it is relevant to both motions and it exercised some Members. It is my strong view that jury trial is to be preserved to the greatest extent possible but we simply cannot ignore the threat posed to the normal operation of the criminal process by terrorists and organised criminals who have nothing but contempt for the rule of law in the State. The Special Criminal Court was established to respond to the threat to the State and its people from republican terrorism over the decades. It continues to be necessary to deal with the subversive threat from paramilitary groups. Indeed, the Government recently put the second Special Criminal Court into operation as a necessary response to the volume of cases that needed to be tried. Some have argued that the Special Criminal Court is no longer needed, that its use is unjustified or even that the Special Criminal Court has been partisan in some way. I reject the utterly baseless assertion made in this House that the Special Criminal Court has operated with bias. For the record, its judges have performed courageous public service in presiding without fear or favour over the prosecution of some of the most dangerous terrorists and ruthless criminals in the State. Are we seriously to accept that the threat from republican paramilitary groups and the brutality of ruthless criminal gangs do not need a particular response from our criminal justice system? Are we simply to ignore these realities and not retain at our disposal the best means to support the Garda Síochána and the justice system in tackling these threats? I cannot and will not accept that. The 1998 Act remains an essential tool in tackling the activities of paramilitary groups across this island. It is complementary to the general criminal law. While the provisions may be out of the ordinary course of the criminal law they are not emergency laws, as some have presented them. Over the course of the State's history, especially during the Troubles on this island, these laws have served to protect and safeguard the State from determined efforts to undermine it and all its democratic institutions. It is surely beyond reasonable argument that a democratic state is entitled, and must make the measures it considers necessary, to protect itself and fundamental rights and freedoms, and allow civil society to flourish. I make no apology for defending our laws and the measures we have in place to combat serious crime and terrorism. The people require us to do what we reasonably can to protect them. Many Deputies here will know from their experience as public representatives the devastation that organised crime in the drugs trade can wreak on individual lives and communities across the State. We must continue to confront this challenge by providing the necessary resources and legislative supports to combat those who seek to undermine the law and damage lives and communities in doing so. The renewal of this provision of the 2009 Act is a contribution to the overall framework of measures that seek to tackle the scourge of organised crime. While we have a comprehensive criminal law regime to tackle serious crime we must constantly see where it might be improved in the light of experience and changes in crime trends. Our laws in this regard remain under constant review to ensure they are proportionate and effective. Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to the Omagh group with which he is in contact. A reply is being prepared and will issue shortly. I acknowledge the work of An Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána has the full support of the Government in tackling serious crime and terrorism. We will provide whatever resources are required to keep our people and communities safe. Some €1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018, an increase on previous years. The Garda authorities work very closely with their international colleagues in their efforts to tackle terrorism and organised crime. It is vital that we continue to enhance the ability of law enforcement and security authorities to make better use of, for example, EU information-sharing databases and resources. Backed by an allocation of more than €200 million for Garda ICT under the capital plan, a significant programme of work is under way to improve connectivity with a number of the information-sharing databases in use throughout Europe. In conclusion, I thank the Deputies who support the motions and the continuation of the use of these powers to ensure the protection of communities, the institutions of the State and our people. I commend the motions to the House.

Increasing working parents' flexibility and choices, and helping to provide them with the opportunity to spend more time with their children, is a worthwhile aim that we all share. However, as Deputies will appreciate, the development of policy in this area is not straightforward and the legislation is more complex than people realise. As the House is aware, the Bill seeks to expand the current parental leave allocation from 18 weeks to 26 weeks. Doing so will place a financial and administrative burden on employers in its own right, but add these eight weeks to the existing provisions for maternity, paternity and carer's leave and existing parental leave entitlements, and the burden becomes significantly bigger. As I will discuss later in further detail, the Office of the Attorney General has highlighted this issue of the cumulative burden on employers and the risk in terms of constitutionality. Therefore, we need to ensure the burden on employers is not disproportionate. To address the needs of businesses and ensure the proposals are proportionate, the Government proposes a phasing in of the expanded entitlements. I will discuss this staggered approach in more detail shortly when I come to the relevant amendment. I might also mention the work the Department has engaged in in respect of two other strands of family leave policy. As the House is aware, the programme for partnership Government includes a commitment to increased paid parental leave during the first year of a child's life, as research shows that children benefit most from parental care at this stage of development. That is paid parental leave as distinct from this, which is unpaid parental leave. To further this commitment, the Government established an interdepartmental working group to develop proposals to give effect to the programme commitments. The group has almost completed its work and is in the process of putting the final touches to its report. I am sure colleagues will agree with me when I say that paid parental leave is much better for parents and families than unpaid leave. It is important to note that discussions are ongoing at working group level on the EU proposal for a work-life balance directive. The most recent draft requires member states to provide for up to 18 weeks of parental leave, two months of which are to be non-transferable between parents, with the two months to be paid at a rate to be determined by member states. There are still a large number of member states concerned with the significant financial implications of the directive and its impact on existing parental leave systems. The directive was discussed at the Permanent Representatives Committee yesterday and it will be discussed at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 21 June. It is an important piece of work in progress. I propose to speak to amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together. These are relatively straightforward and with them I propose a slightly cleaner approach to the Long Title of the Bill. The Title will still reflect that the Bill amends and extends the provisions of the Parental Leave Act 1998 but it will do so in a marginally neater fashion. Simply put, amendments Nos. 1 and 2 amend the Long Title of the Bill to read "An Act to amend and extend the Parental Leave Act 1998". This is something we all want to do and the Government is interested in doing this with respect to paid parental leave as against unpaid leave. I have met both employers and employees and they tell me low-paid employees will find it difficult to avail of unpaid leave but they would certainly be interested in paid leave. It is a Government policy we want to introduce. On Second and Committee Stages I said we were concerned about this cutting across the European Union proposal and what we propose ourselves. As I said at the start, this is complex and we must be careful that we do not cause more damage. That is why I am talking about phasing it in gradually. We do not want a constitutional challenge to the legislation later with the risk of it all being thrown out. According to the Attorney General, there is a risk that this could happen because of the burden it could put on small and other businesses if they had to implement the provisions in one go. We are making these small changes to the Bill to tidy up the Title of the Bill and make it cleaner but without making a major change.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	477	I thank the Minister of State for speaking to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which have been grouped. I am happy to support them to ensure the name and Title of the Bill better reflect what is being provided for. What is being provided for is pretty modest in European terms. The Minister of State spoke of the importance of paid parental leave and there is no doubt that is true. All of us would like to see the Government introducing paid parental leave for the first year of a child's life as soon as possible. It was a commitment in the programme for Government but progress has been slow. What is being proposed is an extension to the entitlement to unpaid parental leave, which is not an alternative but rather an addition to paid parental leave. It is a different type of provision entirely, and its purpose is to provide flexibility to parents during a child's life up to the age of 12. This means that at particular times, perhaps during school holidays or when a child is going through a period or illness, when many different issues arise for parents, there can be flexibility for them so they can balance family responsibilities with work life. We must bear in mind that we are very much down the table in providing parental leave generally within Europe and there is much catching up to do. I was surprised by some of the points raised by the Minister of State. It is a positive aspect of this initiative that it has received cross-party support. It certainly has much support outside this House among parents who are crying out for this flexibility. There has been no mention of any kind of constitutional issue up to now and I do not see that there could be any constitutional issue. The Minister of State also hinted at potential costs, but this was checked beforehand and there is no question of a money Bill. That advice came from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it has been cleared from that perspective. Any potential cost on employers would be minimal. It will not happen that next week all parents will start claiming additional leave, but instead it would happen over a long period of a childhood. It is a very modest proposal that is about helping parents, many of whom are struggling to juggle different responsibilities. The Minister of State mentioned that many low-paid parents might not be able to afford to take unpaid leave, but I repeat that this is not a substitute for paid parental leave. It will be in addition to that leave so it is different. It is about providing a level of flexibility so that parents have the option of taking time off at different stages. We can consider the very high cost of child care and sometimes there is very little in the difference if a parent takes a month of the school summer holidays off work to look after children at home. Taking into consideration tax and the cost of travelling to and participating in work, there may sometimes be very little in the difference. It is an option open to everybody. It is a sensible and modest enough move. I very much welcome the cross-party support we have achieved through Second and Committee Stages and I hope it will continue so we can see the Bill passing Report and Final Stages tonight. I acknowledge the very strong support that Senator Buttimer has given the Bill. He has committed to facilitating its early passage through the Seanad before the recess, which would be a very positive development. There are certainly many parents watching what is happening tonight who will very much welcome these improvements if we can continue to take an all-party approach.

I know amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are not contentious but we will come to such amendments later. I reiterate the point just made by Deputy Shortall, which is that this is not either-or. This is about extending unpaid parental leave. I know from speaking to parents that this level of flexibility would be very helpful in their juggling of work and home life. I will not take up too much time on the first two amendments as they are not the substantial element. I express our general support for what is intended and we also clearly support the extension of paid parental leave, in accordance with the Minister of State's indications.

This is a vital matter and I have received much lobbying on it. Both parental leave and parental benefit are important and they must be dealt with equally. It is clearly more difficult for an Opposition party to bring forward proposals on parental benefit, and that is why this is focused on parental leave. It is important as well. There is much that must be done and I welcome the Minister of State's comments on recent meetings. Ireland ranked 32nd out of 34 OECD states at the end of 2016 with respect to maternity leave. This may have changed somewhat but we are still at that end of the table. If a family cannot afford not to work - a reality for many under pressure to pay the mortgage or rent - it can be a difficulty. The rate is too low and the period for which it is applicable is too short.It is important to address the issue of parental leave as well as parental benefit. The flexibility that Deputies O'Sullivan and Shortall have outlined is vitally important in giving people options and flexibility. Ultimately, between both leave and benefit, we need to work towards a situation whereby there is a single block that can be divided between the parents at their own discretion. This is something we have asked for. It is the best model and one that exists in other states. As I said, it creates choice and flexibility. A lengthier period of paid leave, as well as, I hope, the Government addressing benefit, will assist families. In an increasingly stressful world, there needs to be more flexibility for parents to live lives and raise families.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	480	I wish to make a number of points about this. Deputy Shortall has made the point that this is and should be in addition to paid leave. There is a marked difference in how we approach children and childcare compared with many of our European counterparts, which see people having children as a good thing that needs to be supported in order that society can replenish itself and have people grow up into solid human beings. These countries take a very good approach to the amount of leave provided in the first few years, particularly in the first year. I ask the Minister to consider the example of someone who has had a baby and got her maternity leave. If she has family to mind the baby in order that she can go back to work, that is fine, but for the first year it is in many cases nearly impossible to get a crèche place, for example. Many crèches simply will not take a baby under the age of one. Furthermore, while very often we try to encourage very practical and positive things for a baby such as breastfeeding, the baby may not be weaned. This approach allows for what should be very much a child-centred approach. It seems to me that when it comes to the balance of rights and the balance of how society looks at this, it tends to look at it from an employer's perspective rather than from a child's perspective. Whereas this is a modest proposal, it is an important one because it may well be that a small number of extra weeks give that flexibility that has been talked about. There are, therefore, very practical reasons this initiative could be of assistance not to everyone, but certainly to those who can take it up. A point has been made about the cost of childcare. Childcare is very expensive anyway, but childcare in year one is particularly expensive, and that is if one can get it. This is why this flexibility is something that employers should actually welcome, and I am surprised there is any question at all of there being a constitutional issue about this.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	481	I thank the sponsors of the Bill for affording me the opportunity to speak. I did not speak on any of the previous Stages of the Bill. My two colleagues, Deputies Jim O'Callaghan and Lisa Chambers, represented us on the committee. I completely concur with everything Deputy Murphy is after saying. As spokesperson for children, one thing I do know about crèches is that they normally do not take babies of less than nine months of age. That is part of the rules in most crèches. In the case of children under the age of one, the adult-to-child ratio must be 1:3, which is most expensive for a crèche to operate. This is what crèches are getting out of the business of doing. By increasing the entitlement from 18 weeks to 26 weeks, we would basically be affording a family the opportunity to choose to spend the first year of their baby's life with their baby if they want to do so. I also agree that not every family has that family support in the very beginning whereby they can return to work with the support of either the mother, the father or extended family. The parents themselves would like to care for their own. It is also proven statistically that early intervention and minding one's own in the very beginning aids development at key milestones, so the Bill is a very positive step. It also allows parents flexibility and is about helping them. I absolutely welcome the Minister of State's comments on the programme for Government and paid leave, but tonight's conversation is about the unpaid aspect of it. As a mother of three children, I looked forward to the opportunity to take my unpaid leave after my paid leave. I think parents like that opportunity. It is a choice; it is not forced on them. As for employers, it is not a cost to them to give parents unpaid leave. It is all about how one engages and communicates with one's employer in order that the employer has adequate notice to put provisions in place if it knows the employee is taking that extended time. In my previous work, we had to give a month's notice before we took the additional unpaid leave. However, once we did so, the employer was able to make provisions for it. As Deputy O'Sullivan said, this is not the contentious part of the Bill. I think that will come later. I will support the Bill.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	482	I too am thankful to the Minister of State for his comments. We must be mindful that EU directives do not crisscross, as he said. We will talk about that later. Regarding unpaid leave, I have a staff member who is after having her baby - successfully, thankfully - and who has now gone on to unpaid leave. There is no issue once there is a genuine understanding and a genuinely good relationship between employer and employee, which we would hope would be the case for the vast majority, and once notice is given in order that replacements can be found or contingency plans made. Those very early months and weeks of a newborn baby's life are so important, especially for a first-time parent, or even the second time one. Childcare is so expensive, and many childcare centres will not take small babies. The conditions and guidelines in this regard are very harsh. I happen to be chairperson of a community crèche - a naíonra, in fact - and we must have the checks and balances in place in respect of the 1:3 ratio, which is very high and is onerous on the crèche. There is limited space, limited staff and limited funding, and many crèches have been shortchanged in funding in this recent round, including our one. I have not got the funding that the naíonra expected or was hoping for, so it is very important that there be unpaid leave and that we deal with the matter here. Regarding the issue of paid leave, which I know we will deal with later, I must declare that I am an employer, a self-employed person, and that there are difficulties in this regard. While I am not against the concept proposed in the Bill, I am saying it will be onerous on many employers. While we think we are back in a boom, we are not. Perhaps we are in this city, but we are certainly not in the parts of Ireland I represent. It is important we do not overburden small employers in rural areas as well as urban areas. They are the backbone of our community and our development. I spoke about them earlier today in the context of the Construction Contracts Act and subcontractors not getting paid when big companies go bust, which is a knock-on effect. This is a continuum, and a whole aggregation of these issues forces self-employed people and small businesses out of business. A closed business is no good to the employees, the employer, the taxpayer, the county council or anyone else, so it is very important we make hay slowly. While we might rank well behind in Europe, we cannot just catch up overnight. We must have balance. We need a work-life balance - that is certainly very important - but we also need a balance in respect of the ability or inability of small firms especially to be able to pay the paid leave. However, I support unpaid leave wholeheartedly and I welcome the debate on it.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	483	I have not much more to say at this point. I was just introducing my initial thoughts on the Bill. It is true that it has had a fairly quick turnaround. There was no consultation or pre-legislative scrutiny on it. I said previously at the committee and here that Bills benefit from giving the stakeholders an opportunity to have input into them but that did not happen in this case, unfortunately. I wanted to flag the issue the Attorney General raised that there may be constitutional issues, and to which I will come back later. He does not say that lightly. I do not want to see the Bill ending up in trouble because of those issues.That is genuinely why I am raising it.  Last year we introduced two weeks of paid paternity leave. There has been a very good take-up. We must ensure we are in a position to extend it. I take the point made by Deputies that we have a long way to go in providing for childcare and parental leave. Several years ago I visited Scandinavia where I studied this issue. I met people and saw what they did. Even then they were quite advanced in their thinking. Teachers in childcare services had master's level qualifications in early childcare education and provision. Children learn so much at that age. We, on this side of the House, and I am sure others will agree that in their first year of life children are best placed with their parents. That is where we want to get to and we want to support families and parents in doing so, but we have a long way to go. We propose that we do so incrementally, not in one fell swoop. The unpaid leave is welcome. Some families will not be able to afford to take it, but some will. However, I do not want to move our aim away from the ultimate goal which is paid parental leave in order that people will be able to take time off and have the guarantee that rest assured they will be paid. There are other issues related to gender equality. Often mothers take time out to mind the children and their careers slide because they, rather than the father, take so much time off work. That is an issue and we want to balance it. There are interesting issues when one begins delving into and discussing the matter. The gender pay gap also comes into play, as well as the need to ensure there is a balance and that fathers have the opportunity to bond with children. Last week the House discussed the issue of maternity leave for politicians. We are one of the few groups without a right to paternity or maternity leave and it is something we need to address. We had a very interesting debate on it in Private Members' time a number of weeks ago.  I apologise for going over time.

As colleagues said, it is a subject of some debate. The purpose of the amendment is to amend the Parental Leave Act 1998 to increase the current 18 week unpaid parental leave entitlement to 26. The Government proposes that the increase in parental leave be phased in at a rate of two additional weeks per year between 2019 and 2022. As I have mentioned, while we are all in favour of providing the upmost support for working parents, we must remain cognisant of the potential impact on employers. As Members will recall, on Committee Stage I invited the views of all stakeholders affected, including employers. IBEC subsequently made a submission to the Department in which it underlined its key concerns, chief among which are the consequences for employers, particularly small and medium employers. The big companies will manage, but they were worried about the administrative and cost burdens for small companies. In the light of the challenges involved in replacing key skills and ensuring alternative arrangements will not result in a loss of productivity or output, IBEC submits that it is vital that any increase be on a phased basis to lessen the impact on employers, especially SMEs. Deputies will also appreciate that extending parental leave on a phased basis is not only about supporting the interests of business. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the Office of the Attorney General has raised the issue of the cumulative burden on employers and the risk of constitutionality.  The Bill has moved quite quickly. In my time in the House I have rarely seen a Bill move as fast, with the exception of emergency legislation. Unfortunately, there was no consultation or pre-legislative scrutiny, although on Second Stage I suggested strongly that the committee do so. A phasing-in approach, as proposed by the Government, would enhance the Bill's presumption of constitutionality, as it is contended that phasing in the leave over a four year period, starting on 1 January 2019, would be a proportionate approach and not put a disproportionate burden on employers. This approach stems from previous case law where, as Deputies will recall, the Supreme Court found it to be unconstitutional to place a disproportionate burden on employers which would cause "undue hardship". There is, therefore, a precedent.  As alluded to previously, negotiations on a draft work-life balance directive are still under way at EU level and the Government wishes to highlight the need to ensure that whatever changes are made to domestic legislation will dovetail with the provisions and timeframe for transposing the directive as far as is practicable. Negotiations are ongoing on the directive and we are not yet sure what will emerge. Member states will have three years in which to transpose it into national law; therefore, we are also working at that level on the issue of a work-life balance. Some member states are concerned about the cost; there are, therefore, considerable negotiations taking place on the issue. In some ways, the amendment is quite complex and a lot of work went into making it happen. I am curious to hear what colleagues have to say about it.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	487	As I cannot agree with the points made by the Minister of State on the amendment, I cannot support it for several reasons. The Minister of State cited the possibility of constitutional difficulties. This is the first time that he has raised that issue. We have been through Second and Committee Stages and it never arose. I am not sure what he is talking about when he refers to a cumulative burden on employers. People will not rush out and take all of next week off or whenever the legislation becomes law. In all likelihood, it is something that will be spread over several years. We are talking about an extension of eight weeks during a child's life, potentially a 12-year period, and about a parent having an additional entitlement to eight weeks leave. I do not think that is particularly onerous on anybody. It can be a win-win for employers because very often parents, especially women, find juggling children and work too much. Because of the lack of flexibility in they system, women often step out of the workforce, might resign from their job and stay out of the workforce for some time. Employers often invest considerable money in training their staff. They have loyal and responsible staff who do a good job whom they do not want to lose. That is why there are benefits for employers if they are in a position to show that flexibility to workers, recognise the realities of life where their staff are parents and that in the real world parents have children who need care and attention and time. There is no reason it cannot be combined with an active work life. As I said, it happens across Europe where there are far more generous entitlements to leave which mostly is paid.  I just do not buy the argument about undue hardship. I cannot imagine employers heading off to the High Court because a staff member wants to take an occasional few weeks off when their children are on school holidays or when there are other reasons a parent wants a little flexibility. I wonder from where these arguments are coming. The Minister of State is making this overly complex and I think he is bending over backwards to facilitate employers at the expense of employees. He says the ultimate goal is to provide for paid parental leave. Nobody disagrees with that goal and the sooner the Government legislates in that area the better. We will very much welcome it and the Minister of State will receive the full support of the rest of the House.However, as I pointed out earlier, this is something different. It is about that flexibility during a child's first 12 years. The other point I would make is that what the Minister of State is proposing in the amendment is entirely unreasonable. This Bill is proposing an additional eight weeks that can be spread over a 12-year period. As I have said earlier, and as others have said, this is a very modest proposal. It is not a new proposal. We did not have questions being raised about constitutional issues, employers taking us to court or whatever when the original 14 weeks entitlement was introduced nor when that entitlement to 14 weeks was increased to 18 weeks. None of these questions was raised at the time. It is accepted practice that when a new entitlement is introduced it will incrementally improve and increase over the years as we become, as a society, more progressive and, it is to be hoped, more family-friendly. As I have said, this is not new. I cannot see a difficulty with it. We are talking about a substantial period over which the leave can be taken. What the Minister of State is proposing is that we move in baby steps in extending this entitlement. He is talking about phasing that modest eight weeks over the next four and a half years. For goodness sake, let us be reasonable about this. Let us recognise the difficulties and the important role parents have in looking after their children. Let us be fair and balanced about it. What the Minister of State is proposing is not acceptable by any standards. Certainly when it has been mooted in recent weeks the reaction to it from parents has been very negative. There has been a lot of activity on social media and I think we have all received representations from parents. It is just not on to talk about this modest development being stretched out over such a long period of time.  I hope that in the spirit of new politics and co-operation within the House, the Minister of State will recognise the strong views expressed by all other parties here. We want to facilitate parents and to do it in a reasonable and responsible way. That is what is being proposed. I cannot see there being too much support for what the Minister of State is proposing to do here because it is unreasonable.

I personally can see the attractiveness of that because I believe that children benefit tremendously from parents being at home. However, I have to be honest and say that we need to leave real choice. Every family is different and in some instances it may actually be better, because of a whole range of circumstances, for both parents to be working, even within the first year. I was surprised at the Minister of State's comment in a sense because, from my perspective, the Government is all about labour activation. It is all about getting everyone to work. The Government is backed up in that by the European Union, the OECD, IBEC and ICTU. We saw the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, last week suggest that child benefit be taken off some groups of parents and the money put into childcare. I thought that would just accentuate the ongoing discrimination against parents in the home that I see in the system. It caught me in a sense when I heard that. We should not have any discrimination. We should leave as free a choice as possible to parents. The attractiveness of this provision to extend parental leave is that it is not mandatory. Not everyone will take it. There may be people who choose not to take it for work reasons. Employees will have to decide and they may decide, for a whole variety of different reasons, that it is better for them to go back to work or that it is better for them not to. We need to give freedom of choice to parents. We should do that straight away. I do not think it will cripple the Irish economy. If anything it might help it in the long run. Giving choice and the freedom of choice is important. In respect of those who want to avail of the additional parental leave, I do not see why we should give some people the choice in four years' time but not next year. We should do it straight away. It is about flexibility and providing parents with the ability to choose what is best for them, and they invariably know what that is. In some instances that will be going back to work and in other instances it will be availing of this leave. The provision does not provide any particular financial benefits. We should give them that choice. I do not agree with any delay.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	489	We are discussing and debating an amendment from the Minister of State which would phase in the increase in unpaid parental leave over the period from 2019 to 2022. We are opposed to the proposed phasing-in. We will vote against it when the vote is called. To briefly state why, the proposal for the increase in unpaid parental leave is a very modest proposal. The idea that it has to be phased in not over one or two years, but over several years is not acceptable to us and is not acceptable to parents. Anyone who has sounded out parents on this issue will know that reasonable people feel that this is an unreasonable proposal. The argument seems to be very much influenced by the views of some employers and some employer organisations. There are few, if any, employers in the country who would not be in a position to afford what is in reality a very modest proposal. If the Minister of State was concerned about the ability of some small businesses to afford this in the immediate short term he might bring a proposal before the House for some kind of short-term temporary subsidy. We would look at that on its merits. I personally do not think it would be necessary given the modest arrangements being put forward here. The idea of parents having to wait for their full entitlements for four years is not acceptable and we will be voting against it.

I will be opposing the Government's amendment and the related amendments. I do not see the logic behind it. Even if there was an argument for phasing in the extension, the period we are talking about - four years - is scarcely logical considering that we are only talking about a matter of weeks over the course of 12 years. Businesses would be in a position to facilitate that. It would not cause them any undue difficulty and I therefore will not be supporting the Government's amendment. I will be opposing it.

I just want to stress again that parents have been welcoming things like flexitime and job sharing because so much juggling has to take place when one has children and two jobs in a family, or even one job as the case may be. This would facilitate parents. In terms of the problems for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, there is generally a fairly good personal relationship between the employer and the employees in small businesses. I do not see difficulties arising with this. I think both would be flexible. I think employees would be willing to be flexible but would like the opportunity to take this kind of unpaid time.

It took a while to get advice and views because this moved so quickly. It was not until now that we got the view of the Attorney General and we have genuinely been told that there is a risk. I have listened to what colleagues have had to say. We will definitely not be pressing the amendment based on what they said. It is a modest proposal in its own right. I have reservations and may come back to the Seanad with further information when we have a bit more time to consider this. I do not want this to fall on a constitutional matter. We have to bear in mind that already we have 26 weeks' paid maternity leave, a possibility of 16 weeks of unpaid maternity leave, 18 weeks of parental leave, and two weeks of paid paternity leave. This amounts to 62 weeks already. This provision adds another eight weeks, or two months, of unpaid leave. The Government was bringing forward its own proposals for paid leave on an incremental basis. Obviously, we have to be cognisant of the cost of this over time and of the EU directive. I have listened to what colleagues have said here tonight and on Committee Stage. My view is that the majority of colleagues want this to go ahead as proposed. I will not be standing in its way at this stage. We will have to re-examine this matter, perhaps when we get to the Seanad, and discuss it further. Reducing the period from four years to two might be a way out. On the issue of the previous increase in 2013, from 14 to 18 weeks, that was a requirement of the EU parental leave directive of 2010. There was a presumption of constitutionality in that regard at the time. I will not be pressing this amendment at this time. I have listened to what colleagues have said. We all want to support families and parents. I am still a parent but having been a parent of small children quite a while ago, I understand the pressures, strains, tensions and costs associated with parenting and how they have increased over the years. The first year a child's life is so important. It is important that the child be with his or her parents. Deputy Shortall or Deputy Catherine Murphy said earlier that we must examine issues such as breast-feeding in the workplace and so forth. These are all important issues that we have to discuss if we are to achieve equality, including gender equality. That is my position. I listen quite a lot to colleagues both in the Seanad and here and I believe we have to have a debate on these issues. It is important to debate this issue.

The Government policy is that both sets of parents should benefit from additional parental leave being introduced and, in addition, those parents with unused parental leave should also be able to use any portion of their unused leave. The substantive elements of the changes to the Bill are contained in amendment No. 6, which I will now outline to the House. Currently, under the Parental Leave Act 1998, the single largest period of parental leave a parent may take is 18 weeks. We were going to increase the entitlement on a phased basis but obviously we have now changed that approach. These particular amendments are consequential on the ones that went before. We were going to propose blocks over the number of years. The amendments do not arise now so I do not believe we will be spending too much time on them. That is all I want to say on the amendments.

In page 4, to delete line 16 and substitute the following:"(3) This Act shall come into operation on 1 January 2019.".This is a straightforward amendment. We must bear in mind the changes proposed that would not be accepted here and that I did not press. This is a straightforward amendment that seeks to delete section 3(3) of the Bill and replace it with the Government's text for subsection (3). It states the Act shall come into operation on 1 January 2019, for the following reasons. In the first instance, there is a serious technical issue with section 3 in that an Act cannot come into operation after its passing as proposed in the Bill as the Act needs to be signed by the President to be enacted and to have legal force. As Deputies will be aware, Article 13.3.1° of Bunreacht na hÉireann states every Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas shall require the signature of the President before its enactment into law. Section 3(3) of the Bill provides that the Act comes into operation three months after its passing, not after its enactment. In short, an Act can come into operation only after enactment, not after its passing by the Houses of the Oireachtas, as proposed in the Bill. To allow section 3(3) of the Bill to stand would essentially mean the Bill would bypass the President and his functions under the aforementioned article of the Constitution. I am moving the amendment as it is the Government's intention that the Act will commence on 1 January 2019. It is a technical issue, a constitutional issue, that we must be careful about.

That is a reasonable period for people to adjust. I repeat the point that it is not that people will suddenly start taking all this leave. It is just that it would start after three months, and then people would spread out that leave over a number of years.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	521	When I re-examined the provision on unaccompanied learner drivers which was inserted into the Road Traffic Act 2016, one matter which came to my attention was the question of what should happen to a vehicle if gardaí intercept a learner driver unaccompanied. Section 41 of the 1994 Act allows the Garda Síochána to detain a vehicle in certain circumstances. These include cases where the vehicle is not taxed or insured or does not display a national car test, NCT, certificate when it should. Detention can also happen in cases where the member has reason to believe that the person has been disqualified from driving or where the person refused to produce a driving licence or learner permit and the member has reason to believe that, due to their age, the driver cannot be licensed to drive. At present, however, the power to detain a vehicle does not extend to a vehicle driven by an unaccompanied learner driver. I believe this is an omission we should rectify. Imagine the scene at the roadside. A learner driver has been intercepted driving unaccompanied. The terms and conditions of a learner permit are clear and say that a person who has a learner permit should be accompanied. These people are therefore driving in an illegal way. It is wrong, irresponsible and dangerous. I do not believe anyone expects a garda dealing with a situation like this to take the person's details and let them drive off. How can they when the person does not have an accompanying driver? I will explain briefly how this will work in practice. The rules will be exactly the same as those applying under section 41 if the vehicle is detained on any of the other grounds under that section. The vehicle will be towed away for storage. The owner will then be able to come and reclaim it. They will have to pay a charge for the removal and storage. If it turns out that the vehicle was incorrectly detained, there will be no charge for removal or storage. How could it be incorrectly detained? It is obvious that if a vehicle is detained because it is thought to be uninsured and the owner subsequently proves that it was insured at the time it was detained, it should not have been so detained and all charges are waived. In the case of unaccompanied learners, it might be that the learner had a qualified accompanying driver with them but the accompanying driver did not produce a licence and the member on duty did not accept that the accompanying driver was qualified. If the licence was later produced when the car was being retrieved from storage, there would be no charges. Under section 41, the Garda has the power to dispose of a vehicle if it was not claimed within a certain period. This period is set in section 41 as being either three weeks or two weeks after a notice of disposal is sent to the owner, whichever is longer. The reason the Oireachtas chose to act against unaccompanied learner drivers in 2016 was the risk that they can pose to themselves and others, particularly in the light of the appalling Clancy case where mother and daughter, Geraldine and Louise Clancy, lost their lives in an incident caused by an unaccompanied learner driver. Learner drivers are just that - people who are learning to drive. This is why the law requires them to have a qualified driver accompanying them whenever they drive. It is illegal and dangerous for learners to drive unaccompanied. We need to get the false notion out of people's heads that once someone has a learner permit they are free to drive as they wish. A learner permit is not a licence. It is not something to use for commuting or leisure unless the learner has someone to accompany them. People who have said that somehow putting an end to unaccompanied learner driving will make life harder for people are missing the point. It will make them focus on learning and on getting a full licence and it will make them and all the rest of us safer. I want to tackle the bizarre suggestion that this measure will in some way put farmers out of business because of the seizure of vital farm equipment. It has even been suggested in some quarters that gardaí will be entering farmyards to seize tractors driven by learners. We hear a lot these days about false news or scare tactics but these claims really take the Oscar. Road traffic law applies to public places. That means public roads and public car parks. It does not apply to farmyards, backyards, fields, front gardens, back gardens or anywhere else which is private land. The idea that gardaí could enter a farmyard and seize vehicles driven there by unaccompanied learners is nonsense. There is also the question of what is an unaccompanied learner. Learners in some categories of vehicles such as cars have to have a qualified driver accompanying them. For some categories they do not. For example, learner motorcyclists do not have to have a qualified driver with them for reasons which must be obvious.Learner tractor drivers do not either. Why is that? The people of rural Ireland know, even if those who claim to represent them apparently do not, that tractors have traditionally been built with one seat. Some tractors can take a passenger and the rules state that if a learner tractor driver has a passenger with him or her that person must be a qualified driver. However, we do not require a learner tractor driver to be accompanied by a qualified driver for the obvious reason that in most cases it is not possible. I trust the good sense of the people of rural Ireland to know that and not to be frightened by these absurd and alarmist claims.

It is reckless that the State has failed to give young drivers a test. They go through all the procedures and then apply for their test. Currently, there are youngsters waiting up to six months to get a test. That has been proven. When new laws are being introduced new solutions must also be introduced. The problem is that even though these youngsters have done everything by the book as they were required to do, the State is failing in its obligation to give them a test even in a medium amount of time, which I would consider to be six weeks. There should be no reason for the State not being in a position to do that. We constantly hear promises that more driver testers will be recruited, which is good, but the figures show that the situation is not improving. In fact, it is getting worse. If a youngster has gone through the different steps of getting their 12 driving lessons from a driving instructor, learning the rules of the road and doing everything he or she is supposed to do and is willing to sit a test, the State should have an obligation to provide it. It is recklessness and unaccountability on the part of the State. The State should give them the opportunity to do it within six weeks but it is leaving them for 19 or 20 weeks without a test even though they are ready for it. Before we impose rules on youngsters we should ensure that we have the procedures and enough driver tester personnel in place around the country.  The Minister referred to tractors and it is good that it is clarified. Many people did not know if it affected tractors, but it is good to know it does not have an effect if there is a single seat in it. The Minister said there is to be an accompanying driver. I believe we should be considering new ideas. I should be as good a driver two days before I pass the test as on the day I pass it, if I am going to pass it. I have said time and again that we should have a system whereby in places such as Mondello Park and other places in the west, south and north one can do an advanced type of driving course with a driving instructor so if the State is unable to give somebody the test the driving instructor could say that in his or her opinion a person is fit or able. One gets a piece of paper on the day one passes the test. Obviously, one has to be as good on the day before it but one does not have that piece of paper in one's hand. The big blockage is the failure of the State to ensure that these youngsters are given the opportunity. That is all we are seeking. Nobody is saying they should be able to travel around on the road in one way or another. When I and other Deputies talk about rural Ireland we understand it. The Minister seems to be throwing shots across the bow at different public representatives about rural Ireland. To be quite blunt, between potholes in the roads and the different legislative measures being introduced, if the Minister is left much longer in his job he will be remembered in rural Ireland but it will be for the wrong reasons. As has been the case for many years, and I have made this very clear, there are parents in parts of rural Ireland who may have an income of €12,000 to €18,000. Their child might get the opportunity to go to college. The Minister will be well aware of the price of accommodation in Dublin and in other places around the country where there are colleges. Unfortunately, many parents cannot afford it. There is no point in beating around the bush about what has happened down through the years - a car was bought and the youngster would drive to college. We must ensure that we give such youngsters an equal opportunity, whether they live in Dublin, Donegal or Kerry, to do the test as quickly as possible. That piece of paper is a life saver and might be the difference between a youngster going to college or not going to college. We can introduce laws and that is fine. After that, however, the State does not seem to be bothered. The law is in place and the State talks about recruiting driving instructors or driver tester personnel over the following six, eight or 12 months, but a large number of youngsters are seeking to do driving tests at present and, unfortunately, that facility is not available. To compound that we introduced something that has blocked the system further. There are many drivers who were backing trailers all their lives and then found out that they did not have it on their licence. They are seeking to sit a test. This issue should be checked in the different Departments, not just the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. It is also a matter for the county councils. The licences were shredded and the councils cannot now tell people if it was before 1991 or 1992 when they got their licences. That is a problem in various places. The councils went from paper to computerised records and whatever happened in the meantime - I am not blaming the Department - many people are now caught as a result of not having the information they should have. The Department and especially the Road Safety Authority talk about safety. The first thing I would do is ensure that there is no excuse for not being able to take a test. We should make sure that facility is available. Why is there such a big problem with a lack of driver testers?Is it that there is not a budget or driving testers? There are many people around the country who are well qualified at driving that it does not take a year to get up to the spec that is required with the amount of licences. Even in Dublin there is a shortage of testers. It is depriving youngsters of an equal opportunity if they are going to college or getting a job. Every Deputy gets phone calls every day of the week from people waiting for a driving test. It should be the number one priority to say that by next September we will guarantee every person that they will have a test within six weeks. If the Minister can do that, he can ensure he enforces whatever laws he wants to introduce. We are doing one thing on the one hand without solving the problem. This has not just happened in the Minister's time; I am not having a go at him about this. This goes back for a while. The waiting time for a driving test is getting longer and longer. It is possible to get the theory test within a few days. It is a great facility and well set up. A person who gets less than 35 questions right out of 40 can be back again the following week. We need concrete information that within three months, nobody will be waiting for longer than six weeks.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	526	I will address the issue of tests. I accept the criticisms made by virtually every Member of this House. I also accept the case made by virtually every Member of the House that the driving test waiting list is too long. The Deputy talked about a six-month period. I think that is the highest possible one. The objective of the RSA is ten weeks and the average is around 12 to 14 weeks. That is still not an acceptable level. We should certainly aim to come down to six weeks and we are not there. The RSA has recently taken measures involving extra overtime for existing driving testers, which will bring the waiting time down. It is gradually introducing new systems to allow tests to be done on a self-appointment basis. In other words, applicants can do it all on the Internet and fill in the gaps that way, rather than making an appointment. The RSA has also taken measures to eliminate the no-shows, which represented a very large number of those applying for tests. No-shows were a big problem. Measures have now been taken whereby it contacts all those who are coming up for a test and those who are likely to be no-shows because of their records. Those are also reducing in numbers. I accept Deputy Fitzmaurice's criticisms. It is a fair criticism to say that the waiting list for tests is too long. It is a fair criticism to say it is not reducing quickly enough. However, this does not justify by any stretch of the imagination putting a lethal vehicle such as a car in the hands of someone who is patently judged not fit to drive it.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	527	I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this. I am sorry to say that I was unhappy with what the Minister said in the first place and I am still unhappy with his response to Deputy Fitzmaurice. We need to go back to the nub of the argument the Minister is making with regard to this proposal. The Minister is making an assumption that an accident involving an unaccompanied driver would not have happened if he or she had a fully qualified driver with them. I cannot agree with the criminalising and the targeting of young people. I will say one thing about our young people. Every one of us had to start somewhere, whether it was driving a motorcar or a tractor, or getting up on a digger. Every one of us had to do something for the first time. None of us came into this world being able to perform the tasks that we might do now at our ease. Everybody has to start somewhere. I cannot for the life of me figure out why the Minister is targeting our young people - the people we cherish, the people we want to stay here, the people we want to encourage to work. What about young people in the constituency I am very proud to represent, living down in Tuosist or in Valentia Island or any part of Kerry, be it east, north, south or west, if they are fortunate enough to get a bit of a part-time job or want to go helping an uncle or an aunt? If it means travelling a bit and if they want to make a bit of money, is the Minister seriously saying they must pass the test at a time when they are told they cannot have their test because they have to wait? In saying that, I want to compliment the people carrying out the tests in Kerry, but unfortunately they are not being given the resources to allow them to carry out tests in a reasonable length of time and that is why people have to wait for too long. What the Minister is telling these people who need to travel, whether it is going to college to further their education, get on in life and get their leg up on the ladder or whether it is to go to work? The Minister and his colleagues in government and the people who support them who come from rural areas, often go into and out of the farmyards that the Minister spoke about a while ago. When an election is called, they will go into those yards and will seriously look at those parents and say, "Well, we're the people who supported Minister Ross when he wanted to criminalise you, we backed him, we voted for him and the whole way of life of your young people is being upset because of what has been done inside in Dáil Éireann." I am extremely sorry for any person who loses his or her life on our roads. None of us wants to see a parent losing anybody belonging to them. We do not want to see anybody dying on our roads. However, unfortunately it has happened and always will happen, despite everybody's best efforts quite simply because accidents do happen. To try to put this down on young people and say that it is okay to pass this provision and target young people, that it is okay to paralyse them and leave them in such a way - the Minister should think about the practicality of what he is suggesting. On the one hand they cannot sit the test, because the place is not there for them to sit the test immediately when they want to. So they have a provisional licence. The Minister is saying then that if they are getting up early in the morning and if they have a job or if in the evening time they get work and want to go work, they cannot drive to work.They have to get their mother, father, aunt, uncle or somebody else with a full licence to sit in with them. This may work in this city where people have many transport options but in the county I represent we do not have those methods of transport. If a parent in Boheshill or Glencar wants to send a young person out to work or, more importantly, the young person wants to go himself or herself, how is he or she supposed to do so? It is not practical or sensible that a parent would have to accompany that person. The current system is working. It is not broken. Trying to blame every accident on young people is not fair or right.  As I said earlier, everyone of us had to start somewhere. In rural areas, in particular on farms, the younger a person sits behind the wheel of a car the better. I am speaking in this regard of off-road driving. The younger he or she is trained the better. One cannot buy that type of training. The first time a young person reared in an urban area might sit behind the wheel of a car is when he or she obtains a provisional licence. I believe this person is at a disadvantage in comparison with the person who might have had an opportunity to sit behind the wheel of a car from a very young age, accompanied, perhaps, by a parent explaining how the car works. Everyone in my family learned to drive off-road at a very young age, as did my own children. All of my children were capable of driving from a very young age. If they were not, there would have been something drastically and radically wrong. The longer children in rural areas are driving in farmyards and off-road the better because it is educational and good for them. It prepares them for travelling on the road. I recognise that not everybody has that opportunity, which is all the worse for them.  In terms of what the Minister is trying to do, I am sorry for the people of Ireland who are upset by it. The Minister is not 100% at fault in this regard because he could not do this without the backing of the Government, which he is supporting, along with some Opposition Deputies, which they are perfectly entitled to do. All Deputies have their own mandates. They are here representing people but they seem to be representing a different group of people to those I represent. As the Minister knows, I am working on the ground every day of the week from early morning to late at night seven days per week. I adore the job of representing the people of Kerry. As long as they continue to elect me, I will speak on their behalf. As I said, I believe what the Minister is doing is hurtful. Time will prove what he is doing to be wrong. Despite his best efforts there will continue to be accidents. To insinuate that a young driver will not be involved in an accident when accompanied by a person with a full licence is wrong and misguided. The Minister is misleading people and he is going after young people when he should not be doing so.  If I had all night I could not explain how hurtful and wrong this is. I plead with the Minister to even at this late stage see the error of what he is doing and to understand it is wrong. I plead with him to relent and to listen to people who are proposing other options. There are other ways of dealing with these matters. For example, the Minister could come into this House tomorrow morning with proposals to properly resource driver testing centres so that people can have an opportunity to sit their driver test at the earliest opportunity and if they fail it they will have the opportunity to take a retest almost immediately. Practical, sensible measures such as this would make sense.  Unfortunately, when it comes to road safety we have gone crazy. For example, when lorries and buses are tested and certified roadworthy they can be stopped on the road the following day and rechecked, which does not make sense. Unfortunately, authorities such as the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, which were set up with good intentions, are losing the run of themselves. When it comes to road safety people operating businesses, be it buses, lorries or hackneys, have to negotiate many hoops. We all want to ensure that vehicles that are operated for reward meet all safety standards and are certified roadworthy but even when these vehicles are tested and certified roadworthy they can be hauled in for a recheck. This is a money making racket. It is about time somebody in the Minister's position examined what is happening to these law abiding, decent people who are keeping this Government and the country going. These people are self employed and providing jobs for many other people and they are being terrorised in their businesses.

I am talking about road safety. I am talking about saving lives. I am talking about things in a sensible way and I am asking the Minister to look at other aspects of road safety that he is not looking at. Since becoming Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has concentrated on a very narrow focus of road safety. Many times I have stood up in this House and pointed out that driving a car is one of the sure things young people will do and I have asked the Minister why he and the Minister for Education and Skills do not work together and put road safety and driving cars on the school curriculum, again, from a very early age. Why should young people not be taught the ins and outs of road safety while at school? In the past number of years, I have not heard a Minister make that suggestion in this House or agree to take on board that suggestion when I and others made it. If the Minister is about saving lives, he should be looking at every aspect of road safety and not one particular aspect of it, which is what he and the people supporting him have been doing. I do not understand why he does not broaden his focus. There are so many other reasons for accidents on our roads. Sadly, a couple were fatally injured on our roads today. We do not want to see this happening but I do not believe the measures the Minister is hoping to introduce will prevent accidents. It would be wrong to say any more about the accident that occurred today. I just had to acknowledge it.

Why not consider all the other issues that have been raised during these debates, which have gone on but rightly so? What the Minister is hoping to do will change things forever in rural Ireland which has been hit hard enough for long enough. Each person can speak only for their own area. I have seen the accidents that have happened over the years and have known the cause of many of them. In many cases the truth of what happens goes unreported. It seems to be grabbing headlines that the Minister's solution will fix everything on our roads. That is so wrong. I would like to see the Minister tackle issues that I and others have raised tonight, and will continue to raise. He should be looking at a bigger picture and not concentrating on what he is doing at present. The Minister is probably burnt out from this but the hardship he is about to impose will never be underestimated. Like any rule or regulation, once it comes in, if it comes in, it will be very hard to reverse. It will make our place more unattractive for our young people. Where I am from we have lost many people who left because there was no work for them. They went to England, Australia, America and other parts of Europe. I would give my back teeth to see those people here again. Unfortunately, however, they have started new lives and now we might also lose the next generation. It is sad that grandparents and potential grandparents will not have their grandchildren growing up here. The Minister is ensuring that young people starting out will say to hell with this, if they are from a country area, living with their parents and see that they cannot travel to work, will not be allowed on the road, cannot sit their driving test and get their full licence, and they will decide to chance their arm in Australia for a few months. If they do that they might never come back. This could have the knock-on effect of robbing us of more people who we want to keep in our countryside, in Ireland. They are the taxpayers, politicians and teachers of the future. They are the people we will rely on. We are only on a wheel, we will not be here forever. All I want is to see those people here to replace every one of us, myself and the Minister included. They will not be there if the Minister is going to hunt them, which is exactly what will happen. It is wrong and unfair. I ask the Minister to please look at this again and take on board the opinions I have given him in a cool, calm and reasoned way. I speak on behalf of many people. I would not mislead the Minister, as he knows in his heart and soul. Many people are talking about this and are upset about it. They believe the Minister is misguided in what he is trying to do. They are not nasty about it and I am not nasty about it, as the Minister knows. I am being very reasonable and pleading with him. He has the power, as Minister, and I plead with him to look at this again and not to discourage our young people from living here, not to criminalise their hard working parents, not to tie them up in more red tape and bureaucracy and laws, all in the interest of road safety when we all know it will not lead to our roads being safer. There is so much other work that can be done on our roads to make them safer. For instance, one of the most basic things that could be done tomorrow morning would be to tell every local authority to keep water off the roads and keep hedges cut on narrow country roads. Does the Minister realise how many accidents and injuries that would prevent?

Will the Minister, as the Minister with responsibility for safety on our roads, use his power to ensure that the local authorities will go back cutting hedges and to the basic work they used to do long ago when we had section men who went out every day? They were proud of keeping their sections of road clear of water and keeping the hedges cut. This work has been neglected and is causing accidents. It is about time somebody told the truth in here and said that is what is causing many accidents. If the Minister asked gardaí they would not be long about telling him what is causing accidents. Many of them would privately tell him something completely different from what the public is being fed and what many in the media say, that the Minister is right and everyone else, including us, is wrong. I can only plead with the Minister on behalf of the people I am elected to represent.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-06-13 00:00:00	Business of Dáil	548	I support the Minister's amendment to the 1994 Act. I have been asking the Minister for a long time to address consolidation of road traffic legislation. On its website, the Law Reform Commission appends all the changes that have been made to the Act since 1994, through the Bills passed since then. As that is the case, is it not possible for the Minister to ask the Law Reform Commission to make a full consolidation instead of having the House consider road traffic Bills almost annually? We could have all road traffic Acts in one convenient consolidated Bill, as was done, for example, with the Companies Act 2014 and other legislation. Deputy Fitzmaurice made the reasonable point that several thousand drivers continue to drive on repeat learner permits. They are, however, entitled to a speedy test. The Minister should address that in the Bill.  I also agree with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae on driver education. Purchasing a house and looking after the household and homestead and purchasing and looking after and driving a vehicle are perhaps the two most important transactions in a person's life. It is reasonable to expect that the educational system should focus on that. It should be an important part of second level education.  There was a horrendous tragedy on the Inishowen Peninsula where a teenager was killed driving a vehicle unaccompanied.  It brings home to us the urgent need to address the situation. People have referred in the past to joyriding and to unaccompanied driving at a very young age. This can result in a horrendous tragedy for the family, the district and the child. The Minister has set out a reasonable case as to why we should proceed. Looking at the practice across the rest of the European Union, it is interesting that in most countries preparation for driving is an educational process that one goes through. One then proceeds to obtain one's licence. The main point is that this House tried to legislate for this area in the 2016 Act with an amendment in Deputy Imelda Munster's name. That Bill passed and was signed by the President. The same happened with the rickshaw issue. It is incredible that we have had to go back over this ground at such length. I refer to the section in the 1994 Act and the detention of vehicles and giving additional power to An Garda Síochána in respect of unaccompanied drivers. We could have dealt with this more expeditiously. The Dáil tried to do so in the 2016 Bill. The Minister and the Minister for Justice and Equality have given us the figures in respect of unaccompanied young people who tragically have been killed and seriously injured over the past six or seven years. It is an area of road safety we can address and we should do so with this amendment and the final amendment. Most of these debates have been attended by Mr. Noel Clancy and his daughter and the relatives of victims of tragic road crashes. It would be fitting that we listen to their pleas and those of tens of thousands of families affected by serious road crashes and fatalities and that we would accept the Minister's amendment.

I am disappointed, however. The Minister had an opportunity last night - he was allowed ten minutes - to respond to some of our questions but he chose not to do so. Deputy Broughan intervened as well. We have asked many questions during the course of the debate, including on Committee Stage, when were allowed to speak as non-members of the committee. Privately, I have had long discussions with the Minister, Deputy Ross, on this. I am disappointed he was unable to have a proper discourse on this legislation. We all want to make the roads safer. Ar an gcéad dul síos, I totally condemn anyone who drives recklessly, uninsured or drunk. I refer to people injured and hurt and I sympathise with Mr. Clancy and his daughter. Deputy Healy-Rae just informed us that two more people lost their lives on the roads today, of which I was not aware. It is a huge, complex and multifaceted problem. We are passing this legislation even though the Minister is only two years in office. While I appreciate that, I have a document relating to the commencement of sections of legislation, which is relevant. I mention the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 and the Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness (Roadside Enforcement) Regulations 2018. I mention also the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Act 2014, which was enacted more than four years ago. All this legislation is under the Minister's Department. I asked about the Construction Contracts Act 2013 earlier today, which is badly needed. We pass Bills, and it may be the same with this one, but when are they commenced? I refer to sections of the Road Traffic Act 2016. I have been delving into the sections of many Bills but this issue relates to transport. I refer to the issue of L plates. I have great admiration for young people. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí. Driving is an important skill to have and that applies whether one is living in Dublin, Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Thurles, Nenagh, Rearcross or elsewhere. Young people are entitled to respect and to be allowed to drive. Many young people in the country, especially if they are farmers or are friends of farmers, get great experience on the land and not on the road. That is from a young age and they are accompanied and trained well. Nowadays one has to have 12 lessons from an officially recognised tester. That is good legislation and is very important and valuable for young people because they get that tuition. Parents might not always be the best teachers. I have a family of eight and many of them did not get those lessons but got them from my wife or myself. Since that legislation came in, 12 lessons have to be obtained from approved testers and that can cost anywhere from €350 to €500. It is a lot of money but it is money well spent. Like Deputy Healy-Rae and others, I am anxious to have simulator testing on the syllabus in schools. The Abbey School in Tipperary town has had that for a number of years for transition year, TY, students. It created a track as it was lucky to have the space. An experienced driving instructor comes in and the students do that as part of their TY studies. That is a very good programme of which I am all in favour. Some of the students, however, do not get as much benefit from some of the courses as they should. This, however, is a practical, hands-on course. Girls and boys learn to drive, pay for lessons and get good experience from the tester, Mr. Joe Quinn. He has arranged this with the school, which I salute. We need more of that. The Buttimer family in Cahir is applying for a new racing track. The planning application mentioned that it is hoped to use that track as a simulator course for young people to learn how to drive. It is not only young people who need to learn to drive but some older people as well. We have people returning from America and different places. If they are gone for a number of years, they lose their licence. They have to start off with the theory test, which was not there when I did my test. It only came in quite recently. They have to do lessons before they do their test. There are many things that can be beneficial. We would have liked to have worked with the Minister on this but he refused to engage or to discuss it with us. The delay in getting a driver test is a big issue. It is the same no matter what age one is but more often it affects young people. It varies across the country. I do not always listen to Mr. Joe Duffy on "Liveline" but recently there was a debate on the programme about failure rates. They are very alarming in some places. They vary greatly between urban areas and between rural areas. We had a second test centre in Tipperary when the national car test, NCT, centre opened. We lobbied the Minister and another centre was provided in Cahir but it was closed a year or two later. I think the reason was that there were no traffic lights in the town other than pedestrian crossings. I am not sure but it was alleviating the waiting list and backlog in Tipperary.I know the testers, and there is not a week that goes by that parents or the young people themselves are not looking for an appointment to take a driving test. They have to wait to get it. It is daunting. I remember quite well doing my test. One gets nervous, like any test. There is competition and a person can feel a bit on edge. He or she is driving, doing his or her best, but cannot communicate with the tester. If a person fails the test, he or she cannot reapply for a full month. That person will have done the theory test and taken all the lessons, which takes a good number of months. He or she builds up confidence and gets the sign-off from the driving instructor when ready. The driving instructors use their intuition, and I praise them for the help, encouragement and enthusiasm they give to those young people, and indeed to new drivers from here and abroad. When those people go for the test, many anomalies crop up. I read out a list of such anomalies on the previous occasion, and I do not want to be repetitive. People fail tests because the rubber has gone off the little handle that allows the seat to go backwards and forwards, or because there is a cap on an expansion tank overflow. This can happen to a car that passed the NCT four days earlier. Are we contradicting or overriding the NCT tests? There are other inconsistencies in testing. There is often no shed or covered area available to inspect the car in. I am aware of many people who have turned up, by appointment, for tests on a wet day. Those people did not choose the weather but there was no visual inspection of the car because it was too wet. I am aware of one instance where a person travelled to the testing centre in Clonmel only for the tester to decide that it was too foggy, even though the person had to drive to the centre from Cappawhite, which is 30 miles, with an accompanying driver in the fog. Driving is done in all kinds of conditions. It is not easy. I am aware of someone who failed because it was too frosty. I agree with the Minister when he says that no-shows must be punished and taken out of the system, because they are taking slots from others. I fully accept that. Those people should be able to give notice. Of course, something might happen on the morning of the test, such as an accident or the person being ill, but I do not give any credit to people who decide not to do the test because they want to delay it and do not inform the test centre. That is a slot gone for someone else. On the previous occasion I gave the Minister figures on the number of testers who have been recruited since 2014. I asked him a question and he did not answer it. Of the 26 recruited, only a small number had been put to work. Even though they applied and got the job they were not functioning as employees. Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether there is an issue with the trade unions. I do not know whether there is an issue, but I have heard it suggested, and I would be very concerned if that was the case. Everybody who cannot get a test is being discommoded. I would like to see a system in place where a person can book a test once he or she has completed his or her lessons. If a person fails for one of the reasons I mentioned, including the weather or an inspection which reveals that some manual instrument in the car is not working, there should be a fail advisory issued. If one is good enough to drive, a fail advisory should be issued and the problem could be sorted out. To fail the whole test and have to go back through the system again for a month is wrong. For that month that person in rural Ireland, who may have failed for something I feel should be advisory, is going to be criminalised, especially if his or her parents, guardians or somebody else he or she trusts in his or her friendship circle cannot be with him or her. That is very unfair. The legislation the Minister is introducing is going to criminalise that person, and indeed the car owner, if he or she is stopped at a checkpoint without a full licence. Parents ring me all the time - I am sure the same is true for other Deputies - whose children have just finished secondary school and who hope to go for an apprenticeship or college, and if they want to travel-----
