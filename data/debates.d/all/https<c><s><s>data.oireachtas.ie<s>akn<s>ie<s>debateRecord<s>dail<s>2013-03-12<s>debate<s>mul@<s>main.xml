            <p eId="para_3">I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> I am keenly aware of the challenges we face in delivering housing supports to a range of vulnerable households and groups. The difficulties facing the State's finances and the necessity to reduce public expenditure to sustainable levels are impacting on capital programmes all across the public service. My Department's housing programme is no exception. Deputies will be aware that the amount of capital funding available has decreased significantly in recent years along the lines highlighted in the medium-term Exchequer framework for infrastructure and capital investment 2012-16. Regrettably, these steps are necessary to bring stability to the public finances. As a result, capital spending on housing programmes in 2013 is down on last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> Reduced capital budgets inevitably give rise to difficult choices and decisions in allocating the available funding. This means balancing the available capital across a range of important areas and spreading these scarce resources in a way that meets the needs of those concerned to the best extent possible. In addition to the private housing grants, the housing capital budget needs to cover important measures such as regeneration, estate-wide improvements, energy retrofitting and meeting the housing needs of older people and people with physical, intellectual and mental health disabilities. I am allocating €167 million for these measures in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> The Government's housing strategy for people with a disability 2011-16 aims to support community based independent living for people with disabilities. My continued support for special needs housing provision will assist in this regard. The strategy recognises the role of the adaptation grant schemes as part of a broader framework of supports. I am reviewing the terms of the grant schemes and will monitor operations to ensure effective implementation of the strategy generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> This year I am allocating 12.4% of the housing budget, some € 34.2 million in all , to the grant schemes compared to 13.2% in 2012. In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils, I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible. In framing the 2013 allocations my Department wrote to each local authority requesting details of the numbers and value of grants where work had been approved to commence. Between them, local authorities reported contractual commitments in respect of approved grants totalling €18 million. Local authorities were always encouraged to maintain continuity in approving and paying grants and commitments carried forward into the new financial year always had first call on the available funding. This year each authority was allocated the full amount of its contractual commitments. Only one local authority, Laois County Council, reported a zero commitment for grants approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">The balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority's share of the new applications on hand in January 2013. I believe this is a fair way of apportioning the funding. I appreciate this approach has resulted in lower than expected allocations for some authorities. Should particular difficulties arise in some local authorities in the course of 2013, I have a contingency in place to deal with this. I have set aside a small capital reserve and I will consider applications from local authorities for a supplementary allocation once the initial allocation has been exhausted.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> A detailed table setting out the information on the combined Exchequer plus local authority own resources allocations for the years 2010 to 2013, inclusive, will be circulated with the Official Report.</p>

            <p eId="para_355">I thank the Minister of State for her response. These cuts were made in the same week as those to the mobility allowance. It is amazing, insensitive, callous and targeting vulnerable people in the most ridiculous way. I heard the Minister of State say there are cuts across the board not just in her line responsibility but in every Department. When I measure that against some commentaries we heard in recent weeks, it is different, however. We had the deal on the promissory note, which we welcomed, but we doubted if it would have any immediate impact on the ground. That has since been borne out. With all the talk about the country having turned the corner and green shoots of recovery, these kinds of cuts hit at the heart of our society. I know Laois County Council gave a commitment to these grants by virtue of their available funding. This has been reduced over several years because of the demands and constraints on its budget. Letters were sent out in the county earlier this year in which many people were told they would have to wait three to five years for these grants.</p>

            <p eId="para_357">Will this mean it will now be five to seven years? The range of cuts is from 29% to 70%. Is the Government's disability strategy in tatters by virtue of the cuts that have been made across a range of services? If a commitment was made in the programme for Government to implement a disability strategy, where stands it now? When will the strategy be redrawn? What can people seeking these grants expect? Has the retrofit scheme that was involved in many budgets over the past number of years been exhausted to such an extent that the Minister can now look at this area to fill the gap?</p>

            <p eId="para_358">We are faced with the inevitable cuts in terms of the amount of money available. That is the reality in which we have to live. I have got a small contingency fund and I am satisfied every local authority has enough funding to meet their commitments made in the previous year. During the second quarter our officials intend to speak to the local authorities about these grants. After that we will have a good idea of how they stand. We will then look to allocate the amount of money left over.</p>
            <p eId="para_359"> I am anxious to reform this scheme and examine the upper limit allowed in the grant which is quite high. I am examining lowering the upper limit so it can be spread over more applicants. We have already introduced a reform measure for the retrofit scheme. Before the money was for voids up to this year but from this year on there will be retrofitting done on occupied local authority accommodation. I am trying to use moneys as wisely as I possibly can, albeit with a limited amount.</p>

            <p eId="para_360">These grants cut to the heart of housing policy, but we should be trying to keep disabled and elderly people in their own homes. The fact is that this is happening at the same time as the cut to the mobility grant, and it follows cuts in the respite grant and household benefit package in the past two years. It amounts to tightening the noose and making things more difficult for the cohort of people who have a disability but who are trying to live independently, as well as elderly people.</p>
            <p eId="para_361"> I know of grants amounting to as little as €2,000 that are being used to keep people in their homes. It can cost as little as €2,600 or €2,700 for a simple straightforward stair-lift. Typically, only a small amount of money is needed to keep people living independently. Let us consider it from a Government point of view: surely we should try to keep people in their own homes. That is logical and sensible as it is where they want to be, but even when considered from an economic point of view, it is where we want to keep them.</p>
            <p eId="para_362"> The allocation for Laois County Council is down 76%. The Minister of State indicated that she wanted to ensure the council had enough to honour the commitments it had entered into on 1 January, but Laois County Council does not allow anyone to enter into commitments on 1 January until it secures the allocation. The Minister of State should examine the record for what is a relatively small county. She will find that the council has been using this grant well, spreading it over a large number of people to benefit the maximum number and prioritising it in a careful and systematic way. If the council was not doing that I would be giving out about it. It is important. The council is being punished for doing exactly that.</p>
            <p eId="para_363"> The overall cut in the budget of the Department was approximately 11%. I realise that is difficult for the Department, but the cut to this grant in Laois was 76%. Does the Minister of State agree that this is having a negative impact on Laois? The fact is that Laois County Council has kept its house in order well and it has been running a good ship, yet it is being penalised for this. This is one of the things Laois County Council does particularly well. Does the Minister of State agree that this should be examined again?</p>

            <p eId="para_364">I agree with Deputy Stanley that we want to keep people in their homes if at all possible and that relatively small amounts of money sometimes make the difference. That is why I am examining the upper limit, which is €30,000. We cannot change the limit for those who have already been approved, but it may be different in future. We are looking at it on an immediate basis to determine whether it would make sense to reduce the upper limit in order to spread a greater number of grants of smaller amounts in order to keep more people in their homes. I agree fully with Deputy Stanley in this regard. I remarked that we have a contingency fund and we will certainly be examining Laois as well as other counties in some months' time to determine whether it is appropriate that they should get further funding. I understand the position in Laois is different to that in other counties.</p>

            <p eId="para_365">Will the Minister of State briefly explain the position? The allocation last year was so many million euro, but how much is the contingency fund this year after an 11% cut? My impression of the contingency fund, from the way it has been explained, is that massive, stinging cuts have been imposed throughout the country - up to 76% in some counties - and it seems the Department has decided to take the flak and put a contingency fund in place to pacify a few of those who cry the loudest, perhaps some of those in our own best constituencies throughout the country. This gives the impression that there is some appeasement, but that is far from the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_366"> We are dealing with a cohort of people who do not have the clout or representation that many others do, and who are left in a terrible predicament. In my county, as in many others, there is a five-year waiting list and the council is doing its best to spread the fund. Any further spreading will make no difference. The Minister of State must sit down and get this back on track. These are areas where a difference was being made.</p>

            <p eId="para_368">They instructed constituents, clients and contractors to submit all bills and have everything paid, signed off and in order by 30 December. I ask the Minister of State to examine this case. Laois County Council did not come in on 1 January without applications. A bundle of applications are partially or almost complete; some 116 are fully complete, in addition to 24 that are urgent and seven that are going to be approved immediately on an emergency basis. Approximately 150 cases are serious and need to be dealt with. I ask the Minister of State to bear in mind that we are not beginning with a clear slate.</p>

            <p eId="para_371">I am supportive of the Priory Hall residents and my Department is supporting the efforts of Dublin City Council in that regard. At my request, the Department has previously assisted the council, in consultation with NAMA, to secure alternative temporary accommodation for many of the residents. My Department has to date contributed in excess of €500,000 towards the costs necessarily incurred by Dublin City Council, in the context of a judgment of the High Court, in providing temporary accommodation for households evacuated from Priory Hall. </p>
            <p eId="para_372"> The resolution process in respect of the problems associated with this development which I understand is ongoing arose in the context of legal proceedings which were adjourned to afford relevant parties the opportunity to work together under the chairmanship of the retired President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Finnegan, to identify a way forward on the complex problems at Priory Hall. Given that the matter is before the courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further other than to continue to urge all concerned to afford Mr. Justice Finnegan the opportunity to complete the task he is undertaking. </p>
            <p eId="para_373"> Dublin City Council is the designated authority with powers to enforce the statutory requirements arising under the Fire Safety Act, the Building Control Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which are at issue in Priory Hall. The council is also the designated housing authority under the Housing Acts. Neither I nor my Department has a direct role or responsibility in the exercise of these statutory responsibilities. I am aware of the significant efforts made by the council, with the assistance of my Department, to provide for the needs of residents to date. I understand that the council will continue to work proactively on behalf of the residents towards achieving the much needed resolution of the issues at Priory Hall. </p>

            <p eId="para_374">Once again I raise the plight of the residents of Priory Hall in my new constituency of Dublin Bay North. As the Minister will be aware, more than 250 families were forced to leave their homes to seek alternative accommodation owing to safety concerns. I note with interest that he has said he is supportive of the residents. All involved, from the Minister and the Government to Dublin City Council, need to up their game to support them. Does he or the Government really understand their anguish and hurt? They urgently need homes and justice. Does he realise that many people on the northside of Dublin believe the residents of Priory Hall are the Palestinians of the northside? They are ignored and have been exploited and treated in a despicable manner. I urge the Minister to get on with the job and show more support to the residents. When is the Finnegan report due to issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_375">In his usual flowery language the Deputy has sought to put responsibility where it is not. Surely he is not advocating that the Government should intervene in a court process. The matter is before the courts and Mr. Justice Finnegan has been allowed an opportunity by all parties to come up with a report. I share the Deputy's frustration at the length of time it is taking, but that is not the issue in hand. I understand Mr. Justice Finnegan has been making progress with financial institutions in resolving the issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_376">In the meantime, I have been very much involved with the Department in ensuring that Dublin City Council is supportive of the residents in their temporary accommodation as far as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_377">I agree with the Minister with regard to the courts. However, the Government and the Minister need to be seen to be more supportive of the former Priory Hall residents. Some owners have moratoriums in place, but others are still liable for repayments on mortgages of up to €250,000. One of the residents, Stephanie Meehan, said that she and her partner bought their apartment at the time with the intention of making it their family home but that the situation has been very upsetting for them. From the minute they moved in, they had problems. Their windows leaked and the balconies were built on an inward tilt, so that if there was any heavy rain, it rolled into the apartment.</p>
            <p eId="para_378"> We need to be more supportive of these people. They were exploited and abused by developers and now they are being ignored by a lot of people.</p>

            <p eId="para_379">They are not being ignored by me. I agree with the comments made by Deputy McGrath. There is certainly impatience and frustration on the part of the residents and that is understandable. They have inherited a situation not of their making because of the very lax building control regulations the Department had in place at the time. We will publish new regulations within the next week to ensure the likes of Priory Hall will not happen again and will minimise the opportunities for unscrupulous builders, developers and professionals to allow consumers to be treated this way in future. In the background, I will continue to support financially and every other way, the people in Dublin City Council who are directly responsible through the courts for the residents of Priory Hall.</p>

            <p eId="para_381">In late 2011, the European Commission approved a change in the maximum co-funding rate from 55% to 85% for axes 3 and 4 of Ireland’s rural development programme 2007-2013. Prior to this the axes 3 and 4 rural development measures were co-funded at a rate of 55% by the EU, with the remaining 45% coming from national Exchequer resources. The 2011 agreement reduced the national Exchequer input to 15% on a net basis for 2012 and 2013, without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU. This resulted in a reduction in the overall programme complement from €427 million to approximately €314 million on the basis of the programme achieving full spend by the end of 2013. </p>
            <p eId="para_382"> In this context the original project allocations given to each local development company, LDC, contracted to deliver the Leader elements of the rural development programme required readjustment. We are currently carrying out an exercise to determine the level of project commitments across all LDCs and all rural development programme measures in order to complete the rebalancing of the programme in as equitable a way as possible. In addition, given the levels of spending by the LDCs from 2009 to date, it is very unlikely that full spend will be achieved by the end of 2013. The co-funding rate will revert to 55% for all expenditure beyond the end of 2013 and as a consequence of this the overall programme requirement will also change. </p>
            <p eId="para_383"> Until such time as this careful rebalancing exercise has been satisfactorily completed, it is not possible to be definitive regarding the remaining funding available for project commitments under axis 3 and of the rural development programme.

Does he agree that he will have to allow for projects that will be approved and will not happen and that these could probably amount to €40 million? Does he agree that at the moment, the total commitment is for only €183 million, which means that at a minimum well in excess of €100 million remains to be committed?

            <p eId="para_385">I agree with the figures mentioned. There is a requirement to look at the balance of funding now, arising from the big increase in the number of applications that have come in during the past few months. Officials have wisely decided to have a look at those applications to see what level of funding will be required to meet them if they are successful and to see what funds will remain for the rest of the year. We are anxious to spend as much of the money as we possibly can between now and the end of the year.

            <p eId="para_386">The Minister agrees with his Department's figures that point to a worst case scenario in which €100 million will have to be committed between now and the end of the year. Does he agree that he should allow approvals to proceed as normal? There is plenty of headroom there. If we hold up the Leader companies, we might be unable to draw down all the European funds under this programme. This could have a knock-on effect on the drawdown of funds under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Does the Minister agree that it was wrong to stop these commitments? We are so far short of the full level of possible commitments that there is no danger of overspending on this programme. Does the Minister accept that not all of the approved projects will happen in reality? Backup projects need to be approved before the end of the year to take their place. Does the Minister agree that the actual spend to date - €82 million, which is a very low figure - is more than €200 million less than the total amount of money in the programme? In fact, the Minister has made a big mistake in this programme, as he has in many other areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_387">Unlike the Deputy, I did not cost people an additional €45 when they had to register their septic tanks. That is what happened to people in his constituency, the west and elsewhere when the Deputy changed his mind very quickly. Like the Deputy, I am anxious to ensure we spend as much money as possible under these programmes. Some of the various axes under which funding is provided might be overspent. Some of the other measures might be underspent. We are carrying out a prudent assessment of where the funds are, in terms of the applications that have come in over recent months. Having served as a Minister, I am sure the Deputy will be careful to avoid criticising the prudent approach being taken by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. The Department is anxious to ensure it reorients and readjusts its spend to cater for the big demand that exists in our communities. It will facilitate approvals as quickly as it can. There have been many large-scale approvals since Christmas. That is certainly welcome. We expect that many projects can be approved in every Leader company area in the next couple of months, with a view to having the fund drawn down by the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_390"> Householders seeking to avail of the mortgage to rent scheme must have been involved in the mortgage arrears resolution process with their lenders and have agreed they can no longer afford to pay their mortgage loans now or in the future; must own the property they live in, with a current market value of less than €220,000 in the Dublin area or less than €180,000 in the rest of the country; must have their property in good condition, in a suitable location and appropriate to their current needs; must not own any other property or have assets in excess of €20,000; must have household income not exceeding €25,000, €30,000 or €35,000 a year, depending on the part of the country they live in - household income in this context is net of taxes and social insurance; and must have a long-term right to remain in Ireland. The treatment of any mortgage shortfall or residual debt will be a matter for bilateral resolution between the borrower and lender.</p>
            <p eId="para_391"> To date, 828 cases have been submitted by lenders. Of these, 459 cases are being processed and 220 borrowers have been engaged with or are in the process of being engaged with by the lenders. Sales have been agreed on 20 properties and eight of these sales have been completed. The number of completed transactions is low but significant progress has been made. All of the main lenders and so-called sub-prime lenders are fully engaged and have instituted the necessary internal processes. It is important to bear in mind that the transition from being a home owner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families.</p>

            <p eId="para_393">Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60-day decision period and a 28-day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme. My Department estimates that the overall timeframe per case from start to completed transaction will be up to eight months. This compares favourably to the timeframes in other jurisdictions operating similar schemes. Households benefiting from mortgage to rent have the option to repurchase the home within a five-year period if their circumstances allow. A mortgage to rent option for local authority borrowers in arrears has been piloted in two local authority areas, Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council, and will be extended nationally in the coming months.</p>

We saw the Keane report in front of the finance committee for a long time and the Government has been in place for over two years, yet the relevant figure is that 20 of these transfers have been completed. We know that nearly one in five residential mortgages is either in arrears or has been restructured, mainly to an interest only arrangement. The banks are telling the Government that they are engaged in this process, but they are not. If the Minister of State talks to the people who are trying to negotiate with the banks on a daily basis to reach these deals, they will tell her that the banks are not engaged in this process, although perhaps one or two of them are.</p>

            <p eId="para_397">The key figure is 20. Two years on 20 of these transfers have taken place. There is huge potential in her portfolio for the Minister of State to do something about this. Based on what the Secretary General at the Department of Finance, Mr. John Moran, said and the legislation the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is about to bring forward, we know that the number of repossessions is going to go up. Mr. Moran stated he wants them at international levels; therefore, we know that the banks are to be allowed to make many people homeless and the State will have to pick up the tab. There is a huge opportunity for us to have a win-win, whereby the State wins because it does not pay dead money to landlords and instead pays it on assets of which it has taken control, while the family get to stay in their house and the bank receives a secure amount. Is the Minister of State satisfied that, two years on, 20 transfers have taken place? That is a somewhat loaded question, as I am sure she is not satisfied. What can she do to massively accelerate this process and engage with and force the banks to act? They may be telling her that they are engaging, but I guarantee her that, if she talks to the people dealing with these issues, they will say the vast majority of banks, with one or two good exceptions, are not doing anything.</p>

            <p eId="para_400">A great deal of progress has been made across the board in terms of the personal insolvency legislation and the constant pressure exerted on the banks, as has again been reiterated in the past week. The mortgage-to-rent scheme is part of this, but it is to deal with the most distressed mortgages. There are a number of criteria, including that people have to qualify for social housing and the homes must be under a certain value. It is a very big decision for a family to make that they are no longer going to own their home and are actually going to rent it. This takes time. For example, we reckon the legal process takes on average eight months. It is a totally innovative scheme which we had to invent and it only came into action last year. I am anxious to see more cases going through. While I accept the number that has gone through is very low, we have 300 cases in train and expect at least 250 to get over the line this year. Again, I stress it is a difficult situation for families and that it is a slow and long process. While we now have engagement with the banks, we will continue to keep the pressure on.</p>

            <p eId="para_401">In two years we have had 20 transfers. The Minister of State has said this is a difficult decision for families. It is not. These are families who are about to be chucked out on the street and the decision is whether they want to be chucked out on the street or stay in their house. It is a not a difficult decision for a family to make.</p>
            <p eId="para_402"> The ones who are slowing down the process are the banks. I know the Government is keen on it, including the Ministers, Deputies Alan Shatter and Phil Hogan, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. I appeal to the Ministers to recognise that the reason the number is 20 is the Government is being gamed by the banks. However, they are the ones which are slowing down this process and speaking out of both sides of their mouths. The Ministers should have a think about this. They should think about what they can do to progress this number, not from 20 to 100, but to make this a viable solution. My second appeal is that the Government relax the conditions, some of which, when combined, are nuts. What we want is for housing officers to be able to make the right economic decisions and relax some of the conditions. There are many who would benefit from this process, meaning the State would benefit, but they do not meet the criteria. They might have higher incomes, but because of the house involved, the size of the mortgage and all of the other criteria used, they do not qualify. The process has huge potential.</p>

He then reversed engines after Christmas when he found there was a grant system. Through Deputy Cowen, I would ask Deputy Ó Cuív whether he will compensate people for the €45 he took from them as a result of advising them up to last September not to pay. This was an outrageous decision by Deputy Ó Cuív, his party and indeed Sinn Féin, which held public meetings telling people not to register and not to pay. Some Independents did the same. These Deputies have cost people €45 each for advocating up to the end of September 2012 that they not pay the sum of €5.</p>

            <p eId="para_593">The European Council agreement on the new multi-annual financial framework, MFF, is a good deal for Ireland and for Europe. The overall amount for the last MFF for 2007 to 2013 was €994 billion. The amount agreed for the 2014 to 2020 MFF is approximately €960 billion. Although this is slightly less than the previous financial period it is, nonetheless, a positive development in the context of the financial situation that prevails across Europe currently and particularly in relation to the significant budget available for the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_594"> The agreement provides some €373 billion funding for sustainable growth - natural resources, largely agriculture and fisheries - and it supports a continuing strong CAP. It will deliver some €1.2 billion per year in direct payments to farmers under Pillar I and €313 million per year under Pillar II, including a specific allocation of €100 million for rural development under Pillar II. It will give vital support to our agrifood industry which is growing and continuing to create employment. Ireland also secured a further €100 million for the BMW region from the ERDF. All of this combined means that Ireland will be in a strong position for the next programming period of 2014 to 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_595"> The next stage is for the European Parliament to agree to the deal. In parallel with these discussions, the negotiation processes for the large range of regulatory instruments required to implement the various parts of the MFF will continue. The MFF provides for flexibility regarding the co-financing rates for various areas of rural development including Leader, for which my Department has responsibility. Final decisions on the specific nature of the co-financing arrangements for the Leader elements of the rural development programme remained to be negotiated and in this context, my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will be taking forward the discussions with a view to obtaining the best outcome for Ireland. </p>

Does he agree that the level of Leader funding that will be available on the next occasion will be much less than we achieved during the previous round? Will he indicate the negotiations he has had with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the breakdown of the €313 million available from Europe in respect of outside-the-farm-gate mechanisms such as Leader and inside-the-farm-gate schemes such as the installation aid, farm retirement, disadvantaged areas and agri-environment options schemes?</p>

More than 80 submissions are currently under consideration. I expect that, arising from these, both Departments will be engaging in negotiations in the coming weeks and months in order to obtain the best possible deal for the rural development programme.

            <p eId="para_652">I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 91 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_653"> The programme for Government and the memorandum of understanding with the European Union, the IMF and the European Central Bank provide for the introduction of domestic water charges. The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. It has also decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord Gáis Energy group, will be responsible for the metering programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> There are, as reported in census 2011, approximately 1.35 million domestic properties connected to public water supplies in Ireland and the objective is to install meters in the maximum number of these properties. I have previously indicated that a proportion of these properties may not be metered in the initial metering programme owing to either the high cost or the technical difficulty of doing so. However, I expect that a large number of them will be metered in the longer term as shared service connections are replaced and further options relating to metering apartment blocks are evaluated.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> The procurement processes for the metering programme are under way and it is expected that the installation of meter boxes and domestic water meters will begin in the middle of this year and will be rolled out as quickly as possible thereafter. The Water Services Bill 2013, which completed its passage through the Dáil last week, will assign the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> The Government has also decided to assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, to the Commission for Energy Regulation. The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided for them. As the metering programme will still be under way in 2014, an appropriate approach to charging customers who are not metered at that stage will be put in place. This will be structured in such a way as to ensure that it will represent a reasonable proxy for usage and be fair. The approach to charges for both metered and unmetered properties will be included in a public consultation process taking place this year as part of the regulatory process.</p>

            <p eId="para_663">It seems to be very high. If it is too high, will the Minister's officials confirm to me in writing the basis on which they arrived at the figure of 300,000 because it smells of a "make it up as you go along" approach to the entire process? I do not want to retrack through the interim Bill introduced to the House last week, but the fact is that it was brought before the House in the absence of a good deal of information on an audit of existing networks and the exact cost of metering. An audit has not yet been completed of those who may be affected by the charges associated with water connections, but, in essence, we were asked to vote for that Bill in the dark. We have no problem with the concept of charging for water services, but we want an efficient system, not an inefficient one. We want inhabitants to see there is competency in respect of the information put before us, as elected Members. The figures being bandied about for the numbers of units that can and cannot be metered must be clarified quickly. However, that has not been done. While the interim Bill gives authority to begin metering, which is bad enough, it will be much more than an accident if the figures are not brought forward shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_669">I thank the Deputy. We estimate that 300,000 households may not be metered. We are currently carrying out a survey in Wexford - Deputy Mick Wallace may have been surveyed himself - involving 9,000 houses in the last six weeks. A higher than expected number have been found already to have boundary boxes. We had estimated that 100,000 properties nationally had boundary boxes installed as part of the planning process over the last six or seven years, particularly at the height of the boom. We were very pleased to see that a significant number of houses in Wexford town had the boxes. Of the 9,000 surveyed, 2,000 had the boxes. That is a higher number. I expect that as the programme is rolled out, a significant proportion of properties will be metered between the direct installation of boundary boxes by the appointed contractors and the boxes which are already in place. We are also looking at an opt-in arrangement in provincial areas for people on public supplies. I am told by the technical staff in Irish Water that the figure for households that will have initial difficulties is 300,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_673"> I have encountered many local authority properties where two houses are fed from one line. As far as the footpath, the line is the local authority's responsibility but then it goes inside the property boundary. We will have a situation where two, three or four houses - a lot of in-built houses that were built over the last while - go onto extra lines. It will cause an awful lot of expense if they have to be metered separately. In some cases, they may be forced to do that. There are a lot of issues to consider. There may be a leak in one house or one house may use more water than the other. How are we going to manage this? It is a very complicated system. Can the Minister comment on some of those issues?</p>

            <p eId="para_674">It would be worth pointing out that the 2,000 houses with boundary boxes in County Wexford were built in recent years and the owners will have the comfort of knowing that they paid the highest indirect taxation in Europe when they were purchasing their homes. Given that water is not cheap, would it not be a better business plan to fix the pipes from which 40% of the water supply leaks into the ground before installing meters? Am I correct to say that there will be an entitlement to a certain amount of water for free before charges kick in? If that policy is intended to be put in place, how will it be managed for people who do not have a meter?</p>

Dublin City Council seems of its own volition to have carried out a programme of installing meters outside many city homes. Does the Minister have any figures on that? Is most of the city metered at this stage?</p>

            <p eId="para_676">To reply to Deputy Dessie Ellis, there will be assessed charges for people in apartment blocks which we will not get around to metering. In terms of some of the types of terraced properties Deputy Barry Cowen mentioned, there will certainly be technical difficulties initially. The assessed charge will take account of the free allowance based on a certain amount of permitted litres per individual in a house. That will be brought in as part of the metered charge. It will be the free allowance process that we advocated in the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">Many people expect the meters to be located on their private properties, which will not necessarily be the case; they may be located on the footpath or in a public space. We are working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the potential of smart metering to reduce the level of inconvenience in locating a boundary box or meter by taking into account the current state of water metering technology in order that we can learn from the smart metering programme under way in that Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> I accept that when we install meters, there may be leaks between where a metre is installed and the dwelling. We are looking to see how we can help customers financially in dealing with this matter. A considerable amount of water may be wasted in some cases and, in the context of the water leakage programme, the customer may be provided with some financial support. Through no fault of the customer, there may have been a leak for a long time and the customer should not have to meet the financial responsibility in the first instance. With Irish Water, we are looking for a way to pay on the first opportunity to fix it.</p>

            <p eId="para_683">Funding of €314 million is available under the rural development programme 2007-13 for allocation to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013. There are 35 local action groups, LAGs, contracted on my Department’s behalf to deliver the rural development programme throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers on the allocation of project funding. Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with departmental operating rules and EU regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_684"> Projects that request funding of €150,000 or more are required to seek final approval from my Department. The assessment of these higher value projects usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local development company. It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications. It may also, in some instances, result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme. </p>
            <p eId="para_685"> The policy in my Department is to work with the local development companies to ensure the projects submitted are fully compliant and can be approved rather than to refuse approval for funding. It can, therefore, take some time to come to a final conclusion. My Department will continue to work with the relevant LAGs to make a full assessment of the eligibility of these projects and will advise the LAGs once all queries have been addressed satisfactorily. My Department has 42 projects at various stages of assessment and I propose to circulate a table in respect of these in the Official Report. Some 36 of the projects in hand have been received in the period since October 2012, including 21 since the start of the year. </p>

            <p eId="para_897">Is the Minister not surprised that so many queries are arising in respect of projects above the level of €150,000? Total responsibility for approving projects under the level of €150,000 rests with the local action groups which seem to be able to do so with competence. Why does the Minister think so many problems arise with larger projects examined using the exact same process? Why is there a need to delay these projects for up to ten months before approval is granted? Will the Minister provide an explanation as it seems projects under the level of €150,000 can be approved without difficulty?</p>

            <p eId="para_898">I would like to think it is simple to approve every project, but that is not true of any project, whether under or over the level of €150,000. They must meet certain criteria and are subject to an EU audit. The larger the project, the greater the degree of care and the attention paid by the local action group. Larger projects often require the assistance of the Department in order to meet the obligations, rules and criteria laid down.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">I hope the Deputy would agree that co-operation between the local development companies and the Department is quite good on these matters, and that the work of the local action groups, LAGs, in assisting the Department continues to be quite fruitful in getting these projects over the line in order to meet EU requirements. Otherwise, as applies in a number of cases, there would be open spot-check inspections by the European Commission for the purpose of ascertaining whether the rural development programme is adhering to the original criteria. Unfortunately, there are some cases in that category currently, and some of them are under pressure to meet the original criteria. I do not want that to happen in any major projects involving over €150,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_900">As the Minister is aware, if we take two projects, one costing €140,000 and the other costing €160,000, a LAG can approve the former project without requiring Department approval, while the latter will require Department approval, even though there is not a great deal of difference in the costs involved. In one case the Department trusts the LAG to approve it but in the other case it can take up to seven months to obtain approval. Will the Minister agree that there are a large number of complaints from LAGs about the delays in approving projects over €150,000, and that the applications are lying around the Department and are not being processed? There is an urgency now, in view of the incredibly low spend that has been achieved under the rural development programme, in getting on with this job, approving projects and allowing companies to facilitate the applicants in proceeding with these projects. As the Minister is aware, for all non-community projects, the total maximum amount that can be approved is €200,000. Will the Minister tell me what is the magic difference between €150,000 and €200,000 that makes the approval process so slow and complicated for projects over €150,000, when all projects from zero to €150,000 can be approved solely by LAGs with no reference to the Department?</p>

            <p eId="para_923">I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 93 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_924"> I attach a very high priority to preparing the necessary primary legislation to underpin the imposition of a levy on the quarrying and insurance sectors, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. The Department is currently advancing the drafting of the general scheme of a Bill. While there are particular complexities attaching to the proposed legislation, which require detailed consultations with other Departments, I am confident that these can be dealt with in a satisfactory manner and I will be in a position to bring proposals to the Government very shortly. It is my intention that the Bill be published and enacted in the shortest possible timeframe and there will be no delay on my part. </p>
            <p eId="para_925"> The Department continues to engage in discussions with a number of financial institutions, facilitated by the Irish Banking Federation, with a view to securing a loan facility which the not-for-profit entity would draw down to permit the earliest possible commencement of remediation works. It is intended that detailed negotiations with the prospective lenders on the terms and conditions of this facility will be concluded by the not-for-profit entity. Loan funds drawn down would be repaid over time from the proceeds of the statutory levies. </p>
            <p eId="para_926"> I have recently announced the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board and the appointment of Mr. John O’Connor, former chairman of An Bord Pleanála, as its chairman, together with three board members. I also indicated that I would be appointing a final member to the board from the not-for profit entity. Mr. Matt Gallagher, the immediate past president of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is the nominee from that entity and I have now appointed him as the final member of the board. I believe the membership of the board has the particular range of skills and experience necessary to oversee and ensure the successful operation of the remediation scheme, and to ensure that the public interest and the interest of the affected home owners are well served. The board will be working closely with the not-for-profit entity to deliver an efficient and effective remediation scheme for home owners who have no other option for redress open to them. </p>
            <p eId="para_927"> I understand the Pyrite Resolution Board has had a number of meetings and has now commenced work on drawing up the precise scope of the remediation scheme, including eligibility criteria, procedures and priorities. It is also in the process of developing its own website, where it will publish documentation and a system for receiving applications from eligible home owners.</p>

            <p eId="para_928">The Minister has given us welcome news about the resolution board. Will we see the legislation by June? Earlier he envisaged a fund of around €50 million, perhaps €45,000 per home. Is that the sum he is considering? How many companies will be levied? Has he got down to that detail?</p>
            <p eId="para_929"> While the property tax exemption for houses affected by pyritic heave is welcome, there is a concern that damage may not be visible in many houses. It could be something that happens over decades. Should this be considered again? I am asked this question again and again, particularly by the Lusk Village action group. Many householders face massive property taxes on homes that have a low value.</p>

It is very disappointing that this has not moved forward. I know the Minister has set up the panel, but we need to move quickly. There are 800 houses in serious need. This is urgent. Surely the legislation can be drawn up quickly so that we can agree it and move more quickly. How long do we have to wait? Will we be waiting two, three, four, five or six months?

            <p eId="para_937">When the fund is set up and money is available, would the Minister consider testing some of the homes in estates where pyrite has been found? If one builder built several houses in an estate - or all of the houses, as was often the case - he probably used the same stone from the same quarry to build them, and it is more than likely that other home owners in the estate will find out further down the line that they are also stuck with pyrite. The houses need to be tested, and surely money from the fund could be used to do that. Would the Minister consider doing that?</p>

            <p eId="para_938">I remind Deputies that this fund is a last resort. People must go through all the other processes initially if they have insurance. This fund will kick in only where people have no redress as consumers. I am anxious to move and I assure Deputies that I will move as quickly as I possibly can. I was hoping we could do this through the Finance Bill but our legal advice was that it would not be possible, as a matter of safe law, to meet the requirements that would need to underpin this legislation in the Finance Bill. We are moving quickly. I expect the heads of the Bill to be before the Government in the next two weeks with a view to bringing the full proposals forward in the next Dáil session. I expect that all sides of the House will want to agree this Bill rather quickly. In the meantime we are getting on with setting the criteria that Deputy Wallace mentioned - that is, what constitutes a test and what shows that an entire estate is clean of pyrite. Deputy Broughan raised all of these issues too. I will not get into the property tax debate again. Either one has pyrite or one does not. The test will indicate-----</p>

The Secretary General of the Department of Finance added to that when he told the Committee of Public Accounts that one could not expect the taxpayer to subsidise "them", meaning the people in arrears, to remain in houses that are beyond their means, given an "unnaturally low" level of repossessions. The Labour Party was furious with this remark and immediately set out to rubbish the Secretary General and hang him out to dry. Indeed, a leading member of the Labour Party, Mr. Jack O'Connor, said that the Secretary General's comments were "reprehensible and barbaric". The Minister for Finance said that the Secretary General is the Accounting Officer and must be honest when answering questions. I do not know whether he meant that the Labour Party Ministers and leading members of the party do not have to tell the truth all the time when they answer questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_947">The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, put the tin hat on it when he said that we cannot have necessary recovery without the stick of dealing with people who are in houses they can no longer afford. The Government is facilitating the banks all the way; €1 billion was given back to them last week. Under the Personal Insolvency Act, the banks retain a veto over restructuring deals with clients and customers. Last week I met a young couple in Ashbourne who were working and wanted to engage with the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">All the bank did was raise the bar, preventing any discussion. I encountered another young woman, looking after her mother, who is also in arrears but who wants to deal with her lender. Again, the bar was raised by the bank. The banks are not engaging with people. Instead, they are intimidating young couples. I have one case of a young couple who were told when their interest-only period ends, they had better be thinking about selling on their house. That is what is happening on the ground in reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> Does Mr. Moran enjoy the full confidence of the entire Government? Will the Taoiseach explain to the House why he is insisting the banks retain a veto over all restructuring deals with their clients? I would argue strongly that it needs independent oversight.</p>

          <p eId="para_953"> There are 100,000 people out there who have problems with their mortgages. They are in limbo. The Government's intention is to bring about clarity for them in respect of their house, their positions and how they can plan for the future. Regarding the wall of allegations about wholescale house repossessions, nothing could be further from the truth. For the past two years, the Government has worked hard in restructuring and recapitalising the banks, as well as making arrangements, based on the recommendations of the Cooney report, for the different strategies that can be adopted by the banks in bringing about a resolution to each person's mortgage difficulties. All cases are unique with particular circumstances. Resolution will also include the complexity of the personal insolvency legislation which has passed through the Houses. The insolvency agency will open its doors during the summer.</p>

          <p eId="para_956">Does he want to expand the disastrous situation that he had previously by extending that across Europe? The Minister for Finance has made clear the Government's intention for those with mortgage difficulties. The 100,000 people under pressure every day and every week in respect of their mortgage problems can have them resolved satisfactorily though a variety of opportunities and methods that are now in place. The last of these to be considered is house repossession. We want to see the majority of these people happy in the knowledge a resolution has been brought about in restructuring their mortgage arrangements with their bank or lender and which they will adhere to in a new format. We want this to give them the opportunity to live and plan their lives without this pressure which has been on them for the past several years and which came about, of course, as a result of disastrous policies produced before. The arrangement will allow them to contribute to their local economy and, as a consequence, to their country.</p>
          <p eId="para_957"> We want the majority of these difficulties to be resolved with debts restructured and reconfigured without consideration of house repossessions. I am quite sure Deputy Martin understands that very well indeed.</p>

          <p eId="para_959">The Taoiseach did not answer the question I asked. Why is the Government insisting on the banks retaining a veto over all restructuring deals with its customers? Last week, when I was in Ashbourne, County Meath, I met a young couple - the husband is working - in mortgage difficulties who want to do a deal and are anxious to make a contribution. All the bank does in return is up the bar with fresh obstacles. In another case I have been dealing with for 12 months, which involves a public servant who has an income and can make a contribution, the bank has told the couple to sell their house. I met another couple last week in Ashbourne - there seem to be quite a number of people in mortgage difficulties in the area - who are facing a similar issue. The rhetoric they hear in this House is incredibly disconnected to the reality they have experienced on the ground for the past number of years when dealing with the banks. They do not see themselves in limbo. Quite a lot of them see themselves in purgatory and are unsure where they are going to end up.</p>
          <p eId="para_960"> The problem is that the Taoiseach and the Government have facilitated the banks all the way in this case. Two years on, talking tough is not enough. Telling the banks they must do this and must do that is not enough. Fianna Fáil put forward a debt settlement office Bill which would provide for an independent debt settlement office to arbitrate in matters regarding household debt between the banks and the customer. The banks have been given a fair opportunity here. Why this insistence on the banks having a veto in these arrangements? Why the insistence that the banks be facilitated all the way with regard to this matter?</p>

          <p eId="para_974">On February 13, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of double cochlear implants for young children who are profoundly deaf. At the time, he committed to adopting a positive approach to this issue. I have also spoken to the Minister for Health twice about this matter. The Taoiseach will recall that on 13 February I raised the case of Billy Cairns, aged four from Dundalk. On 3 April he will undergo his fifth general anaesthetic of his short life to replace an existing faulty implant. Would it not be sensible that when he is getting that done, he would get the other ear fixed as well? If he does not, he might have to get several more general anaesthetics in the time ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_978">Despite Liam fitting the criteria, Beaumont Hospital will not carry out the operation because it has not been funded to do so. The hospital has stated it does not wish to make an exception because there are other children who need this treatment. Therefore, it has recommended that he travel to England. This five year old child could be left in a bizarre position where he has an implant in one ear put in place in Beaumont Hospital and one in the other put in place in a hospital in Britain. In such cases there is a need for regular check-ups; therefore, the child will have to travel within Ireland and to England for treatment. This does not make sense. None of us would wish to see our children having to go through this and I imagine the Taoiseach has costed it. We know the treatment is not hugely expensive and that it can make a great difference to the lives of the children concerned. Obviously, they need other supports also. The Taoiseach promised to raise the issue with the Minister for Health as a matter of urgency. One month on, will the Government fund the treatment for the children concerned?</p>

          <p eId="para_979">The Deputy has raised this issue before and we addressed it at that stage. I spoke to the Minister for Health about it. As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no wish to single out an individual case, but obviously this is rather frustrating for the parents and, in particular, the young children who must meet this challenge. The Deputy is aware that since the programme commenced some 17 years ago, there have been approximately 700 cochlear implants. Approximately 90 per year are provided here.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> The Deputy has raised the question of why there is not a dual implant system. This has been ongoing for a considerable number of years in Britain and Northern Ireland. I spoke to the Minister for Health about the matter and the Deputy received a letter from him. I can confirm for the Deputy that last week there was a good meeting between the HSE, the Department of Health and the organisation known as Happy New Ear. I understand the meeting was very positive. While the Minister has pointed out to the Deputy in his letter that it is a matter for the HSE and Beaumont Hospital to deliver their programmes, clearly the intention is to do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> The Deputy has asked whether the young boy to whom he has referred will have a dual implant when he attends for his next examination. I cannot answer that question for him now, save to say I regard this as being a positive development. I understand the cost is approximately €20,000 in these cases and that they are reviewed as time passes. I can confirm for the Deputy that I have spoken directly to the Minister for Health who is interested in seeing whether the policy position that has applied in the United Kingdom for some time might be adopted in a similar way in Ireland. Last week there was great positivity about the meeting on this policy. I will keep the Deputy updated on the question arising from the specific case of the individual boy he has mentioned.</p>

          <p eId="para_982">There are approximately 200 children awaiting a bilateral cochlear implant and it is accepted universally that it is far better for a child to have the implant placed in both ears as opposed to one. It is a matter of funding. I spoke to the parents at the meeting with the HSE last week. I also met the mothers of three of the children over the weekend and spoke to another by telephone. The cost is between €18,000 and €20,000, which is not prohibitive. The problem is that the young fellow in question, Billy Kearns, has not been told he will have the two implants on 3 April; on the contrary, there is a race against time because once a child goes beyond four years of age the nerve ends are not as receptive to the second implant.</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> We can look at this issue either way. It may be the case that there was a good meeting, depending on to whom one talks, but the fact is that the Government must make a decision. If it were to take a decision, it could make a profound difference to the lives of the children concerned. It is also bad economics because if the children do not receive this treatment, they will need special needs assistants and special educational support and so on. The need for these supports will be lessened if they undergo the procedure. I, therefore, appeal to the Taoiseach to take a positive decision on the issue and do the right thing by the children concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_984">The Deputy is right when he says there are approximately 200 children who have been deemed to be suitable for a second implant. However, it is also true to say not all parents want to proceed with a bilateral implant, even after such an assessment. I understand there are ten children who have received bilateral implants because of their specific medical condition. The Deputy is also correct when he says the cost is approximately €20,000. At issue, therefore, is an estimated €4 million. However, I assume that in the case of a child with a unilateral implant only when it comes up for review, analysis or updating would the time be appropriate to consider a bilateral implant. Normally, depending on the assessment of the multidisciplinary teams involved, it is between four and six months from the date of assessment to when a child receives a single implant. I confirm for the Deputy my understanding that the meeting which took place last week was very positive and that it is the intention to phase in the programme of bilateral implants in 2014. That is why I cannot confirm at this stage the position of the particular child or young boy the Deputy mentioned. The matter having been raised, the policy of bilateral implantation is being considered between Beaumont Hospital and the HSE. They met the Happy New Ear group last week when there was great positivity. There is an intention to introduce or phase in the procedure in 2014. I will keep the Deputy updated.</p>

          <p eId="para_990">I highlight an issue fundamental to the pursuit of justice in this country in 2013. There is an ongoing scandal surrounding the unsolved murder of a hugely popular parish priest, Fr. Niall Molloy, in 1985. The case has remained controversial and there has been unhappiness and unease about it through several Governments for three decades. All of the evidence points to a high level cover up, involving all of the institutions of the State, including, sadly, elements of An Garda Síochána, the Judiciary, politicians, the health service and the Catholic Church. The main point is that we want to get to the bottom of this sordid affair. Fr. Niall Molloy was beaten to death and left bleeding for up to six hours, according to an independent neuropathologist who examined his brain. Dermot Hourihane, a former professor of pathology at Trinity College Dublin and St. James's Hospital, spoke to anyone who wanted to listen to him last week in the audiovisual room. He left us in no doubt about his findings and those of his senior and eminent colleagues. Fr. Niall Molloy's watch was cracked and stopped at 10.40 p.m., but the Garda was not contacted until 3.15 a.m. the following morning. What happened during these vital hours?</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> By all accounts, the first Garda investigation was a total shambles. Vital evidence was contaminated and important witnesses were never interviewed. At the first inquest the Garda contradicted the State pathologist. The trial judge, the late Mr. Justice Frank Roe, was a friend of the Flynn family.</p>

          <p eId="para_1005">I am putting my question to the leader of our country, the Taoiseach, who occupies the highest office in the land. His Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, committed to holding an independent inquiry on this sordid affair while he was in opposition, as did the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, when he was justice spokesperson for the Labour Party. It is a serious affair, and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is abroad, will have to deal with it because it is a disquieting situation that cannot be allowed to continue. I ask the Taoiseach whether he will hold an independent inquiry. I am not speaking about a tribunal. I seek a short, sharp independent inquiry of low cost that can get to the facts. I salute the journalists who brought this issue to our attention and are continuing their inquiries. Will the Taoiseach hold an independent inquiry? The chairman of his own party has written to him to request one.</p>

          <p eId="para_1006">I recall this incident. I read about it and have received some correspondence in respect of it in the past. As an Opposition Deputy, the Minister for Justice and Equality had a particular interest in some aspects of it. Deputy Mattie McGrath outlined certain features of the death of Fr. Molloy. This is a serious matter and I am not going to comment further on it other than to say that I will bring the facts raised by the Deputy to the attention of the Minister on his return. I am not going to commit to an independent inquiry without a full analysis by the Minister. This is not a matter to be treated lightly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1007">It is not a matter to be treated lightly and I do not stand up lightly to raise it. It is a matter of huge disquiet to the population at large. Our justice system, An Garda Síochána and the institutions of the State must be held in the highest of esteem and put above reproach. I thank the Taoiseach for indicating that he will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality, but he is well aware of the facts, as is the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and every other Deputy or Minister who cares to find out. The current cold case investigation has been dragging on for almost two and a half years. That is not fair. The Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, has been refusing to answer questions for the past year. There is too much unease and too much time has been lost. The parishioners and family of the late Fr. Molloy and all involved need answers to be brought to light by an independent commission of inquiry. I hope I will hear an announcement to that effect from the Cabinet when the Minister returns and the matter has been discussed. The chairman of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has written to the Taoiseach and has spoken out on the matter. It is very serious. A mountain of evidence has come to light and we know a lot of things we did not know previously. I salute the late Veronica Guerin and Gemma O'Doherty for pursuing this case, as well as the many other journalists who have dared to write about it. It is vital, in this time of debating banks and repossessions, that we have faith in our justice system and the institutions of the State. Things are at a low ebb but this is an opportunity for the Taoiseach to be the leader of the country and put this sordid matter to bed. We all look forward to that.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1026">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 17, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027"> I met the US Secretary of State, Ms Hillary Clinton, on 6 December 2012 when she was in Dublin to attend the OSCE ministerial conference. It was a great pleasure for me to welcome the Secretary of State back to Dublin. I took the opportunity to thank her in person, on behalf of the Irish people, for her long-standing commitment to and friendship with this country. Since I met her in Dublin, Mrs. Clinton has stepped down from her role as Secretary of State. I have written to her on behalf of the Irish Government to formally thank her for her sustained and invaluable contribution to the process of building peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland, convey the abiding regard that the Irish people hold for her and wish her well in whatever her future holds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028"> When we met in December, we had very useful and wide-ranging discussions. I updated her on the measures being undertaken by the Government to lead Ireland's economy to a sustainable recovery. As our meeting took place on the day after the budget, it was a good opportunity to discuss the Government's emphasis on jobs and growth. I also discussed the importance of Ireland's bilateral economic relationship with the US. I reiterated that stronger trade and investment ties are a major strategic goal of our transatlantic alliance. I highlighted the welcome conclusion of an agreement between Ireland and the US on the foreign account tax compliance Act, FATCA. The FATCA agreement is important in demonstrating Ireland's commitment to tax co-operation and international exchange of tax information. Mrs. Clinton commented specifically on the recent progress that has been made under the US-Ireland research and development partnership. I agreed this was a worthwhile programme and expressed my support for its future development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029"> We discussed the ongoing challenges facing the global economy and, in particular, the need for the EU to continue to work to resolve its economic and financial difficulties. I also briefed her on our plans and priorities for our Presidency of the Council of the European Union, including our hope to make real progress in advancing an EU-US free trade agreement. She expressed hope that significant progress would be made towards the free trade agreement during the Irish Presidency, as this would be a very important and positive development for the international economy. There has been significant progress in recent weeks on this agenda and we can now look forward to what I hope will be focused and successful negotiations on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership. I look forward to Ireland's playing a key role in instigating negotiations in the context of our Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030"> The Secretary of State and I discussed our countries' respective election to the United Nations Human Rights Council. We reaffirmed our ongoing commitment to working together on a range of issues in the international arena, including global hunger, and further deepening and strengthening the US-Ireland relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031"> We also discussed recent developments in Northern Ireland. I welcomed her planned visit to Belfast the following day and thanked her for her swift condemnation of the murder of the Northern Ireland prison officer David Black in November. I expressed the Government's appreciation for her unwavering support for the process of building peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. We agreed that while we have seen significant progress in recent years, we could not allow complacency to take hold. We did not specifically discuss the cases of Marian Price, Pat Finucane or the Boston papers. I reiterated that international support has played a key role in what has been achieved so far in Northern Ireland and emphasised that we greatly value the sustained and continuing US interest in both parts of the island. For her part, she reiterated her strong support for the peace process and said that she was very much looking forward to her visit to Belfast.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032"> I also referred to the positive developments in the Ireland-UK relationship represented by the joint statement signed by myself and the UK Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, last March, and the very positive announcement by the Prime Minister that the G8 meeting in June would be held in County Fermanagh. At our bilateral meeting in London yesterday, the Prime Minister and I agreed that we would use our respective roles in the Presidency and the G8 chairmanship to press for the launch of negotiations on an EU-US free trade agreement this June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033"> I commended the Secretary of State on her efforts to end the violence in Syria and the conflict in Gaza. I also expressed solidarity with the victims of Hurricane Sandy and referred to the letters of support I had sent to the US on behalf of the Irish people. I expect to meet families from some of the areas affected next week. Finally, I thanked her for her extraordinary contribution to the peoples of this island and extended my best wishes to her for the future, in whatever path she chooses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">Later this week I will have the privilege of travelling to the United States for the annual St. Patrick's Day visit. This year, my visit will run from Friday, 15 March to Friday, 22 March. Relations between Ireland and the United States are based on a deep and long-standing bond of friendship between our two countries, but they are also based on deeply-rooted economic, social and cultural ties. Strengthening these ties is a key priority for the Government and we will continue to work on ensuring that Ireland's relations with the US remain vibrant. My upcoming visit to the US presents another opportunity to further strengthen these relations. My programme includes events in Washington DC, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Silicon Valley and Seattle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035"> While in Washington I will meet with President Obama in the White House and also attend the traditional Speaker's lunch on Capitol Hill. My programme also includes a breakfast meeting with Vice President Biden as well as a number of meetings with political and business leaders and the Irish-American community. However, the Vice President may be in attendance in Rome if the conclave has elected a pope and the installation mass is on 19 March, the day scheduled for our proposed meeting. In New York I will meet with Mayor Bloomberg and visit the Rockaways area in Queens which was ravaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036"> My west coast engagements will include a series of meetings with US companies as well as indigenous Irish companies operating in the US. My main focus throughout the trip will be to highlight the very significant progress made towards Ireland's economic recovery and to emphasise Ireland's strengths as a location for foreign direct investment and overseas visitors and to promote Irish companies as a source of high quality products and services. I will also use my visit to highlight the importance of an EU-US transatlantic trade and investment partnership and to advance our efforts to see formal negotiations launched during the Irish Presidency of the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037"> I also anticipate that recent events in Northern Ireland will feature in my discussions. I hope to meet the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Washington DC. Both Prime Minister Cameron and I agreed yesterday on the centrality of the values and principles of the Good Friday Agreement and the importance of the institutions that it created. We intend to continue working with the US Administration to consolidate and build on the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland over many years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1040">We must reform how we are doing our work here because most of these questions relate to the visit of Secretary of State Clinton and were asked over three months ago. What are the Taoiseach's plans to meet with Secretary of State Clinton while in the US? One of the reasons we are only getting to these questions is that the Taoiseach decided to halve the time for questions to the Taoiseach when he came into office. In the previous Dáil, these questions were taken on both Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanBarrett" eId="spk_241">
            <from> An Ceann Comhairle<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1041">That is a matter that can be dealt with between the Whips. This is Question Time.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_242">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1042">With respect, it is a matter of Government diktat, not a matter for the Whips, because the Government dictates what happens in the House. It is a crazy situation that we are now only answering questions three months after they were asked. This is unsatisfactory.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043"> I echo what the Taoiseach said and pay tribute to Secretary of State Clinton for her wonderful work during the past four years as Secretary of State. She was significant in terms of the US role as a partner in the multilateral search for peace between states and her work, particularly for human rights and equality, will stand the test of time. I had the privilege of working with her in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs. She was an unstinting friend of Ireland and continues to be so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044"> On the question of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the situation now is probably at its worst level since the Oslo Accords. For millions of people the situation is fast becoming hopeless. In terms of raising this issue with Secretary of State Clinton, was the Taoiseach in a position to brief her on the European response to the issue? Israel acts with impunity in terms of continued settlements and ignores international agreements and the consensus at the United Nations. The US has a cental role to play in the region. Indeed, President Obama was publicly rebuffed in his first peace effort via George Mitchell. In the Taoiseach's discussion with the Secretary of State, was there any sense of a potential breakthrough in the crisis or any sense of a breakthrough in terms of the policy with regard to the blockade or the issue of the acceleration of settlements whose purpose seem to be to deny and make unviable a two-state solution? I would appreciate hearing the Taoiseach's view and perspective on that with regard to the talks he had with her.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045"> I am surprised the issue of the papers from the Boston College project was not raised. Those who conducted the interviews with those involved in violence in Northern Ireland over the past 30-odd years - I recommend the excellent documentary Voices from the Grave which documents the background to many of the atrocities and killings carried out - are fearful for their own lives because of the decision by the British authorities to seek the papers to help them in the pursuit of those involved in various cases, in particular the case of the murder of Jean McConville. This is a project that has shed light on many of the atrocities that occurred, but more is required. I am surprised the Taoiseach did not raise this issue and seek the American perspective on it. What is his own perspective on it and on the content of the Boston College papers and the degree to which that project can shed further light on many of the appalling things that happened over the past 30 years?</p>
            <p eId="para_1046"> Did the Taoiseach raise the issue of the Finucane case with Secretary of State Clinton and did he endeavour to enlist her support for a statutory inquiry into the Finucane murder? This is part of an international and solemn agreement between Ireland and Great Britain, but Britain is resiling from that agreement in an unacceptable way and in violation of the agreement. Did the Taoiseach enlist the support of the Secretary of State in bringing pressure to bear on the British Government to relent in this case and to fulfil the agreement it signed up to in good faith with the Irish Government?</p>
            <p eId="para_1047"> My final question relates to the Taoiseach's forthcoming meetings with President Obama. The International Monetary Fund is undertaking some significant reforms, but America has held up those reforms despite the fact it initiated them originally. Congress is holding them up. We asked previously whether the Taoiseach could shed some light on the role that Secretary of the Treasury Geithner played in insisting at an IMF meeting that no bondholders would be burned, particularly with regard to the Irish context. We know the ECB position on that. It has been consistent from the beginning that no bondholder would be burned. However, it is alleged that the intervention of the Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, was crucial in ensuring that position held. We have never got a satisfactory response on this. Will the Taoiseach commit to asking President Obama whether that was the case?</p>

            <p eId="para_1048">With regard to the questions raised in the House, it is perfectly in order for any Deputy to ask on the Order of Business, arising from legislation, whether it is intended to meet a Secretary of State about immigration legislation into the States or wherever else. I am not responsible for the number of questions put down here. In previous times, many questions were lumped together. Everything to do with Europe, the United States and anywhere else around the world, up to 50 questions, could have been put together. However, I have tried, following representations made by Deputies to split the questions into groups. These questions are about the United States and about the Secretary of State and her visit here. If the questions are three months out of date, perhaps we should give a briefer response. However, if these questions have been asked, it is legitimate for us to respond to those put by each Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">As I said a couple of weeks ago, we need to look at further reforms of the way we go about our business in here and consider the amount of time we devote to legitimate questions from Deputies and issues they might want to raise, vociferously or otherwise.</p>

            <p eId="para_1051">The Tánaiste is monitoring the question of Gaza very closely. It is a welcome reprieve that with one exception, there has not been any rocket fire into Israel from Gaza in the past month. I suppose the calm that is there for the moment is an advance. Some of the measures enacted by Israel to relax aspects of the blockade after last November's ceasefire are to be welcomed. They need to go much further and much faster, especially in light of the absence of any rocket fire. There may well be a rare opportunity to convert this pause into a durable cessation of violence in both directions. I think that would be of interest to everybody. I join the Tánaiste in encouraging both sides, and anybody else who can influence the situation, to work to this end. The people of Gaza and southern Israel, some of whom I have met, deserve to live in a normal situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052"> The Government has made it very clear that the blockade of Gaza, as currently enforced, has no justification and must be ended. While Israel is quite entitled to defend itself and to block the supply of military materials to Gaza, the measures enforced since 2006 have gone much further than anything that could be justified strictly on the basis of security need. We have consistently drawn the international attention of others to this matter. We have supported the EU in its repeated calls for the full opening of crossing points into Gaza to allow for the normal movement of goods and people. There have been some relaxations of the blockade in recent years, most notably in November following the ceasefire. Clearly, this needs to be accelerated. In the meantime, Ireland has maintained its provision of substantial humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza through the UNRWA and other agencies. As I have said, the Tánaiste is keeping a close eye on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053"> I do not have any further information on the allegation about former US Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner. I have not raised it with Christine Lagarde, whom I met last week. There are much more immediate challenges and obstacles to be dealt with. I do not know whether any further information about the allegation, which we have discussed in this House on a number of occasions, has become available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054"> As the Deputy knows, a motion on the Pat Finucane case was unanimously agreed without dissent in this House. I have disagreed publicly with the British Prime Minister about the fact that both Governments committed at Weston Park to follow through on the recommendations made by Judge Cory. We stand by that. I will raise this with the US authorities when I meet them next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055"> Deputy Martin also referred to the Boston College papers. I hope to have an opportunity during my visit to the United States to cover a wide range of issues, including developments in Northern Ireland. We keep a watching brief on the Boston College research. The college has a long history of academic engagement in the field of Irish studies. It has played an important part in the recording of the history of Northern Ireland and the peace process. That will obviously be of value to historians, those who study conflict resolution and people in general. As Deputy Martin knows, the British Government on behalf of the PSNI initiated proceedings with the US Department of Justice under the mutual legal assistance treaty between the UK and the US to seek the release of archive records and interviews held in Boston College. The records, which were deposited in the Burns Library of Boston College, are part of the Belfast project, which is an oral history of republican and loyalist paramilitaries and paramilitary activities. Some of those whose testimonies are included in the project have since died, including Dolours Price, who passed away in recent months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056"> This entire issue is subject to legal proceedings. Legal challenges were launched by Boston College and separately by the researchers to prevent the release of the material. In December 2011, the US District Court dismissed those challenges. Further legal efforts were made on appeal, but the US Federal Court of Appeal turned them down on 6 July 2012. The court ruling means, in effect, that the archive material must be handed over by Boston College to the US authorities to be sent on to their British counterparts. I understand the lead project researchers are considering a motion for rehearing of the case. They are continuing to keep their legal options open in the Belfast courts. I assure Deputy Martin that the Irish Embassy in Washington and the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to monitor the matter closely.</p>

            <p eId="para_1057">I welcome the Taoiseach's remarks about the blockade of Gaza. We discussed this issue to some degree last week. I was pleased that the Taoiseach agreed to raise the EU heads of mission report on Jerusalem with our European partners. I hope the Government can use this State's term as holder of the EU Presidency as a vehicle to encourage people in the region to embrace a peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058"> I join the Taoiseach in commending the work done by Hilary Clinton as Secretary of State and before she held that position. I assume the Taoiseach will meet her successor, John Kerry, when he visits the United States. I welcome last week's statement by the Taoiseach that he intends to raise the plight of the undocumented Irish and the issue of E3 visas. I understand that approximately 50,000 Irish citizens are directly affected by all of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059"> I may have misheard the Taoiseach when I thought he said he has not raised the cases of Pat Finucane, Marian Price and Martin Corey. If I heard him properly and that is the case, I think it is a mistake. These cases should be raised every single time the Government gets an opportunity to do so. I will be looking to the Taoiseach to raise them with his hosts when he visits the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060"> I am pleased the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have reasserted the centrality and principles of the Good Friday Agreement. We have to go much further than that. When I spent the day in Belfast yesterday, I met many people, including people from the Unionist section of our community, who have deep concerns about where the peace process is at present. Some aspects of the Good Friday Agreement have yet to be implemented. Of course it is an international agreement. The structures and all the other protocols that arise from it are the business of people who are in the institutions. In addition, they are primarily the business of the two Governments. The Governments have to be guarantors of the rights of citizens during this transitional period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061"> The Orange marching season starts earlier this year. There is extreme anxiety in what are referred to as interface areas. That affects both sections of the community. Some people are actively trying to frazzle away, cut away or whittle away confidence in the peace process. I welcome every party, particularly in this Dáil, being heavily involved in the North. I think that is really important. I welcome that very much. However, it is important for us to tell it as it is. I listen to the leader of Fianna Fáil on his occasional visits talking about inertia and suggesting Sinn Féin and the DUP are not working properly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">He knows that is not the case. He knows that the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, is a leader above reproach in terms of his commitment to all of these matters. He knows, for understandable reasons, that Unionist leaders are less eager to embrace a process of change because they see this as a zero-sum game. There is a big job of work to be done by the Governments and the rest of us in re-injecting confidence, particularly in those neighbourhoods which were most affected by the conflict and which have not had any economic dividend.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063"> I record a great debt of thanks to Sir George Quigley who died recently. He was a sterling ambassador for economic regeneration, equality and an all-island economic model.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064"> To what does all of this come down? I emphasise the need to be vigilant on the outstanding issues in respect of the Good Friday Agreement but also on what can sometimes be the fragile state of the peace process which is valued by everyone on the island, particularly those who live in the North, and which has to be continuously nurtured and nourished.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1065">I thank the Deputy for those comments. As I said, I have undertaken to raise the Jerusalem report and will do so at European level. Obviously, we will use our Presidency of the European Union which we will hold until the end of June to progress the peace process. The fact that there is a lull and a ceasefire at the moment, which is welcome, presents an opportunity to drive through on a number of issues. In so far as our membership of the European Union is concerned, we strongly support the position of the Union both in regard to the blockade and the issues that might lead to increased normalisation of life. The Tánaiste has met the Secretary of State, Mr. Kerry, on two occasions. I am not sure whether I will have the opportunity to meet him next week. It is not scheduled as a bilateral meeting, although in the course of conducting business around the White House agenda, it may well happen. I will obviously mention the case of Pat Finucane and the situation in Northern Ireland to our counterparts in the United States. As I said, I did not raise the matter specifically with the then Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton, as she had a very tight schedule when she was here. She left Government Buildings to cross the road to speak to Mr. Brahimi and Russian representatives about the situation in Syria which was dominating world headlines on those days and obviously still is.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066"> We are all concerned about the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. I discussed the issue yesterday with the Prime Minister and we have agreed that a very high level group will meet almost immediately to discuss a number of matters. Clearly, there is a need for political leadership to grasp the issue and work through the many matters that can be worked through. From the point of view of the Government, we have been very anxious to pursue a range of issues through the North-South Ministerial Council. Colleagues on the benches here are fully engaged at that level. However, I would like to think that, arising from the difficulties before and after Christmas, we will focus on what it is going to take to progress the Good Friday Agreement, of which we are co-guarantors and to which we referred yesterday in Downing Street. That is why I have made the point repeatedly that, owing to the case made by so many, €150 million was included from the MFF budget for the Peace IV programme which can be very effective in the sensitive line areas. Obviously, it is our mandate as part of the Presidency to negotiate with the European Parliament to obtain consent or approval for the budget, as is required under the Lisbon treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067"> The Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, is equally concerned that we make whatever political judgments and decisions we can to work with the Assembly and the Executive in order that political leadership is seen to be very clear in its direction, the normalisation of life and a calming of the serious disruptive influences, by dealing with the severe threat for some time from dissidents and paramilitaries and activities in that sphere. This will ensure the reputation and perception of Northern Ireland can continue to grow and that Northern Ireland can continue to become an attractive location for investment and jobs to be created. The high level group of officials from the British and Irish Governments will meet very quickly to consider a number of the issues that we discussed yesterday. I hope our engagement leading up to the G8 summit in Fermanagh in June will centre on a number of areas where we think some clear progress and opportunities can present. We will keep the House updated as these matters develop.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068"> I share Deputy Adams's view of the late Sir George Quigley, whom I met on a number of occasions when I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade. Even in the very difficult days of the late 1970s, early 1980s and afterwards, he always had a view about North-South business and trade. He used to say there was an opportunity for businesses in the Republic to test markets in Northern Ireland, small though they were, and <i>vice versa</i>. Even in the very dark times, that element of trade and business interaction continued and, of course, has flourished since. Sir George Quigley was a central element in keeping this going until better times returned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1069">During his visit to the United States will the Taoiseach raise with the Secretary of State and President Obama the ongoing appalling oppression of Palestinian people in Israeli prisons, in particular, the case of the 30 year old Palestinian, Arafat Jaradat, who died on 25 February having been in an interrogation centre of the Shin Bet, the secret police of Israel, for five days? The autopsy findings showed he had been subjected to extreme torture. Does it worry or concern the Taoiseach that he is going to celebrate with the leaders of the United States who endorse and give enormous support to a state with a regime such as this and which has 5,000 Palestinian prisoners, including 200 children, although it claims to be a Western democracy? Will the Taoiseach raise that issue and demand the release of Palestinian prisoners, as well as highlight the other critical issues that need to be addressed, including the right of Palestinians to have a state?</p>
            <p eId="para_1070"> The Taoiseach has said he will be discussing bilateral economic relations and meeting many major companies, as well as the President and leading Administration figures in the United States. Does he plan to raise the issue of the taxation paid by United States multinationals in Ireland or elsewhere on the globe? Does he have plans to raise with President Obama, in particular, the gross abuse of tax avoidance loopholes whereby major companies use Irish tax laws and the tax laws of other countries to avoid paying the headline rate of taxation?</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">Will the Taoiseach raise the extreme example where one major Internet company recorded €9 billion in profits in Ireland but paid €3 million in corporation tax in 2011 through using tax avoidance measures in this State and other countries? Part of that money was made in the Middle East and Africa which desperately need these resources for their hard-pressed people, public services and communities but are cheated of income that should be paid in taxation. Does this worry the Taoiseach, particularly in an era when he is foisting the property tax on low and middle-income workers and the poor and when these resources are desperately needed by the poorest of the poor in other countries who are being robbed of them? Will he raise that issue with a view to changing as a matter of urgency this policy in the interests of justice, if nothing else?</p>

            <p eId="para_1072">I will not have the opportunity to raise every individual case referred to here with the US administration or the President individually. Clearly, time will not allow for all those things to be debated. However, it will be opportune, given our Presidency, to raise the issue of our concerns about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the issues surrounding that. From a European perspective, I will have the opportunity to articulate that on behalf of the Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073"> The question of taxation is not confined to Ireland. I was glad the US administration clarified over a number of years allegations that Ireland was some kind of tax haven. Our corporation tax rate is very transparent and applies across the spectrum. I will have the opportunity to discuss with the President the imprimatur being given to negotiations and discussions on the EU-US free trade partnership agreement concept, which I strongly support and to which I have referred over many years in this House, not just from these benches. Deputy Higgins will understand that the process in the US requires that a 90-day notification be given to the authorities so that this could commence. That means that if we can organise it at an early stage now and get that platform and mandate, those negotiations and discussions will be able to commence after the Irish Presidency concludes but of which we will be very supportive. On his way back from Texas this week, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation met with his counterparts in Washington D.C. and reported to me that there was a very positive engagement and attitude towards dealing with that high level report and its consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074"> The Deputy is aware that 150,000 Irish jobs are supported by US companies here. I met with the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland recently and the indications are that the continued line of investment in Ireland remains very strong. As Deputy Higgins knows from his native county, things have changed and Irish companies supported by Enterprise Ireland now employ almost 100,000 Americans across 50 states, which is a very welcome trend that helps to boost our exports. I assume that the question of European tax systems and other countries' tax positions will be part of those negotiations and discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075"> It is not for me to engage in the detail of the taxation issues surrounding US companies in countries outside the US. We are very clear on our tax position. Obviously, the impact of investment in the country is very substantial and supports a great number of jobs. I hope I have the opportunity to raise these matters with the US administration and the President. I also want to confirm that the reason we have this opportunity is because of the impact that Ireland has made over many years of connections with the US. The tradition of the St. Patrick's week engagement with the White House began very many years ago and is something we value greatly. It is something that would equally be valued by other countries, had they the opportunity to avail of it. Based on our ties of culture, tradition, literature, business, economics and politics, these are opportunities to review the progress being made in US-Irish relations and Irish-US relations. It allows us to raise the question of immigration and the undocumented Irish. The pressure is on in quite a number of areas. It also allows us to reflect on areas where we can work together. I believe that because of our particular connections with the US going back many years, holding the Presidency for these few months gives this Presidency on behalf of the EU a real opportunity to drive that agenda which, by conservative estimates, could result in over 2 million jobs over a period in Europe and raise the economies of the Union by between 2% to 3%, which would be a very welcome trend.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076"> They are the general areas I hope to have the opportunity to discuss with the President and administration but by force of circumstance, I will not have the opportunity to get into the detail of all these issues although the issue of taxation in general will inevitably arise in those discussions when they commence.</p>

            <p eId="para_1077">President Obama has indicated grave concern about the manner in which US multinationals avoid paying tax, not least tax to the US, and has expressed concern about an international architecture of tax avoidance facilitated by various states around the world. Ireland is constantly cited in media and business analysis in the US and elsewhere as being part of this architecture which facilitates tax avoidance by enormously profitably multinationals which do not want to pay their fair share towards the economies and societies that host them and provide them with workers who generate those enormous profits for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078"> The Taoiseach's answer that our corporate tax rate is transparent is patently nonsense. I have put questions in the past week or two to the Minister for Finance, which were part of a series of questions because I intend to keep at this issue, to ascertain what is the effective corporate tax rate. The Minister said he cannot tell me. How can the Taoiseach say our corporate tax rate is transparent when the Minister for Finance says he cannot tell us what the effective tax rate is? He cannot even tell us how much the corporations are paying in tax. Eurostat suggests that they are paying 6.8%, which is half of the headline rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">The Taoiseach needs to examine this issue seriously. He needs to address it and discuss with the American Government how we can deal with the problem of multinationals which do not want to pay their taxes, as well as any role Ireland may be playing in facilitating them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080"> I have a question about Palestine. The Taoiseach expressed his concern and raised with the then Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton, the issue of the ongoing blockade of Gaza. This is welcome, but we need to begin to match words with deeds. I refer to the UN report produced at the end of last year which considered the likely humanitarian situation in Gaza by 2020 if something was not done about the blockade. It suggests Gaza may be uninhabitable by that date. It states the humanitarian crisis arises directly from the blockade and the devastation wreaked on Gaza during Operation Cast Lead. It is an issue which requires action as a matter of urgency rather than words. The Taoiseach says he raised it with the then Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton, and that he is concerned about it. In that regard, I understand the Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence, having spent one day with Irish troops in southern Lebanon, is at the Herzliya conference in the Dan Accadia hotel in Israel where he will spend the next three days. He is attending a conference hosted by the Institute for Policy Strategy and co-sponsored by the US Embassy in Israel. The Herzliya conference is a gathering of neo-cons and Zionist supporters who, frankly, have never shown much interest in the plight of the Palestinians. Is the Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence attending the conference in an official capacity? Will he be saying at the conference that he believes the siege should be lifted? Are the Taoiseach's words of concern being matched by the Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence in attending this conference which is full of neo-cons and uncritical supporters of Israeli policy? Will the Minister challenge the brutal policy being inflicted by Israel on the people of Gaza? </p>
            <p eId="para_1081"> I ask the Taoiseach about the case of Marian Price. I express extreme disappointment that he did not raise the issue. Is he aware that a parole hearing for Marian Price will be held this week? The Northern Ireland Office is arguing that she should be held indefinitely because of what it claims is so-called confidential information on her. This is confidential information to which even her lawyers do not have access. This is an Irish citizen who is being held indefinitely and whose rights are being trampled on. I ask the Taoiseach why he did not raise the matter with the then Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton, somebody who regularly expressed concern about human rights and the situation in Ireland and who played a part in the Northern Ireland peace process. This is a flagrant abuse of the human rights of an Irish citizen who is being held without trial and, effectively, interned. Why is the Taoiseach not raising this issue as a matter of urgency when the woman concerned is sick and particularly this week when a parole hearing will decide whether she will be kept interned in prison or released, as she should be? She is no threat to anyone and there are no proper or justified reasons for keeping her in prison.</p>

            <p eId="para_1082">Ireland's corporation tax rate of 12.5% has long been a cornerstone of the attraction of investment to this country. Taxation matters are for each individual country. It is not for me to change the taxation rate applied by any other country. One of the difficulties that has arisen from a European point of view is that corporation tax rates range over a number of rates. They are dependent on the criteria set down for particular industries and sectors and the location of such industries in different countries. Some countries have a rate of corporation tax which can be varied, depending on the location of the industry or the sector in which the industry is represented. In the case of Ireland, the rate is 12.5% and applies across the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083"> As I said to Deputy Joe Higgins, these matters will be referred to in the discussions on free trade between the European Union and the United States covering all products and issues. I do not agree with the Deputy that it is blatant nonsense. Our rate has been fixed; it is unchanged and will not be changed, despite some recommendations to the contrary.</p>

            <p eId="para_1090"> A number of years ago, when I was on the other side of the House, I brought the then spokesman on children with me to Israel and Gaza. We saw at first hand the devastation caused by the Israeli invasion some months earlier. We had long discussions with the authorities and heard graphic descriptions and analysis given by John Ging who at the time was in charge of elements of the provision of humanitarian and educational assistance for the people of Gaza. Anyone who visits Gaza will understand the difficulties surrounding this complex question. It is also fair to say the current ceasefire has ensured that, with one exception, no rockets have been fired by either side in the past month. This provides an opportunity to deal with a number of issues. We strongly support the European Union's policy. The Deputy will have the opportunity to hear from the Minister for Defence on his return about the areas he has visited and the issues he has dealt with on behalf of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091"> I do not know the names of the people who are attending the conference. The Deputy attached particular classifications to them and categorised them. It is not for me to comment. I am sure the Minister will be happy to report to the House on the issue when he returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092"> As I said in reply to Deputy Gerry Adams and, perhaps, Deputy Micheál Martin, I did not have the opportunity to discuss the details of individual cases with the then Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton. The date of her retirement as Secretary of State had been announced and she came here for a particular purpose. Her time was limited because she was on her way to a meeting with Mr. Brahimi and Russian representatives on the situation in Syria which was dominating world headlines during those few days. We thanked the then Secretary of State and her husband for the part they had played and their exceptional interest and actions on many issues relating to Northern Ireland for very many years. We could have discussed a number of issues such as the Parades Commission, the riots which had taken place during the Christmas period, Ms Price, the disappeared and the legacy of the past. We could have discussed my engagement with people from east Fermanagh, Kingsmills and Enniskillen or the fact that the Tánaiste had attended remembrance day ceremonies in Belfast, while I had attended the ceremony in Enniskillen on the same day. We could have discussed the meeting held with the representatives from Ballymurphy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">In the light of the number of matters involved, one could not possibly discuss each individual case. However, I have an interest in the case of Marian Price.</p>

            <p eId="para_1096">I detect from the Taoiseach's reply that there is no fresh European initiative in respect of the situation in Gaza and the Middle East. In the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, is he aware of or is he leading a new initiative to bring greater pressure to bear on the Israeli authorities in respect of the blockade and the acceleration in the process of constructing settlements? Ultimately, the latter undermine the potential for a two-state solution to emerge. With the exception of the odd articulation of opposition, this problem has been allowed to continue with the acquiescence of the global community. There is a need for a fresh initiative. Next week the Taoiseach will be meeting President Obama who will be visiting the region shortly and in the light of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, he should initiate a discussion on this matter. What is happening is unacceptable. The population of Gaza has literally been imprisoned. The impact of the conflict is bad enough but the sense of imprisonment is perhaps worse. Young people cannot even go out and engage in what we would consider to be normal activity. Without the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, this sad and unacceptable situation would be catastrophic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097"> In the context of the Taoiseach's discussions with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and his forthcoming discussions with President Obama, it is important for Ireland to indicate where matters stand with regard to the operation of the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement. I do not share Deputy Adams's perspective on this matter. The Deputy had a cut at me in terms of my assessment of the position. As I articulated recently in Belfast, my views are shared across the board.</p>

            <p eId="para_1099">There is a sense that there is inertia at the heart of the Executive and in the legislative process. There is also a sense that the two main parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, are dividing the spoils in order to please their own electoral bases. There is a concern to the effect that everything is being based on electoral considerations for both parties and that this is being done to the exclusion of other parties and communities. The economic dividend has not happened for many communities on both sides of the traditional divide across the North. There is a need to call it as it is and the key players - the British, Irish and American Governments - must exert pressure in order to get normal politics back on the rails. Those who occupy the middle ground in the North are amazed that flags, emblems and symbols are still dominating the discourse of party politics there and that bread-and-butter issues do not appear to attract the same attention or priority.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1100">I will deal with Teachta Martin's really misinformed and deliberate misrepresentation of what is happening in the North at some other time. I welcome the Taoiseach's efforts to refocus the British Government on the peace process and on what needs to be done in the North. I especially welcome the convening of a group of senior civil servants who will be charged with knuckling down and dealing with this matter. The group in question must work with the Executive and with all of the parties in order to ensure that there will be delivery in respect of certain matters. There are other matters which are very much the responsibility of the British Government and which have not been delivered upon. Regardless of the other pressing issues on the Government's agenda - I accept that these are difficult times - it is crucial that the peace process receive regular attention and be treated as a continuing priority. It is particularly important that the concerns of all sections of society in the North - not just those of republicans or Nationalists - in respect of identity, equality and symbols should be dealt with. Equality must be the foundation of what we do, across the island and, at this time, in the Six Counties in particular. Unionists and loyalists must, like the rest of us, be mindful of our abiding commitment to uphold their rights and entitlements on the basis of equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101"> Teachta Ó Snodaigh also visited Marian Price and he furnished the Taoiseach with a written report relating thereto. Ms Price and Martin Corey should not be in prison. Sinn Féin made representations to the parole hearing and was informed that these two individuals would be a threat to the peace process if released. I wish to state on the record of the Dáil that they would not be a threat to the peace process if released. Their detention is actually the threat to the peace process. Ms Price and Mr. Corey are a threat to the peace process as a result of the circumstances in which they are illegally detained. I look to the Government to raise this issue in the United States and also with the British authorities before the review of their detention concludes. The last thing we want is a judgment handed down by a kangaroo court to the effect that Ms Price will be held in detention for ever and a day. She and Martin Corey need to be released.</p>

            <p eId="para_1102">Why did the Taoiseach not raise the Marian Price case, on a humanitarian basis, with Prime Minister Cameron? It would take 30 seconds to do so. When he visits the United States, will the Taoiseach deal with these issues in a concrete fashion? One of his predecessors, Bertie Ahern, informed us that he constantly raised matters with the President of the United States and others when he visited that country. However, he was tiptoeing around the issues and was particularly concerned about not offending his hosts. Will the Taoiseach raise with the US President the ending of the siege of Gaza, which is critical, the need to deal with the issue of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails? Will he also deal in a concrete manner with the so-called free trade agreement, which will mainly benefit multinationals and increase their profits? He should be firm in respect of taxation. Google made $9.07 billion in operating profits in 2011 but it only paid $3 million in tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_1103">I am delighted the Minister for Justice and Equality met Irish troops in southern Lebanon. However, I asked the Taoiseach why the Minister spent one day with the troops and, as I understand it, then travelled to attend a conference of very strong supporters of Israeli policy in the luxury resort of Herzliya. Was the latter an official visit and was the Minister representing the Government at the conference in question? Why did he not travel 100 km further on and visit Gaza in order to express his solidarity with the people there who are living in the most squalid conditions as a result of the Israeli policy to impose a brutal blockade on them? Was it an official visit and was the Taoiseach aware of it? Was part of the purpose of the visit to allow the Minister to raise at the conference the Government's view that the blockade of Gaza should be lifted immediately?</p>
            <p eId="para_1104"> I also add my voice to the urgent requests to the effect that the Taoiseach should raise with the British and American Governments the need for Marian Price to be released.</p>

            <p eId="para_1105">We will have the opportunity to raise the blockade of Gaza and the situation which obtains in the latter at the European Council's spring meeting on Thursday and Friday next in Brussels. I will take the opportunity to have discussions with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Catherine Ashton, who reports to the EU on matters of this nature. Ireland has been very strongly of the view that this blockade should be brought to an end and that some sense of normality should be restored. I share the views of Deputies Adams, Higgins and Boyd Barrett in respect of the situation in Gaza, which the Minister for Justice and Equality had the opportunity to witness at first hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106"> On the question of the institutions of the Assembly in Northern Ireland, I raised those matters with the then Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, and they have been raised by the Tánaiste with the Secretary of State, Mr. Kerry. Obviously, I intend to raise Northern Ireland issues directly with the President and we will be direct in our reporting back on that matter. Clearly, political leadership must be shown all around in respect of demonstrating that the principles of the Good Friday Agreement, of which both Governments are co-guarantors, will be seen to be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107"> On the other matters raised by Deputies, namely, the EU trade talks and issues that arise from that in respect of taxation and so on, the programmes are laid out for every Minister who attends, on behalf of the Government and the country, St. Patrick's Day events in various locations throughout the world. Each Minister will be happy to respond to the House on the official elements of the business in which they have been involved.</p>

How many sections of the Personal Insolvency Act have been commenced? I have asked this question on a number of occasions on the Order of Business in recent months and the Taoiseach indicated he would check that and get back to me.

          <p eId="para_1132">The programme for Government contains commitments to enhance trust between local communities and the gardaí, and also through the policing partnerships, to give greater priority to community policing and higher Garda visibility in local neighbourhoods. What is the position on that issue? The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, and I were in St. Patrick's GAA Club in Lordship, of which Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe was an active member. He was killed recently a mile from where we met. There is widespread concern in the area that 21 Garda posts have been cut. There is one van patrolling a 45 km stretch of the Border.</p>

          <p eId="para_1179">Government wants to have a fair and transparent process for dealing with all of those cases that are in distress. I have pointed out on many occasions that this is about ensuring that a resolution, and a solution, can be got in each individual case, which are all different, in order that the people concerned can be taken out of the limbo they are in and contribute to the economy. The last resort clearly identified by Government, and referred to by banks, is the question of repossession of any of these houses. The majority of people involved in this can have resolutions brought about for their security and their future in a way that does not involve repossession.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180"> The Government will deal with the question of the loophole in the law because that loophole was being used by some lending institutions to say they cannot settle with clients in particular positions. It is only to have a process that is fair and transparent in the interests of the clients to ensure they will not lose their houses but will have a resolution they can meet and with which the lending institutions are satisfied.</p>

A process was set out in the White Paper whereby the House was encouraged to produce legislation through various stages including hearings on heads of Bills. In most cases, heads of Bills have not been discussed in the House since 2004 notwithstanding that we are supposed to discuss them before legislation is published. There has only been one instance since the Government took office when heads of a Bill were discussed by a committee before being published.</p>

            <p eId="para_1265">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the matter of parents who wish to return to the workforce after a period in the home raising children. They are not provided with similar rights and entitlements to those on the live register in terms of education and training initiatives and other labour market activation mechanisms. Although the proposal is couched in gender-neutral terms, in most cases we are talking about women who, mostly for reasons to do with child-rearing, opt out of the labour force for a number of years. As they are not in receipt of a qualifying payment, they are not entitled to participate in many of the labour market activation programmes available through the Department of Social Protection or its agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266"> I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, and I appreciate that not every Cabinet Minister can be in attendance for these debates. However, I had hoped the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, would attend because she is interested in these matters. In recent days, she celebrated International Women's Day. It is not often I find myself comfortable in the company of the National Women's Council of Ireland and SIPTU but it must be acknowledged on such occasions. The two bodies combined to produce a very interesting paper called Careless to Careful Activation. It deals with a range of issues that arise on the basis that women do not present a homogenous group in terms of labour market activation measures. Women who have reared children have different requirements from those who are at the pre-child-rearing stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267"> The challenge for the Minister is whether it is possible to have a gender perspective on labour market activation and to move away from what appears to be a gender-stereotypical approach, that one size fits all in terms of labour market activation. I acknowledge it is a lot to ask but, from the point of view of the State, there is a danger of locking out a large cohort of women, many of whom have acquired skill sets at the expense of the State that are in danger of being lost forever. This will have an impact on employment rates in the economy and contribute to household poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268"> On the other side, women in receipt of qualifying payments are, in some cases, harangued and harassed by the Department of Social Protection to participate in labour market activation measures. In some contexts, it places extraordinary pressure on them, including the obligation to participate in training or courses and, subsequently, low-paid employment, as well as leaving them with the onerous task of domestic, child-rearing and care responsibilities. While we can understand the argument that scarce resources must be allocated in a targeted manner, under the current arrangements we are in many instances reaping the worst of both worlds. A cohort of women wish to participate in activation measures and to avail of the initiatives tailored to that purpose by the State, while another cohort of women, by virtue of the fact they are in receipt of payments, are being hunted and obliged to participate in the labour market activation processes. In many instances, labour market activation processes do not subsequently lead to productive engagement in the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269"> Does the Department of Social Protection, through its many agencies, have the capacity for a gender perspective on labour market activation that designs tailor-made solutions to individual clients? These will not be exclusively women, but in many cases women currently not in receipt of social welfare qualifying payments are locked out of the benefits of activation measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270"> The publication I referred to, a joint effort between SIPTU and the National Women's Council of Ireland, addresses many of the issues. The only way to come up with a realistic solution is to allow greater autonomy and flexibility to those who decide who participates. Many participants are unwilling and many willing participants are locked out of these arrangements.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Fergus O'Dowd)<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1271">I will respond on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton. It is estimated the Department of Social Protection will spend over €1 billion on working-age employment supports in 2013. This substantial expenditure, against a backdrop of significant fiscal consolidation, underlines the Government's commitment to enhancing support for activation and assisting people in returning to employment. Given the scale of the crisis, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency. This policy objective prioritises scarce resources for the benefit of those who are in receipt of qualifying welfare payments. Accordingly, the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused, in the first instance, on the cohort of unemployed people. The major elements of the Government's response are set out in the Pathways to Work policy, which is aimed at ensuring that as job vacancies are created they are filled by people on the live register. The Department maintains a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272"> The Government believes a work-first approach to activating the unemployed is better than a programme-first approach, given that many who sign on to the live register will exit it again within a short timeframe without any recourse to employment schemes or intensive activation measures. For example, in 2012, of those who signed on to the live register, 43% had left within three months of first signing on. Given these high exit rates, it is an efficient use of resources to use duration on the live register as a criterion for identifying those jobseekers who are most in need of additional support in order to re-enter employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273"> The Department has a role in supporting people in moving from welfare to work. A range of employment support programmes are available to eligible unemployed people. These initiatives focus on allowing the long-term unemployed, lone parents and sickness-related welfare recipients to return to the active labour market by supporting them in participating in education, taking up employment or becoming self-employed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274"> A number of education and employment support schemes such as the back to education allowance, community employment schemes and the rural social scheme are also available to qualified adult social welfare recipients. The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of employment support schemes and this is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need and where optimal benefit will arise for the individual.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275"> It is recognised, however, that not all unemployed people, including those previously engaged in home duties, are dependent on the State for financial support. Some services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job-searching tools, are available to all unemployed persons, regardless of their duration of unemployment, if they register with the Department's employment services offices. Unemployed persons not in receipt of payments, including those recently engaged in home duties, may also be eligible to avail of skills improvement opportunities, for example, through FÁS training, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking such training.</p>

            <p eId="para_1276">I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response. It was a single transferable speech. I have seen similar responses to parliamentary questions. It does not show any willingness to think outside the box on this issue, which is a significant impediment to a large cohort of women who have skills they acquired previously and who need to improve their skills, sharpen their presentation and so on in order to get back into the workforce. The Minister of State's response was like the dialogue of the deaf. I urge him to have a word with the Minister for Social Protection to see if we can at least get an acknowledgement that there is an issue in this respect. If we cannot have an acknowledge of that, we will not get a resolution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277"> The Minister of State's response raises an obvious question: what is the success rate of those who are availing of activation measures in transferring from labour market initiatives to the workplace proper? Obviously, if the system is not working - I suspect it is not, and that many people are pursuing course after course and are not successfully transferring to the workplace - that would be grounds for a review of the current regime. I would like to know the position in that respect. If people are not transferring successfully, there is a weakness in the policy approach that should be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278"> The Constitution is often the last refuge in an argument, but it does contain pro-family provisions. For those women who opt out of the workplace to spend a number of years at home raising their families, surely there is a question, legally and constitutionally, about whether barriers to their re-entry into the workforce are in keeping with the Constitution. If this is the case, there may be an impediment in the future for women who wish to stay at home, if they are going to be treated in this way subsequently. </p>
            <p eId="para_1279"> We need a gender perspective on participation in programmes, and we need to provide flexibility for local social welfare officers or employment service officers to use their discretion where people present seeking to participate in such programmes and avail of them in the same way as anybody else who receives social welfare payments. We must determine whether it would work financially for everybody, including the State, to allow such people to participate on an equal basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1280">I will bring the comments of the Deputy to the attention of the Minister. Pathways to Work represents the Government's policy statement on labour market activity, which is committed, as I said, to more focused intervention. Given the limited public resources, it is essential that these activation measures are targeted. The current cohort of people who are long-term unemployed are a particular focus for interventions. More than 87,000 education and employment support programme places were provided by the Department in 2012. There are 450,000 State-funded places providing further education and higher education and training. There are other activation initiatives available to unemployed people which are not contingent on social welfare status, such as FÁS training courses. The Government spent almost €1 billion on employment supports in 2012 and will expend more than that in 2013. A significant number of schemes, such as the back to education allowance scheme, the rural social scheme and community employment schemes, allow spouses or partners to apply for schemes based on their spouses' primary social welfare payments. I will happy to bring the Deputy's comments to the attention of the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_1281">I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of the school completion programme and the vital role it plays in the school community and the community as a whole. He will know that one of its main purposes is to ensure that every child has the opportunity to complete the leaving certificate. In doing that, those involved in the programme work in some of the most disadvantaged communities in the country. As the school completion programme is ingrained not only in the school system but in the community, it has built up a wealth of experience over a number of years. It also recognises that a holistic approach is needed to deal with the issue of school completion, encompassing the community, families, schools and children. Therefore, each project throughout the State has built a number of relationships with outside agencies, the schools and the individuals concerned. As a result of this work and experience, those involved in the programme have developed a number of indicators by which they can identify children who are at risk of dropping out of school and they put in place strategies to try to combat that tendency before it becomes an issue. They offer a number of supports, including the provision of breakfast clubs, which not only provide children with a healthy breakfast when they go to school but also teach them how to socialise with their peers, as well as lunchtime clubs and after-school clubs, which help children in completing their homework. Such clubs foster a culture whereby children will go home and do extra study and go the extra mile to try to complete their education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282"> The programme also offers a number of academic supports to students who may need them. These are provided inside and outside the school environment. A key area on which the programme focuses is school attendance. Unless children attend school, it is difficult for them to be instilled with a culture of learning and to obtain qualifications. Those involved have developed a number of programmes to target school attendance among students. They have established a number of initiatives that reward attendance at school, which have proved to be successful. Any of the co-ordinators of the school completion programme would advise that in areas where these programmes are in place and are working well, school attendance is on the increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283"> Similarly to every other section of society, the school completion programme has suffered a number of cutbacks in recent years. There has been a 20% reduction in its budget over three years, with a final cut this year of 6.5%. If cuts continue to be implemented, it is the children who will suffer. I ask the Minister of State to raise this issue with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Some staff have already been let go under this programme and children will suffer as a result of the reduction in the supports that are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">We have just passed a referendum on children's rights. The people working in the school completion programmes are the very ones who have the experience and the knowledge to help meet children's educational needs. The school completion programme is a vital component of the educational welfare board which has done great work in many areas. If we continue to target the funding to this group I fear that the school completion programme will collapse. If that happens the children will suffer. If we do not invest in education we are giving up on education. No one in this House, regardless of political persuasion, wants to see children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, lose the support and assistance they need to complete their education. I ask the Minister to revisit this budget cut.</p>

            <p eId="para_1285">I thank the Deputy for putting this matter on the agenda this evening. I am taking it on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald. I assure the Deputy that I will bring his comments directly to her attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286"> The school completion programme aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and generally to improve school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort. The programme operates under the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board which has responsibility for the operational management and national direction of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1287"> In 2013, funding of €26.456 million is being made available by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to support the 124 school cluster projects and related initiatives within this national programme. This funding enables the 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools in the programme to support educational interventions for approximately 36,000 students. The majority of schools supported by the school completion programme receive this assistance as part of the school support programme under the DEIS initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288"> As in all areas of the public sector, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs had to find savings as part of the comprehensive review of expenditure. The Department must play its part in the collective Government effort to reduce our unsustainable day-to-day deficit. That is the reality for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as well as others. The comprehensive review published in December 2011, set out clearly the 6.5% per annum savings required in the school completion programme in each of the years 2012 to 2014. The extent of the adjustment was signalled to the projects by the Department in late 2011. In these circumstances it has not been possible to ring-fence funding at historical levels but we did protect individual projects from the full budget adjustment in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289"> In order to remain within the 2013 allocation, however, the local management committee responsible for each project was notified last September that a 6.5% reduction would be applied for the coming academic cycle, in this way the full year budget for each project was confirmed earlier than in previous years to assist local management in refining programmes within available budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290"> The local management committee leading each project assesses local needs to devise an integrated, costed and targeted proposal of interventions to support educationally disadvantaged students at local level. This project model approach is a key feature of the school completion programme. It allows the local management committee the autonomy to be creative and innovative in developing tailored support strategies for young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291"> Each committee was requested to review its proposed programme of supports and to finalise an approved programme with the National Educational Welfare Board. Projects were advised to examine all elements of expenditure and to seek to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies while prioritising evidence based services to support children's educational outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292"> The National Educational Welfare Board, in its role to give direction and support to projects, has assisted each project in this process to review plans to ensure front-line services are protected to the greatest extent possible. The board continues to work closely with management committees, schools and local school completion programme co-ordinators to ensure student supports are tailored to meet local needs. As a further support to projects in managing the challenges presented by programme adjustments, the Department has recently commissioned Pobal to undertake an analysis of existing operational and staffing arrangements with a view to providing advisory support to local management in such matters. It is intended that this work will commence shortly after Easter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1293">I want to focus on a project in my area, the Le Chéile project which covers five DEIS schools. It is in Knocknaheeny on the north side of Cork city. The Government is investing huge sums of money in regenerating the physical environment of the area. It is knocking down houses and rebuilding them to a high standard. While on the one hand the Government is doing that, on the other it is cutting the budgets for programmes to improve the social environment in those communities which is contradictory. This project has three members of staff who work 35 hours a week, one who works 24 hours and two who work 22 hours. They access 170 students. These are schools where traditionally there is a high level of early school leaving and a higher than average number of children with special needs. As a result of the budget cut the decision has to be made whether to cut the two members of staff who work 22 hours or to cut the programmes. It is not possible to implement another cut on top of the cuts of the previous two years of 6.5% without affecting front-line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294"> In his response the Minister of State said, "The Department must play its part in the collective Government effort to reduce our unsustainable day-to-day deficit. That is the reality for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as well as others." The reality of a 6.5% cut to these communities is that children who now have the supports and resources to complete their education may not have them in September. They may not get the opportunity to complete their education. If we cut these resources and staff and the co-ordinators have to decide whether to cut back on programmes, children will suffer. That does not make any economic sense in the long run because if people leave school before they have the opportunity to realise their educational potential it will cost us more. The Department needs to consider that. In this project 6.5% represents approximately €25,000 or €26,000 which is not a large sum of money but one cannot put a price on the benefit to the community, the schools and the children of having it. I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to reconsider the budget cuts which will be implemented in September.</p>

            <p eId="para_1295">I acknowledge the Deputy's points and assure him that I will bring them to the attention of the Minister, particularly the Le Chéile project in Knocknaheeny.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296"> While there are significant financial problems everywhere the full adjustment identified in the comprehensive review of expenditure for 2014 will be further considered in the context of a review of the programme to be undertaken this year. A core objective of the review will be to ensure that available funds are appropriately targeted to support those pupils most at risk of early school leaving. The review will address the potential to achieve greater consistency in programme delivery, administration and examine the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing. Terms of reference are being finalised and the Department will consult with individual projects during the course of this review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1297">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue of the restrictions announced by the Health Service Executive, HSE, Beechpark services for autistic children in north Dublin and the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, for being here in person to discuss it with me. When I previously raised it several months ago, I was told there was an ongoing review with which I should engage. However, that has not been successful from my end.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298"> There are a number of autistic units in a number of Dublin northside schools with which I deal frequently, including Scoil Chiaráin CBS and Our Lady of Consolation in Donnycarney and Scoil Bhríde and Scoil Naomh Colmcille in Donaghmede. Beechpark services provide several services for children in these units such as speech and language services, occupational and play therapies and psychological services. These are vulnerable children and the staff are doing their best to serve their needs. There are varying viewpoints as to what Beechpark services can do for a school. Many schools state once they receive the services, they are delighted with them, while others say it is difficult to even access them in the first place. I have also been informed some private diagnostic assessments are not being recognised by the HSE for referrals to Beechpark services, which is an added problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299"> Schools are now being told that new children will not receive these services. All children will be played off against each other, as the HSE will assess their needs and allocate resources on the basis of the needs various children have. One child may have more needs than another. I do not know how anyone can assess the difference between one autistic child and another. I accept that there are various degrees on the spectrum, but I would have thought any child admitted to a unit needed all the supports he or she could possibly get. School principals will be looking at older children in their units continuing to receive services, while new entrants - younger children - will not receive the same level of service or allocation of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300"> Has the review of Beechpark services being completed? Can a communication which brings clarity to the issue be brought to all schools that depend on these services? There is significant uncertainty and trauma associated with this issue. Last Friday the Autism Bill 2012 was introduced to the House and it was graciously accepted by the Minister for Health. Several speeches were made on all sides of the House on how Ireland had grown up on this issue. However, when curtailment of services happens, parents who care deeply about their children and feel strongly about their advancement in life begin to wonder what will happen next. They had a sense of certainty that their child would receive these services but now that is gone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301"> I know budgets are tight and difficult, but it is the haziness, lack of clarity and total uncertainty surrounding this entire issue that need to be cleared up. The schools need to be dealt with in a more professional and compassionate manner. We need to ensure schools and the children's parents know where they stand. We cannot have a dichotomy of services in any autistic unit in which older children receive services younger children do not.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1302">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The Government is committed to protecting front-line services, including services for children with disabilities and autism, to the greatest possible extent by seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources. Beechpark is a regional HSE service which provides clinical supports for children with a specific diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder up to 18 years of age who attend designated special schools, outreach preschools and outreach classes in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. The service has to operate within the financial and other parameters applying.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303"> Importantly, the Beechpark service is working with local implementation groups to progress disability services for children and young people across the HSE's Dublin north-east and Dublin-mid-Leinster areas to focus on the current service model and service delivery structure provided by all service providers in the area with a view to addressing the realignment of resources in the context of the report of the national reference group, the national review of autism services report and the progressing disability services programme. This issue is also being examined by the Dublin Beechpark service review group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304"> Specifically on the issue of speech and language therapy services, the HSE aims to ensure the resources available are used to best effect in order to provide an assessment and ongoing therapy for children and adults in line with their prioritised needs. With the significant investment in the area of speech and language therapists employed in recent years, a range of new approaches has been developed and is used in many speech and language therapy services across the country. These include providing structures, training and support for parents and carers in order that they can work to help to improve the individual's speech and language. In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings, where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305"> These changes to speech and language therapy services aim to ensure services are provided based on the level of need in an equitable manner and in line with evidenced-based practice. It also facilitates access to services where vacancies arise having regard to the employment control parameters which apply. In that context, the Beechpark speech and language therapy service in north Dublin has been moved to a rotation system in the school-based model in an attempt to meet the needs of children across the entire service. The speech and language therapy service is due to rotate schools in April. The individual needs of the children will be kept under review. The speech and language therapist service will also continue to be available on a consultation basis for ongoing programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306"> While the current economic position presents challenges in how best to maximise the provision of services with available resources, I am committed to protecting front-line services, including children's disability and autism services to the greatest extent possible. I am less than happy with this situation or the level of service delivered. I am acutely aware of schools which do not have a service, even though they have special needs assistants. I have asked for a review in the Department. Today I spoke to Mr. Tony O'Brien, the HSE director general designate, about how staff were rotated and how the public sector recruitment moratorium impacted on front-line staff, especially therapists. For parents of a child with autism, each week without a service is a serious concern as the opportunity for the child to reach his or her full potential is compromised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307"> The position in the Beechpark service is unacceptable and I will take up the matter with the Minister of State responsible, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. I have always agreed with her approach that the service must be in place to ensure early diagnosis. Equally, once a diagnosis is made, the more specialist services required must be made available. I know the Minister of State will not be one bit happy about this either. I will revert to the Deputy on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1308">I am impressed not just by the Minister's attendance in the Chamber but also his willingness to move off script to give an impressive and impassioned defence of the services the children in question need. I take it at face value that he will communicate with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on this issue and revert to me in due course. We are agreed on the need for the children in question to access the services they require. We must also acknowledge, however, that there is significant disconnect between schools, parents and the service providers. This is not good for the relationships that need to be built up over time. This issue needs to be ironed out. The very least the schools and parents should expect is clarity. I thank the Minister for his commitment to deal with this issue and appreciate his offer to revert to me on it. I hope we will have positive news for the parents involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1309">I appreciate the Deputy's comments. Many years ago I was involved in the setting up of the Beechpark service when I was a member of the then health board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">The service was based on the south side but was to serve the entire area I referred to, including Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. I am not happy that we have unequal distribution of services and I have asked for this to be addressed. I have allocated €1 million per annum for three years to the area of autism and I await more complete reports on how that money is being spent and how it is impacting on the service. In all areas of patient care we need to focus not on inputs but outcomes and we need to measure outcomes. Having said that, if there is no therapist available to support special needs assistants then children will not receive the optimum care that they should receive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311"> Earlier Deputy Áodhan Ó Ríordáin referred to the review and I did not respond on that point. The review is not complete. However, we are the first Government to put in place at principal officer level an individual across the Departments with responsibility for health, education and children to deal with intellectual disability and autism. We have done the same thing to address childhood obesity as well. Certainly, I will come back to the Deputy. I believe this is a serious situation and one I will address aggressively with the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch. I believe she is as committed as I am to seeing the situation corrected. We are keen to see the type of flexibility applied to the moratorium on recruitment that will not prevent people taking up posts in this specific area because of its significant importance to the future of children.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1312">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for attending personally. This issue is topical. There have been interviews in recent days involving parents of children who are waiting for a bilateral cochlear implant. The debate has been passionate at times. I record the words of the mother of Anna Murphy, the little girl who featured on TV3's "Temple Street Children's Hospital" and "Ireland: AM" programmes last year following her cochlear implant surgery. Her mother contacted us and I sought permission to relay her words to the House. She said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1313">At present children in Ireland are implanted in one ear only, which, while fantastic that the child hears, is not acceptable as bilateral implants are recognised as international best standard. Ireland is one of the only countries limiting children to one implant. Beaumont Hospital has been begging for this funding since 2009 and the HSE acknowledged that this is best practice in its audiology report of 2009. However, after four years the HSE is still not funding bilateral implants and this is affecting 350 children in Ireland who time is running out for. These children have a window of three and five years between the first and second implant, including my daughter Anna. After this time the nerve dies and there is no hope of implantation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">We also heard from Julie Anne Cunneen who spoke passionately on behalf of her son, Liam. I realise that times are very difficult with the budgetary position that the Minister is faced with on a daily basis but we must act if we are to allow children to reach their full potential. By allowing only implantation we are compromising their ability to flourish and their ability to fulfil their ambitions and hopes and aspirations. I recognise that advances have been made and I realise there has been a meeting with the HSE chief operations officer, Laverne McGuinness, and some representatives of children who are waiting for the second implant. I urge for this to be made a priority and for the sequences needed to be set out to ensure the resources are in place following the appointment of Dr. Gary Norman as the national audiology clinical lead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315"> I realise that not much can be done between now and the Estimates for 2014 but at least a process could be put in place and the services could be nailed down. Then we could go ahead with the sequential implantation and simultaneous implantation for those who are born from here on. I urge the Minister to use this opportunity to put in place the necessary procedures. I realise there will be a significant drain on resources in Beaumont Hospital because it will have to play catch up with the sequential implantations but this change is necessary and time is not on the side of some of these children. If we are to allow them to have an opportunity in life to play their fullest and most meaningful role in society then surgery for a bilateral cochlear implant is a necessity. It complies with best international practice and this fact has been acknowledged by everyone concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316"> While people welcome the fact that one implant is provided at this stage most take the view we must proceed in the interests of giving children born with disadvantage and who will confront many obstacles a better service. Giving them one implant gives them hope but by giving them two it would give them opportunity. I hope the Minister can provide a positive response to the impassioned pleas of Julie Anne Cunneen, the mother of Liam, and the mother of little Anna who spoke passionately about the need to have this programme rolled out as quickly as possible.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1317">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of cochlear implantation services. The Taoiseach addressed the matter during Leaders' Questions today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318"> The Deputy has pointed out that Beaumont Hospital is the centre for delivering Ireland's national cochlear implant programme, with surgical provision for patients under the age of six years carried out in the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street. Since the national cochlear implant programme commenced 17 years ago more than 700 patients have received cochlear implants. I understand that in 2012 a total of 90 cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children and 48 adults receiving implants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319"> In 2009 a national review of audiology services was carried out by the HSE to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the national audiology review group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation. Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national roll-out of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone-anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme, but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320"> While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential implantation is being carried out in Ireland at the moment some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness. It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant. The HSE has established a national clinical care programme for audiology, which is overseeing the implementation of the recommendations detailed by the report of the review group. Progress is being made on the modernisation of audiology services in Ireland. The introduction of a universal national programme of new-born hearing screening is a key priority, the aim of which is that all babies have their hearing screened shortly after birth. One recent development has involved the appointment of a national audiology clinical lead, as Deputy Kelleher noted. In addition four assistant national lead posts have been advertised to support the implementation of the audiology clinical care programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321"> The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation. I understand that representatives from Beaumont Hospital, HSE management and the HSE's audiology clinical care programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation. An important element of this process will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow-on implantation. Each child must be assessed to determine if he or she is suitable for a bilateral implant. The provision of information about the advantages and potential disadvantages of bilateral implantation is required to facilitate an informed decision on whether to proceed. Not all suitable patients proceed with the second implant when appraised of all the issues involved. The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont Hospital. I am pleased to report that these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1322">The parents of the children in question are committed to ensuring that their children are allowed to reach their full potential. Clearly what is needed in the context of the clinical lead care programme is a commitment that funding will be provided. I realise it is difficult for the Minister to give a guarantee in the House today. However, the sequential implantation process should be given priority as should the simultaneous implantation process for those born thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323"> Time will run out for some of these children if the resources are not made available in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">I do not expect the Minister to make a grand announcement today, but the priority must be the establishment of the clinical lead and the appointment of Dr. Gary Norman, followed by an assessment of who is suitable for sequential implantation. It will be a demand-led scheme for several years because if a cap is put on the amount of funding available prior to completion of an audit of suitable candidates, some children will be placed at a disadvantage. Until the backlog is addressed, all those deemed suitable for cochlear bilateral implants should be treated. I urge the Minister to make every effort to convince those who have a say in budgetary matters that it is critical to maximise the opportunities for the children concerned in their future lives.</p>

            <p eId="para_1325">I do not wish to make a political argument on this issue. The Deputy and I want to give children the opportunity to reach their full potential. It has not been possible to implement the recommendations made in 2009 because of budgetary considerations, but we are providing as many children as we can with single implantations in order that we can begin sequential bilateral implantations in 2014. I have discussed the matter with the director general designate as recently as this morning. High priority is being given to this matter and, without being a hostage to fortune, we will have provision to undertake the bilateral implantations next year in order to give children the best chance. I do not want any child to miss out on the opportunity to have bilateral hearing and the same chances as other children. The Estimates for this year do not allow us to immediately engage in bilateral implantations, although some have been carried out. It is a priority for me to start providing them next year and we will enter into negotiations with Beaumont Hospital in this regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1326">The Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 provides that, subject to certain conditions, somebody who has been convicted of a minor offence will not be required to disclose it when applying for a job. There is a great line at the end of "Macbeth" when Macbeth considers the wrong he has done and says:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1327">I am in blood</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1328">Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1329">Returning were as tedious as go o'er:</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">In other words, it was easier to continue committing crimes than to start over. There is something wrong if it is easier to continue in crime than to start a new life. If we are serious about reducing the level of recidivism and stopping the revolving door, we have to act. Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille, toisc go dtugann sé seans nua do dhaoine a dhéan dearmad agus a bhí ar an mbóthar mícheart tosú ar an mbóthar ceart, but I do not think it goes far enough. The Bill provides for exceptions such as sexual offences and other serious offences tried by the Central Criminal Court. I acknowledge the need for the disclosure of convictions for those who work with children or vulnerable persons. However, we do not want to preclude those who pose no threat to children or vulnerable persons. Convictions will also have to be disclosed when individuals apply for taxi and private security licences. I understand the taxi issue has been discussed previously in a different context, but concerns have been expressed that the same regulations will apply to all applicants, regardless of country of origin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331"> We know the phrase "commit the crime and do the time", but every opportunity should be given to individuals to start afresh once they have faced up to their punishment. If we are serious about preventing recidivism, we must get such individuals into productive employment at the earliest opportunity. The seven year wait in the case of a custodial sentence of up to 12 months is too long, as is the period of three years in the case of a fine of up to €500. Research indicates that the optimal time for a clean slate is just after completing a sentence. The sooner an offender gets a job, the higher the odds that he or she will not reoffend. As a representative for Dublin Central, one of the biggest prisons in the country, Mountjoy Prison, is in my constituency. People from certain parts of Dublin Central make up a disproportionate number of those who go to jail. I have known teenagers from my youth club days, particularly young boys, who I am sure would not have reoffended if jobs had been available for them when they left prison after their first offence. I doubt that waiting up to seven years for a conviction to be considered spent will help a young person to stay out of jail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332"> The Penal Reform Trust made an interesting submission on the Bill. It gave the example of person A who received a nine month sentence which was suspended for two years but who is still feeling the effects 14 years later. He is working abroad and wants to return to Ireland, but his criminal record defines what he can do. Person B received a fine for possession of cannabis 20 years ago and is still precluded from working with children. That person feels demonised for a mistake made a long time ago. The trust believes that where an individual is given an entirely suspended sentence which is not subsequently revoked, it should be treated as a non-custodial sentence. The issue of isolated incidents must be taken into account. Somebody who makes a mistake or a single transgression for a minor offence should not receive a life sentence which defines what he or she can do for the rest of his or her life. </p>
          <p eId="para_1333"> Section 258 of the Children Act 2011 states offences committed by people under the age of 18 years can be considered spent under certain circumstances. This is an acknowledgement that past behaviour is not indicative of future behaviour. I do not see why that principle cannot be applied to older offenders. Tá aithne agam ar dhaoine ó mo dháilcheantar a bhí i bpríosún. Thóg siad gach seans a fuair siad san bpríosún i gcomhair oideachais nó i gcomhair oiliúna. Tháinig siad amach as an bpríosún i bhfad níos fearr agus réidh chun leanúint ar aghaidh lena saoil. Caithfimid cabhrú leis na daoine sin agus gan bac a chur os a gcomhair amach. Perhaps if we lived in a society that was equitable and fair, nobody would need to be afraid to reveal a past conviction. </p>
          <p eId="para_1334"> I acknowledge the work of the Mercy Law Resource Centre which advocates that the proposed spent conviction scheme be extended to the provision of publicly funded housing by local authorities. Its submission which has merit suggests only information on unspent convictions should be disclosed to a local authority. It also calls for an extension of the equality legislation to include a prohibition on discrimination on the grounds of a past criminal conviction and recommends the establishment of an independent body with enforcement powers to investigate complaints under the proposed scheme. This will be needed if we are to combat the issue of homelessness among those who come out of prison. There is a strong link between homelessness, crime and reoffending. Homelessness can lead to crime and being released from prison can lead to homelessness in the absence of a proper housing strategy. It is vital that we stop that cycle. A recent survey found that 33% of Irish female prisoners in Dóchas and 35% of male prisoners were homeless after release.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335"> In my constituency anti-social behaviour is prevalent in certain housing estates. I support the system of estate management checks, but we cannot exclude individuals from local authority housing on the basis of information from the Garda without taking into account its relevance, accuracy or seriousness. We must differentiate between different crimes. I am concerned that the information provided by the Garda includes not only criminal convictions but also cautions, warnings, investigations without charge, pending investigations and dismissals under the Probation Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">Some of these minor crimes result from addiction and alcoholism, but those who deal with their issues, attend rehab services, complete the 12 step programmes and have turned their lives around towards sobriety may not be housed by the local authority if they have a conviction, a sentence, a fine or a caution relating to that drug or alcohol use. For this reason, people coming out of rehab services or prison may not be housed and will move into emergency accommodation. This is very expensive and not always appropriate because it means they are mixing with people in a state of addiction, which will not help their recovery. They often end up homeless and the cycle begins again. I would like to see the Bill extended to include the provision of housing in a balanced and fair way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337"> With regard to enforcement powers and penalties, the enforcement-investigation powers of the Data Protection Commissioner should be extended to include complaints under the scheme. There must be some penalty system or enforcement will not be effective. A scheme that aims to facilitate the reintegration of ex-offenders into society must be welcomed. However, the gaps in the proposed legislation must be addressed. The Minister spoke about not doing enough, but the Bill only goes just a short way in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338"> I would like to mention two projects. The first, not in my constituency, is called Care after Prison in the Dublin 2 and Dublin 8 areas. This project is a partnership between a group of people, the Carmelite community and the Dublin YMCA. In the past year and a half it has worked with over 160 ex-offenders. It provides a range of services, including counselling and peer support. It has provided from its own resources a highly committed and motivated experienced team which provides information and support, whether to do with counselling, housing, training or education. The recidivism rate for those participating in the project is 0%. The budget for the project in the past year was €29,400, a small proportion of which came from the local authority. If we are serious about preventing recidivism, this is a project that works and I see no reason not to look at it more seriously. It costs €14,000 to keep a person on methadone for one year. We have a project that is working to help keep people totally drug free, saving €14,000, but that money is not being returned to it to help more people to become drug free.</p>

          <p eId="para_1339">We all have a common interest in reducing the level of crime. A strong spent convictions Bill would help to do this, but a weak one will add to the level of crime. Most of us have been victims of crime at some stage. At one time, when I was undertaking civil works for Dublin City Council, I was robbed 25 times in one year and not once did I get anything back, as it was mostly small machinery that was stolen. I also had a JCB excavator burned out in Finglas, a mini-digger taken in Dame Lane, a lorry taken in Russell Street, while a crane was sabotaged when the copper cable was removed from it. It was worth about €15,000 at the time. These crimes do not warm people to criminals, but we must understand there is a reason for their behaviour. We should not forget that the greatest suffering inflicted on Irish people in recent years was not caused by burglars in jeans but by professionals in designer suits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340"> The majority of people in prison come from a small number of disadvantaged communities. If we want to reduce the level of crime, the focus of imprisonment must be on rehabilitation, given that repeat offenders play a major role in crime levels. The rate of repeat offences is high - one of every two people leaving prison will be back again within four years. Peter McVerry who knows more about prisons and crime problems than any of us asks why we should be surprised by this because great numbers of prisoners spend their time in overcrowded, drug filled and violent prisons, with little or no constructive activity to occupy them. The only skill many prisoners acquire while in prison is how to commit crime more successfully on their release. Peter McVerry says many people leave prison without any arrangement being put in place to ensure they have accommodation, access to a social welfare payment or supports to help them to adjust to life outside.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341"> When people are in custody, we have a great opportunity to address the personal difficulties they have experienced. We also have a duty of care to ensure that on release, they have some chance of not sliding rapidly back into a life of crime. Ultimately, society's "us" and "them" mentality towards criminals prevents a serious attempt to reduce crime levels. Most people now know that 196 young people died in or shortly after leaving the care of the State in the decade 2000 to 2010. Most died from unnatural causes, a drug overdose, by suicide or as a result of violence. An investigation was carried out, followed by a report and there was widespread outrage at the failure of the State to adequately care for the young people concerned. In the same decade 135 people died while in prison or within one month of leaving prison. In other words, at the time of their deaths, they were or had recently been in the care of the State. Most died from unnatural causes, a drug overdose, by suicide and as a result of violence. However, there was no investigation, no report and no outrage. There was no comment from any politician and no commitment to deal with the deficiencies in the system that may have led to some of their deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342"> Sadly, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill retains a strong element of the "us" and "them" mentality. It allows prison sentences of 12 months or less for certain types of offences to be considered spent after a period of time in an attempt to assist the rehabilitation of ex-offenders. It also applies to suspended sentences of up to 24 months and lesser penalties such as community service or fines. However, the Irish Penal Reform Trust which is committed to reducing imprisonment and the progressive reform of the penal system, based on evidence-led policies, points out that the definition of "excluded sentences" in section 1 of the Bill sets out the maximum custodial sentence at 12 months imprisonment. This means that only those who have spent 12 months or less in prison may have their convictions considered spent. The Irish Penal Reform Trust argues that this should be extended at least to sentences of 30 months and ideally to sentences of 48 months or less. It states the limit of 12 months could be raised without any risk to public safety or of diminishing the punishment handed down by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343"> Spent convictions are not about mitigating punishment but about rehabilitation and acknowledging the person's successful effort to move on from offending behaviour. It is about supporting change in behaviour by removing barriers to participation in employment, education and other aspects of day to day life. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has stated the UK legislation is now the most liberal in the Commonwealth, with a limit of 48 months, and that in comparison to Australia and New Zealand, what is being proposed in the Bill is liberal. However, the Irish Penal Reform Trust argues that we should look closer to home for best practice. In countries such as France, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and Italy the individual who is the subject of the criminal record search is generally the only person allowed to request the information. Moreover, the emphasis in Europe is more on an individual's right for the crime to be forgotten, particularly in France, rather than the employer's right to know. As well as this, the Irish Human Rights Commission, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Mercy Law Resource Centre have all recommended that a broad prohibition on discrimination on grounds of criminal conviction must be introduced into equality legislation. They have argued that the impact of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill is diminished in the absence of such a prohibition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344"> There is a need to decriminalise certain kinds of offences. A six year study of drug laws in Britain by leading scientists, police officers, academics and experts has concluded that it is time to introduce decriminalisation of certain drugs.</p>

          <p eId="para_1346">The report by the UK Drug Policy Commission, an independent advisory body, states possession of small amounts of controlled drugs should no longer be a criminal offence. The commission concludes that such a move would not lead to a significant increase in use. The experts say criminal sanctions should be replaced with simple civil penalties such as a fine, attendance at a drug awareness session or a referral to a drug treatment programme. They also say imposing minimal or no sanctions on those growing cannabis for personal use could go some way towards undermining the increasing number of illicit cannabis factories controlled by organised crime. These issues are as relevant in Ireland as they are in Britain and we need to take a serious look at them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1347">This is a mean-spirited Bill which has been designed by people who come from an area with a low crime crime and have no understanding of how others have encountered problems in the first place. Worse still, people in this country who come from the "right" area will potentially not even have to go to court in the first place. I will give some examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">On 3 June I was heading to Dublin in my car for a meeting in the Dáil building when I was stopped by a Garda car. I had been using my phone. The garda in question told me I would be receiving a fine. I distinctly remember thanking the garda for doing his job well and commenting that his actions might extend my life. I headed off on my business and received a fixed penalty notice in the post. A few days later I bumped into a Garda sergeant who informed me he was aware I had received a notice. He asked me what had happened and I told him the story. He told me I was covered under the rule on travelling to the Dáil. I informed him that there was no point, but he insisted that I write to the station and explain. I did so and no points were added to my licence. I will supply the name of the garda in question to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, in order that he can use it in his internal review of the penalty points issue. I had planned to name him in the Dáil, but I was informed by people who seem to know how this place works that I would be stopped and that would be the end of my speech.</p>

          <p eId="para_1350">The Chair is suggesting likewise. That is not all, however. In December 2011 I attended a meeting in the Roscommon County Council building. When I was approaching the roundabout coming up to the building, I was stopped by the Garda and informed that I would be receiving a fixed penalty points notice because I was on my mobile phone again. I said "Okay" and headed into the meeting. At the meeting I casually mentioned that I had been foolishly using my mobile phone while driving and would be getting two penalty points. The meeting proceeded and afterwards I drove home. When I spotted my phone ringing approximately ten minutes into my journey - I learn a lesson eventually - I pulled in to answer it. A senior county council official was on the phone. He informed me that he had sorted out my penalty points issue for me. To this day, I have not received penalty points or a fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351"> Whatever about the case in which the penalty points were removed on the grounds that I was travelling to the Dáil, there is no case for what happened in this situation. Not only is a cohort of gardaí going around asking people if they want penalty points cancelled, but it also appears that there is a franchise system, whereby a person who is cosy with a senior garda can have people's offences quashed. As I have suggested, the Bill before the House has been put together by people who come from areas where crime is very low. If they ever commit an offence, they will never have to face charges. The Garda Commissioner and the Minister might not believe this is true.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352"> When the Garda Commissioner announced the penalty points fraud investigation, he said, "There is no question of what has been described as a culture of non-enforcement of penalties being tolerated by An Garda Síochána." How can my experience be explained in that context? I did not ask the Garda sergeant in question to get involved, but he insisted that he should. I do not believe it was an attempt to trip me up. I believe it is a culture which has festered for years. All the garda was doing was what he had learned along the way. Leaving that case aside, it is quite extraordinary to think a senior county council official would feel confident that approaching a senior garda would enable him to have penalty points quashed for a citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353"> Many people will ask why I did not release this information before the press released some of it. I had understood it was illegal for gardaí to release such confidential information. Strictly speaking, I was the only one who could release such information. I had intended to do so on publication of the internal review by the Minister. That was not my original idea, but I eventually worked out that this was where it would have the most impact. My intention was to be able to show clearly on the day of the launch of the review that there was systematic abuse, something I believe the report will attempt to whitewash.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354"> Last week I attended a court case in Loughrea to support my fellow turf cutters. Several people were in court that day on penalty points offences. We have been told by the Minister that people who have had their penalty points revoked had them revoked for good reasons. Many people in Loughrea courthouse put up a far stronger case than my own in support of the revocation of their penalty points, but they were ignored. Some of them were given four penalty points. I had a similar experience when I appealed penalty points in Roscommon courthouse some years ago. I had a good and legitimate reason for my appeal - a priest was visiting my father-in-law in hospital because he was on his death bed - but instead I was given four penalty points.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355"> The Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 does not do what it says on the tin. We are discussing it at a time when supposedly important people like me - I am one of them now - do not even have to go to the court in the first place. If the justice system is to work, it must be seen to be above favour. Our system is not. Corruption is like rust. It starts out small and cannot be seen, but if it is not kept in check, it corrodes everything. That is what is happening in the Garda Síochána. It started out as something small and has reached the point where people feel confident that they can cover up the murder of a priest who was such a good man that he had been named Roscommon person of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356"> I have contacted the fines office in County Clare to ask how I can go about having the punishment that should have been imposed on me in the first place - my fine and my penalty points - restored. I am calling on the 15 Members of the Oireachtas who have been referred to in media reports to tell us whether they were approached by the Garda or if they proactively went about having their penalty points removed. If that happens, perhaps we will be able to talk about the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012, for a start, with a little credibility. However, we will not be able to do so as long as the system in place in this country ensures the important people never have to go before the courts in the first place.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_442">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1357">I am sorry I did not speak before Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan because his speech is a hard act to follow. He has raised some important issues. We should start our discussion of spent convictions by looking at how people end up before the law and getting convictions in the first place. It is absolutely correct to say there is a culture in the State whereby a connected person with influence is outside the law in some way and can receive privileges and exemptions that are not afforded to people born on the other side of the tracks. Equally, there is evidence to suggest that when people collide with members of the Garda, the position I have described can be abused and they can end up with convictions also.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358"> This important Bill is a start, but it certainly does not go far enough in dealing with this issue, which is at the heart of certain questions. What type of society do we want to live in? What is the basis of the criminal justice system? As other Deputies have said, the idea that incarceration and custodial sentencing represent a way forward as we try to transform society is particularly ludicrous in this era of austerity when there is so much emphasis on cutbacks and so many attacks on public expenditure. It does not stack up on any ground. Given the cost of incarcerating people, substantial savings could be made by taking people out of the prison net. I am surprised that a much greater focus is not being placed on rehabilitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359"> We must consider how the system works from the outset - how people are apprehended and trials are conducted, whether sentencing policy is consistent and what goes on in prison. People must have the right to move on when their time is done and their sentences are served. We need to have consistency, transparency and proportionality in the system. While the principle of this legislation is good, the Bill does not go nearly far enough. If this issue is not addressed, a person who was sentenced after something relatively minor happened a long time ago, which certainly does not define his or her current contribution to society, could end up serving a life sentence. If he or she has to carry that conviction, for example, when dealing with prospective employers, it increases the likelihood of him or her becoming a career criminal. A person cannot gain employment if his or her record follows him or her around and taints him or her in this way. That is not a good way forward because it costs society in the long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360"> I will not repeat the points made by other Deputies. I do not think the Bill goes far enough. The proposed time period of 12 months is paltry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">Why should it even be 48 months? Why should it not be 60 months to start the ball rolling? That would be legitimate and not cause a danger to anybody else. I agree with the points made by the Irish Penal Reform Trust on having a simpler rehabilitation scheme laid out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362"> I am concerned about a couple of issues, the first being the question of excluding particular areas of employment. I do not see any basis for discrimination in this regard, given that it is an erosion of human rights. The reference to "relevant work" should be removed from the Bill. If there are concerns because somebody is dealing with children or security issues, they can be dealt with under the vetting legislation, although that in itself raises other issues, given that, under the vetting system, people brought for prosecution may not have ended up with a conviction, but the very fact that they were in court can be used against them in applying for a job. To take the issue of public order offences, I will use the example of people who could be served with an adult caution under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act. If they admit their guilt and accept the order, this does not have to be disclosed. However, if they do not accept an adult caution because they believe they are innocent, choose to go to court to defend the issue, go on trial and are acquitted, the very fact that there was a trial may, in some instances, have to be disclosed and can be used to discredit the person with a prospective employer, which is ludicrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363"> Under the vetting system, it is not just convictions that apply but also other specified information, which is highly dangerous, given the question of who defines it and is accountable for it. If, for example, a garda maliciously inputs some information on a person onto the PULSE system and it shows up, will it have to be disclosed? I echo many of the points made by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and consider that many of these issues are tied with the governance of An Garda Síochána, of which serious questions have been asked in terms of the lack of independent scrutiny. The reason it is tied with it is that the route to people being convicted starts initially from their contact with members of An Garda Síochána; therefore, their conduct has to be above aboard. I would be very concerned to ensure the non-disclosure aspect was removed for persons called in for interview and internal investigation by members of the Garda. What is to stop malicious information being used?</p>
          <p eId="para_1364"> We had a meeting over the weekend with multiple victims of Garda malpractice who had given definitive evidence about how they had been unlawfully summonsed for no valid reason whatsoever because a garda, or a resident with a connection to a garda, had decided to maliciously take action against them. In one case, a man's jeep was stolen and ended up being involved in a crime and he ended up with a criminal record. The conduct of gardaí is very relevant to how people receive sentences and end up in this position. This protection needs to be built in. We need to look at the Garda Ombudsman system with regard to public accountability and independent scrutiny of the Garda, which would assist in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365"> The other issue concerns rehabilitation. I do not believe there are many people who are beyond rehabilitation. If we were to invest in this process, our society would be far better off. Obviously, part of this is the idea of a spent convictions process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1366">Sinn Féin welcomes this legislation which is long overdue. The inaction on this issue for so long has had a seriously negative impact on those who made mistakes in the past, paid for their non-violent crime and yet had their conviction hanging over them for the rest of their lives. Ireland is the only jurisdiction in the European Union which does not have in place appropriate legislation to ensure certain criminal convictions can be expunged and people can move on with their lives and make a clean start with a clean slate. We are all aware of the problems that result from this. People have difficulties in obtaining visas and accessing employment, education and training courses. Many of them cannot take out certain types of insurance and are prevented from taking out a mortgage on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367"> This jurisdiction is far behind the rest of Europe on this issue. However, we do agree that an appropriate range of employments should be expressly excluded. However, these employment-related exemptions should be limited and offence-relevant. For example, it is obviously crucial that work involving substantial access to children or vulnerable adults should be afforded special protection. However, broad and blanket exclusion of all posts in health care, the Civil Service and certain legal and financial-related posts is not justified by the evidence. Where the nature of a past conviction is not relevant, employers and others should not be permitted to discriminate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368"> While we welcome this Bill, there are several problems with it and we will table amendments to seek to have these rectified on Committee and Report Stages. I am hopeful the Minister will take these suggestions on board. These are not "out there" suggestions but are considered normal in most other European jurisdictions. Framing this legislation correctly will be key to ensuring the successful reintegration of prisoners in society. Clearly, the Bill must apply to a wide range of convictions and the rehabilitation periods before a conviction can be spent must be reasonable and proportionate to the original conviction. In any area of employment where a conviction will still required to be declared, despite being spent must, under normal circumstances, it must be kept to a minimum and justified based on the public good.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369"> The Bill will not apply to most sentences and, while it is welcome that it has been agreed to on Seanad Stage that suspended sentences of up to 24 months can be considered spent, it is a shame this has not been amended to ensure custodial sentences of this length and up to 48 months, as is the case under the British legislation, would also be included. We will seek to have this amended, as the Bill will currently only apply to sentences of less than one year in prison. This is simply not adequate for the needs of those who have served their sentence and are not at risk of reoffending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370"> There are also issues regarding the various combinations of custodial and non­custodial sentences and people may find this difficult to follow. Furthermore, some of the periods of "rehabilitation" are on the excessive side. Six to seven years in the case of certain convictions is simply too long. Likewise, a further age-related tier, linked with the length of the rehabilitation period required, should be introduced. In the Twenty-six Counties the Children's Act 2001 makes provision for the convictions of children to become spent after a time. However, an 18-year old who commits a once-off minor offence may have this conviction hanging over him or her until he or she is nearly 30 years old because the seven-year rehabilitation period dates from conviction which may take place up to two years after actual commission of the offence. Facing employment-related discrimination during these crucial years, when the foundations of a career are laid, will have lifelong negative consequences. A tier requiring shorter rehabilitation periods for those who offend between the ages of 18 and 20 years should be introduced. I understand there may be a reluctance on the part of some to go down the road of introducing different reduced rehabilitation periods in case the former prisoner concerned reoffends. However, this is certainly not the first jurisdiction to introduce such legislation; therefore, we must look to other jurisdictions which have relevant experience and see how it has actually worked for them. There is a simpler way of doing this and we will table amendments to that effect on Committee Stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_1371"> There are other technical provisions which need to be amended. We welcome the exclusion of spent convictions from general court proceedings. However, the legislation in its current form allows circumstances that might require courts to deviate from that general approach "where justice cannot be done except by so admitting or requiring the evidence" of spent convictions, as set out in section 6(2). The implications of this are not clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372"> Some exclusions related to a number of specific types of legal proceedings seem reasonable and proportionate, although others seem vague and may require further clarification. We note that the Irish Penal Reform Trust has concerns about the exclusion of certain areas of employment and the potential impact on individuals seeking to benefit from the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_1373"> Regarding the provision for new areas of employment to be excluded from the Bill, any additional area of employment should only be introduced in consultation with other Departments. As there are very important issues of equality and privacy that must be addressed, the Bill should also provide for consultation with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Data Protection Commissioner. In fact, there is an argument to be made that both bodies should appear before the committee to discuss this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374"> Sinn Féin believes effective post-release reintegration of offenders with their families and communities once a custodial sentence has been served is essential for the prevention of reoffending and, therefore, ensuring community safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">As that is in everyone's best interests, the Bill is more than welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376"> Since it is our view that the primary objective of justice policy is to prevent crime, part of the emphasis must be on incentivising crime-free lifestyles by ensuring gainful employment is available to ex-prisoners, but this should not be out of the reach of the majority of prisoners. To this end, unwarranted barriers and discrimination in law or policy must be proactively removed. A range of barriers currently serve to inhibit the reintegration of all those with a past conviction, especially ex-prisoners, most of which are not addressed in the Bill. The fields in which discrimination operates to exclude those with a past conviction include employment, accommodation, travel and adoption, among others. The extent of this discrimination should not be underestimated. </p>
          <p eId="para_1377"> Sinn Féin also supports the existing regime for the expungement of criminal records of juveniles in so far as it is consistent with principles established under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. A recent study found that nearly half of employers said they would not employ someone with a criminal record. Far from effectively protecting the public, these barriers actually serve to exacerbate Ireland's already high rates of repeat offending. If this and previous Governments actually wanted to remedy crime, they might have tried to do this years ago. I received a letter from the Mercy Law Resource Centre which told me that in 2011 there were 3,808 people sleeping rough. There are clear and documented links between homelessness and crime, recidivism and reoffending. Effective and humane justice policies cost the State less in the long term. We need more initiatives like this that will reduce crime and allow people to reintegrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378"> A spent convictions regime for non-disclosure of criminal records should be supported by all in order to facilitate post-release reintegration through employment and prevent other forms of discrimination. More than a decade after the Good Friday Agreement, former political prisoners are still subject to grave discrimination in a wide range of areas. The political nature of the conflict in Ireland has now been recognised. This recognition must be formally extended to ex-political prisoners and discrimination against them needs to end. It is Sinn Féin's long-standing and firm position that records of all former political prisoners should be expunged to assist the process of national reconciliation and discrimination on the basis of a conflict-related conviction should be prohibited by law to enable such former prisoners to participate as equals in all aspects of economic and social life. It is a scandal that this has not been addressed in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379"> Both Sinn Féin and the Irish Human Rights Commission have also proposed that equality legislation be extended to include criminal conviction as one of the grounds on which discrimination in employment, except where objectively incompatible with job responsibilities, and the provision of services is prohibited. This protection is crucial to ensure effective post-release reintegration, in particular, through the provision of adequate and appropriate housing. This is also something that must be included in this Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_1380"> I urge the Minister to take on board our suggestions and commend the Bill to the House. We will engage with the Minister on Committee Stage when it commences next Wednesday and continue the discussion then.</p>

          <p eId="para_1382">Yes. I am delighted to see a spent convictions Bill before the Dáil. I have long had an interest in this area and recall former Deputy Barry Andrews introducing a Private Members' Bill in the last Dáil. As it did not see its way to the floor of the House on Second Stage, I am really pleased that the Government has brought it to this stage in a way that is more generous to offenders than even the approach recommended by the Law Reform Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383"> I know many may see this measure as a concession to offenders, but I see it as having widespread societal benefits. Most reasonable people would agree that minor offences should not carry a lifetime record, which is effectively a lifetime sentence for those who have offended in the past. It is easy to envisage a situation where a young person becomes involved in activities which, although resulting in a record, may be the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. A few years later he or she will become a model citizen. Most of us know young people who found themselves in these situations. </p>
          <p eId="para_1384"> When the Bill was taken in the Seanad, many Senators referred to really minor offences such as fishing offences. This is not to minimise these offences, but they are minor in the scale of offending. They could include offences such as a failure to pay a television licence fee or incurring penalty points for minor offences, but they are time and circumstance-specific and, by definition in the Bill, are not repeated for five years. They are minor, once-off offences resulting, in many cases, from sheer youthful impetuosity or thoughtlessness, particular circumstances or sheer bad luck, for example, being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even if there is intent and real culpability, the offences proposed to be regarded as spent under the Bill are minor according to the conditions of the case and those guilty of them have not reoffended for a number of years. By definition, they are part of a person's past and I do not believe they should forever define their character and limit their prospects for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385"> It is not just offenders who will benefit from being allowed a clean slate and an opportunity to move on with the lives and reintegrate into society. There is a significant societal benefit for all of us in encouraging good behaviour, offering people the prize of leaving their record behind and rewarding their good behaviour. It gives people who have made one or possibly two past mistakes to change their life and start again. I think the Bill permits two past mistakes to be regarded as spent. It is right that the justice system sees its role as preventing future crimes and offering rehabilitative opportunities to all offenders but particularly those guilty of really minor crimes which are once-off events rather than reflective of the lifestyle of a career criminal. The Bill recognises this and as such, I very much welcome it. I am, however, disappointed that these crimes will remain on the record. I would like to see them expunged completely. Alternatively, if a record must be kept, it should be closed in order that for all normal intents and purposes such as educational opportunities such as attending courses here or abroad, insurance or travel purposes and particularly obtaining visas, there was no crime committed. That surely is the principle behind the concept of a spent conviction for minor crimes. </p>
          <p eId="para_1386"> As proposed in the Bill, it is limited and the benefit is only for employment purposes within the State. That is a valuable opportunity and I am not denigrating it in any way, but the Bill offers the opportunity to do more. I understand ensuring the record was closed or expunged entirely would involve a cost, whereas it is to be self-administered under the Bill. For the purposes of taking out insurance or applying for a licence or an education and training courses, minor crimes committed in years past could reasonably be ignored and taken entirely from the record. We are not talking about major crimes against the person which are outside the scope of the Bill. Otherwise, people will continue paying for minor crimes in many important areas throughout their entire life, including obtaining insurance, which is important. It seems unnecessarily penal and possibly counterproductive because it limits people's life opportunities as a result of doing something very stupid in the past. Furthermore, they can never travel to the United States or many other countries. This is a significant restriction at any time, but it is particularly restrictive for young people when emigration offers the only opportunity they will ever have in many cases to find a job. To have that door closed to them forever is penal. It seems cruel that a moment of impetuosity or foolishness at the age of 18 years would forever prohibit them from availing of these opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">I listened to Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan who seems to have a support network when it comes to penalty points. Some people may obtain that number of penalty points on a single day. As it is a criminal offence, it will be on their record forever, with the result that they will not be allowed entry to the United States or anywhere else. If the record was closed, one could reasonably and honestly answer "No" to the question, "Do you have a criminal conviction?" which appears on US visa application forms. This would be consistent with the position where the State considers past crimes to be atoned for and, therefore, no longer relevant, either here or abroad. However, any question about a spent conviction must be answered honestly. We cannot control what other countries ask, but this is an independent state, which means we can decide on the existence of a criminal conviction. The principle of the spent conviction is that the conviction no longer applies, which means that the question about a criminal conviction can be answered with confidence. I ask the Minister to consider this measure which would add to the Bill and make a real difference to people's lives. If it is regarded as a step too far in cases in which a custodial sentence has been imposed, I suggest it could be introduced in the first instance in the case of non-custodial sentences. I ask that suspended custodial sentences also be regarded as non-custodial sentences. I believe the Minister has already received such a recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388"> The Bill allows for two records to be kept, only one of which will show the convictions. An offender seeking his or her record from the Garda Síochána will be provided with the two records. However, the Bill is silent on what will happen when others seek that information such as by way of a freedom of information request from the media or an individual. Anyone can submit a freedom of information request for information on convictions. Will it be an offence to reveal information on spent convictions? Does the system which will be self-administered preclude enforcement of a spent conviction? The absence of enforcement makes the new measure somewhat weaker and less effective. It raises the issue of defamation law and the legality of protecting information on spent convictions from the media, for instance. If some effort is not made to keep that information confidential or protected, the Bill may be meaningless in many ways. The information must be kept secret from those who, for whatever reason, may seek to obtain it. Enforcement of spent convictions is complex and it will be difficult to ensure the information is kept secret. A problem may arise with on-line information which is very difficult to monitor. For example, newspapers in Britain which may have reported crimes in the past are not required to remove that information from their on-line or archival records, but legislation prohibits them from writing about these crimes in the future. I question information on convictions being freely available on-line, a provision which is being introduced in some countries. I ask why the Bill is silent on such a provision which may be introduced here. Perhaps it should be included at this stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_1389"> I appreciate that the British legislation has been in existence for 40 years; therefore, there has been an opportunity to refine and reform the regime in place there. The British legislation is a little more generous in that spent convictions are permitted in the case of longer sentences. However, the Minister has adopted a more generous approach than has previously been proposed. </p>
          <p eId="para_1390"> I commend the motivation behind this legislation, but I would like it to include circumstances other than employment. We must consider the enforcement of the decision to regard a conviction as spent. If this is not done, it will become almost meaningless. This is ground-breaking legislation and it is a tosach maith. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy John O'Mahony<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1391">As Deputy Olivia Mitchell said, there have been a number of attempts to introduce such a Bill. I acknowledge Deputy Dara Calleary's Private Members' Bill. The Bill is welcome in that it provides persons convicted of certain offences with an opportunity and an incentive to move on with their lives after taking the punishment for their crimes. The Bill is not soft on crime, rather it gives some people a second chance. They will not be stigmatised for life for making one mistake which may prevent them from gaining employment. The Bill will allow such persons to put the past behind them and move on with their lives. They will have the opportunity to prove they have reformed and be enabled to lead a crime-free life in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392"> The Bill includes checks and balances to ensure its provisions cannot be used as an escape route for the disingenuous. The spent conviction provision can only be exercised twice in a lifetime. The Bill also excludes a range of employments, including those relating to the security of the State or the administration of justice and an application for certain licences. It will apply retrospectively. Those with spent convictions are excluded from seeking to work with or providing services for children or vulnerable adults. The Bill will not delete a conviction from the public record but provides that an employment opportunity will not necessitate the raking up of the past, so to speak. It is very sensible legislation. A lengthy time period is provided for between the imposition of the conviction and when it can be considered spent. The provisions do not apply to any sentence of more than 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393"> The Bill will be of benefit to once-off offenders who, as a result of myriad circumstances which may be drink-related, are convicted in the District Court. It caters for those convicted who realise the gravity of their situation. Their long-term employment prospects are damaged and travel to certain countries becomes an issue. That moment of madness will come back to haunt them and this legislation will allow them to move on with their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394"> I agree there is a need for deterrents, which are the responsibility of the courts. There has to be a balance in the justice system between showing no mercy to hardened criminals who show neither remorse nor a willingness to mend their ways and must be removed from society and, on the other hand, helping and supporting those who want to have a second chance to demonstrate that they have mended their ways. In that context, a few weeks ago in the House I raised the matter of career criminals continually being given free legal aid. This is the other end of the spectrum. There is a need for some deterrent for criminals who show no sign of mending their ways and who must be punished. They should not be permitted to continually milk the scarce resources of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395"> I noted that Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan had harsh things to say about the Garda Síochána. As someone who has a few penalty points, I never asked and never received an offer to have them expunged, nor do I believe I should have been. The Garda Síochána is fair game and has come in for severe criticism. From experience, I am aware that gardaí do their duty to the highest standard. As with every other group, however, there are exceptions to the rule. That is why the Garda Ombudsman Commission is in place. It must be remembered that people have been dismissed from the force. I am reminded of what occurred in the case of clerical child sexual abuse. The vast majority of gardaí carry out their duties to the highest possible standard, as is the position in the case of the vast majority of priests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396"> We sometimes tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There is a need to achieve a balance and the Bill has a sense of balance. It will give people a second chance and provide them with an opportunity to prove that they have moved on and get their lives and the lives of those around them back on track. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1397">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Minister for Justice and Equality's version of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012. I wish to begin where Deputy John O'Mahony finished by stating I have penalty points. Ironically enough, I obtained most of them while travelling through Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan's constituency, either on my way to the Dáil or on my way back home. I was never contacted to see if I wanted to have my penalty points expunged and never wrote a letter seeking to have them expunged. The notion that all Members of this House live in a reality which is separate from that occupied by everyone else is ridiculous. If one receives penalty points, one accepts that fact and then gets rid of them after two years. I hope someone will not obtain so many points that it will lead to him or her being banned from driving. The holier than thou attitude on this matter is crazy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1398"> I endorse what Deputy John O'Mahony said about the Garda Síochána. Tonight, thousands of members of the force are on duty throughout the country. God knows what situations they will come across as they seek to protect the people of this state. As is the case with every operation, there are a few bad eggs. However, the vast majority of members of the Garda Síochána seek to serve both their communities and the State and they do so under tremendous pressure. That pressure has never been greater than it is today. It is completely unfair to come before the House and continually criticise gardaí, particularly in view of the fact that we depend on them so much for the security they provide for our homes and communities and in many other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399"> It is welcome that the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, finally got around to publishing the Bill. We published our own legislation in 2011, but he dismissed it and stated he would bring forward his own. He has done so now and I welcome the opportunity it provides to discuss the issue of spent convictions. As my party's spokesperson on justice and equality, I came to this matter relatively late. My colleague in the previous Dáil, former Deputy Barry Andrews, discussed it with me and presented me with the Bill he had introduced in 2008. We then reintroduced that Bill which opened up for me an entirely new area of correspondence and telephone calls with people throughout the country on their personal experiences of spent convictions. I received approximately 20 calls from parents whose children were seeking either to travel or emigrate and who could not do so as a result of minor offences they had committed in their late teens or early 20s. In many cases, they committed such offences while under the influence of alcohol or while at college. Their convictions are now on their records, which is why they are precluded from travelling to the United States and many other destinations. Perhaps the Minister might clarify the position in this regard, but I understand what I have outlined will not change. In other words, such convictions will remain on people's records. Many were hoping this Bill would change the position. The people to whom I refer have already paid the price for what they did in their early or late teens or their early 20s. They were obliged to go to court and were convicted for the offences they had committed.</p>

          <p eId="para_1400">There is already a spent conviction provision in respect of those who are under 18 years.</p>

        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_449">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1401">I apologise. However, I am most concerned about those in the 18 to 22 age bracket who have endured the public embarrassment that goes with being convicted for minor offences. However, many of their lifestyle choices are affected by the fact that they have such convictions on their records. As Deputy Olivia Mitchell correctly stated, unfortunately we are for whatever reason in a situation where the only choice many have in seeking employment is to leave the country. The trend in this regard will I hope be short lived. We have the opportunity to clarify the position of those who have convictions for minor offences once and for all in order that they might travel abroad if they so desire.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402"> The Irish Penal Reform Trust does superb work. The Bill gives us the opportunity to discuss what we want from the justice system. Do we want rehabilitation and restoration? Do we want people to learn from their mistakes? Do we want such individuals to re-enter society, not repeat their offences, keep below the radar and live peacefully out of harm's way? Are we seeking retribution from the justice system? For many, we are seeking both. Every crime has a victim and every victim will want a certain element of retribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403"> Those of us who are seeking a spent convictions regime want to change the position on convictions for relatively minor offences. It is on foot of such offences that people learn. It is because of them that they enter the criminal justice system and they will I hope learn their lesson and choose a different path. Unfortunately, people choose not to do so and there are many repeat offenders. Deputy John O'Mahony identified a serious problem in that regard, namely, the fact that repeat offenders continue to enjoy access to legal support at taxpayers' expense. I am all for a fair system of justice and everyone has the right to representation. However, when individuals repeatedly seek to access such representation, something must be done. In the context of other spheres of public expenditure, people who had committed crimes would not be allowed to repeatedly return and access what was on offer. There are no members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in the Chamber, but I am aware that the Chairman, Deputy David Stanton, has indicated his intention to do some work in this area. There is no doubt that it requires consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404"> The Irish Penal Reform Trust has raised a couple of concerns about the Bill. I refer, in particular, to the limiting of rehabilitation periods. It is welcome that the Minister made changes in this regard in the Seanad and I hope he will make further changes on Committee Stage. The shortening of the conviction period to three to seven years is an improvement on what he originally proposed, but it could be reduced further to two to four years. After all, we are discussing minor offences. Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn has made the point that it is after conviction and that by the time one eventually gets to court, one's chance to expunge the conviction is arising at a time when one should be obtaining the work experience one needs in order to create the foundations for one's career. As a result of convictions such as those to which I refer hanging over people, they will not get the opportunity to obtain such experience. As Deputy Olivia Mitchell stated, the offences in question are minor and a person could have obtained a conviction for committing such an offence in circumstances utterly beyond his or her control or because he or she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1405"> The Irish Human Rights Commission has been significantly and sharply more critical of the Bill. We agree with the commission that the Bill must be viewed in the context of National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. The two are similar and their provisions cross into similar areas. It would be foolish in the extreme to implement the Bill before the House while completely ignoring the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. Where the two dovetail, steps should be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1406"> The issue of discrimination on the grounds of a conviction for employment purposes must be examined. I have a certain sympathy for employers who have a right to know about someone's background. They also have the right to know whether something someone did in the past is going to influence or impact on the manner in which he or she will undertake his or her work. Employers have a right to know, but they do not have a right to discriminate. If a particular candidate is the best person for the job, an employer does not have the right to discriminate on the basis of a previous minor conviction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1407">That should be expunged at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408"> I am not fully in favour of Deputy Mitchell's proposal that the entire conviction should be expunged. The employer has a right to know, and any potential candidate who has respect for a potential employer would admit to the offence, but some work needs to be done on that. A complete expungement as proposed by Deputy Mitchell probably goes a little too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409"> I welcome the Bill. There is much to be improved on Committee Stage. The Minister is not the most generous in accepting Opposition amendments. He might do so on this Bill given the general all-party agreement at this Stage on it. He accepted some amendments in the Seanad before Christmas. He is probably in better humour now, but any amendments put forward on the Bill are for the good of the Bill and the good of those it seeks to address, particularly younger people who have made genuine mistakes who want to restart their lives. I hope the Minister would examine any amendments proposed in that context and also in the context of groups such as the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which does super work in this area and challenges all our perceptions about penal reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_1411">Yes. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012, and I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality on bringing it before the House. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the non-disclosure of certain convictions where a person has not reoffended for a certain period of time. That is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1412"> In the past three years I have encountered a number of cases where people have experienced major difficulties when applying for jobs due to relatively minor offences on their criminal record. Obviously, if a person breaks the law, regardless of how minor the offence, he or she deserves to be punished. There should be no ambiguity about that. However, we can all make mistakes, particularly when we are young, and it is important that those mistakes are not held against a person for the rest of their lives, thus impinging on future career opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413"> It is important to point out that convictions for serious offences such as murder, manslaughter and sexual offences may never become spent. Convictions resulting in sentences of more than 12 months may not become spent either, and not more than two convictions in a person's life may become spent. On that basis the Bill cannot be described as an effort to assist hardened criminals, but rather an attempt to ensure that persons who commit minor one-off offences are not stigmatised when seeking employment in the future. Essentially, the spent convictions Bill is providing people with a second chance. </p>
          <p eId="para_1414"> A young person called into my office recently regarding a Garda vetting application. The person in question had an intoxicated in a public place offence dating back to 2004. At the time the case was struck out of court and there was no conviction against the person. However, the offence still appeared on a Garda vetting application, which was a cause of great distress and embarrassment to them. I am aware that matters relating to Garda vetting applications are somewhat different from the spent convictions Bill about which we are speaking. However, that is a clear example of a case where a relatively minor offence will be held against a person for the rest of their life. That is relative in the context of today's debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1415"> One of the main purposes of the spent convictions Bill is to help with the rehabilitation of ex-offenders who have demonstrated a positive change in their ways by making it easier for them to access employment and reintegrate into society. With regard to the case to which I referred, the offence took place nine years ago, and there was no conviction. On that basis, it seems unfair that that information should have to be disclosed when applying for jobs in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1416"> Other cases have been brought to my attention involving details appearing on Garda vetting disclosures where the Probation of Offenders Act was applied in the court. When a charge is dismissed under the probation Act, it is effectively a non-conviction and can only be used against a person if they are brought into court on a second or subsequent occasion. Judges, therefore, operate in the District Court on the basis that the probation Act does not affect a person's record and will not hinder future employment or travel opportunities. However, I have been advised of cases where Garda vetting applications have disclosed matters where the probation Act was applied. That impacts on a person's employment prospects and appears to be contrary to what judges and solicitors understand as being the consequence of applying the probation Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417"> It seems to be unfair that persons who have been given the opportunity by the courts to have a clear record subsequently have that chance taken from them by the Garda vetting office. The obvious solution would be to amend Garda vetting policy to exclude any offences which were dismissed under the probation Act. The Minister might provide some clarification on that issue as it ties in with the main thrust of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1418"> I welcome the Bill. It is a step in the right direction and it will bring Ireland into line with other EU member states. Essentially, it provides persons convicted of certain offences with a second chance, and it will be welcomed by those people who will now have the opportunity to leave past misdemeanours behind them and get on with the rest of their lives.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulConnaughtonJnr" eId="spk_452">
          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1419">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. In decades past, the idea that Garda vetting had to be carried out before one could take up any position was unthinkable yet it is now a fact of everyday life, and that change in society must be reflected in terms of the way previous convictions are dealt with and the length of the shadow they can cast upon a person's life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420"> Recent years have seen thousands of applications for Garda vetting submitted from organisations across a range of fields as those organisations seek to ensure that everyone involved is aware of best practice in terms of safeguarding policies, that they have signed up to those policies, and that they have been Garda vetted. Some years ago a young man or woman who ran into trouble and received a criminal conviction for a relatively minor offence could live out the rest of his or her life without his or her work colleagues being aware of that part of their past. While the vast majority of such cases related to minor offences, there had to be cases in the past where people were allowed to work in an unsuitable context, perhaps with unsupervised access to children, because colleagues were unaware of the extent or nature of their previous convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421"> Recent decades have seen the lid lifted on the scandal of sexual abuse in Ireland, with revelations relating to every facet of life, and have prompted the recognition that much stricter procedures must be put into place in terms of the suitability of people working with children. All employers, including voluntary groups, must have much greater awareness in terms of the previous convictions of all staff and volunteers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422"> The Bill strikes the proper balance between releasing people from the burden of convictions recorded many decades ago and ensuring that all people working with children are properly vetted and that in such instances, all previous criminal convictions must be detailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1423"> I note from the Bill that convictions for murder, manslaughter and rape will never become spent under this measure, nor will convictions for sexual offences. Given the high level of recidivism among sexual offenders, that is particularly welcome. Also, people who received sentences of over 12 months will never be able to consider that those convictions are spent. </p>
          <p eId="para_1424"> The most important element of the Bill, however, is that anyone seeking to work with children or vulnerable adults, or in sensitive positions in the civil or public service, will have to disclose their convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1425"> Another important element of the Bill before the House is that the spent element of the conviction relates to the onus to disclose the conviction, as opposed to the conviction itself. The conviction remains on the person's record.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426"> Lest anyone fear that this Bill will allow career criminals to wipe the slate clean and apply for jobs among unsuspecting colleagues, it is worth remembering that only two convictions may be considered spent during a person's life. People with multiple convictions, therefore, will have to disclose all convictions bar two, and convictions of a serious nature will still have to be disclosed. After two years a fine becomes spent, while it will take five years for a one year jail sentence to become spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427"> The provision that people involved in work relating to the security of the State are excluded from the provisions of the Bill is also welcome. We cannot have a situation whereby those working in areas such as Customs and Excise have had serious criminal convictions in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428"> Another fear that many members of the public would have is that the Bill could allow serious criminals to take up jobs where they have access to members of the public, and where the public have a right to expect that their previous behaviour has been up to a certain standard. The exclusion of licence holders such as taxi licence holders and private security licence holders from the provisions of the Bill is also to be welcomed in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1429"> In introducing the Bill, Ireland is following the example of most other EU member states that have enacted provisions to ensure that people convicted of offences in the past can move on with their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430"> As Garda vetting increasingly becomes a part of everyday life, it is important that people who had a conviction for an offence in a previous chapter of their lives are not excluded for ever more from accessing employment, and that they are given the chance to prove their ability to a prospective employer.</p>

          <p eId="para_1431">One consequence of the intense focus on the financial and economic crisis of recent years is the time and energy consumed in the Oireachtas at the expense of other less important or significant legislation. That is despite the fact that the 31st Dáil is meeting more often than any since the 1920s.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">The Law Reform Commission, a State agency which undertakes exceptionally important work, can devote time to carefully scrutinising and examining the law to ensure its relevance and practicality. In 2007, the commission produced its report on spent convictions and it is regrettable that it has taken six years for it to reach this point in the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1433"> The Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill will draw on the practice that currently operates in many other European and OECD countries. It recognises the central point that as human beings we all make mistakes. The Bill will bring an end to circumstances in which a citizen is forced to experience the consequences of having committed a misdemeanour or small offence for many years after conviction. As Deputies, we often draw on the experience of constituents who have come to see us. Daily contact with constituents is vital. Shortly after the general election of 2011, I met a constituent and gained a deeper understanding of the issue before the House. The constituent had been involved as a young man in a petty criminal act and was still suffering the effects of having received a non-custodial sentence well over a decade later. He had long since realised the seriousness not only of the initial crime but also of its consequences on his everyday life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434"> Our criminal justice system is based on the premise that a person convicted following a fair and transparent trial pays his or her debt to society through a custodial or non-custodial sentence. The hope is that a person can move on once that debt has been repaid. In practice, however, the requirement that a citizen must disclose any conviction irrespective of how much time has elapsed or the nature of the offence constitutes a life sentence. The current practice hardly assists in rehabilitating and reintegrating offenders. Previous convictions affect, among other things, access to employment, finance, education and travel visas for thousands of citizens. The simple truth is that a person should not have to pay indefinitely for a crime that was not of a serious nature. The Bill will achieve that goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1435"> Examination of the Bill reveals the careful consideration that has been given to its construction. The Bill will benefit citizens who have made a mistake and will not help career criminals. It will apply to prison sentences of 12 months or less and suspended sentences of up to 24 months. Importantly, the Bill excludes more serious offences such as murder, manslaughter, rape and other sexual offences to protect the public. Further welcome provisions safeguard vulnerable people, including children, by ensuring that it remains obligatory to declare any such convictions when applying for certain jobs. The Schedule of the Bill sets out clearly and directly the duration of the relevant time periods that must elapse before a conviction can be considered to be spent. It also differentiates clearly between the conditions that apply to custodial sentences and those that apply to sentences of a non-custodial nature. This clarity cannot be overvalued in circumstances in which the provisions of the Bill will be self-administered and there is no application process or procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1436"> While there has been and will continue to be much debate on the future of the Seanad, I am encouraged to see that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, took the opportunity provided by Seanad debates to make amendments tabled by himself and by Senators. The amendments have improved the effectiveness and value of the Bill. It is certainly more generous and nuanced that any of its predecessors. The Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill achieves the balance required to safeguard the public, particularly its vulnerable members, while ensuring that a citizen who has received a less serious conviction can move on with his or her life. I welcome the Bill, which I hope will become law without delay. Many honest and reformed citizens await its enactment.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianWalsh" eId="spk_454">
          <from>Deputy Brian Walsh<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1437">I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this important debate on legislation which brings Ireland into line with all of its EU partners by providing for spent convictions. The application of the Bill is tempered by careful and specific constraints which ensure that the protection of the public remains paramount at all times. The Bill does not provide for a criminal record to be simply wiped clean. It removes the requirement for a person to disclose a conviction in certain limited circumstances following the lapse of a certain period of time. In this regard, Ireland remains more stringent than certain other jurisdictions which provide for convictions to be expunged and criminal records to be destroyed entirely. In addition, the provisions of the Bill will apply only to convictions resulting in prison sentences of up to 12 months or to lesser penalties including community service orders or fines. Convictions for sexual offences and other serious crimes are outside the scope of the Bill, while no more than two convictions may become spent in respect of any individual. Crucially, anyone seeking to work with children or other vulnerable persons will not be able to avail of the provisions of the Bill. These and other restrictions which constrain the application of the legislation adequately safeguard society from any ex-offender who would seek to take advantage of its provisions with a view to committing further crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1438"> The introduction of the Bill is long overdue. As far back as 2007, the Law Reform Commission made recommendations on spent convictions, and legislation has been discussed in the House on numerous occasions in the intervening years. The Law Reform Commission's recommendations were born of the idea that the purpose of the criminal justice system is not merely to punish offenders but to rehabilitate them. I take the example of a person who in a moment of youthful indiscretion at 18 years of age committed an offence resulting in conviction and a community service order. Currently, that individual would be obliged to disclose the conviction in a job interview even if the offence had taken place decades previously. This makes it extremely difficult for such a person to find a job. Research carried out by the Small Firms Association suggests that up to 87% of employers would be reluctant to hire a former offender. Thus begins the cycle of criminality. The inability to find a job can make it difficult to reintegrate into society and to cope financially which, in turn, can act as an economic incentive to re-offend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1439"> In the absence of provisions for spent convictions, even a relatively minor offence represents a life sentence of sorts. Its implications can endure for the rest of a person's life. Instead of placing a burdensome millstone around a convicted person's neck, we must present people with a path to a place in the community, the workforce and society. Where a person demonstrates a positive change in his or her ways by remaining free of convictions for the required period, the legislation will assist with his or her rehabilitation. The introduction of the Bill represents a progressive move which brings Ireland's law into kilter with the laws of other member states. I commend the Minister on the carefully balanced and considered form of the legislation he has brought before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1440">I am delighted to come here chun cúpla focail a rá ar an mBille. I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality, which I do not often do, for introducing a Bill on which a great deal of groundwork was done by the former Minister of State with responsibility for children, Mr. Barry Andrews, and, in Private Members' time, by Deputy Dara Calleary. Many Members regularly come across constituents who have made a simple mistake and done something stupid which they regret for life. It is time we addressed that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1441"> I have two penalty points which I received ag teacht go dtí an Teach seo. I was coming here and did not even know I had been given points. I was in no particular rush as I was late for most things that Tuesday evening. When I returned home on Friday morning, the penalty notice had arrived to my office. I make it clear that I did not ring anybody and nobody rang me to say I could, should or would have the points removed. To be fair to gardaí and members of local authorities, I do not think they go around ringing people to tell them how to get off penalty points or rudaí mar sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442"> The Garda vetting system is a shambles. There was nothing like Garda vetting when there were local gardaí who knew every family in a parish and could tell in good faith by the way a person behaved and because of the support they gave what type of family someone came from. They would often give a fellow the benefit of the doubt. We now have a centralised system from which one has to wait six months for a result. Somebody looks at a computer and provides Garda vetting about someone he or she has never heard of. It is a farce. A participant in the community employment scheme of which I am the chairman came to me in awful distress two months ago having received a letter from the Department of Social Protection. He has worked with us for three years and disclosed to us at interview that he had a conviction for drink driving. While that is a criminal offence, it does not represent a threat to society. We disclosed it also, but someone in FÁS discovered it lately and decided that it was terrible and that he could not work with us because he had a conviction. There are farcical situations such as that. In some instances, one is compelled to take on others. I am glad to see the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has arrived in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1443">We all know about employers - I am one myself - and they give people the benefit of the doubt within reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_1444"> There are many good things in the Bill but the Garda vetting system is a farce. I am not blaming gardaí. It has been taken away from local gardaí. In the past, a call was made to the local Garda station about a person and a garda could vouch for the person. They knew the people because they had stood in their kitchens. Now it is all bureaucracy and people must wait six months for Garda vetting. It is crippling employers and community organisations and is devastating to participants. Then, they are vetted by people who have never heard of them and know nothing about them. We need to address that point because this is a case of ticking boxes and is useless.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445"> I do not mind Garda vetting because we have to have it in child care, which I am involved in. If a man is sweeping the streets on a community employment scheme, three years later they might ask why he did not disclose that he had a conviction for drink-driving, even though he did so.</p>

          <p eId="para_1477">I propose to share time with Deputies Padraigh Mac Lochlainn, Michael Colreavy, Sandra McLellan and Seán Crowe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1478"> I want to give a voice to the many skilled workers left on the dole queues, the full-time workers reduced to part-time hours and those forced to leave the country out of economic necessity. They are a generation sadly lost to a nation. The Government has made much of the state of the economy it inherited from the previous Administration and there is no doubt the years of the Fianna Fáil Government were an economic disaster. No one on this side of the House will argue with that. The massive job losses from 2007 to 2009 are clearly the outworking of the economic failure of Fianna Fáil policy. However, continued high levels of unemployment are no longer the symptom of a contracting economy. High levels of unemployment are now the cause of continued economic stagnation. An economy cannot grow and deal with the deficit or deliver first-class public services needed while several hundred thousand of our citizens are unemployed. Over 80,000 potential workers emigrate every year. Our families and our communities cannot afford the cost of unemployment yet the Government continues to follow the failed policies of the previous Administration while expecting a different result.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479"> Last week the Government celebrated two years in office, having promised that jobs would be its first priority. After two years of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government, unemployment is still at the same levels as the last six months of the Fianna Fáil Administration. Some Ministers claimed the Government had brought stability to levels of unemployment. Stability of unemployment is not, nor should it be, a boast. Hitting the bottom and staying there is not a legacy of which any Government should be proud. The Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, said last week that jobs was the first thing on his mind when he woke up every day. This comes from a Minister in a Government that has no issue with shedding 30,000 public sector jobs. These are posts for gardaí, nurses, teachers and doctors. If it took place in any other sector, there would be a call to action against the employer. Last year, the Taoiseach announced the Government would support 100,000 net jobs in the economy by 2016. Last year the economy lost 12,800 full-time jobs. We are further away from the figure announced by the Taoiseach last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480"> Over the past two years there have been significant changes in the labour market. We have seen the erosion of workers' rights, the loss of hours for workers, an increase in long-term unemployment, an increase in emigration and some of the highest rates of youth unemployment in Europe. The Government has not made good on its promise to deliver jobs and that is not surprising when following the policies of Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481"> Job creation is not the first priority for the Government. The strategy of this Government is to sort out the banks, keep Europe happy and hope it all turns out okay. The strategy of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is to take one for the team in Europe. In doing so, communities, families and the unemployed are viewed as collateral damage. All the while, unemployment and emigration continues and the debt issue remains unresolved. There seems to be an acceptable level of unemployment and an acceptable level of emigration for this Government and that is fundamentally wrong. It is wrong for our people and wrong for our economy. The failure of the macroeconomic policy is replicated in the contradictory policies of various Departments. The Department Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation wants to promote the SME sector yet the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is doing its best to cut the sector out of Government contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1482"> In my brief, education, we hear a lot from the Government about a knowledge-based, smart economy that is supposedly based on a well-resourced education system that is flexible enough to produce students with the skills to prosper in an ever-evolving economy. However, the Government is failing in its aim because all of the rhetoric about a knowledge-based economy is undermined by countless cuts being implemented across the education sector. Last year, for example, over 1,000 workers were recruited from abroad to fill IT jobs because employers in the State could not find enough suitable home grown candidates. The number of workers hired from outside the EU has almost doubled in the past year and it is estimated a quarter of all new IT jobs are filled by people recruited from abroad. The growing skills shortage comes when over 434,000 people are on the dole queues yet the Government is trying to entice workers to take up technology careers through conversion courses. The Government is failing to empower citizens and open up new opportunities for them through education because it lacks the vision, implemented in other EU states in recession, to ring-fence funding for education initiatives that can make a real difference. Cuts imposed on the education sector have for example, resulted in the loss of the modern languages initiative, language support services, educational resources for Traveller children and increases in the pupil-teacher ratio in PLC courses, which will lead to a reduction in the type of courses that can be offered. Also, we will lose specialised teachers in the further education sector. These are the specialised teachers we should nurture and rely upon to educate the next generation of the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1483"> Unlike the Government, the starting point for Sinn Féin is jobs. Getting our people back to work will grow the economy and tackle the deficit. It is about investing smartly and investing to get our people back to work and to enhance the competitiveness of the economy. Despite the resilience of our homegrown business sector, the private sector cannot make the investment necessary and at a scale to deliver a substantive impact on unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1484">Prior to the budget we produced a jobs strategy document with proposals to provide for a €13 billion investment in projects that would create up to 156,000 jobs and sustain employment. They included investments in broadband, transport, infrastructural, school, regeneration, green technology and sustainable energy projects. The strategy document also included initiatives to tackle the barriers to competitiveness such as ending upward only rent reviews, developing progressive commercial rates and tackling regional disparities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1485"> I am not for one minute suggesting we on this side of the House have all the answers in tackling unemployment, but if we consider countries such as the United States, it is clear that investment in a stimulus programme is required to sustain and promote employment. The latest figures from the United States demonstrate that there has been welcome growth as a result of investment in a stimulus programme. That, in turn, will impact on its deficit and generate spending in its domestic economy. It is clear that a new approach and strategy is required from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1486"> Last week Mr. Jack O'Connor spoke at a Sinn Féin conference marking the anniversary of the Dublin Lock-out and used the opportunity presented to call for an alternative to austerity. The alternative to austerity is not further austerity but investment. It is about getting people back to work and resolving the issue of the deficit through generating growth. The alternative is investing in the wealth of the people for their betterment. It is not about continuing the policy of Fianna Fáil in handing that wealth to bankers and bondholders. I urge the Government to stop the spin. I also urge it to recognise that in boxing off the bankers, to describe it in those terms, hoping for growth is definitely not a strategy. I urge it to begin in earnest investing fully in the people and business in order that we can get people back to work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1487">I had hoped to have an opportunity to discuss the unemployment crisis in County Donegal with the Minister at an earlier stage last year, but his colleague, the Minister of State, took the debate on that occasion. I will take this opportunity to take the Minister through the history of the unemployment crisis in County Donegal as the crisis is not. As he will recall, the Fruit of the Loom textile industry collapsed in County Donegal and the signs of its decline were evident in the late 1990s. It finally collapsed in the early 2000s. An employment task force was established by the then Government to address the crisis caused not only by the collapse of Fruit of the Loom but also the collapse off the entire textile industry in the region. Definite job creation targets were put in place in the next seven years that would have amounted to a net gain of approximately 6,000 jobs. That was the scale of what was required to allow County Donegal to start to catch up with the then employment levels across the State. After a period of almost seven years, however, there was no real progress. Unemployment levels in the county were still at or around 14% to 15% which at the time were almost four times the national average. An interdepartmental group was set up to work across all Departments as there was a unique job creation challenge in County Donegal. As we approached the late 2000s, some 8,300 people were unemployed in the county, a large number of people equating to an unemployment level of 14%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1488"> The level of unemployment in County Donegal today is 28%, which means approximately 23,000 people are out of full-time employment. This presents a profound crisis in the county. Donegal is a county with natural entrepreneurs, people who want to work if they were given the chance to do so. In that respect, there are one or two examples. Primerica stands out as a solid example of what the workforce in County Donegal has to offer, if given the chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1489"> I will give the Minister some shocking statistics. I remind him that while unemployment levels are bad throughout the country, the unemployment levels in County Donegal are the highest in the State by a mile, while the youth unemployment rate is almost at 50%. I will cite statistics for last year for the job creation agencies. In the case of Enterprise Ireland, there were 129 net job losses in County Donegal. The number of site visits by IDA Ireland in the county in 2012 was zero, despite the crisis we face in the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_1490"> As the Minister will be aware, IDA Ireland was to ensure 50% of jobs would be created outside the major cities of Dublin and Cork. However, outside of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and County Louth, the percentage of jobs attracted to rural Ireland, including my county of Donegal, which has approximately 50% of the population was 2.5% of the overall number of jobs attracted to the country. I commend IDA Ireland for its work. When I was my party's spokesperson on foreign affairs and trade, I had the opportunity to see for myself in the United States the reputation it had earned and the work it did there, but it is not attracting jobs to the regions. I note in the Minister's latest plan that he has apparently scrapped the 50% target. How can he stand over this? How could he go on a Donegal radio station or visit the county and tell the people there that the Government has its finger on the pulse and that he is aware of the extent of the crisis?</p>
          <p eId="para_1491"> As the Minister knows, there are solutions. He does not need to listen to Sinn Féin in this respect. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and every Nobel Prize winning economist would tell him that we need to reverse the insanity of only having austerity policies. There are billions of euro in the National Pensions Reserve Fund; there is also the European Investment Bank and there are pension funds in Ireland. Therefore, there are resources that could be deployed. People must be given hope. As a representative of the people of Donegal, the level of unemployment in the county has gone from bad to worse. People there want to work and the Government must meet them half way. It must attract investment into the regions and assist employers to keep employees in work. We have given the Minister a range of proposals which we have presented in our jobs plan. I have given him the figures for my county and they are indefensible. His colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, has joined him. I addressed the Minister of State last year and brought these numbers to his attention. The Minister knows the wider issues involved. I cannot stand here and not directly bring to his attention the scale of the crisis in County Donegal and the failure of the job creation agencies and the Government to address it. He must give the people of the county some hope. I, therefore, ask him to take on board what I have said.</p>

          <p eId="para_1492">There are 428,000 people in this nation unemployed, while countless tens of thousands are under-employed. Most of the unemployed have been unemployed for 12 months or longer. Younger people now account for a figure of between 27% and 33% of the unemployed, depending on the way it is calculated. There is this level of unemployment, despite the fact that since the Government came to power 167,000 Irish people have emigrated and tens of thousands continue to emigrate each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493">More than 240,000 jobs have been lost in the Irish economy since 2006, with the majority of these losses incurring in 2008 and 2009. Over the past year 30,000 jobs have been lost in the public service, including nursing, medical, teaching and clerical and administrative posts. Many public service workers who had been working full-time are now working part-time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494"> Any examination of the statistics on unemployment and job creation shows huge regional imbalances. Rural Ireland has been particularly neglected. Although 49% of the population live outside the cities, rural areas received only 2.4% of jobs created. Whole communities in rural areas are being shut down by neglect, job losses, emigration and reductions in public services through both the closure of facilities and service level reductions. Is it a deliberate plan of this Government to concentrate the Irish population into already overcrowded cities and major towns? It is all very well to blame the last Government for all of this, but last year in Cavan the IDA and Enterprise Ireland between them created 134 new jobs, while 39 were created in Donegal. Leitrim lost 113 jobs and 187 jobs were created in Sligo. What a result for the west and north west in 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_1495"> Before the election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised that jobs would be their first priority. Emigration would be stopped, jobs would be protected and created, and unemployment levels would decrease. This has not happened and is not happening. It is not happening in Cavan, Donegal, Sligo or Leitrim. It is not happening nationally because the parties in Government - just like their predecessors - continue to focus their energies and taxpayers' money on managing the banking and sovereign debt and hoping that magically something will happen to create jobs. How many times must it be said that we cannot fix the national economy by taking ever more money from the pockets of the very people who sustain our local economies before this Government listens and understands? We cannot contribute to fixing the EU economy and banking system by destroying our national economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496"> Politics is about choices, and leadership means bringing about the changes necessary to reach the chosen destinations. Sinn Féin has pointed out that there is a different, better way. We have shown during the debate leading to the 2013 budget that there is a way to achieve the fiscal targets set by Government, but a fairer, sustainable way that gives hope to people in despair, that spreads the burden of adjustment more evenly, and that recognises that the ordinary people of this country should no longer have to suffer because of the failures of others - including, or perhaps particularly, the failures of those in political leadership who made the disastrous decisions that led to the economic ruination of this nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1497"> I remind the Minister, the Minister of State and Deputies in the Government parties - and those in the party that was previously in government who might be listening in, because they are not here - of a very simple question put to me by a member of the public at a recent meeting in Carrick-on-Shannon: how is it that we have allowed ourselves be brought to a state in which the people fear the Government, rather than the Government fearing the people? I remind the Minister that 2016 is coming fast.</p>

          <p eId="para_1498">Most people would accept that the unemployment crisis is getting worse. It does not give us any joy to come in here and talk about the difficulties facing people who are unemployed. No one receiving €188 a week wants to be in that situation. Most of the people I have spoken to in my constituency do not want to face the prospect of not getting a job. We have wronged these people, because they were promised change. They are constantly being told that their situation is a priority, but we have not seen it being dealt with. That is how we wrong those people daily. One of the difficulties for most of the people I talk to about unemployment is the lack of hope. That is the crisis. People eagerly turn on their televisions or listen to their radios and hear people talking about this or that coming down the track, but the next week - or the month after, or six months after - they are in the same situation. The constituency I represent has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the country, like that of my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn from Donegal. That is not the fault of the people who live in that area. We have two Ministers and a backbench Deputy in the area but the jobs are not being delivered. In all the years I have been active in the area I have not heard anyone talk about getting a crisis management group together to see what they can do for jobs in the area. The Government is not putting forward any plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1499"> The Government promised change and said it would revitalise the economy, repeatedly stating that job creation was one of the main priorities. Despite this, it is quite obvious that the process of austerity and debt repayment is its main priority, not jobs. We have not seen the promised 100,000 jobs. The Government has pursued cutbacks and austerity policies with such conviction that over the past year 30,000 jobs have been lost in the public sector, including those of nurses, doctors and teachers. Economic growth has been minuscule and the unemployment crisis has deepened. If job creation is the Government's number one priority, why is it that emigration and the resilience of some of our SMEs have had a bigger impact in reducing unemployment rates than the Government's policy? It is a damning indictment of its performance to date. Most people would accept that the Government has failed to address the scale of the problem facing our people and to invest in job creation. It does not make sense to people that we are not using the funding available in the National Pensions Reserve Fund as a stimulus package for jobs. It does not add up. That money was supposed to be put aside for a rainy day. We have had winters, not just rainy days, over the past few years, yet the Government in its wisdom has decided not to invest the money in a job stimulus package.</p>
          <p eId="para_1500"> Jobs should be the Government's number one priority. Getting people back to work will reduce the deficit, sustain public services and contribute to resolving the debt issue. We have seen unemployment get worse and worse. State employers need to respect the rights of workers. The Government has criticised employers such as Vita Cortex for the growing trend of leaving workers in the cold, but the workers in IBRC were given an agreement on a redundancy package and now the State, through its new legislation, is walking away from that agreement. We cannot give out to employers in the private sector and at the same time turn our backs on workers. If nothing else comes out of this debate, the Minister might at least examine that area. We are tabling this motion on a positive basis. We want to get a discussion going on unemployment.</p>

        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_461">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1501">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion brought before the House by Sinn Féin. The issue of job creation is arguably one of the most pressing and important challenges that we as elected representatives face. In simple terms, people need work if they are to feed their families and put a roof over their heads. Work or employment gives people the material means to engage actively with all that society has to offer and to lead full and meaningful lives. In psychological terms, work or employment is a key determinant in a person's ability to maintain good mental health, a sense of self-esteem, pride and self-worth. Society places a high value on work and employment and one's identity and societal status is often determined by one's occupation or profession. At a more fundamental level, employment has a significant impact on one's socio-economic status and class position. This position will in turn determine access to life chances, social utilities, education, health etc. In other words, to engage in the many societal strands that give meaning to life in contemporary Ireland, one has to have work, employment, a job - call it what one wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502"> The reality is that almost 500,000 of our people are now out of work while thousands more have emigrated. The end result of this is that we now have a society that aptly fits the dictum of the haves and the have-nots. At one level we still see restaurants and bars in affluent and prosperous areas full of people who can afford to eat out on a night in the middle of the week. These are the very same people who shop for luxury goods in exclusive stores in our major cities. The other side of this coin is that children, lone parents, the working poor and people dependent on social transfers are now more than ever at risk of living in consistent poverty. Put another way, where one is located on the employment ladder, or if they are even on the ladder, will now more than ever determine their class position and the manner in which they will live their lives, be they adults or children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1503"> We now have clear fault lines developing around socio-economic class in society. If we have even the faintest of concerns about issues of social cohesion, societal well-being and, dare I say, social justice then we cannot ignore such fractures. It is now a historical fact that the policies and actions of successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments played a major role in destroying the economic and employment infrastructure of our country. No matter how much Deputy Martin and his colleagues may try to disguise and ignore this fact, the record is clear. Fianna Fáil, Deputy Martin, Senator Thomas Byrne and others played Russian roulette with the lives and futures of hundreds of thousands of Irish men, women and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1504"> Fine Gael and Labour's response to the maelstrom has been nothing short of disastrous in that they too have decided to continue along the same lines as the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government. Clearly for all three parties, Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil, austerity is the only game in town. If by some misfortune one happens to be unlucky enough to lose one's job, or to be a child in a household experiencing unemployment, or to be one of the disabled or working poor, then tough because this Government does not really care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505"> This profound lack of human empathy and political acumen is clearly evident in the Government's recently launched Action Plan for Jobs 2013. The plan is to create 100,000 new jobs by 2016 and to provide credit to the small and medium-sized, SME, enterprise sector. The information technology, IT, sector and new industries will be the subject of renewed focus while the long-term unemployed are to be offered a range of incentives to upskill with the aim of finding work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506"> There are several problems with the plan, however. First, it makes no mention of annual targets for a net increase in jobs or a reduction in unemployment rates for this year. This is shocking given that almost 500,000 people are now out of work. What does the Government expect them to do? Flaky policies, procrastination and false hope do not put food on the table or help people to pay the mortgage. In the plan, the Government also gives an undertaking to commission research, monitor bank lending to SMEs and so on. These are actions that any government worth its salt would be doing as a matter of course.</p>
          <p eId="para_1507"> Moreover, if one were foolish enough to believe the Government's spin around employment, then perhaps there might be reason to be optimistic. The reality, however, is far bleaker than Fine Gael and Labour would have us believe. For example, according to the coalition, its actions have resulted in the stabilisation of unemployment. In the real world, we know that levels of unemployment reached the bottom six months before the current Government came into power. Since then it has been virtually static even in the face of ever increasing emigration. Even more alarming is the fact that since the launch of the action plan, there has been a loss of 12,800 full-time jobs and a gain of 14,000 part-time jobs. Added to this, in the past year 9,100 jobs in the public sector have been lost. The bottom line is that since the announcement of the plan, 4,300 jobs have been lost and we are further away from the 100,000 target net jobs than at the start of the initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1508"> More fundamentally, if we look at the structure of the labour market what we see is a worrying growth in low-paid, part-time, non-unionised labour which is primarily concentrated in the services sector. Meanwhile workers in construction, industry and agriculture have borne the brunt of the collapse of the economy. As if the collapse in the economy and the restructuring of the labour market were not enough, the policies of austerity that are being relentlessly and blindly enacted by the Government have led to a process of acute regional uneven development and the growth of a surplus population that has no work and few prospects. It is as if the Government is, to paraphrase Reginald Maudling, happy or content to live with an acceptable level of unemployment and emigration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1509"> All the while we see, according to the Central Statistics Office, an increase in levels of child poverty and in the numbers of people living in consistent poverty. We now live in a State where the Government thinks it is acceptable to cut mobility allowances for disabled people and to cut the working hours of thousands of home helps. All of this is done under the mantra of austerity. Meanwhile, 60% of the unemployed have been out of work for 24 months or more with all the evidence suggesting this pattern will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510"> The Sinn Féin jobs document provides a clear alternative to the false projections in the coalition's jobs plan. There are choices and austerity is not one of them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1547">I thank Sinn Féin for raising this important debate but I am disappointed with its Members' input so far. I listened to five speakers but there was not one mention of enterprise, building new export markets, creating access to finance for small business to build on, how we need to be more competitive, how we drive innovation in our businesses or how we can grow successful businesses that can win new markets. Neither was there one mention of the new sectors which will drive the future economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1548"> Instead, what I heard was a call to employ an additional 30,000 in the public service and spend €13 billion on a stimulus fund. Rebuilding our economy is not about finding new ways of spending moneys we do not have or recruiting people on to the public payroll who have to be paid from taxpayers' money. That is the very problem we inherited, namely of an economy built on free-flowing public spending, a property boom and a destruction of enterprise, export markets and innovation. That is the shift we have to make. No one ever said this was going to be an arithmetic exercise with 20,000 jobs created in year one and so many in year two.</p>
          <p eId="para_1549">That is not the way economies work. We need to rebuild a completely devastated economy. It is as if there has been an earthquake and many of the foundations have been rocked to the core. Banking and the public finances have been broken beyond all recognition. Employment is a major issue as Sinn Féin has rightly noted. Some 90,000 jobs per year were being lost in the economy. We cannot turn that around by a simple stroke of the pen. We inherited an economy spending 50% more than it was collecting in revenue. That was the economy we inherited but we cannot solve that by agreeing to spend even more or by raising €13 billion from somewhere or by taking on more public servants. That would simply make the hole bigger.</p>
          <p eId="para_1550"> Sinn Féin does not seem to recall that as a nation we were unable to borrow anywhere at one stage. The only people we could borrow from were those in the troika, which set conditions because we were effectively bankrupt as a nation. That is the economy we inherited and that is the economy we must fix. There is no point in being naive about the solution. It is not a case of back to freewheeling spending in the construction sector or freewheeling spending on new public services. Would that it were that simple but it is not; it is about rebuilding an economy that has been shattered. It must be built on enterprise, innovation, winning new export markets and building strong, successful companies that can carve out those markets and they must be predominantly Irish businesses. We are fortunate to have overseas investment but we need to build a strong indigenous engine of growth that can develop from our own ingenuity and skills base. That is the ambition. Addressing this will require and has required considerable changes in the way we conduct our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1551"> It is a pity Deputy Jonathan O'Brien is not here now because he used a phrase to the effect that we are continuing with the failed policies of the previous Government, but nothing could be further from the truth. We have determined that we will not build over the same fault lines that destroyed our economy, the fault lines of freewheeling debt, a construction sector that was too big and selling houses to one another at ever-inflated prices. That is not the economy we intend to build; we are going to build a different economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1552"> We have had to do things which for many were unthinkable. The first thing we did was renegotiate the deal with the EU and the IMF. I have listened to speaker after speaker from Sinn Féin pretending that in some way we have been saving bankers but the bankers got wiped out. Anyone who had shares in the banks lost virtually everything and bondholders have had to stump up €15 billion. One could argue that the credit guarantee given by the previous Government exposed the Irish taxpayer and naturally it did, but the job of this Government has been to redress that. We have renegotiated the interest rate on the bonds, which was worth €10 billion. Now, we have renegotiated the promissory note which will mean we need not go into the market to raise €20 billion. Now, as a sovereign State, we can borrow in the open market at reasonable rates of interest again. This effort has involved considerable rebuilding and it has taken great deal of work to fix our public finances and fix the way our banks have behaved. It has involved a good deal of work but we have made real progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1553"> I recognise that Sinn Féin is, rightly, impatient for employment and I am impatient for it as well. That is the job I and the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, get up to do every day of the week. We are trying to promote more job opportunities in the country, whether for small or big enterprises, whether they are foreign-owned or domestic. That is what drives us. However, to do that requires fixing things that were broken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1554"> Some Sinn Féin speakers referred to the need to use the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the European Investment Bank money and they are correct but I did not hear any reference to the fact that we are using EIB money to fund a stimulus package and PPPs. I heard no mention of the fact that the National Pensions Reserve Fund is now putting money into funds to drive and small and medium enterprises. Some €2.5 billion worth of new money is going in to fund small and medium enterprises and this is completely aside from the banking sector. This money is being generated by the State's ingenuity. The process involves coming up with new models that can help to fund business. It is using money in a creative and sustainable way rather than spending it today such that it is gone tomorrow. We are putting it into funds that can build strong enterprises that will drive our future. That is what we are doing and that is what stimulus means. That is the way to stimulate the economy, which we must rebuild properly rather than simply indulge in freewheeling spending. It must involve the smart use of public funds, infrastructure funds, small and medium enterprise equity funds and restructuring funds for small businesses which have got into trouble and need fresh equity. That is the route we must travel and we must work to develop strong enterprises which can recreate all our communities rather than only some of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1555"> We have also had to focus on restoring competitiveness and rebuilding our export potential. We spend a good deal of time on trade missions, relentlessly supporting good Irish companies which are trying to win new markets. We are opening up those new markets. Let us consider the work of Enterprise Ireland and the structure of Irish-owned companies and where they are selling. The United Kingdom is diminishing in importance because we are now carving out new markets whether in Canada or the United States. This week I was in Texas and the south-eastern states of the United States. These are new strong growth markets where we can bring innovative companies and win fresh business. That is the route we are travelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1556"> We must reorient our welfare services as well and the work of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is decidedly important in changing the notion that our welfare services are about insisting that people be idle in order to get paid. She is reorienting the whole system with an emphasis on helping to develop people. She has introduced schemes, including JobBridge and the momentum scheme, which also involves the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and the Springboard initiative, which I heard Deputy Jonathan O'Brien speak about disparagingly. These are real schemes to help re-skill people who perhaps committed themselves to the construction sector and related sectors. They will allow these people to re-skill and enter into the new employment areas and we are seeing these new employment areas beginning to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_1557"> Let us consider what our plan is delivering. The IDA has had its best years in a decade in the past two years, one has been better than the other. Enterprise Ireland has had its best year in more than five years. Sinn Féin speakers quoted from the quarterly national household survey but they overlooked the fact that the past two quarters have seen employment growth for the first time in five years. Sinn Féin speakers overlooked the fact that the private sector is expanding and has been for 15 months. We are seeing the results of slowly creating a new environment whereby businesses can win new export markets and we must continue with that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1558"> We have ambitions and the work we did last year has been helpful in this regard. The Action Plan for Jobs saw a new approach. Sinn Féin maintains we are not making jobs a priority but we are. Every Department has committed to actions to make it easier for businesses to create jobs, whether the Department of Finance and the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, with his small business package in the budget or the Department of Health and the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, with the health innovation hub, which is designed to take innovative companies and get them to embed within our hospital system. All these initiatives are contributing to the changes that we must make. We have brought in initiatives relating to micro-finance and temporary loan guarantees. These are new ways of trying to deal with the problems that companies face. We have introduced a first-time exporters division to take companies which had never looked abroad but which, given the constrained domestic economy, must carve out new markets. We are helping them to make steps into those new markets and helping them to fund the process. That is the route we must travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1559"> It is disheartening that there is no understanding of what needs to happen to change our economy among the Sinn Féin speakers. It will not be simply about finding new ways to spend public money; that is not the solution. The nation is still spending one third more than it collects in tax revenue. That is the sad truth and we must continue to correct and deal with these problems. The way to deal with these problems is to build strong enterprises that take people on and open up new opportunities. I believe the Action Plan for Jobs was a success last year. It was not a dramatic success but a real success. We delivered more than 90% of the actions we took on. We brought in the type of innovations to which I have referred. Now, we want to build on that. We will be more ambitious in 2013. We have carved out areas where we believe there is real opportunity. The JobsPlus scheme being introduced by the Department of Social Protection is a recognition that we need to do something special to encourage employers to take on the long-term unemployed, to which Sinn Féin speakers have adverted. It involves a simple subsidy of €75 per week to take on someone who is 12 months out of work, or €100 per week for someone who is two years out of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560">That is a solid proposal which favours the people Sinn Féin rightly argues have been displaced and damaged by this recession. We are trying to give a leg up to people who are in that category. That is the purpose of the recently launched Momentum scheme which mixes on the job skills with off the job training. That is innovative thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1561"> The development capital fund which we launched last year is aimed at companies which are basically sound but have weak balance sheets and require capital to expand into new markets. We are putting in place a fund with private sector leverage so that we can get more out of it. We put forward €50 million and are leveraging it up to €200 million. That is the sort of smart thinking required from us in the context of limited resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1562"> There are real opportunities in practical areas, such as reforming licensing in the retail sector. The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is committed to simplifying the way in which business is done and making it easier so that people do not have to comply with 25 different licences when they want to open a retail store. The action plan for jobs tries to carve out new niches. There are opportunities in big data and in the green sector. We are doubling the ICT skills base in the coming years and offering conversion courses in areas of real opportunity. We can green our buildings by developing higher standards of energy efficiency while employing people in the process. This is an innovative approach. I acknowledge it may involve a lot of small proposals but we never said there would be a big bang.</p>
          <p eId="para_1563"> The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is making our research expenditure more forensic by focusing on areas in which we can add value and create opportunities for our businesses. The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is introducing a one-stop-shop through which small businesses can find out the supports on offer from the State. These practical measures are not as glamorous as announcing a €13 billion fund but we cannot play in that arena. We have to rebuild brick by brick, starting with a solid foundation for strong enterprises which export and are innovative. One would be proud to accompany Irish companies to Texas, China or India because of the quality of our people and the companies they are building. We have pledged to row in behind them. God willing, we will deliver on our targets. If we fail it will not be for the lack of commitment because we are putting all our efforts into achieving them. We are open to new ideas. One of the features of the action plan for jobs is that every year is a new year and when ideas spring up we will seek to adapt them. Today we announced the bringing in of industrial partners to help us drive those new ideas. That is the route to reforming our economy, rebuilding our society and creating opportunities for our people. I know the Deputies opposite genuinely crave that change as much as we do.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy John Perry)<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1564">I commend the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on the great advancements he has made. This is an uphill struggle but we cannot respond with negativity all the time. I have toured the country to meet business people and employers. Yesterday I was in New York where I met 20 Enterprise Ireland companies which left this country as part of the wave of emigration and are bringing people from Ireland to Irish-American companies. These are bright, new and intellectual companies which are doing exceptionally well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1565"> This Government has considerable respect for the role played by small businesses. We still have 1.8 million people at work. We have no fear of 2016 because we understand it is a question of creating jobs, cutting red tape and improving access to finance. The business sections of today's newspapers reported that banks in Northern Ireland are not giving money to business people. There is massive emigration from Northern Ireland and the unemployment rate there is high. There is no point in the Deputies opposite saying they have all the answers or the policies when they are part of a Government in Northern Ireland which is presiding over high rates of emigration and banks that are not supporting SMEs. Deputy Colreavy and I share a Border constituency. It is important when we speak about job potential that we tell it as it is. We must be positive. Business people want confidence and credit in the economy. They do not want constant pessimism. When we go abroad we see the capability of Irish companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1566"> The Government is working on the issue of access to finance. The banks have been recapitalised. We have developed microfinance schemes and loan guarantee schemes. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has dealt with these issues. We are cutting the cost of business by reducing the administrative burden. I am working to reduce the current 50 licences required for retail operations and plan to establish one national body by the end of the year. Tomorrow morning I will chair the high level group on business regulation. We are cutting red tape and the cost of doing business. That will make a real change. We are also working to reduce legal, insurance and energy costs. People can reclaim VAT. On upward only rent reviews, a code of conduct has been drawn up for NAMA properties. Rents have dramatically decreased in the NAMA property area. All around the country rents are being reviewed downwards because it is better to get some rent than to have an empty unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1567"> I am amazed at the commitment on display from Enterprise Ireland. Earlier today I received a call from a company in Spiddal which has taken on additional staff with the support of an Enterprise Ireland investment fund. How many Sinn Féin Deputies go into factories to meet their proprietors? I also got a call from a company in Sligo with greatly enhanced potential. Go into the companies to meet the operators and staff. Last week I was in the Mansion House. It was a tonic to see high potential start-up companies doing extraordinary things. These are the people we should be discussing instead of coming out with negativity. We have 1.8 million people working and people do not want this negativity. The last several years have all been negative. We want the positive. One positive leads to another positive. It is about getting people spending for Ireland. We have consumers who want to shop in the community but there are negative stories about pessimism. Certainly there are people who are unemployed but our job is to get them back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1568"> The one-stop-shop for business will be rolled out in every county to deal with mentoring, administrative, banking and legal costs, loan guarantees and microfinance. The banks are engaging with the Credit Review Office. If people are refused credit they can appeal the decision but banks are not going to give money to a proposal if it is not viable. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is working tirelessly to get foreign direct investment. He returned from Texas this morning and has been working all day. He is still on a mission in terms of meeting foreign direct investors. Barry O'Leary is attracting foreign direct investment. It is an uphill struggle but we are only 100 weeks in Government. Miracles take a while longer and Deputies are wrong to assume they will get to the top of the hill simply by entering Government. We are not taking over the policies of Fianna Fáil in any sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1569"> Cross-Border economic development is close to Sinn Féin's heart. I visited Newry last week with InterTrade Ireland. There is close cross-Border co-operation with Northern Ireland companies in the South. InterTrade Ireland is the best cross-Border body of them all. The Sinn Féin Deputies should meet its CEO and the companies it supports. I met a host of companies from the South and the North. The Opposition is spinning the motion to suggest it is all negative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1570">The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, mentioned Springboard, the ICT action plan, the Momentum plan, the Youth Guarantee for those under 25 years, JobBridge, Intreo - a fantastic concept - and emigration. Emigration from Ireland is not forced. I found the people whom I met in New York and Philadelphia a tonic. I met some of Deputy Michael Colreavy's colleagues there also. I found it a sheer pleasure to meet Irish people who were there legally working in companies. Over 88,000 jobs have been created in the United States by Irish companies and jobs are also being created in Europe. We no longer live on an isolated island. Ireland is part of Europe in which there 23 million SMEs. Ireland is not just a small village and this is not the Ireland of 30 years ago. Ireland has a population of 4.5 million and 98% of what we produce is exported. A report issued last week indicated the value of our exports last year was €193 billion. Therefore, it is not all bad news.</p>
          <p eId="para_1571"> I get annoyed when Sinn Féin tables a motion such as this because it does not stack up in any way, not for the people I meet who are confident business people who see a bright future for Ireland and believe in job creation. Our job in government is to promote them. The backbone of the economy is small business, in which we are making a massive capital investment, as stated by the Minister. This investment is being made by non-banking sources, but we are also dealing with the banks. The Taoiseach and the Minister are meeting the banks to discuss the loan guarantee. We are not being fobbed off by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1572"> Sinn Féin needs to examine seriously its own policies. It should not come down here to say this is what it is doing in opposition, when where it is in government it is not doing anything. In Northern Ireland there is massive unemployment and masses of people are leaving. Sinn Féin should not think it has the answers for here when it does not have them in Northern Ireland where it is certainly not providing them. It should state the facts. I know the situation only too well. I visit Enniskillen frequently and other areas across the Border and know exactly what is going on. Sinn Féin is in joint government in Northern Ireland and does not have a magic wand. The matter is not as simple as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1573"> Ireland holds the EU Presidency and will host the Competitiveness Council meeting in May at which it will deal with the issue of SMEs internationally and the issue of access to credit. While we welcome Sinn Féin's sentiments in this regard, it has come up with some very poor arguments. Where is its plan? It is a voodoo plan and does not stack up. If we ran with it, the country would be totally bankrupt. It suggests we borrow to employ more State employees when the objective is to cut costs and get people back to work. That is what we are doing and we will succeed. We will have our job done by 2016, by which time we will have Ireland back working again and recognised in Europe. I am very happy to support the Minister on this issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnLyonsLab" eId="spk_466">
          <from>Deputy John Lyons<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1574">The Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, has expressed his frustration at the motion and I feel the same way. I was watching the debate on the monitor before coming to the House and could only wonder what was the purpose of the Sinn Féin motion, apart from kicking the Government in an opportunistic way, as Opposition parties do. I can see no other reason for it. With no disrespect to Deputy Dara Calleary, the only part of the motion with which I can agree is that the mismanagement of the previous Government was horrendous. It would drive anybody insane delving into what went on that allowed 250,000 jobs - 90,000 or so a year - to be lost. What happened was embarrassing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575"> I would like to refer to two points made by Deputy Sandra McLellan. She described the response of Fine Gael and the Labour Party as disastrous and said we did not care. As a backbencher who works his backside off, like the Minister and Minister of State, I find it incredibly insulting that it is thought the Government does not care. I live in an area in which the people would agree with many of the points made in the motion. I can see poverty and unemployment all around me, in particular youth employment. There are many reasons for this, but the main one is the successive bad decisions taken by the previous Government. If the Government did not care, does Sinn Féin think it would have developed a Youth Guarantee scheme? Does it think the Ministers, Deputies Richard Bruton and Joan Burton, would have been in Brussels last week brokering a €6 billion deal to deal with the biggest issue we face in Ireland and Europe, youth unemployment? Would we be introducing a pilot scheme in Ballymun to give the people about whom Sinn Féin talks the opportunity to upskill in order that they can find jobs for which they are not qualified currently? Would we be implementing social clauses to allow new jobs to be taken up by unemployed persons? Would we introduce the likes of the jobs plus scheme which provides incentives for businesses that cannot afford to take on new workers to encourage them to do so? Would we have developed the JobBridge scheme for people with all of the qualifications theyed need from university but who lacked experience? That scheme has a 52% success rate and within five months of somebody leaving it, the success rate rises to 62%. Deputies might ask about the people who left the JobBridge scheme or were not part of that 62%. When all of the people who had not completed the scheme were asked why, two thirds of them said they had left the scheme to take up a job. If we did not care, we would not develop a Youth Guarantee scheme or social clauses to try to get people back to work and give them the skills they need. We would not develop Springboard or Momentum which is being developed to cater for long-term unemployed persons about whom Sinn Féin says we do not care. If we did not care about them, we would not develop these courses to help them to upskill for the jobs available. We know from private industry that if there were more people with these skills, these industries would come here and invest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1576"> If ours is not a caring Government, why is it doing all of these things? It is insulting and demoralising to hear an Opposition party such as Sinn Féin state the Government is uncaring. I have the height of respect for Deputies Sandra McLellan and Michael Colreavy, but politics are being played tonight. They are pulling a fast one. They are looking for an opportunity to say the Government is not doing a good job, but the facts speak for themselves. We are doing one hell of a good job in the bad times in which we find ourselves. We have brought the country from a place where more people were leaving than we wanted to leave. We are turning the boat around. Some 250,000 people lost their jobs during the term of office of the last Administration. During the past 15 months there was a net increase in jobs of 15,000. Ours is a caring Government. We care about society and the people. That is why we have the Pathways to Work programme and the Action Plan for Jobs, part 2. Given time, these programmes will deliver. We inherited a disastrous situation and are doing the best we can to turn it around. We see the shoots on the ground, but God forbid that an Opposition politician would come here and be honest and admit this. We are making changes for the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_1577"> I have a reason for not believing in Sinn Féin's motion. I stood in the general election in 2011 and all over Ballymun and Finglas I saw on huge billboards promoting Sinn Féin the phrase, "We will reverse the budget cuts". That was what Sinn Féin promised the people, but it is being opportunistic. It knew then that it could not reverse the budget cuts. In its stimulus plan it realises we still need to meet a €3.5 billion deficit. It told the people fibs at the time and has told them fibs constantly since. Tonight, it is telling them again, saying the Government is not doing a good job. It should wake up and join us. It should engage in some constructive criticism, less of the fantasy economics and more of the sound, grounded economics that will give life and dignity to the people about whom we are talking about. The best thing we can do is give them €1 in their pocket and the dignity of work. That is what the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work have been doing and what every Government backbencher, the Minister and the Minister of State have been doing for the past two years. We are trying to turn the economy around to give people a reason to participate in society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_467">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2013-03-12T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1578">Fianna Fáil has also proposed an amendment to the motion. I wonder whether somebody injected gas into the Chamber in the past few minutes, as we have witnessed some passion, which is good. It is the one good thing Sinn Féin has done tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1579">For the last few months, we have been going through the motions when the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has taken parliamentary questions, particularly on the graveyard shift on Thursday evenings. I hope those watching this debate see some passion. </p>
          <p eId="para_1580"> I have enormous respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton. We have just heard a lecture on negativity from the Minister of State. I was in his seat in the last Dáil. I saw what he did and what the Labour Party did every time they got an opportunity as we approached the 2011 general election. There was no question of them putting on the green jersey. The same business people were doing the same wonderful work abroad. I commend the Minister, who is just back from Texas, and the Minister of State, who was in New York, on attending tonight's debate. The same business people were doing the exact same work. The same brilliant companies were doing wonderful work. The same high potential start-up companies were doing a great deal of really good work then as well. They had to deal with two parties that were determined to get into government and were prepared to say anything to that end, even if it involved talking this country down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1581"> That is why I am a little sceptical of what the Minister of State said about negativity. I believe in the Minister and the Minister of State. I believe in the quality of our people, our agencies and their staff. I had the honour of working with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and enterprise boards the length and breadth of this country. I am familiar with the excellent work they do with companies to get them to accompany Ministers on trips to every corner of the world. It is fantastic that the Government parties have woken up and seen the value of travelling abroad. When they were in opposition, one could not leave the country without one of them giving out about expenses. At one stage, one could not cross the Border without being the subject of a freedom of information request. We need to be out there. I salute them for going abroad to work to sell the message of this country and its companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1582"> The Minister spoke about the Department's key strategies. The last Government and its predecessor laid the foundation for the work the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is doing on the research and development and science sides. The Minister knows that companies did not decide in March 2011 to go to Ireland. The work of IDA Ireland started before that. IDA Ireland is currently building much of its attractiveness on the innovation island platform, which started before March 2011. Its work to expand the existing client base of IDA Ireland companies, encourage research and development and help companies to move up the value chain started long before then. I accept that the Minister has brought some new thinking into the Department and I welcome that. It needed to be reformed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1583"> I welcome the work the Minister has done on retail licensing, the basis of which was a report that was commissioned in 2009. He has done fantastically to take it on board. He has run with the ball. We will have a single portal. However, he knows that the notion he loves to propogate - that the last 14 years were a disaster - is absolutely wrong. The work on many of his policies, including JobBridge and Springboard, was started by Batt O'Keeffe and Mary Coughlan under the previous Government. The reorganisation work that has led to the establishment of Intreo was started by Mary Coughlan in the last Government. I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to stop suggesting that a crock of Fine Gael and Labour Party gold was at the end of the rainbow that came in on 9 March 2011. Much of the work they mentioned started under previous Ministers and Ministers of State in their Department. I absolutely accept that they have added to that work. I am not into slamming them for the sake of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1584"> The difficulty is that the parties which are now in government suggested in advance of the 2011 election that there was an easier way. I remind Deputy Lyons that Sinn Féin was not the only party to do this. The Labour Party, in particular, was not immune from this. They targeted the unemployed, in particular, by saying they would create 100,000 jobs by 2016. The jury is out on that. We will measure it in 2016. We all want to sign up that target. Nobody is happy that 430,000 people are unemployed, some 330,000 of whom are full-time unemployed. Nobody wants such human waste and misery. I have a difficulty with the use of that cohort of people for electoral gain by suggesting to them that there is an easier way. Two years on, nothing major has been done to address their plight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1585"> The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is absolutely right when he suggests that progress will be made by means of a collection of small things. I remind him that not too many small things were contained in his party's five-point plan, which was supposed to bring an end to all suffering and misery across the world. The plan did not apply to Ireland alone. It was going to bring world peace and employment. We did not hear too many small ideas then. The notion that was propagated for a year in advance of the 2011 election campaign and during the campaign itself was that everything would be easier. It has not been easier. The Minister knew it would not be. In fairness to him, he did not sign up to the particular creed to which I refer. The difficulty with the jobs action plans and the big announcements associated with them - we heard that 94% of the ambitions have been achieved - arises when the 330,000 people who are full-time unemployed look at them and ask whether there is something in the plans for them. There is probably something, in fairness, but these people are looking for jobs so they will have the spending power to help their communities. This is the difficulty with the promises, the spin and the hype.</p>
          <p eId="para_1586"> The Minister and the Minister of State spoke passionately about what the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is doing. There is a lot of good stuff going on. My difficulty is that a whole-of-Government approach is missing. I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Burton, is doing some things. The further education colleges are absolutely essential if people who find themselves in a sphere in which their skills are no longer relevant, for whatever reason, are to be upskilled and brought closer to the jobs market. It is ridiculous that we are talking about skills shortages across the economy at a time when 430,000 people are unemployed. It is really wrong that the Department of Education and Skills has cut the ground from under the further education colleges that should be training those who are trying to acquire the skills needed to fill one of these vacancies. As a result of the decision to cut by 500 the number of people employed in these colleges, fewer courses will be available in areas of growth and jobs potential like cloud computing and pharmaceuticals. Many of the colleges in question will not be in a position to offer such courses this year. The options of those who want to upskill are being limited because another Department is acting in a way that is contrary to the spirit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation's action plan for jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1587"> I accept the Minister might be constrained in what he can do about the cuts in the capital programme, but he should look at the way the capital programme is spent. Towards the end of last year, an embarrassing number of Departments came in with an under-spend on their capital budgets. The capital budget is where we get the jobs. It opens the opportunities for employment creation. Estimates come into this House every September, October, November and December, to be agreed on the nod or rushed through committees, in order to reallocate money from capital expenditure to current expenditure. That cannot happen this year. The Minister should send a clear message now, in the third month of the year, that the Department will not send back any capital money. It should be spent and jobs should be created in the process. This is an issue in other Departments too.</p>
          <p eId="para_1588"> The Minister and the Minister of State have both attended meetings of the Joint Commmittee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which is a very good committee. We leave our party jerseys outside the door and try to get around all of these issues. Why are we cutting the legs off many small companies that are involved in procurement? Many schools give business to small local companies. Those companies, in turn, sponsor the school jersey or take out an advertisement in the programme of the school play. They are there all the time. The bizarre procurement rules are being interpreted by someone who is not in the real world of business. Schools want to spend money locally to support local jobs and investment, and possibly get a return for the school, but are unable to do so. The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, could help small businesses by taking this issue on and asking officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform what they are at.</p>

          <p eId="para_1590">If we do not take action, we will cost small suppliers around the country jobs and we will lose businesses. Ultimately, English-based suppliers and stationery companies will benefit. Jobs will be lost and money will leave local economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591"> If the jobs action plans are to mean anything, we will have to move away from the silo way of doing government. I always make this point. I do not mean it in a political way. I welcoming the opening of the silos in the case of the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection. The rest of the silos are still closed, which means Departments are operating in isolation from one another at a time when we have the biggest national crisis on our hands. We need the kind of effort that is currently being made to reorganise our banking system to be made with regard to joblessness and unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1592">We need to know that just over 5,000 extra activation places were created last year, according to CSO figures. I am a fan of JobBridge and I make no apologies for that. I believe the more work experience a person has and the closer he or she is to the labour market, the better the chance that person has of getting a job. Deputy Lyons has given the figures in this regard. However, we need more JobBridge places. There are communities around the country screaming out for CE places because they have worthwhile local projects but they cannot get the places. I know of a group that was willing to sponsor materials and cover the insurance but it could not get the places. I do not believe there has ever been a situation in the history of this country in which there has been such a skilled group of people on the live register, with skills in many sectors that they want to use. They want to gain new skills, but while they are waiting for that, can they not use those skills they have for the development of community and social facilities and in our health and education services? The answer is "No," they cannot, because Department A will not speak to Department B or C to come up with joint programmes to allow that to happen. If a whole-of-government approach is to mean anything, it will mean that silly barriers such as this are torn down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1593"> I welcome the news today of the group appointed by the Minister. It consists of six very impressive people who have given enormous service to this country and who will now be in charge of monitoring the so-called disruptive reforms. Let them disrupt the system of government, which is the most disruptive reform we need, so that these barriers, these silos, are knocked down. Let them not be trapped by the system. I have asked the Minister previously what kind of support will be available to them. Will they be swamped within the big system of government? While I know some of them will not let themselves be swamped, when one gets stuck in quicksand, there are very few ways to get out, no matter how strong one is. It is up to the Minister to protect them. It is up to him to ensure their skills, talents and ambition for this country do not get lost in that system, that they have the chance to be disruptive and that we celebrate the fact that they can be disruptive. The Minister owes it to those six individuals who have had the courage to stand up and put their names to this initiative, and to businesspeople around the country, to ensure this works and to ensure they have the protection they need to avoid being drowned within the system. If they can work, there is hope and there is a chance of job creation. At the end of the day, that is what we are all about. The Minister can have his big PR occasions and the Taoiseach can write articles for <i>The Irish Times</i> on every anniversary of the election of the Government claiming that employment is its number one priority. However, until we start denting those figures, and until the 330,000 people who are depending on this Chamber for a job, or at least for the conditions that create jobs, see that figure going down, we are not getting anywhere. The Government has nobody to blame but itself for creating the expectation that it would do this in the first place.</p>

          <p eId="para_1596">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion. I make no excuse to Deputy Lyons or anybody else for saying this Government does not care. The fact is that if this Government cared, it would stop destroying jobs and creating unemployment in this country. The first thing it would do is to stop the destruction of jobs in the public service, where 30,000 jobs are already gone and another 8,000 jobs are targeted for this year, 4,000 of those in the health service. That is job destruction, not job creation. If this Government cared about job creation it would stop that destruction of jobs, stop throwing those people on the live register and stop creating unemployment. It would start creating employment and allow the State to start creating employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1597"> The private sector has failed under the last Government and under this Government. It is not creating jobs and it will not create jobs. The State will have to get involved in job creation and should have done so long before now. This is because there is a huge investment strike among private industrialists, who are not prepared to create jobs. The Government will simply have to step forward and allow the State to do the job because, as I said, private enterprise has not done it and will not do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1598"> Austerity did not work under the last Government and it is not working under this Government. Extracting billions of euro from the economy did not work under the last Government and is not working under this Government either. As we all know from walking down the main street of any city, town or village in the country, the extraction of billions upon billions of euro from the economy is creating further recession, further closures and further job losses. We see what has happened. It is the policy that was pursued by the last Government and it is the policy pursued by this Government. When they stood in the last election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party said they were going to change things. We were going to have a democratic revolution and it would all be different. Of course, the minute they came to power, they took on the Fianna Fáil-Green Party clothes and implemented austerity and cutbacks. That policy has created an appalling vista, with over 14% of the population, or 430,000 people, unemployed, of whom 60% are long-term unemployed, and 27% of young people unemployed. Last year, 12,800 full-time jobs were lost and 14,000 part-time jobs were created, which means we are effectively standing still. This is an admission that the Government itself simply must get involved in job creation. We need an economic stimulus and economic growth to create jobs. Until we have that, we will simply have huge numbers of people on the dole queues and leaving the country at a rate of 200 per day.</p>

          <p eId="para_1599">I have watched the debate and I compliment the proposers of the motion. I look across at the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry. They have a huge job on their hands and they will have to deal with the bureaucratic system, the red tape and the inertia that exists, which is preventing job creation and driving out the spirit of entrepreneurship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1600"> I took two telephone calls in the last half hour about the Construction Contracts Bill, which was supposed to be introduced this week but is again delayed. I raised that issue in the House the morning Pierse Construction went out of business, with 550 subcontractors left high and dry. These issues must be dealt with, as this is where the jobs are. These are the companies that create jobs, the small employers and subcontractors who will take on people. I looked for tax incentives in the budget and also from the previous Government, although I did not get them, for employers who employ people, for example, to carry out home improvements, so long as they are tax-compliant and have a C2 and so on. The black economy is thriving, sadly, and people do not have jobs. If small businesses took on only one person extra, the dole queues would be halved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1601"> Businesses need to be unshackled from the burdens of the State, such as NERA and the other agencies which go around driving businesses mental. The Minister can smile but he knows what I am talking about. They were needed at the time but they should be converted to a national employer support agency in order to support people in their jobs. They should ask how they can help employers and not come with the cars flying, showing their business cards and badges and threatening employers. Employers must be supported and nurtured. It must be rewarding for people to take up a job and go to work, although not in the black economy. If there is a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, people will work. Employers will not be found wanting if they are allowed to be unshackled, as the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, should know, being a small businessman himself.</p>
