          <p eId="para_1">We all accept and know there is a housing crisis. Despite the Government's best efforts, announcements and plans this crisis is, unfortunately, getting worse rather than better. Research from agencies such as Focus Ireland has confirmed that an overwhelming number of homeless families had their last stable home in the private rental sector. They had to leave those homes as landlords were selling up and an increasing number of property owners do not accept rent supplement. The Government has promised that by July families would no longer be accommodated in hotels. Instead, families are being told that emergency accommodation is not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> Today we learn that 12 families, with 30 children, were told to go to Garda stations on Tuesday night. Three of these families had been evicted recently and they presented to Store Street Garda station, while other families and their children presented to Pearse Street and Clondalkin Garda stations. These families were homeless and evicted when they presented to the Garda stations. The families depend on bed and breakfast accommodation and emergency accommodation on a day-to-day basis. The situation is bad enough but, unfortunately, the events on Tuesday have brought a very negative and extremely worrying turning point. Hundreds of phone calls were made by Focus Ireland to bed and breakfast accommodations and to hotels for the families on Tuesday night. For them, however, there was no room at the inn. Some of the families ended up sleeping rough that night. Mike Allen of Focus Ireland has said that what happened on Tuesday is unprecedented and shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> It is more than three years since Fr. Peter McVerry described the housing crisis as a humanitarian one. There are 61,600 households that qualify for social housing and one in five of those have been on the list for five years. There are more than 60,000 people in severe mortgage distress. Nationwide, there are 7,472 homeless people and this number has now increased by 32% since March 2016. One in three of those who are homeless are children. There are 12,056 families, including 2,563 children, in emergency hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation. In Dublin alone there are 138 rough sleepers. Hotels are now getting busy as the tourism season moves along.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">This has very negative consequences for short-term emergency accommodation provision. Nobody accepts that this is normal, but what is the Government doing to prevent this becoming the norm, as appears to be the case, in how homeless families are dealt with? If hotels are booked out, what plans have been put in place to arrange emergency accommodation? Has more emergency accommodation than is currently available - as we witnessed as recently as last night and Tuesday night - been sought by Dublin City Council on a short-term basis?</p>

        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_2" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_5">The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the response to homelessness on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities, as the Deputy is aware. What happened on Tuesday night is unacceptable. The demand for accommodation experienced on Tuesday night was exceptional. It was out of the ordinary in comparison with the situation in 2017 to date. In regard to what has happened since then, from last night, 24 May, Dublin City Council has more than doubled the volume of emergency contingency capacity that is available to any family that may present in an emergency situation. Clearly, Garda stations are not suitable places for families to be directed to in any circumstances. There is now additional emergency contingency accommodation for families, which includes large units that can accommodate families of up to six persons. Last night, only one of these new additional contingency units was needed to accommodate a family.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> At the end of March, 870 homeless families were housed in commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dublin region. Statistics to be published later today show a reduction in the number of families in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation. I spoke to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government this morning and he made clear that he wants to ensure that we will have supported and appropriate facilities in order that families will be in more suitable accommodation. The Minister wants these facilities to be in place by mid-year. Over €15 million is being invested in eight new facilities that will offer appropriate services for up to 240 families. Available at these places will be facilities for children, homework clubs and key workers and housing assistance payment, HAP, place finders will be on site. Families will be able to look after themselves in these places. Work on the facilities at Mater Dei on Clonliffe Road, Lynam's Hotel, High Park in Drumcondra, for which Respond! is responsible, Clontarf, Clonard Road in Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Dundrum and Coolock is well advanced. The State is spending €4.5 million on the Mater Dei development alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> Outside Dublin there will be facilities to accommodate 21 families in Cork and 18 in Limerick. These developments are also being advanced. In Kildare, a facility for eight families operated by the Peter McVerry Trust will open in the coming week .</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_8">I acknowledge the provision of family hubs across our cities. They are a welcome development in recent months, although they have come very late in the day. I hope the pace of provision will be quickened such that there will not be a repeat of what occurred on Tuesday night. When a similar situation arose two years ago, in response to being told that the law was not strong enough in respect of the obligation on Government regarding the provision of housing for homeless families - it is very clear in the context of provision for children - the Taoiseach said that the situation would not arise again and that there was no need to strengthen any legislation. It is a damning indictment of him and his Government that, two years later, the situation has arisen again and the crisis has worsened. Despite all the best laid plans and announcements the delivery of housing has not been what it should be. Despite the introduction of rent pressure zones, rent costs are higher. The home-to-buy scheme has done nothing but give rise to higher house prices, particularly in Dublin. Regulation on costs to builders is exceptionally slow and social housing provision is wholly inadequate. In addition, the provision of rapid-build accommodation has been woefully slow.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">After a year in office and with the Government on the cusp of having a new leader, it is time to concentrate on the job at hand and provide the services, facilities and housing units people crave. We have heard a lot of sentiment on the subject in recent weeks but we need to deal with reality and the Government has failed to do that up to now.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">The Deputy knows, more than most, the intense focus there has been on ensuring supply is developed following the disastrous lack of supply of recent years, the reasons for which I do not need to articulate. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has indicated that the current legislation that defines legal responsibility for the provision of homeless services, including the provision of accommodation to a housing authority, does not require change. I accept there is an extraordinarily big challenge in accelerating housing supply but Rebuilding Ireland has ensured that very many actions are under way, so that we can begin to see the supply that is needed and to provide the necessary accommodation. Nine months into the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland, there is strong evidence that the focus on increasing and accelerating supply is starting to work. Planning permissions for 16,375 new homes were granted in the 12 months up to the end of December, an increase of 26% year on year, and commencement notices for over 13,000 new homes nationwide were submitted in the 12-month period to the end of February 2017. There were 3,000 sustainable exits from homelessness during 2016.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">The Government promised 15,000. That is the problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">Governments should be judged by how they treat the most vulnerable in society. After six years in office, Enda Kenny's record speaks for itself. According to the Central Statistics Office, in 2011 there were 641 homeless children but, last month, 2,563 children slept in emergency accommodation funded by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. That is a 300% increase. These figures do not include children in Tusla-funded domestic violence emergency accommodation or the children of hundreds of families trapped in direct provision after getting their leave to remain or children in emergency accommodation funded by the new communities unit. In fact, the Government has no idea how many children will sleep in emergency accommodation tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> There are 183,000 vacant homes across the State, 40,000 in Dublin alone. That is 24 vacant homes for every single adult and child in emergency accommodation. That is Enda Kenny's legacy. He put the rights of the child into the Constitution and he put thousands of children into emergency accommodation. His would-be successor, Deputy Coveney, has been Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for a year and, contrary to what the Tánaiste said, since taking office child homelessness has increased by 20%. Every single month Deputy Coveney has held office, the number of people in emergency accommodation has increased. Also during his tenure, the length of time children are spending in emergency accommodation has grown ever longer. Last year, before he took office, the average time was 12 months but today it is 24 months. Can the Tánaiste imagine one of her own children or her grandchildren spending two long years in a hotel?</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> To make matters worse, people are now expected to find their own emergency accommodation and 200 families are being forced by Deputy Coveney to self-accommodate on a night-to-night basis, shunted from one end of the city to another and not knowing if, tomorrow night, they will be forced to sleep on the streets. We might have thought things could not get any worse but now it emerges that homeless families are being forced to sleep in Garda stations, and Deputy Cowen outlined what happened on Tuesday night in this respect. How can the Tánaiste stand over this? How can the Government stand over what is effectively the abuse of thousands of children?</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Does the Tánaiste believe that the current situation is acceptable? Will she admit that the Government's response to the crisis of homeless families is failing? Will the Government release emergency funds to allow local authorities to acquire homes to ensure that no child is left in emergency accommodation for more than six months?</p>

          <p eId="para_16">All Members are aware of the scale of the challenge in terms of supply of housing and the reasons we are in this situation. The Government has recognised this challenge and has taken every action to ensure that the people of whom the Deputy speaks are provided with appropriate homes as quickly as possible. The most recent homeless figures are a reminder of the challenge we face in dealing with this problem. Dealing with the challenge head on is what the Government has done. Luckily, as the economy has improved due to careful and appropriate management, we are in a position to help the people of whom the Deputy speaks. Rebuilding Ireland has allocated €5.3 billion to the provision of 47,000 social homes. The Government has recognised the seriousness of the situation outlined by Deputy Ó Broin. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has particular responsibility for the issue. The biggest budget ever allocated to dealing with these issues has been approved. A range of social supports are being put into place to help the children of whom the Deputy speaks. Significant additional resources have been allocated. In budget 2017, approximately €100 million was allocated to homeless services. Nobody wants to see the situation described by the Deputy. That is why we have prioritised dealing with it and that is why more houses are coming on stream and the rapid builds are developing and will deliver homes for people. Over 3,000 households exited homelessness in 2016, which is the highest level ever. This year, there is a much higher level of response and aspiration to deal with the issue. As I have said, the Government is working on its commitment to exit homeless families from hotels by mid-2017 except in exceptional circumstances. A very broad range of actions, including dealing with vacant properties across the country, are being taken by every local authority. The housing assistance payment is providing help to families to exit homelessness. Multiple initiatives have been taken because we recognise the seriousness of the situation. However, we are coming from a position where there was no new housing supply for several years and no money to pay for it. That has now changed.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">It is strange that the problem has increased by 300% during the Tánaiste's time in office as a consequence of the Government prioritising tackling it. I understand that she must defend the Government's position. However, given her background in social care and her time as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I can only imagine how this issue makes her feel in private. In some ways, it makes her defence of Government policy failures even more remarkable. As the family homelessness crisis was spiralling out of control in August 2015, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, stated "If a family becomes homeless in Dublin this evening as a result of being moved out of a B&amp;B, ... the local authority ... will have the resources to supply emergency accommodation for that family." Two years on from that statement, families are being left on the street or in Garda stations. I will once more ask the Tánaiste the question she did not answer the first time: will the Government release emergency funding to allow local authorities to buy homes to ensure that no child spends more than six months in emergency accommodation?</p>

          <p eId="para_18">The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has made it clear repeatedly that local authorities will have support and funding and they have bought many hundreds of houses over the past year. This has been possible because improvements in the economy mean that the budget to do so is available. I have told the Deputy that €5.3 billion has been allocated to the provision of 47,000 social homes. He knows that South Dublin County Council is increasing the supply of housing available by building new homes, renovating homes and dealing with vacant properties.</p>

It is a very challenging situation. What happened on Tuesday night is absolutely unacceptable. We do not want to see one family in that situation. I repeat again that Garda stations are certainly not the places for families to be sent. The Garda works closely with the housing agencies, but clearly a Garda station is no place for a family, and I want to assure the House that no families have stayed overnight in any Garda station.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_29">I also want to focus on housing. There have been regular discussions in this House on the issue of social housing and the housing crisis. From intolerable rent increases to enormous social housing waiting lists to growing homelessness, the situation has been grave for some time now. The Tánaiste is correct in that there have been discussions across parties to develop plans to address these issues, and there are other proposals from all of us on the Opposition benches that could and should be taken on. However, the events of Tuesday night surely must shock us all. There is no amount of discussion on housing policy that could inure us to the real impact of families in this country being required to sleep either in Garda stations or in public parks.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Mr. Mike Allen of Focus Ireland has referred to Tuesday night as unprecedented and shocking. He is correct. Some 12 families could not find emergency accommodation in this city. Some 30 children could not be accommodated. Families were sent to Garda stations for their safety. Seven families spent the night in police stations as it was the only way they could find safety for their children. Unsurprisingly, some of the families were concerned about the potential implications of doing so, and so three families slept in Fairview Park and another family slept in Merrion Square. I say slept, but obviously there was no sleep for those families. Everybody in this House would agree unconditionally that that is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> A spokesman for the Dublin Region Homeless Executive was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> saying that Dublin City Council provides an emergency supply of contingency capacity for families. Clearly that contingency capacity is insufficient. In the meantime, 200,000 homes lie empty. There is plenty of space to accommodate not only the 12 families we spoke about but all those who need accommodation. While the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, is focused on the Fine Gael leadership debate, this House is still waiting for the vacant homes strategy. We do not know if the Government will consider a vacant home levy to bring 200,000 unused houses back into use. We do not know if the Government will consider the use of compulsory purchase orders for homes that have been vacant for a period of years. We do not even know when the audit of vacant homes will be completed. We do not know if the Government intends to increase the funds to acquire vacant properties. What we do know, shockingly, is that we have families who have spent the night in parks, and that cannot continue. The crisis of family homelessness cannot be allowed to sit side by side with that scale of empty homes. When will we see the vacant homes strategy and what particular assurances will the Tánaiste give us now to ensure we will never again see a repeat of Tuesday night?</p>

          <p eId="para_33">I want to repeat the point about the extra accommodation that has become available since Tuesday in terms of the emergency contingency capacity. It has doubled for families who present in emergency out of hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">It is reassuring that not all of the accommodation that has been made available was used last night. Only one of the new additional contingency units was used to accommodate a family. The additional accommodation were available and all the agencies knew this. There was real difficulty on Tuesday, as I have acknowledged, for a variety of reasons including exceptional booking levels in hotels.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> I spoke to the Minister this morning and his goal is clearly to move families out of commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation. I have outlined the huge range of initiatives he has undertaken in terms of family facilities. The aim of those initiatives is to make sure that more appropriate accommodation is available for families that present in this situation and have previously been housed in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation. The budget has been made available, as the Deputy is well aware. A variety of funding mechanisms are in place for buying up more homes. There is a €70 million fund with the Housing Agency to buy houses that are available and are considered suitable. Each local authority has been asked to identify vacant properties. That is a complex situation in terms of who owns the properties, access to them, legal issues and other restrictions on bringing them back into use. Where they belong to local authorities, they of course can be brought back into use.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> Every effort is being made to ensure that families get accommodation through the use of the housing assistance payment, HAP, through social builds and through encouraging private supply. All of those initiatives will come more and more into play. I have given the details of the increase of 26% in construction that is under way. An increased number of planning applications also have been submitted. This will ensure that by the end of this year we will see a fairly dramatic increase in supply. It is a very challenging situation. Every resource that is necessary is being provided at a national budgetary level and for local authorities. </p>

The Government was to have an audit completed and published and a vacant homes strategy published by the end of March. We are now approaching June. All the plans and talk are one thing but when will we see the strategy that was negotiated and accepted by this House actually implemented? What target does the Government have? How many of the 200,000 homes does it aim to bring back into family home usage and by when?</p>

          <p eId="para_42">Yesterday, Kathleen O’Toole confirmed the suspicions of many, namely, that the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is a fig leaf to divert attention away from the crisis in Garda management. She said that the commission's task is not to scrutinise the performance of individuals and that Garda management inherited a poisoned chalice. However, she forgot to tell us that the current Commissioner was part of the poison when she got the job in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">Why did the board appoint someone who was part of the problem? The head of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, said last week, "I would have thought you could have this commission done and dusted by December 1st if they just sat down and read the [inspectorate's] reports,". She went on to say that there was no guarantee that the report delivered by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland in September 2018 would be acted upon. The head of the Garda Inspectorate, Robert Olson, has said that previous reforms identified had not been implemented. He said, "No-one had made the change happen".</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> In recent weeks, things have got so bad at Garda headquarters that a decision was made to grant a barrister and junior counsel to the Commissioner and to a senior assistant commissioner at the expense of the State. They cannot even be in the same room without being lawyered up as a result of the failure to resolve issues around the complaints made by the same assistant commissioner, including those relating to interference in the interview process for the Commissioner's job in 2014. This was despite the expenditure of tens of thousands in consultancy payments to a company to investigate the issue – a job that was never sent out to tender.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> Interestingly, the same interview panel that trawled the world before deciding Nóirín O'Sullivan was the best person to replace Martin Callinan included Josephine Feehily, who, in her role as head of the Policing Authority, failed to recommend the removal of the Commissioner; it included Kathleen O'Toole, who yesterday indicated that she wanted to take the heat off Nóirín; and it also included Vivienne Jupp, former executive at global management consultancy Accenture, a company that benefited from multimillion euro contracts with An Garda Síochána. Vivienne Jupp was also instrumental in establishing Cyril Dunne as chief administrative officer in An Garda Síochána. He was among the first to be made aware of the Templemore scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Yesterday, the outgoing Taoiseach said that if a Minister were in charge of a calamity like that at the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, that Minister would be sacked immediately . The Tánaiste might find herself heading up a different Department in a few weeks' time. The current Commissioner has given us more than enough proof that she is not the person to bring An Garda Síochána forward. These might be the last weeks of the Tánaiste in the Department of Justice and Equality. Will she not consider doing what needs to be done in the best interests of An Garda Síochána? Legislation allows for the Minister for Justice and Equality to remove the Commissioner when it is in the best interests of An Garda Síochána. It certainly would be.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">I have already made my position and that of the Government in respect of the Garda Commissioner very clear. The Government established the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland under the chairmanship of Kathleen O'Toole. Deputy Wallace comes to the House and puts various names on the record. He does so again and again. I believe that we ought to observe due process.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> In respect of the commission, Kathleen O'Toole is a person of the highest calibre. She is uniquely qualified to take on this task. The other 11 members of the commission are all highly respected in their diverse fields. We are fortunate that they have agreed to bring the wealth of their experience to the task of shaping the future of policing in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> The Government, along with the support of many in the House, decided to establish the commission because we took the view that it was appropriate to examine a range of issues relating to all aspects of policing in Ireland. As the Taoiseach mentioned yesterday, these include whether the combination of State security and policing should be in the one force; an examination of management and the kind of management supports that are necessary within a police force to be equipped to deal with the challenges that, sadly, we saw in Manchester this week; and the other challenges from international criminal gangs and cybercrime. These are all new challenges facing policing. It is altogether appropriate that we decided to establish the commission. It is fully independent and will, I believe, provide a useful service for the future of policing in the country. That is the only job of the commission and that is the job that it will do.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> In the meantime, a vast amount of policing work needs to be done in the country, not least that which relates to international terrorism and the threat posed by those who carried out the appalling attack in Manchester this week. There are many other policing challenges. We should support An Garda Síochána in the vital work of securing the peace and keeping our communities and citizens safe. Of course, inquiries are being carried out by the Charleton tribunal and the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I suggest that we await the outcome of these inquiries before there is any further comment on the particular issues they are examining.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">It is outrageous that they might use international terrorism to defend the present Garda Commissioner. The house that is An Garda Síochána is falling down around her ears. While scandals, which can only be described as white collar crime, continue to escalate around Templemore, at the other end of the scale the plot thickens around the Garda involvement in the heroin trade in Athlone. On 19 May 2017, Judge Keenan Johnson, presiding in the Circuit Court, expressed his displeasure, annoyance and frustration at being seriously misled by a garda. The judge outlined in open court that on 7 June 2016, while sentencing a woman on drug offences committed on 2 June 2015, a garda purposely and deliberately misled the court. This is the same drugs operation in which other gardaí have been found to have had an involvement as a result of the protected disclosure of Garda Nick Keogh three years ago. Despite this, no one has been arrested or charged three years later. Why? It is because some of Nóirín's inner circle are being protected. This is an organisation in crisis. Will the Tánaiste allow this shambles to be her legacy?</p>

          <p eId="para_57">Let me be clear. At the very beginning, I indicated my concern at the findings of the interim internal audit report relating to the financial procedures in the Garda College in Templemore. It paints a disturbing picture of the way in which the college's finances were run. In short, it found that financial controls that cannot be stood over were in place there. That is the reality of the situation going right back. Action was not taken in 2008. In respect of 2009, we see reports in the newspapers today about internal inquiries at that time. We need to understand why that action was not taken at that time to deal with the issues emerging and which the Garda Commissioner has dealt with and on which she has taken action. In the most recent report she has outlined to me how the vast majority of the various recommendations in the interim draft report relating to Templemore have been implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">There is a commitment in the programme for Government to support the development of the agriculture and food sector. Every Deputy supports that aspiration, no more than we support the aspiration to look after everyone who gets up early in the morning, let alone those who cannot find a place to put their heads at night. The latest reports citing farming as the occupation with the highest risks for families is something that cannot be ignored by Government. The findings published by the ESRI earlier this week of the analysis of the 2013 Health and Safety Authority's survey on risk-taking and accidents on Irish farms outline how the fatality rate for farming is nearly ten times that of other occupations in the 2009 to 2015 period. It is a startling figure and one that proves a lot more action is needed. There were 11 fatalities last year alone and 138 people died in farm accidents during the past seven years. Will the Tánaiste confirm to the House that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have agreed to meet to discuss this issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Will the Tánaiste confirm to the House that extra funds will be made available to both Departments to ensure every effort is made to address this issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_62">The issue the Deputy raises is a very significant one. The issue of farm safety is a very significant priority for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, who has responsibility for the Health and Safety Authority. Farming is the occupation with the highest risk of fatalities in Ireland with a rate nearly ten times the average across occupations. It is a very serious and disturbing situation. The Health and Safety Authority has primary responsibility for health and safety on farms and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working closely with it. There are a number of ongoing initiatives in the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">The programme for Government recognises it is not acceptable for families to live in unsuitable emergency accommodation. If a child presents unaccompanied to a Garda station out of hours, there is a clear statutory responsibility on the Garda to contact the Tusla-funded social worker. When a family with a child presents at the same Garda station, there is no statutory clarity in terms of what the Garda should do. Focus Ireland wrote to the Taoiseach two years ago asking for regulations to be introduced to clarify what the Garda must do in such circumstances. The Taoiseach said it was not necessary. Given the events of this week, will the Tánaiste look again at the issue and come forward with regulations to clarify the legal situation in such circumstances?</p>

          <p eId="para_64">Gardaí are very clear about their responsibilities in such a situation. For example, a family turned up in Finglas the other night. Every effort is made to ensure they are made aware of all the services. Contact is made with the appropriate services. In this situation we are talking about housing. The Garda works very closely with all the agencies and will do everything possible to ensure anyone with whom its members come into contact is linked to the appropriate service. If there is any question about the safety of the children of those families, there is very clear law governing it. There are child protection guidelines, emergency out-of-hours services and provision for contacting Tusla. Gardaí are very aware of the law and they work to it so there is no need for extra arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">The programme for Government says, "We will end the use of unsuitable long-term emergency accommodation, such as hotels and B&amp;Bs, for homeless families". What we heard about here this morning goes much further than people ending up in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, with 12 families and 30 children being sent to Garda stations. I want to follow up on the vacant homes strategy. Will the Tánaiste or the Minister, Deputy Coveney, give us a date when the strategy will be published? The question was not answered when my party leader raised it today. The Peter McVerry Trust has looked at the situation in Britain where every local authority has a vacant homes officer. The Tánaiste said we do not know why they are vacant but that person's job is to go out and look at vacant homes, find out why they are vacant and bring them back into use. It has been really successful so there are models we can use to get a quick win. There are almost 200,000 empty homes in our country while people are sleeping in parks.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">In light of the fact that 12 families, 30 children and a pregnant woman turned up at Garda stations last night, will the Government support the Residential Tenancies (Housing Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) (Amendment) Bill 2016 in about ten minutes' time? If not, what legislation will it bring in? Who in the councils is telling people to go to Garda stations and why? What are gardaí supposed to do? They have enough on their hands. Will the Government issue a direction to stop the practice? The fear of having one's children taken away is probably the biggest fear any parent has. I am addressing the Tánaiste, the Government and the Labour Party. This crisis has been going on for three years. We know it takes time. The Government invokes the housing assistance payment, HAP, yet one of the women who was evicted was in a rental accommodation scheme, RAS, property. The Tánaiste knows RAS. It is the thing the Labour Party and Fine Gael told us was the solution to the housing crisis. Unless there are measures brought in to keep people in their homes and to stop them being evicted as a result of the sale of a property or its occupation by a family member of the owner, this will continue. Will the Government support the Bill in about ten minute's time?</p>

          <p eId="para_73">Regarding the commitments on health care in the programme for Government, I told the Taoiseach a number of weeks ago that I did not want Kerry University Hospital to be turned into a glorified community hospital. Funding is being cut from the hospital and allocated to the South/South West hospital group where it is swallowed up by hospitals in Cork. Where does this leave us given that recent reports indicate cuts of €5.6 million are being imposed on management at Kerry University Hospital who will have to make significant cuts to staff, services and equipment? This could lead to the closure of beds or entire wards? Patients in the hospital are at severe risk. This is a disgrace. Will the Tánaiste give an assurance that Kerry University Hospital will not be downgraded as a result of a lack of funding?</p>

          <p eId="para_75">What happened on Tuesday night when 30 children did not have anywhere to go or a roof over their heads is a blight on a society.

This is an absolute failure on the part of the Government. Mr. Mike Allen of Focus Ireland stated in a radio interview this morning that 200 of the 1,000 families in emergency accommodation must ring around and self-accommodate every day.

          <p eId="para_88">The Supreme Court this morning upheld an appeal by the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland in respect of who would foot the bill for the collapse of Setanta Insurance. It now looks like the insurance compensation fund, ICF, will have to pay the outstanding claims, of which there are more than 1,600 amounting to more than €90 million. Last June, the Government published a report on the motor insurance compensation framework which recommended that the current 65% cap on ICF payouts be increased to 100%. Will the Tánaiste give a commitment that the policyholders caught up in the Setanta collapse will receive 100% compensation in respect of their claims and that the 65% cap will be lifted immediately by way of legislation?</p>

          <p eId="para_89">I have raised this issue continually as the drama of Setanta Insurance has unfolded. While people will be relieved that the Supreme Court has made this judgment, it will come as a crushing blow to many motorists who are waiting for payouts in light of the 65% cap to which Deputy Michael McGrath has referred and the upper limit of €825,000 imposed on payouts.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">Some families have been left in a situation in which they are no longer mobile and the cost of their claims are far in excess of that. The cap would be cruel. Will the cap of 65% up to a limit of €825,000 be lifted and will the Minister direct the liquidator to begin immediately payouts to and communication with those who have been waiting for many years?</p>

          <p eId="para_92">The decision that has been delivered by the Supreme Court today in respect of the cases outlined by the Deputies removes the uncertainty that has existed since 2014. That is to be welcomed. The decision clarifies that the payments will be made from the ICF, which is overseen by a High Court judge and the Central Bank, as the Deputies will be aware. The payment of 65% of the amount due from each outstanding third party claim or €825,000, whichever is the lesser, will be arranged as soon as possible. The Department of Finance has been assured that this will be dealt with as a priority matter, given the urgent need to compensate people who have been waiting a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> It is likely that a significant proportion of the balance of third party claimants' claims will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of assets on completion of the liquidation process.

The formal transfer of that decision will come before the Cabinet in the next couple of weeks. I have been engaged with the company. As the Deputy knows, two reports have been completed by Mr. Bobby Kerr and have fed into the restructuring of the company that is under consideration by the board. Significant restructuring is required to ensure the continued viability of the company. It is building on some of the existing strengths, including the nationwide network that post offices and sub-post offices provide. They will be a key part of the reform of the network.</p>

          <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor)<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_684">The people suffered severely in the last decade due to the financial collapse. That happened for a number of reasons, one of which was absolute disregard for financial governance and fair practice. I agree that the shortcomings in this case are very serious. I agree that they are unacceptable. It is infuriating for the public and we need to get to the bottom of it. This fell far short of the standard impartial, unbiased and thorough investigation we demand and expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> With this in mind I have ordered a report from Mr. Drennan, the current director of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, into exactly what went wrong. That has to be our starting point in our attempts to understand what exactly occurred. We must know exactly what happened and exactly what failed, we must be open to any and all new measures and solutions to fix this and I do not accept that this is entirely an issue of funding and resources. So as the Minister, as a Department, as a Government, as the Dáil, we must now devise solutions, be they in areas of procedure, organisational change, enhanced powers or legislative change. If the report leads me to conclude that we need an entirely new model, then so be it. We owe it to those who suffered during the crash to never, ever allow something of this nature happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> I am deeply frustrated and share the disappointment and annoyance felt by Members of the Oireachtas and the public following yesterday's ruling by Judge John Aylmer. Judge Aylmer considered that, as a result of shortcomings in the investigative process undertaken by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, he could not allow the charges go before the jury for decision. As a result, Judge Aylmer directed the jury to acquit Mr. Seán FitzPatrick of all charges against him. I share the judge's view that the shortcomings identified are serious and unacceptable. As the Minister inheriting this long drawn-out and difficult case, I intend to complete a full review and examine all possible options. Nothing is off the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> This has been the longest running criminal case in the history of the State, at almost ten years, and has resulted in a significant legal bill to be footed by the taxpayer. As the trial is now complete, I am in a position to comment and review the results. As Members know, although I was briefed by my officials when I took office, I was totally precluded from commenting on any case before the courts. Now, and immediately on hearing the ruling, I have acted. Yesterday I formally requested the Director of Corporate Enforcement to provide me with a full and detailed report under section 955(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2014. This should address the chronology of events, the specific issues and criticisms raised by Judge Aylmer and any other relevant issues. I expect this report to be provided to me as a matter of urgency, and no later than 23 June.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> The functions assigned to the director include enforcing and encouraging compliance with company law, investigating and prosecuting breaches of the Companies Acts, referring cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecution on indictment and exercising a supervisory role over the activities of liquidators and receivers. As Members know, the Director of Public Prosecutions is charged with the prosecution of criminal offences and the DPP's office operates independently of Government. Mr. Ian Drennan was appointed Director of Corporate Enforcement in August 2012 and he is statutorily independent in discharging his compliance and enforcement role. It is important to note that the criticisms directed at the ODCE by Judge Aylmer regarding the investigative procedures pre-date Mr. Drennan's appointment as director. When Mr. Drennan took office, the file relating to the case of Mr. FitzPatrick had already been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions who took the decision to prosecute. However, when he was informed of particular difficulties in the case in May 2015, including the discovery of documents and the shredding of documents, he took immediate and appropriate action in informing the Director of Public Prosecutions of those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> Following his appointment, Mr. Drennan undertook a review of the organisational structure and management of the ODCE, together with the staffing and skills mix available to him. That review identified, in particular, a significant skills deficit in the area of accountancy expertise. Following that review, the director sought and was granted sanction to recruit seven new forensic accountants. Five accountants have now been recruited and the process of recruiting a further two is in progress. Additionally, the director sought and received sanction to recruit a digital forensics specialist. This specialist is due to start work next month. The ODCE also has an approved complement of seven members of An Garda Síochána. Vacancies exist for two of the Garda posts following retirements. The secondment of gardaí to the office is a matter for the Garda authorities and the director has been in communication with them to expedite these vacancies. The ODCE has recently been advised that one of the vacancies is to be filled shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> I now want to comment briefly on the trial. Under the proceedings initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Seán FitzPatrick, the former chairman and chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc, was charged with 21 alleged breaches of section 197 and six alleged breaches of section 242 of the Companies Act 1990. The trial in respect of Mr. FitzPatrick began on 13 April 2015. A jury was sworn in, before whom Mr. FitzPatrick was arraigned on alleged breaches as outlined earlier. I understand that substantial legal arguments, which included the issues regarding witness statements and shredding of documents, took place in the absence of the jury. The trial judge delivered a ruling on the range of issues on 2 June 2015. She discharged the jury and directed that a new trial be held in October 2015. Subsequently, in August 2015, the High Court ordered that the trial date be deferred to 25 May 2016. Mr. FitzPatrick's retrial in connection with those charges began before Judge Aylmer and a jury in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on 21 September 2016. At that time, it was envisaged that the trial would be likely to conclude by the end of 2016. However, the bulk of the court's time between September and December was taken up with legal arguments which were required to be dealt with in the absence of the jury, and in respect of which no reporting was permissible for that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I understand that many of the arguments again related to issues now in the public domain. The trial continued and legal argument in the absence of the jury meant that the hearing of evidence began in December 2016. On Wednesday 24 May, Judge Aylmer directed the jury to acquit Mr. FitzPatrick of all charges. It is clear from Judge Aylmer's comments that there were serious and unacceptable deficiencies in the investigative practices used by the ODCE in this case. In particular, the manner in which two witness statements were obtained and the shredding of documents were cited. The judge’s comments were highly critical and highlight a number of areas of concern. I note that the ODCE has accepted the criticism directed at it by Judge Aylmer and outlined some of the actions it had already taken long before the ruling which addressed these criticisms. These steps included the appointment of new professional experts and an assurance that investigative procedures now in place will prevent such a case arising again. This assurance can be provided because members of the Garda Síochána will now take the lead on all criminal investigations.</p>

          <p eId="para_693">As I outlined earlier, I have written to the Director of Corporate Enforcement to request a detailed report into the issues highlighted by the judge. I expect this report to be finalised as a matter of urgency. With the support of the Office of the Attorney General, I will review this report very carefully. This is my number one priority and I take it most seriously. I reiterate that all possible options are on the table and I will take all actions necessary to ensure that lessons are learned. I assure the House that I will return at the earliest opportunity to update Members on this matter and the actions I deem necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_694">I will be sharing time with Deputies Troy and Butler.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> Every week, probably even today, repossession courts are sitting across Ireland to hear cases brought by banks and organisations such as vulture funds who have bought loan books. As a result, people are being thrown out of their houses. I have attended such hearings, as have many other Members in their role as constituency representatives, to observe and support people in the process. It is always a case of a big bank or business against a small person. This trial turned that concept on its head. It was a case of the State taking on a big person. In one respect, it was intended to give the perception that no one, no matter how big they are, can get away with breaking the law. If a small man is prosecuted, the prosecution is inevitably successful. The collapse of this trial is so shocking on many levels that people are disgusted that the State has shown a lack of capacity in terms of how to bring a successful prosecution. The comments of the presiding judge in regard to statement contamination, witness coaching, the shredding of documents, and the presumption of guilt rather than innocence have been widely reported in recent days. These are fundamental issues in bringing criminal prosecutions. However, this case was approached in a botched manner. This serious and grave issue needs to be sorted out and there needs to be a proper follow-through, which is the most important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> The State's approach to prosecuting white collar crime needs to be considered. Prosecutions can involve many organisations, such as the Garda Síochána, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health and Safety Authority and, potentially, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Local Government Audit Service. These are some of the many agencies charged with trying to bring white collar crime to heel. There is a scattergun approach to doing so, with no co-ordination or focus. The result is evidenced by the FitzPatrick trial and the fallout therefrom. A proper debate on co-ordinating the State's approach to tackling white collar crime is needed. If it is necessary to bring in a serious fraud squad or serious crime agency similar to those that exist in the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions, then the State should take that step.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> We must be mindful of the damage done to Ireland's reputation by this trial. Ireland's reputation was discussed in the context of a debate in the House regarding the Apple tax judgment. Many commentators from outside of Ireland referred to it as the wild west in terms of playing fast and loose on tax policy. For outsiders to see the collapse of a trial of such importance in the context of the calamity of the banking crisis and Anglo Irish Bank in particular is hugely disturbing. When one adds what has happened in this trial to the perception that the Garda Síochána have created for itself as a result of financial irregularities at the Garda College in Templemore, the credibility of the Garda is in tatters. I say that with much regret. That issue has been debated in the House on many occasions. The credibility of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is also now in tatters. We have to pull together to mend this damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> Serious questions need to be asked of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is an independent office, as are many of the agencies of the State. Unfortunately, its independence shrouds a lack of accountability in terms of the organisation's output. Why was this case once again sent for trial following the collapse of the first trial in view of the many misgivings such as critical documents having been shredded? More details in this regard will emerge in the coming weeks. More accountability is needed, as is more questioning of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> The total cost of this saga needs to be revealed when the Minister has that information. We know the cost of it to ordinary people who are struggling to keep their homes or on whom banks are foreclosing. Those people are carrying the cost. The State is now being asked to pick up the cost of this trial on the double, in particular through the free legal aid scheme. It is of huge concern that the criminal side of the free legal aid budget is being drained, which is impacting on the provision of civil free legal aid. An ordinary person such as a woman who has been battered by her husband or is estranged or is trying to recover a maintenance payment and needs to avail of free legal aid for that civil matter cannot be helped because the free legal aid budget is being drained by cases such as the FitzPatrick prosecution. The expansion of the terms of reference of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to allow it to examine the functioning of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement needs to be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> The issue of resources needs to be addressed. During Fine Gael's time in this Government and the previous, staff numbers in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement fell from 43 in 2010 to 35 in 2016. The Minister has alluded to a recent increase in its staffing level.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Clear legislation is needed for accountancy bodies in terms of conflicts of interest. The same lawyers were advising Ernst &amp; Young on several cases, including the FitzPatrick trial, a case taken against Ernst &amp; Young by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and in terms of Ernst &amp; Young's own regulatory environment. The area of conflicts of interest of professional organisations and the belief that Chinese walls exist or are good enough need to be further fleshed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I trained as an accountant in Ernst &amp;Young in Limerick when I left college over 20 years ago. I am putting it on the record that I had no involvement in auditing any financial institutions. We dealt with small businesses and manufacturing. Separation and conflicts of interest should be key issues, and Ernst &amp;Young have questions to answer here.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">The collapse of the longest running criminal trial in history, involving charges against the former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, represents a damning indictment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Today, as chair of the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have written to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement asking that he appear before the committee to address his functioning in light of the collapse of the trial of Mr. FitzPatrick. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, admitted this week to very serious failures in its investigation into the actions of Mr. FitzPatrick. We need to hear before committee as a matter of urgency an account of the events that led to the collapse of the case, and to brief us on the ODCE's operation in light of the case. The judge condemned the ODCE's investigation for its inappropriately biased and partisan approach. My colleague, Deputy Collins, spoke about following through. The follow through will be started in committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">Everyone looking on is totally and utterly outraged. There is a perception that there is one law for the elite and another for the hard working citizens. We can be sure that Mr. Seán FitzPatrick will not be presenting himself to a community welfare officer in the weeks or days ahead. The consequences of his actions over many years have left many families presenting themselves on a regular basis to a community welfare officer. Today I spent 20 minutes arguing with a financial institution on behalf of a hard-pressed family to seek an element of leeway. They are trying so hard to meet their financial obligations and the bank is not playing ball with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> The Minister has said that she will seek a report, which I welcome. It is acknowledged that this office is coming before the committee. That is welcome. However, too often in this House Members are reacting to what is the political flavour of the day and what is in the news. What the Minister needs to do today is set a clear timeline as to when we will ensure that actions are being taken and that there will be consequences for the people in this office who failed the State so abysmally.</p>

          <p eId="para_706">I am sharing time with Deputy Pearse Doherty.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">I welcome this opportunity to speak on the role of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and on the shambles of the court case that has just concluded. In relation to the Seán FitzPatrick case, it is clear that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement categorically failed in its mission to encourage adherence to company law and bring to account those who disregard that law. The sheer incompetence shown in this investigation is shocking and totally unacceptable in this day and age. Common sense informs us that it is not appropriate for anyone to take statements from witnesses except an Garda, or to shred documents in the midst of a criminal trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> The financial cost of this fiasco will be significant. Leaving aside the price of a nine year investigation, this 127 day failed trial is estimated to have cost €3 million alone. As usual the taxpayer is left cleaning up the mess and picking up the tab. If one thing is guaranteed in this State it is that the taxpayer will be left on the hook.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> The loss to the citizens of Ireland is not just financial. This situation also led to an immeasurable loss of public confidence in politics and the legal system. The State can be bankrupted and banks can collapse and no one is held to account. However, if one does not pay the TV licence one can expect the full rigour of the law to be applied. Public opinion is firmly of the belief that criminal law is applied differently depending on who one is and what his or her worth is. This has to change. People across the country are rightly outraged at the conduct of the recent court case. The shambolic way in which the ODCE has dealt with white collar crime contrasts starkly with so-called welfare fraud. Public taxpayers’ money is currently funding an advertising campaign which follows the usual hard right agenda in its attempt to stigmatise those unfortunately dependent on welfare and not simply the tiny minority who commit fraud.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> I look forward to the Government’s similar campaign to tackle white collar crime. Minister Varadkar has defended his recent campaign saying social welfare fraud was a crime which should be punishable. I agree with that, but where is the Government’s campaign against white collar crime? A crime that cost us billions of euro brought this county to the brink of ruin and into years of devastating austerity which has fractured families and whole communities across the State. Everyone agrees that the agency established to investigate corporate crime is clearly not fit for purpose. Surely the Government is to blame for that. The ODCE is under-funded, under-resourced and not given the opportunity to be effective. One has to wonder why this is the case. The chief investigator in the case of the former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank unbelievably had no previous experience and he admitted in evidence that he made many fundamental errors, including the destruction of documents. This occurred in what was anticipated to be one of the most important cases in decades in this country. Given his lack of experience, who appointed him as chief investigator? Who was he accountable to?</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> In 2005, 2006, and 2007 Fianna Fáil refused requests from the office to increase its workforce by 20 people. The office described its resources as wholly inadequate. The then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, dismissed their requests. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour have all been in government since this investigation began in 2008, so it is hypocritical of Deputies from these parties to stand here and say more should have been done to avoid this outcome. They had the opportunity in government to tackle white collar crime but they failed to address it and this is the result of their inaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> My party colleague, Teachta Adams, yesterday reminded the Dáil that the Government spends just over €5 million on the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement. That is €5 million to investigate white collar crime.<b>
						</b>It is clear the ODCE was unprepared, under-resourced, without the necessary skill and unable and not fit for purpose for the type of investigation and prosecution it needed to undertake. The Minister said before the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on 21 June last year that she was of the opinion that the ODCE was sufficiently funded. Clearly this is not the case. In light of the serious shortcomings this investigation and court case have highlighted, does the Minister stand by the statement she made? As the ODCE comes under her remit, does she personally take responsibility for this shambles?</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_713">Ireland does not do prosecution of white collar crime. It is not just the collapse of the trial and the acquittal of Seán FitzPatrick, but for decades now we have seen that thread. We have seen the underfunding of resources of agencies that are supposed to be tackling white collar crime. We see staff resources being cut, and we see no legislative framework that should underpin a strong, robust, anti-corruption, anti-white collar crime agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> My colleague spoke about the request the OCDE made. It was established in 2001 as a result of the tribunals of investigation and the massive corruption that we saw in those tribunals. They spanned three decades yet there was only one conviction for corruption. This is despite the fact that we know that politicians were up to their necks with brown envelopes and despite the fact that we know that people had benefitted in terms of their own lifestyle as a result of backhanders given to people in influential places. The Criminal Assets Bureau did not go in and seize the assets at that time because there is one rule for certain individuals and another rule for others.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> When the ODCE was established in 2001 within a number of years the director was requesting resources. The director wrote to Michéal Martin, who was the line Minister at that time in 2005, and continued to write to him over a period of time to tell him that the ODCE was wholly inadequately resourced. Deputy Martin was the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and he refused the request. At a time when tens of thousands of additional public sector workers were being recruited not one additional staff member was given to the ODCE. Bertie Ahern stood where the Minister is sitting today and said the ODCE needed to wait its turn. At the same time Seán FitzPatrick and his ilk were setting in train the economic disaster that people the length and breadth of this country had to endure over the last ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">It is a symbol of how this country deals with white collar crime. The Fianna Fáil Deputies now tell us that Seánie FitzPatrick should be behind bars and that he caused an absolute catastrophe. A number of years ago, that party was appointing the same Seánie FitzPatrick to the boards of State bodies. The Fianna Fáil leader of the day was out playing golf with him and taking advice from him on economics, sipping wine and sharing dinner. I am really annoyed today because all we are going to do is go through the motions. We have fake outrage about white collar crime from Fianna Fáil, a party that refused to beef up this agency at a time when such action was needed. We have the fake outrage of the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, even though the ODCE has dropped 25% of its staff since Fine Gael came into power in 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> This is not the first time the Minister has heard about the shredding of documents and vital information, or if it is, by God, there is something really wrong. We in Leinster House, along with everybody who is clued in, knew about that for quite a while. Was there not a report required at that time? There was no need to wait until the trial collapsed. There was no need to wait to beef up the resources of the ODCE or to have a review of every single agency. That is what happens in modern democracies. That is what happens when people in suits take our economy and ruin our country. The Government should have looked to see what agencies we have. It should have done a review to see if they were fit for purpose and it should have strengthened them and beefed up our legislation. That is not what happened. The Minister says her Government presented the seven additional forensic accountants to the ODCE. Even though that staffing request was made in 2013, they were not appointed until 2015, two years later. The trial was ongoing at that time. We only had one person who could actually forensically analyse data on a computer. It is absolutely mind-boggling. It is like something out of Monty Python. This is how the State deals with white collar crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> Year after year, I have been challenging both the responsible Minister and the Taoiseach to conduct a complete review of white collar crime agencies in the State. I requested a commission that would examine all our agencies to make sure they were robust enough and, crucially, to overhaul our legislation to make sure we are not only going after the minutiae. These bankers, these people who wrecked our country, should rightly be behind bars. Since we have not made it illegal to do what they have done, they are walking the streets of Dublin and elsewhere with smiles on their faces, able to get on with their lives. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people who were forced to emigrate or are in poverty or have lost their houses are suffering because of this misery. This cannot be allowed to happen time and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> It is not just me making these points. A senior barrister addressing the Bar Council said that a tin-pot dictator would blush at the type of system we have. In 2012, Mr. Justice Kelly said of the Anglo Irish Bank trial that he was astonished to find there were only 11 gardaí and eight members of the ODCE working on it, the biggest trial in the history of the State. All the warning signs were there. While there can be no forgiveness or excuse for what happened in the ODCE, it is simply wrong to hang that office out to dry. The present Government and Fianna Fáil before it underfunded and under-resourced the fight against white collar crime because some of their own people were up to their necks in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">I am sharing time with my colleague, Deputy Burton. I will take seven minutes if that is acceptable to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> Anyone charged with investigating serious crime has two basic obligations. The first is to assemble all the information needed to persuade a jury that the accused person has committed a crime. The second is to maintain the integrity of that information and of the information-gathering process itself. To acquire full information fairly and to preserve it is not hugely demanding. We know very well that An Garda Síochána eventually learned hard lessons after a long succession of cases in which prosecutions were thrown out because the evidence could not be relied upon. We now discover that another major body charged with the investigation of serious crime seems to have learned nothing about the basic obligation to comply with the law of the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> We all know that the defendant in a criminal case has rights. It is also important to remember that serious crimes are prosecuted in the name of the people and they, too, have rights. Mr. FitzPatrick has not been convicted of any offence and is entitled to the benefit of his directed acquittal. However, that does not prevent me and most right-thinking people from continuing to believe that company laws were breached in an egregious manner in the management of Anglo Irish Bank. That was the case made on the people's behalf and we expected Mr. FitzPatrick and others to be required to answer it.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> Those whose duty it is to prosecute cases on the people's behalf owe a duty to the people to discharge that function professionally and competently. This train wreck of a case seems to reveal staggering incompetence in how agencies of the State do the people's business. We as public representatives are not just entitled but obliged to find out why this happened. I have heard Professor Niamh Brennan, a distinguished author and academic with a lot of expertise in this area, caution that we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. That is fair enough. I am sure the ODCE has done good work over the years. In this particular case, however, the failures have been monumental. I am concerned that there might be wider implications. Our regulatory landscape has many bodies independent of Departments with powers to prosecute summary offences in their own name and to prepare serious prosecutions for the Director of Public Prosecutions. After this omnishambles, I fear there is a risk that other bodies could repeat those mistakes. I believe the review that must now inevitably follow must include an audit of the competence and capacities of all regulatory agencies that are capable of mounting investigations and prosecutions in criminal law.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> I repeat my earlier statement that I respect Mr. FitzPatrick's directed acquittal. However, I do not believe that outcome should prevent a full examination as to how and why this happened. The Minister proposes a referral under section 955(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2014. Although that may be a reasonable starting point, it is far from meeting the requirements of this matter in full. In essence, the Minister proposes to ask the director to give an account of his own stewardship, to give his own story. What is really required here is a robust external review of what happened and how it happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> I have listened to Deputies talk about resources. Although some people want to make political capital out of that issue, the issue of the million breath tests was not a resources problem. Evidence is not shredded because of resources issues. We must demand and expect high standards from those whom we pay well to do the people's business. We need an independent investigation into the workings of the ODCE, a process that has already been called for by my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly. Once the investigators have completed a review of that body, they should be tasked with repeating the exercise for any other body that has been charged with the enforcement of criminal law. That would include the HSE, the Health and Safety Authority, ComReg, the Central Bank and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> I hope the Minister will now propose a meaningful engagement with all of us in opposition on these matters. We must have robust mechanisms to carry out investigations into matters that have rocked the foundations of the State. Others have spoken about the economic catastrophe that the people have endured in recent years. The people have marched through that horror story and have asked that things be put right in order that we can have an economic future.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Equally, they have asked for an accounting in order that those in the banking system who, through their actions or inaction, caused the economic catastrophe that befell our people - as well as those who were tasked with oversight and who failed in that - will be held to account. Bluntly, when it comes to the holding to account of those who were responsible for the economic catastrophe, we have a long way to go.</p>

          <p eId="para_728">This is a low blow to citizens in the country, especially to people who lost their jobs, businesses or homes as a consequence of the goings on in Anglo Irish Bank. It is fair to say that white-collar crime is not taken seriously in this country. I believe the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has never really wanted the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. It has always been something of a holding job rather than a thorough job. Consideration now has to be given, as it was at the time of the murder of Veronica Guerin, to the establishment of a criminal assets bureau for white-collar crime. Nothing less will address the situation. It must be seriously resourced, robust in its attitude and willing to take on all comers in respect of white-collar crime. That is the only way it can address the devastation, loss and cost that such crime means for the rest of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> The basic difference or distinction between gathering evidence for a civil case and gathering evidence for a criminal case appears to be at the heart of what went wrong in this regard, in addition to the shredding of documents. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is part of the permanent Civil Service. Ministers do not have day-to-day contact with officials in a quasi-independent autonomous section of the Department. Did no one in the Department shout stop? My colleague, Deputy Howlin, brought in whistleblowers legislation, which has changed all of that. Where are the people in the Department who have come forward and advised the Minister? I believe that all those involved in this shambles need to seriously consider their positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> By whom will this report be carried out? The Minister should not tell me that it will be by one of the officials in the Department. I do not believe that would be acceptable to anyone in the Dáil. I hope the Minister tells me it will be done by someone who is competent and who has the relevant expertise, maturity and experience. The people who have handled this from the Department's side appear to have been people who probably were very good but whose experience all related to civil litigation and who seemed to have little or no experience with criminal prosecution. The cost of this to Irish society is severe.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> I listened to Deputy Pearse Doherty. I recall that Deputy Doherty was one of the people who voted for the bank guarantee. He was proud to do that and he told us what a good fix it was for the people. People are gutted by what has happened with regard to this trial. It would seem now that the legal insiders were aware, by and large, that a second trial would have had little chance of success.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> I have seen the advertisements against social welfare fraud put on the buses by my successor in the Department of Social Protection. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is listed as one of his supporters in the current discussions within her party. Will the Minister please tell the Minister for Social Protection to save half of the €250,000 that he has put into that campaign and divert it to white-collar crime? Were he to do that, he might actually do the public in Ireland some service.</p>

          <p eId="para_734">I am sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> The expression "fake outrage" has been mentioned. Fianna Fáil Deputies certainly must have to go to acting classes because trying to generate an emotion around these issues must be extremely difficult for them. The same applies to those in the Labour Party who were in government with Fine Gael for years while this lack of pursuance took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> I would love to say that the acquittal of Seán FitzPatrick has been greeted by working-class people and ordinary people with collective outrage. Actually, it has been greeted with a collective lack of surprise because there is little or no faith in the Minister or any of the majority parties in this Dáil, to deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> It is quite clear of late that there are elements of a banana republic around this State when we consider the crises with the Garda, the church and so on. There is probably an element of disappointment on behalf of the Minister and some in the establishment in Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and so on. There is an argument that they needed to jail at least one significant person in connection with the bailout. Lo and behold, one of those significant people has gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> This investigation was foiled due to the historical subservience of the establishment to big business and the lack of concern about white-collar crime in general. It simply confirms the view of many people that there is one law for white-collar crime and another for blue-collar crime; one law for the rich and another for the poor. Indeed, there is no law for the rich – let us be frank.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> It would appear that the only things senior bankers got sentences for were life sentences of fat juicy pensions. Can the Minister point to how many people have been prosecuted in connection with the bank bailout? I think the number could be counted on one hand – it is minuscule. However, the downfall of the banks was caused by the cutthroat profit motive that exists in the banking sector. The previous Government and the Government before that operated light-touch regulation in the sector. They were quite happy to see vast profits being made by the banks with minimal regulation. This led to extraordinary mortgages – of up to 40 years in some cases – being heaped on the back of ordinary people. This was well documented by my colleague, Joe Higgins, in his minority report at the banking inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> The Minister says she is serious about white-collar crime. All these developers have now had their act cleaned up in NAMA. Either they are back on their feet or they are getting back on their feet. Some are even getting State hand-outs. I am not referring to the land that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, is talking about gifting. I am referring to Activate Capital, which is getting money from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, and some of the big developers who were involved in the crash. Not a word has been said about them. It is all perfectly legal and there is nothing illegal about it. Never before have so few people paid for such serious crimes. Let us consider the toll taken on health, education and special needs services. Only this morning the Tánaiste invoked the excuse that we had no money for years and that was why we have a housing crisis now. The State had money but it was put into the banks. The amount was €64 billion in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is a convenient scapegoat. Obviously, what happened should be investigated and any incompetence should be dealt with but the office is completely under-resourced. Is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for real? Fifty people were investigating the biggest crime that took place in this country in a decade of austerity. The staff in place were completely inexperienced when it came to dealing with criminal investigations. The lead investigator was never involved in a criminal investigation. Gardaí were not in place to take statements from witnesses. Of course, errors were made in the context of under-resourcing, staff numbers etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> At the same time, however, many Garda resources were put into fighting people over the water charges. A total of 200 people were arrested at the time. Vast resources went in to challenging the people who were challenging austerity. On the same day that Seánie FitzPatrick was being led out into the lovely sunshine, ordinary people from Tallaght – I will not comment on the case, of course, because it is <i>sub judice</i> - who were involved in a protest over the very austerity that was resulting from this white collar crime were facing court. I will not comment on the details but already one 16 year old has been criminalised for that, in stark contrast to what has happened to Seán FitzPatrick. That is not lost on people. It is certainly not lost on the people who voted for the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_748">I believe the fact that Seánie FitzPatrick is walking away is not a blunder but a set-up that stinks to high heaven. There is a direct line between Seánie FitzPatrick's rotten, corrupt activities at Anglo Irish Bank and the families that are this week being sent to Garda stations or are sleeping in parks because no homes are available. The establishment in this country has contrived and conspired to ensure that he walks away free. It is an absolute scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> Consider the facts. An individual with no previous experience in criminal prosecutions is put in charge of the case. He has never even taken statements from witnesses in a criminal trial. In 2012, a judge presiding over the High Court's commercial list wonders why only 12 gardaí have been assigned to the case. However, nothing is done. Some gardaí are even moved to other cases. In March 2011, the Minister with responsibility for trade is told in a report that there are irregularities in the way the investigation is being carried out. In December 2010, a preliminary report was shown to the DPP making the DPP aware of the manner in which the statements were being taken, which was irregular. Mr. O'Connell told the court that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement changed its practice since he gave evidence in 2015. Therefore, it knew, yet we only find this out now. To me, all of it stinks. Ministers, gardaí, judges and the DPP knew there were problems, but nothing was done and he walks away free because of the apparent blunders of one scapegoated individual. I do not believe it for a minute. It is rotten and absolutely stinks to high heaven.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> As Deputy Coppinger said, the ordinary people on the street have been shafted by Mr. FitzPatrick and Anglo Irish Bank and the disaster inflicted on the country rolls on. The property assets that these people bankrolled with gambling and speculation were handed over to NAMA and then handed back to vulture funds and to some of the same developers who are now evicting people, resulting in a homelessness catastrophe. One of the chief architects of this walks away and we are told it is because of a mess up in the investigation. I do not believe it is primarily to do with resources in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, although that is part of it. That is part of the ongoing fact that there is one law for the rich and one law for the poor in this country. This situation is perpetuated and protected by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the establishment in this country. However, I think it is worse than that. I believe that many people in government and in the State knew that this was going to collapse and they let it collapse. They let it run to this point so that Mr. FitzPatrick would get off. The people have been shafted yet again. The economy and people's livelihoods were destroyed and we have a housing crisis that rolls directly on from it, yet one of the chief architects walks away. How convenient. If anyone believes that this is a blunder, a mistake, a resource issue or the result of one individual not being able to cope with the stress, he or she must be living in fantasy land.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> I do not believe the Government's fake tears. It must have known it. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was not present but her Department must have known because we have been told that there was a report stating there were problems in how the evidence was gathered. It stinks to high heaven.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_107">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_752">If committing a crime in Ireland, wear a suit. The chances of being caught are probably directly proportionate to the price of the suit worn. Given media reports, the only source of information available to the House until today, which says a lot in itself, it is beyond credible that the Government could be surprised at the collapse of the case. It appears that journalists covering the case, who were restricted in their reporting, were fully aware that the case would be dismissed. For the Government to state now that it wants a report on this from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is far too little far too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> I raised the question of white collar crime during Leaders' Questions last week and highlighted that the staffing levels at the ODCE had fallen by more than 18% since 2010 and that the number of gardaí working in the office has been reduced by 24.5%. At one point, there was only one garda seconded to the ODCE, while 20 gardaí are working in the Department of Social Protection. This shows where the priority lies in detecting crime and who Fine Gael sees as being the criminals. However, it is not only Fine Gael who do not see crooks in suits as a problem. Fianna Fáil told the ODCE, when it highlighted it was under-resourced, to get in line in 2007. In 2015, when the first case collapsed, Deputy Howlin was the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and sat at the Cabinet table. What did they do then?</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> It is estimated that Ireland loses about €2.5 billion a year from economic crime. That is €25 billion over the past ten years. However, that is okay because they are the people who buy tables at party fund-raisers. Today the Minister announced that this will be investigated and lessons learned. We already know what is wrong. It has been pointed out by the ODCE itself and by the Garda Inspectorate. The question is one of resources. However, we also now have to ask what was known all along about this case. The chronology of some of the events has been outlined by Deputy Boyd Barrett. The Minister outlined in her response the steps that have been taken by the ODCE. I wonder when these steps started? Was it after June 2015 when the first case collapsed? Why was the second case taken? Why was there a second prosecution? The same evidence was to be used and presented, yet the Government and the DPP, knowing it would collapse, allowed a second prosecution to go ahead. </p>
          <p eId="para_755"> In 2015, the Garda Inspectorate report noted that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation was struggling to manage the volume of suspicious financial transactions forwarded as part of money laundering and terrorism financing legislation. The report also found that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is investigating serious fraud without always having the skills and resources to conduct a thorough investigation. This shows the Government's priorities. It will go after and hound those in receipt of social welfare. Fraud does take place there but these people have nothing and will have nothing at the end of it. The people the Government is letting go and not targeting, however, are those who will walk away wealthy, with big pensions and with their names and freedom intact. </p>
          <p eId="para_756"> Other parties in the House are saying that we need an anti-corruption agency. In his leadership pitch, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, is saying that he will establish one. However, do we really need another agency or board and an inordinate delay in its establishment that allows politicians to say that they are dealing with the issue? We do not. We need the Government to act and to do what it knows needs to be done. We already have the agencies; we have just never taken them seriously. We have never made them work on behalf of the citizens of the country. The potential savings for our society are huge at more than €2.5 billion a year, against which the amount of social welfare fraud that takes place in the State pales into insignificance.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> The most important question is when the Government will show our citizens that the criminal law is not only a law for the poor and the defenceless. When will it begin to address the scandal and start targeting those crooks in suits?</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_758">I too am delighted to be able to speak today although it saddens me to have to speak. The former director of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Mr. Paul Appleby, has declined to comment on whether he will co-operate with the report and audit into the agency's role in the trial of Seán FitzPatrick. Let us think about that. Mr. Appleby has received retirement benefits worth almost €590,000 since he retired five years. Controversially, he retired early on an annual pension of €73,000 on top of a €225,000 lump sum, most of it tax free.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">I thank the judge and the jury in the case for staying so long. I thank the judge and all juries that give their valuable time. I thank the judge because if the trial ended long ago, we would not know any of this. This particular judge has done a great service to the State. People are criticising him for going on so long with it but he has done a powerful service to the State. There was a media blackout for an awful lot of it. We would not know anything about it. I thank him from the House on behalf of the people of Tipperary.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> The Minister said people have suffered. There are shortcomings in the report. If the Minister's meagre answer is that it fell short, it is pathetic. What went wrong? It is all very wrong. It was wrong from the start. Mr. Appleby was in the Competition Authority where he took on cases. The solicitor was involved with CRH. There is a long history here of abject failures to act and control big business when CRH was crushing small people in my county. They were good, honest, family business people who gave huge employment as their people did before them. CRH wanted a monopoly. Writing to the Competition Authority was like writing to Santa Claus. At least one gets something from Santa Claus. One got sweet Fanny Adams - excuse the expression - from the Competition Authority or any of those authorities. It is all a racket. They all get bought into it. They are all self-serving and they serve the big business. To hell with the ordinary people. They came from the Competition Authority and were appointed across to this so-called agency. It is another quango that has done nothing for the people. It has done nothing to explain the cost. We are going to give a fat pension to the head of it for five years. Then we have a solicitor who was with the Competition Authority and the DPP for years and now he is the main man who drafted all the statements incorrectly and took the statements incorrectly. I wonder how many people were charged under this solicitor's watch in the DPP's office in the past. If he is so incompetent to make such a monumental cock-up, what about the people who were prosecuted? I happen to know of somebody the ODCE prosecuted. He was a developer in Dublin who had an apartment block. He was brought before the courts, severely treated and fined €10,000 for not holding management meetings. It is a case of who and what people are, as Deputy Pringle said. It is a case of who people are and who they know. This is outrageous. It stinks from the high heaven. There has been no appetite since I came in here in this or the previous Government to tackle this issue. If there was, we would give them the resources. We would give them all the resources they want.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> We saw last night Caranua getting the resources and what is it doing with them? It is setting up headquarters and appointing CEOs and a clatter of staff. The public person it was supposed to represent has been dismissed and diminished. We will celebrate the centenary of the Soloheadbeg ambush in a year and a half's time and the men who fought to give us our freedom. They are turning in their graves because we have been raped and plundered by big business and the systems that are supposed to protect the people. Senior officials the whole way across the board have become self-serving. It is all about career promotion and then they might be seconded someplace else, retire and go in as advisers and consultants the week after. It is rotten. It is a merry-go-round and it is rotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> The ordinary people I represent on a daily basis are crying in anguish. They are sick and traumatised and many of them have gone to their grave by suicide because of the cock-up that happened with the banks in this country, because of the vulture funds and because of Mr. FitzPatrick and all of those people. This charade has been going on for ten years now. I thank the judge for keeping it going on long enough to find out the information. I have been down to the courts with families. I have been in the banks with families. They are merciless to those people. They are mercenaries who have no mercy or understanding for people. I call them mercenaries because that is what they are. That is what the officials in this case are too. They are not doing their job. They have a duty to be held to account. Mr. Appleby may not co-operate. He will probably get immunity like the official who shredded and burned all the files. He went down to St. John of God's, God help us. He may be ill and he has immunity from prosecution. It would not be in a Mills and Boon novel. One could not write it.</p>

          <p eId="para_764">I am. It is factual. We all know it because it is in the public domain thanks to the judge and the reports. There was a clampdown on the media and it could not be reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> We had three decades of tribunals. I went up to the Taoiseach's office recently about the so-called investigation into NAMA because I object to the chair the judge appointed. It is another cover-up. We asked the question, which someone else also asked of the officials, what have all these tribunals cost us. I was told the figure is well north of three quarters of a billion euro. There has been one prosecution after 25 or 30 years. It is a joke. As I said, the solicitor went off from the DPP's office and we are told now he could not take a statement. He was unable to take a statement and he was working in the DPP's office for years and probably decades. Company law here is clearly smashed and broken by Anglo. We all know that. I have a small company. There are many people in companies. We know how delicate and difficult the law is. Compliance is very important. We have to obey and so does the ordinary man in the street, who has been put into penury. Their children and grandchildren have been put into penury as a result of the actions of these people. This sham of a trial that went on is a total smokescreen because they are all in it together. Certain senior politicians are in it. The senior civil servants are being rewarded and now they want to get a restoration of their pay and they want to get their privileged position back. They have their hands on the handlebars of power and it does not matter who is in government. It most definitely will not be the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, because she will probably be gone out of her office next week. I wish her well. It will be like St. Leo saying it was like that when he got here. They will be cavalier and move on. They will forget about the people and forget they were elected to represent the people and to stand by our Constitution. It has been made a mockery of throughout 2016 and in the past ten years because these people are not held accountable to anybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> The new head of the ODCE picked up the pieces and ran off to the DPP. They are complaining they do not have the resources. The Minister has given them seven new gardaí. They had five already. We have problems in the gardaí too. They cannot even investigate themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_769">I thought the Minister said seven. There are two yet to be appointed. I heard the Minister's speech and I listened to it. They cannot account for the million illegal breath tests that were never carried out. Who are we going to get honesty from? I want an outside agency brought in from a faraway country to come in here and clean up the ODCE and An Garda Síochána and deal with this. For years colleagues and I have been asking the Competition Authority to deal with many issues. We might as well be talking to the wall. They are toothless, useless and fruitless. They are the same as most of the quangos that have been set up. The Government and the last Government promised to get rid of quangos yet they are like mushrooms coming up. Every shower of rain there is a new one coming up and they are bigger and bigger. They are magic mushrooms. They are magic for jobs and positions. They are magic for them to bring in their advisers and friends and magic to do nothing but wave a wand and go hide and go asleep. They get offices and CEOs and pretend they are working. They go to conferences and travel the world but do not serve the people such as the people in Caranua who were the unfortunate victims of abuse. There are unfortunate victims here.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> Over a decade or two decades, families that tried to make a living in small business have been destroyed. With regard to small business, yes, there is law but Deputy Pringle is right that the price of one's suit dictates who one knows and what one knows and it has not changed under this Government or this Taoiseach. The Taoiseach is retiring now and going off into the sunset. I wish him well in that. I do not wish him ill-health but we need an audit of all the regulatory bodies because they are not regulatory bodies. They are just compliance bodies. They are regulatory bodies for the ordinary people. The Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 is being forced at the moment. People who went out to clean rivers to stop bridges being taken away were prosecuted illegally by the fisheries board. We are passing legislation with gusto to make it legal retrospectively. They were fined. Some of them had to go to court three times and pay thousands of euro to barristers and solicitors. They were found guilty and named and shamed in the paper illegally. We cannot do anything with these people because they are too powerful. We just play games with them. It is on the agenda for next week finally to pass the Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017. Honest people were trying to ensure rivers were safe and clean and that fish could live in them. They were trying to save roads, bridges and properties. They were prosecuted illegally by men in suits waving badges at them and now we are passing legislation here to make it legal. It stinks from high heaven. The Minister should be ashamed to be a part of it. She has been part of this Government and she supported the last one.</p>

          <p eId="para_771">I am sharing time with Deputy Ryan. In the Minister's opening statement, she spoke about people being frustrated and disappointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">She is wide of the mark in using tame terms such as frustration and disappointment because people are outraged and furious and have a right to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> The case in the courts this week must be a game changer. Otherwise, we may as well hang up our hats because nothing will change. Serious action must be taken as a consequence of what occurred. There is widespread acceptance and significant evidence that white-collar crime goes virtually unpunished in Ireland. This is why people are saying, "Here we go again." </p>
          <p eId="para_774"> The 2011 general election was supposed to be the election to change everything. People wanted reform and the introduction of systems and checks and balances that would prevent a recurrence of the types of behaviour that caused the crash. However, the fragmentation of our institutions and organisations continues and it is clear they cannot cope with the issues they face.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> The website of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, features the following statement: "The mission of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is to improve the compliance environment for corporate activity in the Irish economy by encouraging adherence to the requirements of the Companies Acts, and bringing to account those who disregard the law." The office clearly failed in its mission in the recent court case. </p>
          <p eId="para_776"> I had dealings with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement when I was dealing with the issue of Siteserv, when there was definite evidence of a spike in the price of shares in a company that was heavily indebted. My contact with the office involved letters being sent back and forth on this matter. I was informed by the ODCE that it had no role in the matter and did not hold this type of information. If insider trading is not related to corporate responsibility, I do not understand the meaning of corporate responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> In 2015, the Social Democrats sought to bring a solution to the table when we called for the establishment of an independent anti-corruption agency. We studied examples of similar agencies operating in other countries and made a proposal in the Dáil in December 2015. After our proposal was voted down by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, we persisted with calls for an anti-corruption agency and undertook extensive work on how such an agency would operate. Examples of such practice internationally informed our research. Two years after we first introduced this idea, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has decided to adopt certain aspects of it. However, he advocates that the agency should only operate in respect of the public service. If the recent case demonstrates anything, it is that such an agency should not only apply to the public service. </p>
          <p eId="para_778"> A functioning anti-corruption agency would prevent, investigate and prosecute corruption. Given that we have far too much fragmentation, the new agency would consolidate agencies charged with tackling corruption and strengthen the legislative framework in which they operate. It would help to rebuild trust and renew public and international confidence in Ireland as a place in which to do business - not dodgy business but clean and honest business.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> When I was dealing with the Siteserv issue and the IBRC debacle, I was contacted by a remarkable number of people from the business world. What they wanted was to be able to operate in a country that was a fair and honest place in which to do business. They did not believe Ireland was such a place. To give an example, the report on the Garda training college in Templemore states that Garda staff assigned to administrative roles in the college had no training or experience in administration and no knowledge of public procurement or financial procedures. When this can occur in the college that trains gardaí, is it any wonder we do not take white-collar crime seriously at any level? What is required at political level is fundamental change, rather than postponing action until some time in the future. </p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_780">What is most frightening, worrying, alarming and shocking is the basic lack of competence that has been revealed in this case. Given that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has ultimate responsibility for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Minister and her officials have questions to answer. How did we end up with an agency that was not competent to do its most critical task? I do not believe the answer is related to a lack of resources. Six or seven years ago, towards the end of the Green Party's time in government, we requested a meeting with the then Director of Corporate Enforcement and specifically asked him whether the office had the resources it needed to carry out the critical task of identifying, among the carnage left by the banking crash, whether cases could be brought that would restore public confidence in the idea that inappropriate corporate activities would have consequences. We were given a clear and categorical commitment that resources were not a problem. I understand from reading more recent accounts that at critical times in the process, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement was offered additional resources at every turn to manage what everyone knew would be some of the most critical cases in the history of the State in terms of restoring and building confidence in the judicial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> For the past six or seven years, everyone has known that maintaining and restoring public confidence in the State has been one of the most important tasks facing us. What was revealed in the judicial decision to pull the recent case is incredibly worrying. While we must maintain due process in the judicial system, one of the strengths of this country, we must also ask why an agency utterly failed in its task to build an investigation in a proper, legal and considered manner. As well as the view that some people got away with things in the crash because we were unable or unwilling to prosecute, there is also a concern that from now on, the rest of the business world will conduct its activities without fear of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> Change is required. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement must maintain a rigorous guard over the accountancy profession, which failed completely before the crash to identify widespread inappropriate and illegal lending. In the legal profession, solicitors were signing off and approving conveyancing and documents where there was not proper title or the paperwork was incomplete. The legal system must know that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is an A-rated, top-quality agency which always does its job. I am certain the profession does not believe that is the case today. Last but not least, the banking system must know that the final arbiter, namely, the courts, is in a position to completely hammer out illegal activity in the banking system. That faith has been shattered by the judgment delivered this week. </p>
          <p eId="para_783"> The Department, as the parent body of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, has a responsibility to find out why the agency was not competent to do its job. The Minister must present clear mechanisms for restoring public confidence in both the ODCE and the judicial system and ensuring business people know they are operating in an environment in which ethics and the rule of law apply. This must be done quickly because once public exasperation sets in, it is very hard to win back confidence. We will start winning back public confidence by ensuring the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is competent but that notion was blown out of the water this week.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_785">Tá ceist agam. I will argue that the Minister is scapegoating Mr. O'Connell and that he will be thrown under a bus for the problems this situation has raised. The Minister is really arguing in her statement that the Government is about to close the stable door now that the horse has bolted.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> I will ask about the role of An Garda Síochána. It is usual practice for gardaí to question witnesses and take statements. They should have done so in respect of the EY auditors, who were questioned by Mr. O'Connell himself. In his evidence, Mr. O'Connell stated that the gardaí did not do it because, according to them, they were "flat out" working on other Anglo probes. What were those probes that were more important than this investigation into the activities of Mr. FitzPatrick and his loans? When a Garda assistant commissioner received a letter in June 2015 informing him that gardaí were not involved in taking these statements, why did the Garda not act? Will the Minister admit that the assurance that the Garda will act as the lead in all criminal investigations from now on bears no weight, given its criminal failure to deal with this matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> I have a question on the role of EY in this situation. Is the Minister's Department or any other still hiring EY, giving it contracts and paying it for reports and advice? EY gave Anglo Irish Bank a clean bill of health just before the crash and the firm was taken on again to give advice and help in investigating the causes of the crash. Along with other elites and parts of the clique of the Irish wealthy and powerful, such as Goodbody, PwC etc., EY is part of the nexus of the rich and powerful, which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to, who view it as their job to protect one another and their golden boys such as, for example, Mr. FitzPatrick.</p>

          <p eId="para_788">Did the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, at any time before or during the collapsed trial that is the subject of this discussion or during the previous collapsed trial raise issues with the Minister directly or with her Department about its capacity or the capacity of the DPP to mount the cases on behalf of the State? Is the Government open to considering extending the terms of reference of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to review the workings of the ODCE?</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> I referred to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health and Safety Agency. What is their capacity to deal with white-collar crime?</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> What was the role of the chief investigator <i>vis-à-vis</i> the person's mental health and the action of shredding documents? Are other prosecutions pending in which that person was central in building the case on behalf of the State through his role in the ODCE? It would be important to know whether there are more calamities coming down the tracks.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> Has the Minister, through her Department, plans to review and regulate the conflicts of interest among accountancy houses? Irrespective of whether there is a conflict of interest in reality, if there is even the perception of one, it is an issue. These accountancy practices are also assigned consultancies by the large clients that they audit. That is wrong. On one side they audit clients and are supposed to hold them to account in terms of checks and balances but, on the other, they are providing some other accountancy service in another section of the business. They are compromised, which is something that we need to examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> What will be the consequences for EY of its botched auditing of Anglo Irish Bank?</p>

          <from>Deputy Eugene Murphy<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_793">This is a shocking state of affairs. While I accept that Mr. FitzPatrick has been cleared, people out there are none too happy about the situation. According to the<i> Irish Examiner</i>, Professor Shane Kilcommins of the school of law in University of Limerick referred to "a 'fragmented' approach by a myriad of state agencies in tackling this type of crime" that was having a "demoralising effect" on society and democracy. It is having a serious effect on our democracy. Apart from this case, there are many more cases of white collar crime and other issues along the Border that have been ongoing for many years and need to be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> I will put a simple question to the Minister. I agree somewhat with Deputy Boyd Barrett, in that the issue with the case was not a lack of resources. The ODCE has a budget of €5 million and 56 staff, so it should be well able to deal with any serious issue. Despite what a number of people have said, the ODCE had some experienced people involved. In Northern Ireland, the police deal with white-collar crime. Is the Minister prepared to revert to the Government and tell it that, after the Garda Síochána has been sorted out, the ODCE should be abolished and this type of investigation should be handed over to the Garda?</p>

          <p eId="para_796">There have been a number of references to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. Its terms of reference were approved by the Government on 19 May. These include addressing the structures and management arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> I have written to the Director of Corporate Enforcement requesting a report under section 955 of the Companies Act 2014. That report will outline the issues arising from the investigations by the ODCE into Anglo Irish Bank since 2008. I have asked for that report to be furnished to me on 23 June. I will bring it to the Attorney General and the Cabinet and then before the House to determine how to proceed. I will examine procedures - if necessary, everything will be on the table - and discuss solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> I know that people are outraged. I am extremely disappointed, too, but I cannot show my outrage here. It is my task, with Deputies, the Attorney General and the Cabinet, to find solutions. Everything is on the table. I am not defending what happened - it was appalling.

          <p eId="para_814"> I want to address the question of resources. For 2011, I have the transcripts of a meeting which took place where the ODCE assured people, including my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality, that it had adequate resources. That meeting took place on 16 March 2011, with the following in attendance: Seán Gorman, then Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; Seán Aylward, then Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality; then Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan; and Kevin O'Connell of the ODCE. In response to inquiries, both the Garda and the ODCE stressed that, as far as they were concerned, they had adequate resources, according to a note taken at that meeting. The Garda had 47 people involved in the inquiry and the ODCE had 16. The Commissioner stressed that both himself and his predecessor had at all times ensured that the Garda team had all the resources it required, and that was the answer our Department got. For its part, the ODCE said it was satisfied with the resources available to it and that it had received anything it had looked for. What happened-----</p>

          <p eId="para_816">Since the judge's findings and the acquittal of Mr. FitzPatrick, has the Minister met the senior staff, in particular the director, of the ODCE? She told the Dáil minutes ago that she has asked the director for a report for 23 June. However, has she or her senior officials, such as her Secretary General, met the director and, as necessary, senior staff in the ODCE?</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> When I was speaking I put it to the Minister that the ODCE, arising from this shambles, has been shown to be entirely inadequate in regard to the prosecution of white collar crime, which by the way is an extremely difficult area in every country of the world. Does the Minister share my view that there should be a white collar crime criminal assets bureau, in other words, a new organisation which would function in parallel to the existing Criminal Assets Bureau but which would deal with what is broadly described as white collar crime?</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> The Minister mentioned she was commissioning a report. She also mentioned that she is asking, as she is entitled to do under section 955, for a report from the director of the ODCE. Is the report she mentioned one she is commissioning from an independent expert or just the report from the ODCE?</p>

          <p eId="para_823">I would like the Minister to respond to the suggestion I made that this whole thing stinks to high heaven because the series of events simply defy credibility in terms of being characterised as blunders. Mr. O'Connell in court emphasised that many other people knew how the investigation was being conducted. According to him, the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, in March 2011 received a report outlining the progress of the investigation and noting that the extent to which witnesses required the assistance of legal advisers was unusual and uncommon in the experience of the Garda. Therefore, the then Minister knew. Will the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, confirm that the then Minister knew and explain why alarm bells did not ring? We were told the DPP in December 2010 was made aware of the manner in which the statements were taken to some extent, so the DPP knew there were problems with how statements were being taken. The Garda knew they were not taking the statements, even though this was not supposed to be the case, and that means the current Commissioner, Nóirín O'Sullivan, or the then Commissioner would have known. Are we asking them? Did the Minister's Department have any discussion with the Garda Commissioner or other gardaí about the irregularities? The lead prosecutor shredded documents, documents he said he never read, but there is no prosecution or no investigation into the shredding of the documents.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">From listening to the discussion it is clear that white collar crime is not taken seriously in this country. It was said people are outraged. I do not think they are outraged; I think they are not surprised at what happened in this court case because they did not expect any other outcome. Working-class people in particular did not expect anyone to be prosecuted for what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> I have several questions. Obviously, the ODCE is not fit for purpose but, in the interim, has the Minister any intention to increase staff or funding for this office? At what stage did the Minister become aware of the serious failings and problems within the ODCE in regard to this case? Due to the failure of the ODCE while under the Minister's Department, is she happy to keep it within the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or does she think it would be more successful under the watch of another Department? More importantly, if this case was so flawed and unsound, why did it take 127 days of a trial and millions of euro, which were no doubt wasted on legal services, to realise it could not proceed?</p>

          <p eId="para_842">First, I said that I had asked the director of the ODCE to send me a report as soon as possible, that is, on or before 23 June.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The reason for this is that we do not have the transcript of the court case. Huge sections of it are closed off. It has been very sensitive. Even the jury was not there. I cannot investigate something when we do not know what happened in court. As I said, the director of the ODCE has gone to the courts to seek the transcript so that we will have a better sense of what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> I am being asked questions left, right and centre. Everyone wants to protect the independence of the ODCE, the DPP and the courts. Yet some Deputies are then asking me to be answerable for the courts and the DPP. I am sorry; I cannot take questions that should be addressed to the DPP or to the judge. That is the way it is. I clearly stated in my opening remarks that I will get this report, go to the Attorney General and then come back to the Dáil. I will tell Deputies plain and squarely what happened. We can go from there to find solutions in order to ensure that this never happens again.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> I say to Deputy Boyd Barrett that I equally know people in Dún Laoghaire who were absolutely affected. I was a school principal and there were children coming into our school who had suffered. He should not have this outrage as if we are all to blame. There were serious issues within that, irrespective of the resources. I will address resources in a moment. However, this was not down to resources. A person who shredded evidence and a person who coached witnesses - that is a totally different matter-----</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Eoghan Murphy)<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_898">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> I welcome the opportunity to debate the legislation concerning the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman. As Deputies are aware, the Government published the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill 2017 on 10 May and today's Second Stage debate on the general principles of the Bill is a positive step in the progress of this significant legislation which deals with a number of important issues for consumers of financial services and pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> The Bill will amend, update and consolidate into one Bill all of the legislation underpinning the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman with the aim of forming a unitary structure and amalgamating the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman into the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. The Government decision to amalgamate both offices follows the recommendation of a critical review under the public service reform plan. In the drafting of the Bill, the Department undertook a full regulatory impact analysis, including a public consultation process along with a series of consultations with relevant stakeholders - both public and industry representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> The Financial Services Ombudsman is an independent statutory officer who deals with unresolved complaints from consumers about their dealings with regulated financial services providers. The statutory role of the Pensions Ombudsman is to investigate complaints of financial loss due to maladministration and disputes of fact or law relating to occupational pension schemes, trust retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts. The Pensions Ombudsman performs these functions independently and acts as an impartial adjudicator. Given that financial investments and pensions are increasingly becoming intermingled, the merging of these two offices will provide a simpler process for consumers who will have a one-stop shop for complaints on the wide range of products falling within the two general areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> Since the Government agreement on the outline heads of Bill, both offices have been physically merged in one location on Lincoln Place. In addition, recent legislative changes under the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2015 have enabled the appointment of the Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Ger Deering, as Pensions Ombudsman in May of 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> The detailed heads of Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny on 27 October 2016, along with a Sinn Féin Private Members' Bill on the Financial Services Ombudsman, namely, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014. I welcome the scrutiny report of the joint committee which has provided a useful service to this House. I am particularly glad that the report recognises the improvements for consumers the Government's legislation will bring to financial investments and pensions. The report, in its analysis of the general scheme of the Bill, recommended changes in the heads that would bring further clarity to its proposals. I have reviewed the committee's recommendations and I assure Deputies that these recommendations have been addressed in the published Bill, where it proved feasible to do so. I look forward to discussing the detailed provisions on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> In drafting this legislation, the Department of Finance reviewed the legislation underpinning the Pensions Ombudsman - the Pensions Act 1990, inserted by the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002, and the Financial Services Ombudsman, Part 7 of the Central Bank Act 1942, as inserted by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004. The published Bill is more comprehensive and provides for a number of improvements to the existing legislation. First, it amalgamates the Offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and Pensions Ombudsman. Second, and most importantly, it consolidates and updates the legislation, including the extension of the time limits for complaints. I will now outline the key features of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> Part 1 deals with preliminary matters. As is the normal practice, this Part contains definitions of terms used throughout the Bill. An important definition is that of a financial services "consumer" which is defined as meaning in general terms individuals, small businesses - sole traders, partnerships and companies - charities, clubs and so on. Small businesses are those businesses with an annual turnover of €3 million or less. Part 1 also sets out the power of the Minister for Finance to make regulations and outlines the type of regulations he can make, including the ability to specify additional classes of persons who may make a complaint to the ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> Section 3 sets out the new dual funding structure of the merged body. The existing levy on financial services industry is maintained, but it should be noted that moneys will continue to be received from the Oireachtas in so far as they relate to the investigation of complaints regarding pension providers, reflecting the current funding of the Pensions Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> Section 5 refers to Schedule 1, which lists all the legislation and statutory instruments to be repealed and revoked on the relevant commencement date. We are repealing Part VII of the Central Bank Act 1942 and Part XI of the Pensions Act 1990 which set up the respective ombudsman offices originally.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> Part 2 establishes the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. Part 2 also gives the Minister for Finance the power, by order, to appoint a day as the establishment day for the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. This Part provides that the power to appoint the ombudsman and deputy ombudsman will be the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, having consulted with the Minister for Social Protection, from a list of candidates following a Public Appointments Service competition. This Part also sets out the functions of the ombudsman and deputy ombudsman, the terms of their employment, and the ability to remove the ombudsman from office on certain grounds. Terms and conditions of the staff of the office, including consultants and advisers or both working in the office, are also dealt with under this Part. Their obligation to deal with information confidentially is also covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> Section 18 outlines the power of the ombudsman to exchange information with the Central Bank of Ireland or the Pensions Authority as appropriate, which is a very important provision that we have reproduced from the original legislation. Part 2 also sets out the accounting and reporting requirements of the office, including the accountability of the ombudsman to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> Part 3 sets out the functions that are to be dissolved or transferred to the new bodies, including transitional provisions pertaining to staff, accounts and the council. Specifically, Chapter 1 dissolves the former Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau, the Financial Services Ombudsman Council and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman. All of the functions that were vested in the Financial Services Ombudsman or the Pensions Ombudsman are, on and from the establishment day, to be transferred to the ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> All reference in enactments to the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman are to be taken as references to the new Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman upon establishment day. All land and other property, and rights and liabilities, and records that belonged to any of the dissolved bodies are to be transferred to the office under Chapter 1 of this Part.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Chapter 2 transfers staff and superannuation from the dissolved bodies to the new office. Chapter 3 deals with the final accounts and annual reports of the dissolved bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> Part 4 establishes the new Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Council. To reflect the changing workload of the council, the Bill reduces its membership from a maximum of ten members to a maximum of seven. One member is required to have pensions experience, while one will need to have financial services knowledge, and now at least two members must have knowledge of consumer protection or consumer issues. The members will be appointed by the Minister from a short list of more than three persons following a competition by the Public Appointments Service. One member with pensions experience will be nominated for appointment by the Minister for Social Protection. The Minister for Finance shall appoint a chairperson from among members of the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> In the context of the amalgamation of the two bodies, the Minister for Finance has maintained the prominent oversight role the council plays but has made some changes. He proposes to remove the regulation-making power of the council with respect to how the ombudsman operates. Instead, the Minister, rather than the council, will have the regulation-making power under section 4 relating to the operation of the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. This can be done either on the Minister's own initiative or at the request of the ombudsman, having consulted with the council and the ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> The council will continue to keep the efficiency and effectiveness of the office under review, but it will no longer be responsible for the appointment of the ombudsman or deputy ombudsman. The council will maintain its role in approving the draft statement of accounts prepared by the ombudsman, before they are to be submitted to the Minister for Finance. A notable change in the legislation is the new funding structure of the amalgamated body, part-industry for financial services complaints and part-Exchequer for pension complaints. For that reason, the council will continue to determine and prescribe, by regulation, the levies or fees to be paid to the ombudsman by financial services providers. Further provisions in respect of the operation of the council are set out in Schedule 2.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> Part 5 outlines the type of complaints that can be made to the ombudsman and the format in which they should be submitted. In the context of the conduct of a financial services provider, a person can complain about: the provision of financial services; an offer of financial services; or failure to provide financial services. Regarding the conduct of a pension provider, a person can complain about financial loss or a dispute in respect of pensions. Part 5 also sets out some practical arrangements such as the provision for a complaint to be continued on the death of a complainant. This is a new provision for financial services complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> Section 47 outlines the powers of the ombudsman regarding an investigation and section 48 sets out transitional provisions for the investigation of complaints that were made before establishment day. Section 50 sets out rules in respect of the option of staying of court proceedings where a complaint is being investigated by the ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> Part 6 outlines the complaints procedure that consumers will be subject to once the Bill is enacted, including the most significant change in the legislation. This change relates to an extension to the time limits applicable for complaints to the ombudsman, which I will outline in a moment. Section 50 outlines the matters within the jurisdiction of the ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> It is worth noting that some significant changes are proposed in this Part of the Bill. For example, it contains provisions for the ombudsman to adopt rules of procedure with regard to dealing with complaints and to publish the rules. The changes have been proposed with the intention of providing more clarity and certainty for the consumer about the process for dealing with complaints and it will also help them to understand what to expect when the ombudsman is dealing with a complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> The Bill outlines the steps involved in the resolution of a complaint ranging from internal dispute resolution to investigation of the complaint by the ombudsman. There are related provisions in respect of mediation and adjudication. The Minister for Finance is retaining the requirement for consumers to first try to resolve the matter with the internal dispute process of the provider of the financial or pension product. However, the Minister is now allowing the Ombudsman to waive the internal dispute process in certain cases such as when the ombudsman determines a complaint is of such importance as to warrant waiving the process. This also means that in cases where the provider may be seen to frustrate the process, the ombudsman can intervene.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> I wish to emphasise the fact that the Bill continues to provide for mediation as a tool for the ombudsman in cases where he sees fit, while at the same time strengthening the role of the ombudsman in promoting engagement in the mediation process. A key feature of the legislation is the increased communication between the ombudsman and complainants. Under the proposed provisions, once the ombudsman has considered a complaint, he may now issue a preliminary decision which will indicate the potential decision to be made and the evidence considered in arriving at this. This will ensure that all parties to a complaint will be aware of developments in respect of it and will have the opportunity to ensure that the ombudsman has all evidence necessary for making a final decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> Part 6 also sets out the redress available to consumers. The ombudsman can direct a financial services provider to pay compensation of up to €250,000 and he can also direct other measures, for example, rectification. Such rectification can be very significant as it can involve putting a person back to the position in which they previously were before the complaint arose. Part 6 also details the manner in which the ombudsman can publicise decisions which is a new measure to increase transparency for consumers and providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> Section 51 sets out the new time limits applicable to complaints made to the ombudsman. The current legislation prohibits the Financial Services Ombudsman from examining any aspect of a complaint where the conduct being complained of occurred more than six years from receipt of the complaint in his office. Extensive research was undertaken by the Department into designing the most appropriate time limit achievable within the law that would provide the necessary protection to consumers over the longer term. In this regard, my Department engaged with stakeholders, analysed views received from the public consultation process, and sought advices from the Office of the Attorney General on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> The Bill extends the time limits for complaints in respect of certain long-term financial services to the same time limit that currently applies to pension products, namely, six years from date of the conduct complained of or three years from the date the complainant knew or ought reasonably to have known about the conduct. The rationale for this expansion is that those who have long-term financial services may not become aware of an event to be complained of until their service or product matures and they should have some access to the ombudsman at that stage. Long-term financial services are, in basic terms, services that exceed five years and one month.</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> The new time limits for long-term financial services will apply to complaints made to the ombudsman about conduct that occurred during or after 2002 and the service in which complaint is about must not have expired or otherwise been terminated more than six years before the date of complaint. This 15-year period, that is, from 2002 to 2017, is inspired by the long stop recommended by the Law Reform Commission, which was considering a new discoverability time limit for personal injury claims. The introduction of a long stop prevents the opening up of stale cases and gives some certainty to the parties as to the cut-off time for bringing actions. The Bill also provides an extra discretion to the ombudsman to extend the time limit that would benefit consumers of long-term financial services and pensions in cases where it is just and reasonable, similar to the provision that currently exists for pensions complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> Part 7 sets out the rules relating to appealing decisions of the ombudsman to the courts and court applications. The steps involved in appealing a decision of the ombudsman to the High Court on a point of law are detailed under this Part. Furthermore, Part 7 deals with the ability of the Circuit Court to enforce a direction of the ombudsman and the ability of the latter to refer a question of law to the High Court. Finally, Part 7 includes transitional provisions for appeals in the court system of complaints already in the system before establishment day.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> Part 8 outlines some other transitional provisions for the saving of regulations made by the former council and the transfer of functions from the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau to the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> Part 9 contains consequential drafting amendments to the Central Bank Act 1942 and the Freedom of Information Act 2014. Part 10 contains miscellaneous provisions such as the ability for the ombudsman to co-operate and exchange information with the Central Bank of Ireland, the Registrar of Credit Unions and the Pensions Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> Part 10 empowers the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to partake in the memorandum of understanding on a cross-border out-of-court complaints network for financial services in the European Economic Area, EEA.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> Schedule 1 sets out all the repeals and revocations that must be made to Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments on foot of this new legislation. Schedule 2 sets out the operational matters in relation to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> To summarise, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill will amend, update, and consolidate into one Bill all of the legislation underpinning the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman. It has the aim of forming a unitary structure amalgamating the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman into the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO. The measures I have outlined will strengthen the functions of the new ombudsman and improve the experience for consumers of both pensions and financial services. As Members are aware, there are many consumers for whom this Bill is a pressing issue, particularly the proposed change to the rules regarding the period in which the ombudsman can investigate complaints. With that in mind, I hope that this Bill can be sent forward to Committee Stage, at which point it can be discussed in more detail.</p>

            <p eId="para_942">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 4 and 5 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_943"> Of course we need to provide affordable homes for people. The approach we are taking is different from the way it was done previously. What ended in 2011 was an affordable housing scheme. We are now trying to put together affordable housing projects as part of schemes on a case-by-case basis. We have asked local authorities to publish, in a very transparent way and for everybody to see, the 700 sites throughout the State where local authorities own public land that is suitable for housing. We have asked local authorities to produce a development plan for each of those sites. We want the local authorities to design an affordable element within those plans. Sometimes it will be a certain percentage of social housing, a certain percentage of affordable housing and a certain parentage of private housing. Depending on where the site is in the country and the demand in that area, the construct of that affordable housing plan will be different.</p>
            <p eId="para_944"> Last week, after quite a lot of negotiation and discussion with Dublin City Council and even though Sinn Féin voted against it in the end, there was agreement among a majority of councillors on Dublin City Council on how, through a massive planning process, we would develop on the Poolbeg Irish Glass Bottle site, which is a privately owned piece of land. This will involve some affordable and social housing. It will also include some specialist social housing for older people and so on. We are trying to ensure we have mixed tenure, diverse, healthy communities as part of many projects around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_945"> Sometimes projects may be all affordable housing and sometimes they may be 10%, 15% or 20% affordable housing. The prudent thing to do here is to demand of local authorities to come back to us with proposals that suit the area and the site. We will then sign off on the affordable housing projects. We need to give guidance to some local authorities around the thresholds under which and over which people will qualify for those affordable housing schemes. Let us consider the docklands in Dublin as an example. Affordable housing was provided through many of the apartment developments in the docklands and the affordable housing was allocated through the drawing of lots. That is the kind of template we want to see as part of mixed tenure communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_946"> With regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's comment, we are not giving away sites to private developers; it is not happening. We will ensure we will get a full State public interest dividend from every one of those sites. The dividend may be in the form of affordable housing, it may be social housing or it could be something else. If appropriate, it could be cash but in most cases I do not think it will be. We are trying to do social housing differently from the ways in which it was done in the past. We are trying to build stronger and more progressive communities than has been the case previously in how the State approached social housing. It is in this context I encourage local authorities to be ambitious in their proposals around affordable housing schemes as part of how they use and develop landbanks we have throughout the country and which have the capacity to deliver 50,000 houses. I believe it is about 5,000 acres over 700 sites. It is a significant opportunity. We are doing it differently from the way it was done in the past. It will result in much healthier communities and a lot more affordable housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_948"> The Government has no plans at this stage to introduce a new affordable housing purchase scheme of the kind that existed up to 2011. However, the Government recognises the housing affordability pressures in certain areas and is determined to see increases in the supply of high-quality social and affordable homes, to buy or rent, as quickly as possible, particularly in the major urban areas where demand is greatest.</p>
            <p eId="para_949"> At a strategic level, under the new 20-year national planning framework, there will be an emphasis on managing and utilising State lands to deliver housing and to ensure an active and healthy market for development land. The opening up of State-owned lands for the development of mixed tenure housing is also a key objective under Rebuilding Ireland. Rebuilding Ireland also commits to the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the provision of affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent. As set out in the strategy for the rental sector, this commitment is being progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones and leveraging the value of State-owned sites to deliver units for rental, targeting middle-income households.</p>
            <p eId="para_950"> On 27 April 2017, I published the Rebuilding Ireland housing land map, a vital initial step in the new strategic approach to State land management. The datasets published on the map include details of more than 700 local authority and housing agency owned sites, totalling some 1,700 ha, as well 30 sites covering about 200 ha owned by State or semi-State bodies. The map is available to view on the Rebuilding Ireland website.</p>
            <p eId="para_951"> It is crucial that much-needed housing for families and individuals on the social housing waiting list, and for those on low to middle incomes, is delivered from local authority and State-owned sites as soon as possible. In the first instance, the specific approach to housing delivery on each site, including the optimum tenure mix, is a matter for the local authority concerned, the elected council members included, who best understand the housing needs in their area. In this regard, I welcome the fact that two of the Dublin local authorities have brought forward four key large-scale sites capable of delivering 3,000 of these new homes, and I expect other local authorities to follow suit.</p>
            <p eId="para_952"> Mixed tenure development on publicly-owned land provides the best way forward to deliver social and affordable housing quickly in a fully integrated and sustainable community. Importantly, it allows for risk-sharing and far quicker delivery of social housing and badly needed housing more generally as part of the full development of individual sites. Opening up the supply of State land in this way, for mixed-tenure housing, is a critically important intervention in addressing a situation where the pace of recovery in the house development sector is slower than we would like it to be. In practical terms, the development of these sites will mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.</p>
            <p eId="para_953"> I am committed to ensuring the State secures the most beneficial use of its currently under-utilised assets for much-needed housing in the shortest possible timeframe and maximises the public good dividend through increased and speedier delivery of high-quality social and affordable homes. My Department is working closely with local authorities and other State agencies to ensure that the optimum mix of social and affordable housing is delivered from public landbanks in the shortest possible timeframe and in a manner which achieves value for money and the best possible housing outcomes. The approach to be adopted to individual sites will be decided case by case, taking account of the specific aspects of each site and the particular local housing considerations arising.</p>

            <p eId="para_954">I thank the Minister for his response. I accept and acknowledge that there is potential in the future development of the sites the Minister spoke of. I would have hoped for them to come on stream much earlier than this, but I accept the mechanism under which the Minister believes the development can take place and the benefit that can accrue to the State, as he said. I would hazard a small warning on the Minister describing the projects as being assessed individually and case by case.</p>
            <p eId="para_955"> It may be that we can derive benefit from the dividend in the provision of social and affordable housing, but I would advise against the provision of cash. To be honest, the Part V scheme had that option and it did not prove fruitful for the local authorities. More importantly, it did not prove fruitful for those who were hoping to acquire or receive the benefit of a home from the scheme. I ask the Minister not to consider cash as a dividend in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_956"> While I do see the merit, as private developments take place there are concerns. This week Cairn Homes, for example, announced quite substantial profits. It was public knowledge. This says that the methodology of the Government, where it sets the bar in order to encourage builders into the market, is a dangerous one. In the absence of a specific obligation on such private sector developers, a select few of whom have funds available again, it should be incumbent on them from a legislative perspective in the House to ensure there is a benefit to the State through Part V. It was a mistake to decrease it to 10%. I ask the Minister to increase it and to have 10% affordable and 10% social housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_958"> If each local authority must agree each scheme individually with the Department, will this not entail all the difficulties we currently have with the amount of time it takes between funding being given for public housing and when the homes are delivered. Is this approach not just setting up this process to have the same issues as before? There is no national scheme, and if there is to be individual agreement between the Department and the local authorities on each scheme, I would have a concern that it is going to be very slow process.</p>

            <p eId="para_966">It will not necessarily be the same as it was previously, whereby the Department has to do everything in terms of designing an affordable housing scheme and then the local authorities implement it. We are asking people to take a much more innovative approach towards building more diverse and healthier communities on publicly owned land which, in some cases, is not being used for any purpose. In some cases, the development will be 100% social housing and we will fully fund it. If that is what local authorities want to bring forward, that is fine. I am not aware that I have refused any local authority council housing projects since I became Minister. Funding is not the barrier. We are asking local authorities to look at the new housing policy that encourages mixed tenure, a mix of social, affordable, private and other specialist housing units, for elderly people in particular, such as the 81 social housing units development currently under way in Limerick city centre. It is the largest social housing site in the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_968">Yes. Some 57 of those houses are specifically being designed for elderly people. That is the type of mix we are looking for now. If local authorities need guidance, they can get it from the Department's housing delivery unit. There are teams of staff in the Department who are willing to meet local authorities to work out what is appropriate on a site-by-site basis in order that we can get a lot of development of sites at the same time. We can get private sector innovation and finance as part of the development of these sites, which means we can do a lot more a lot quicker.</p>

            <p eId="para_969">As two of the questions in this grouping are in my name, I hope that will be reflected in my time allocation. As I said earlier, I understand the mentality behind the proposal but it was late coming to the pitch. What mechanisms and processes have been put in place to adjudicate the performance and reaction to the publication of the lists in regard to each local authority? I accept each local authority's needs are different and that how sites will be developed will vary from authority to authority, place to place and so forth. Aside from publication of the list, what processes and mechanisms have been put in place to ascertain what progress is being made? In the event of proposals coming forward from the private sector, how quickly will these be responded to by the Department and local authorities? As I have previously said on several occasions, those conventional methods have failed a previous plan sanctioned by the then Minister, Deputy Kelly. His plan was very ambitious and bold and money was not a problem either but yet the results expected were not achieved. We all want to see this issue dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_970"> I will reiterate one of the questions I asked earlier because the Minister did not answer it. I accept he had a lot of questions to answer but in regard to the private developers whom, as I said, are posting large profits on foot of the Government policy which I believe increases house prices rather broadens the spectrum for which construction can take place and more houses can be provided - they are supply initiatives that we can discuss again - will the Minister give serious consideration to the reintroduction of the Part V affordable element that existed previously and ensured that where private development took place, it adhered to Part V social and affordable housing? The issue of affordable housing must be addressed with as much gusto, effort and determination as the provision of social housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_971">I agree with the Minister that funding is not a barrier and that there is need for more urgency and initiative on the part of local authorities. The Minister will be aware that when a local authority is asked why a particular initiative is not being implemented, the response is usually that the Department has not approved a particular part of it and that the Department when asked the same question will respond to the effect that the local authority has not moved on it. Is the timescale for these projects five years? Perhaps the Minister will clarify when he expects these projects to be completed. Leaving aside that we need initiative on the part of the local authorities, we need to ensure that this type of passing the buck between the Department and the local authorities stops. A site in my constituency, which I drive pass almost every day, which was supposed to be developed and inhabited in the middle of last year, is still full of weeds. When one asks the council why that project has not commenced, the response is that the Department is holding it up.</p>

            <p eId="para_974">There are 607 projects, which will comprise 10,074 housing units, at various stages in the pipeline. Some of them are in the assessment process, some are in the Part 8 process and others are on-site. I agree there is a need for urgency. When I became Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government I asked the same question that Deputy Jan O'Sullivan just asked. When I, or the Minister of State, Deputy English, visited local authorities, we were told that they could not get decisions from the Department. I probed that issue in the Department. It was not as straightforward as many people like to think. It is a convenient excuse to blame the Department for everything. There is a system in the Department that is about driving projects as quickly as is reasonable, while still carrying out a very robust assessment to ensure we get value for money. Staff visit local authorities where they meet engineers, quantity surveyors and architects to get projects approved quickly. That is happening. If there are cases where it is not happening I would like to know about them and I will ensure they are addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_975"> In regard to the sites, two of the Dublin local authorities have already brought forward four key large-scale sites that are capable of delivering 3,000 new homes. I expect other local authorities will follow suit fairly quickly. The Dublin local authorities have already advertised with regard to those four sites. In the coming months, I will be asking each local authority to produce plans for all the sites that are ready to go now. It will not be possible to have movement on the 700 sites within the same year. The target is to have delivery across all of these sites over a five-year timeframe. There will be a significant ramping up of the volume of units that is being delivered. As I said, on many of these sites the housing will be either all social housing or a significant portion of social housing. Some of them are small infill sites and others are large sites which need proper tenure mix such that essentially what would be created is a new town centre and community of the type that exists in Poolbeg, Cherrywood or Adamstown.</p>
            <p eId="para_976"> On Part V, I do not propose to repeat the mistake made in the past whereby a developer could buy out an obligation under Part V. If I understood Deputy Cowen correctly, he agrees with me in this regard. That was a big mistake at the time. Although money was handed over it often was not spent on social housing. Let us not forget that we are not building enough houses in Ireland. Many developers are not making enough money to be able to justify building a lot more houses. If I were to ask them to contribute more than 10% that would, in my view, slow down the momentum that is already starting to take hold in some parts of the country. What is encouraging is that many developers are asking to provide more than 10% because based on the plans, they can get paid upfront by the local authorities, which can help them to finance the remainder of a project. The level of social housing being provided by projects such as Poolbeg and O'Devaney Gardens, which is on State-owned land, is way beyond 10%. Some projects are providing up to 25% social housing. In the case of O'Devaney Gardens, 50% of the units are non-private housing. Different sites require different solutions and local authorities should be able to deal with them on a case-by-case basis.</p>

Sinn Féin councillors did support the final Poolbeg proposal partly because they managed, along with councillors from other parties, to get an additional 350 social houses to the 620 originally proposed. A good job was done by the councillors in Dublin City Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_980">The aim of the local infrastructure housing activation fund is to relieve critical infrastructural blockages to enable the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in urban areas with high demand for housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council received approval for funding of €15.19 million for Cherrywood for the provision of public infrastructure that will support the delivery of 2,000 housing units by 2021 and the potential for a further 6,000 homes in the longer term. LIHAF will facilitate additional social housing of 200 housing units in Cherrywood in the short term through the 10% Part V social housing dividend, with a further potential for 600 housing units in the longer term. Moreover, the overall significant increase of private housing from this strategically located and well-serviced site will help ease the pressure on the housing market generally and on rental accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_982"> In addition to the increased supply of housing generally, the Government is also seeking an increased affordability dividend for the eventual purchasers of private housing. My Department has asked Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to secure commitments from the developers in this regard. The council is currently engaging with the housing developers to conclude specific agreements relating to finalising the timelines for delivery of the housing and the required affordability commitments. My Department expects that final agreements will be in place by the end of June to facilitate the signing of a formal grant agreement with the local authority in respect of LIHAF funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_983"> In other words, we will not sign off until we see the detail of the affordability commitment developers will have to make. We are putting in €15 million and we want a dividend from that, in the context of affordability as well as getting houses built quickly.</p>

            <p eId="para_984">To summarise, the Minister's answer to my question is that he does not know, despite the fact that he has been working on the scheme for a year. A circular issued by the Department in August stated that a minimum of 40% of the homes to be delivered would be available at 10% less than the average market cost, though in Dún Laoghaire that would be no guarantee of affordability. In October the Department issued another circular rowing back on this, stating that following discussions with officials and others, the commitment would not be possible. One has to ask why a company as profitable as the company providing the houses in Cherrywood needs any LIHAF funding at all. Even if it does, the Minister designed the programme so it should not just be up to the local authority to negotiate affordability. What is the Department's threshold in terms of numbers of units and price? If, as in the August circular, it is 10% of market value in Dún Laoghaire, it comes nowhere close to being affordable and this would also be the case in many other parts of Dublin. I am concerned that the Minister does not know how he will guarantee affordability and that he has now rowed back on commitments made in the August circular.</p>

We are not going to sign off on any financing deal until we see the detail. It is up to the local authority to finalise the detail in negotiations with the various developers on site, as is the case with many of the other aspects of the Cherrywood development. We have assisted that process through the housing delivery unit, which has been very helpful and has ensured that the negotiations received the necessary urgency. The project is moving forward and we will get detail on the affordability dividend before formally signing off on LIHAF funding. The Deputy will just have to wait for that, I am afraid.</p>

            <p eId="para_988">The Minister should read his own departmental circulars. In the August circular, it stated that affordable homes would be delivered and that a minimum of 40% would be available at prices 10% below the average cost in the market. That suggests it was a target but the October circular states that it may not always be possible to deliver 40% of new homes under the LIHAF bids at prices 10% below the average market cost. The Minister was looking for a certain number of properties at a certain percentage less than the market in August but rowed back in October and is now saying that his Department is just providing the funding, with local authorities having to negotiate it. I am not making stuff up - it looks like the Department and the Minister is making this up on the hoof. Public money is being spent but unfortunately, people will not get access to greater affordability.</p>
            <p eId="para_989"> If there is not an adequate level of affordability, will the Minister pull funding from these projects? A "Yes" or "No" answer would be great.</p>

            <p eId="para_997">3. <b>Deputy Barry Cowen</b> asked the <b>Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government</b> his views on whether national planning standards should be set to increase the height of apartment buildings in view of the high break-even costs of building apartments and absence of supply of new apartment buildings despite the high demand.

            <p eId="para_998">Despite high rents it still seems uneconomic to build apartments in Dublin and major cities. If we are serious about attracting investment and financial services jobs to Dublin in the wake of Brexit, we have to provide homes but we cannot add to the sprawl in Dublin and other cities. Is the Minister open to amending national planning guidelines to allow high-rise development in order to provide apartments in cities, which would mean people could work and live in those cities?</p>

            <p eId="para_999">My Department routinely monitors the planning process and acts to ensure that it facilitates appropriate multi-unit housing developments to meet the broader housing requirements of society. My Department's 2009 guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable residential development in urban areas encourage local authorities to bring about high-quality and sustainable urban development, using their development planning and management functions to deliver quality homes and neighbourhoods where people want to live, work and raise families.  In particular, the guidelines outline a range of densities appropriate to different location types, from lower densities at the edges of smaller towns through to densities in the range of a minimum of 50 dwellings per hectare in larger urban areas along public transport corridors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000"> However, the guidelines do not set out specific policy advice in respect of height of buildings alone, in isolation from broader location, design and layout considerations nor would it be appropriate to do so, given variability in urban contexts and the inappropriateness of a one-size-fits-all height policy for very diverse urban areas.  Rather, it is a matter for local authorities to ensure the appropriate application of the guidelines in their statutory development plan and development management processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001"> Notwithstanding the above, my Department is currently in the final stages of completing a cost review of multi-unit and apartment developments, which is due to be finalised later this summer.  This review is examining the key aspects of viability issues, including building height limitations, and will inform further policy development in respect of this matter.  In light of the review outcomes, the intention is to engage further with relevant local authorities like Dublin City Council to address any building height issues arising.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002"> The Deputy will have heard me say previously that I am very much in favour of higher buildings and higher density in the right locations and we should be doing a lot more of that, particularly in Dublin but also in my own city and other cities. We do not want high-rise buildings on Georgian squares but high-rise buildings are the only way we will create significant numbers of homes, along with affordability, in Dublin city centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_1003">I agree with the Minister but he has the opportunity to make sure it happens sooner rather than later. This is relevant because of the opportunities we might have following Brexit but also, and more important, because of the crisis in housing provision and the lack of adequate units in the city to enable city living. He says a cost-effectiveness review by his Department will report in early summer but he, or whoever holds the esteemed office at that time, should provide the necessary amendments to national planning guidelines to ensure this is done, rather than engaging eternally with local authorities on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">I implore the Minister to use his office and, if necessary, to seek assistance from Members in order to bring forward legislation to provide for planning guidelines which would supersede those that apply to local authorities. I am not recommending that this happen in the suburbs but, as the Minister said, in the centre of cities such as Dublin, Cork and so on.</p>

            <p eId="para_1005">The Deputy should take cognisance of developments that are currently under way, such as the Poolbeg site. It will be the highest density residential development ever in Ireland. It will comprise 3,500 units on a medium-sized site. Several very tall buildings will be part of the scheme and will be factored into the overall design, taking account of the needs of the community and so on. That needs to be done on many other sites. I have strongly indicated to Dublin City Council in particular that it should be more ambitious in regard to building height restrictions. That can now be seen in the master planning of strategic development zones. If there is a need to legislate after examining the forthcoming report on the costings, potential problems and limitations involved in the building of apartment complexes, I will do so. Local authorities should show initiative because it is very difficult to legislate in this area and also avoid the one-size-fits-all approach which can lead to problems in some areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1006">The Minister should instruct local authorities rather than hope that they will be receptive to his wishes. Office blocks of six or seven storeys are being built on Nassau Street. I see no reason why there should not be another five or six stories of apartments on top of those developments. That is what is needed. Urban sprawl has gone too far and for too long. It has crippled the public transport system. I acknowledge there are issues in terms of parking. Student developments are being constructed across the city. They are greatly appreciated and badly needed. Restrictions on car parking are not overly severe in those developments, in spite of the fact that the developments will eventually come into wider use. The Minister needs to use the available space. There needs to be outside-the-box thinking and instruction given to local authorities, even if it is for a sunset period, in order to address this issue while we can.</p>

            <p eId="para_1007">Higher buildings are beginning to emerge. Planning permission will probably be granted in the coming weeks or months for the highest building in the country. It is to be built on a super site in the Cork docklands in the middle of the city centre. Planning permission has previously been granted for a building of 36 storeys in the docklands in Cork. It is possible for developers to develop very tall buildings if they do so in the right locations. The Deputy is asking me to legislate to require certain building heights in certain areas, or at least the facilitation of certain building heights. In some parts of Dublin, there is no restriction on the height of development for which one can apply. Planning permission has been refused for residential buildings with ambitious heights, such as a recent application for a development in Donnybrook. Perhaps planning guideline issues can be examined to ascertain if it is possible to allow more ambition from the private sector in terms of building higher buildings. However, caution is required. We have an historic and very beautiful city which needs to be protected. However, parts of Dublin have very low population density and if we are serious about providing affordable homes in the city centre, building heights must be more ambitious than previously.</p>

            <p eId="para_1010">My Department engages on a continuous basis with local authorities in regard to the advancement of all social housing construction projects.  That is done at both a Departmental and Ministerial level.

There are now over 600 social housing construction projects, which will deliver over 10,000 social housing units, listed in the status report on social housing construction projects.

            <p eId="para_1013">The most recent version of the status report on social housing construction projects was published last week. The report, which represents the construction pipeline picture at the end of quarter 1 of 2017, sets out the position on each individual project, which is possible because of the project-by-project tracking that the Department does with the local authorities. The publication of the quarterly status report is a valuable part of the oversight for these projects as it allows Members, councillors, stakeholders and the public to view the status of projects in their areas and to track their progress over time. The pipeline of projects increased by some 1,600 units in quarter 1 of 2017 alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014"> In addition to the systematic arrangements for engagement between the Department and local authorities, as I have said, the Minister and I have regular engagements with local authorities regarding their social housing programmes. These interactions, at both ministerial and departmental levels, will continue in the months and years ahead. It is important that is done because we are trying to strengthen the relationship between the Department and local authorities at staff and political levels. We have engaged with all parties on this issue. To strengthen that relationship is the right way deal with this issue. Social housing provision targets will only be achieved with the co-operation of local authorities and the approved housing bodies. Local authorities are central to this issue and have a significant role to play. We will continue to support their part in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015"> Social housing figures are published in order that Deputy Ó Broin and others can track the figures and understand the facts. Figures published are based on evidence and are not made up.</p>

            <p eId="para_1016">I thank the Minister for his response. I am aware of the quarterly reports. One battle in regard to them was that they be published in an open source format in which the figures could be analysed and the details examined. All Members must be realistic and honestly admit that a blame game is still taking place between the Department and local authorities. That has gone on for more than a year, even after the Minister, with the best of intentions, reduced the eight-stage process to four stages. Full transparency is the only solution. An application from a local authority should be dated when it arrives at the Department and then dated on each occasion it moves from one stage to the next. It would be better if the four stage process could be time-bound. That could cause problems but it would at least be possible to identify where the problem is.</p>

            <p eId="para_1017">The Department and the Minister have a difficulty with numbers. The Minister does not now how many people will sleep in emergency accommodation tonight nor how many new builds are under construction. There are not 10,000 social housing units in the pipeline. I have examined the figures very carefully. In my constituency, a third of the units listed do not exist, are not in pre-planning and are never going to happen. The Department and the housing managers know that to be the case. If, as I suspect, the status of a third of units in my constituency is replicated across the entire 10,000 units, that they are in the pipeline means that a civil servant put them on a piece of paper and nothing more than that. The Department needs to become more honest in regard to the figures it publishes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018"> In regard to the substantive query, the real issue is that there should be a single stage process. The Department is delaying the construction of social housing from 18 to 24 months. The Government was able to rush through emergency legislation to assist big developers of private housing developments of 100 units or more. It must reform the four stage process, make it one stage and take the leash off the local authorities so they can build the houses that people need.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">I accept that the blame game went on for many years. It is not currently being played. In some local authorities, there was a concern as to whether funding would be available if a local authority were to pursue strongly a social housing project it was asked to develop by the Department. All Members support what is being done in regard to social housing, at a minimum, and are committed that the €5.3 billion that has been allocated to it be spent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">Some Members want to spend even more and I accept that as well. I have given assurances to local authority members and managers that they can get on with this. What happened under previous Governments, when funding was stopped after local authorities were told to progress sites, is not going to happen. That is very clear. I am doing that on behalf of the Dáil. This is not the Government trying to claim credit here. Everybody in this House supports the spend on social housing and wants it to continue. It is something that we are pushing because it was delaying projects, and even delaying to the commitment to pipeline projects. The fear was that it could be cut off again. That is not happening.</p>

            <p eId="para_1021">It would be great if we could get to a one-stage process. That is probably unrealistic, but equally we have to admit that there is duplication of the decision making process. I have not studied the latest report, which was issued last week, because it is not yet available in Excel format. We are still looking at it in PDF format. There were 508 projects going through the Departments. Some 32 of those were for single units that are forced to go through a four-stage process. The bureaucracy in that regard makes no sense at all. Some 49% of the total projects were for fewer than ten units. The whole programme of delivering social housing is quite small and it is not challenging. A project with 100 units has to go through the very same process as that relating to one unit. This matter must be examined.</p>

I have asked our Department and the local authorities to consider the way that the same method is being used to deliver schools under the devolved grant scheme. That worked quite well and everybody got on board with it eventually. It was started by Noel Dempsey, and I totally accept that. People should not be afraid of the risk associated with the single stage process. All of us working for the delivery of housing know that there is a need to change the processes. That is what we are trying to do. That is why the interaction of our staff and the staff of the local authorities has increased dramatically and why on-site meetings are happening much more often. The availability is there. We have to eliminate the delays and the blame game associated with them. That should not be there any more, because there is no excuse for delay. In defence of both sides, there were not sufficient staff two or three years ago to deal with this. An extra 500 staff have been sanctioned to work on housing projects in the past year and that will help to make it faster as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026"> On Deputy Wallace's question, we have no problem with an analysis of our 10,000 pipeline projects. I will get that done. They are available online and can be analysed. We are not saying that they are all under construction. They are all at different stages of the pipeline.</p>

            <p eId="para_1031">I thought that the question related to Part V. I will answer and then I will give the information that I have.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032"> My Department recently published an updated status report on social housing construction projects, containing details of all approved social housing construction projects, including in the Galway City Council area. It outlines locations and details for ten projects in Galway city, delivering 134 new social homes. The council has also recently submitted further social housing proposals, including construction projects by the council and the approved housing bodies, AHBs. These are being actively assessed and when approved will be added to the status report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033"> The exact timing for the advancement of each of these projects will be a matter for the council. However, I have been clear with the council that funding is available to support early delivery. I was in Galway recently to meet members of the council and I made it very clear that we want these projects to move much quicker and that we also want the number of projects to increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034"> In addition to the projects listed in the status report, 73 new social homes are planned for Ballyburke. These were included in the second bundle of the social housing public private partnership programme. Also in addition to the projects listed in the status report are new social homes that have been acquired either through purchase or long-term lease directly by the council or in conjunction with AHBs from various sources, including NAMA and directly from property owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035"> The development of new social homes under Part V arrangements will be dependent on the advancement of new construction projects in the private sector. While it is not possible to identify the precise numbers that will be delivered at this stage, I have assured all local authorities that funding will be made available to secure these units and my Department is in ongoing contact with the local authorities in this regard. I understand that Galway City Council anticipates an escalation to between 30 and 40 Part V units per annum from 2018 onwards depending on the level of construction of developments of ten or more units taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036"> Following my conversation with both local authorities in Galway, the lack of planning applications coming forward for both private and social housing is of major concern. They have now fully engaged with us on the Ireland 2040 process to see if we can increase the figures. We have also asked them to work with our Department to see if we can activate more sites in Galway. I am very concerned at the lack of construction activity in Galway. The councillors I met that day share the same concern. The Department is open to working with the councillors on that. We told them that the funding is there and that there will be no delay on our side.</p>

            <p eId="para_1037">I am not clear. I welcome that the Minister of State is concerned and that he is saying that houses will be built. I am asking a very specific question, which I asked in the written form. How many city council houses will be completed this year and in each of the next five years? The most recent figure we got for the waiting list was 4,720 households going back to 2002. At a conservative estimate, this means that approximately 15,000 people are waiting for homes. Significantly, in the recent report the council has refused to give the data. I presume the position has worsened. In addition, there are 29 homeless families in Galway city who are being put up in bed and breakfast accommodation, hotels or other accommodation. It is really at breaking point. My question is very specific. How many houses will be built by the city council this year? I understood that it was 14. Will those 14 alone be completed or are there more? How many will be completed in the next five years?</p>

            <p eId="para_1038">I am not being awkward with Deputy Connolly. I understood her question to specifically relate to Part V housing. She referred to the Urban Regeneration and Housing Acts. I apologise that I do not have the exact figures the Deputy has requested but I have answered the question she asked.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039"> On other social housing, on the construction front Galway City Council currently have two local authority construction projects in the pipeline to deliver 69 units at a cost of some €16.3 million. There are two phases of one overall development at Ballymoneen Road and these are currently under construction. The other 55 units are at the design stage and will hopefully go on site at the end of this year or in early 2018. There are eight other AHB projects in the pipeline in Galway city. Two of these, involving 18 units, have now been completed. The remaining six, involving 47 units, are at various stages of development. On phase two of the Ballymoneen Road scheme which I referred to earlier there will be at least 55 units. A design team will soon be put in place to ensure that we get the maximum use of that site as well. There are other possibilities there as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_1040">The question is very clear. I asked the Minister of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government the number of social housing units that will be completed in 2017 and in each of the five years thereafter. I then go on to ask for further information. At this point, we are looking at 14 houses this year, with a bit of luck, in a city which has 15,000 people on a waiting list. The only game in town in Galway is the housing assistance payment, HAP, which is putting money into the hands of the landlords. This is notwithstanding the fact that Galway has been designated a rent pressure zone and that those payments are therefore limited. One cannot rent a house in Galway for love nor money. We have the most serious homelessness crisis. The figures from the Department are directly at odds with what the city council are reporting. There were 185 homeless individuals in March, and the figure from the council is 21 families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">The Department does not have a clear idea of how many are homeless or what land is zoned as residential. It cannot possibly plan for a crisis if it does not have the right figures.</p>

            <p eId="para_1044">It did not appear to be additional in the question we had. We answered that question. I have no problem getting all the information the Deputy wants. The question we had, which we answered, was in respect of Part V. It is a demand-led scheme and we could not give exact figures for it. If it is of help to the Deputy, I can tell her what projects are due for delivery in 2017 with approved housing bodies. Túath has two projects: 12 units at Reilean at Roscam, and another six at Maoilin, Ballymoneen Road. Co-operative Housing Ireland, which I met recently, has delivered 23 units that are being tenanted at the moment. Clúid has acquired 39 units which are being tenanted at the moment as well. There are also two more with Clúid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045"> I am not happy with what Galway is bringing forward across the board in social housing. The Department is not happy and neither are the authorities in Galway. That is why we met them. We have asked them to increase activity across all the schemes, even when it comes to using vacant properties. There is a new scheme which we went through in detail with them. We have encouraged them to acquire more houses so they can get value for money as well. They have land. We have asked them to activate their sites. They brought forward one project under local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding. It did not pass the test as it was not going to deliver enough units. They have other options and we have told them that the Department will engage with them fully to bring forward housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_1047">Right across the country, there are numerous smaller housing estates with proprietary treatment plants, often serving ten or 15 houses. In many cases, the treatment plant is not operating, which is causing pollution, blockages and difficulty for householders. They want to put it right but are struggling to do so. They cannot get access to the taking-in-charge initiative. Irish Water does not want them. Councils have no budgets for upgrading sewerage plants and the residents cannot afford to do the work.

            <p eId="para_1048">My Department’s new multi-annual rural water programme 2016 to 2018 was developed through a working group of key stakeholders involving local authorities, the water services transition office, Irish Water, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, as well as my Department. The programme provides for the funding of demonstration group sewerage schemes through measure 4(d), where clustering of households on individual septic tanks is not a viable option, particularly from an environmental perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049"> Local authorities were invited in January 2016 to submit bids under the programme. The invitation envisaged no more than two demonstration group sewerage projects being brought forward under the measure in any one year of the three-year programme. The demonstrations will allow my Department, over the course of the programme, to determine the appropriate enduring funding levels and relationship with the current grant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050"> As new demonstration group schemes have been identified for the duration of the programme, and as only two demonstration projects can be advanced in any given year, my Department does not propose to modify the programme at this point. My Department will give consideration to the scope of the measure under the programme from 2019 onwards having regard to the implementation of the existing multi-annual rural water programme 2016 to 2018. My Department will also be giving wider consideration to the report of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services as it relates to the rural water programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051"> This issue has been raised by many other colleagues, including Deputy Durkan, who is also in the Chamber. We are aware of the matter but there is no scheme in place with enough money to deal with all the applications. Deputy Aindrias Moynihan's own area of Cork would have applied for about five under that scheme. There were 83 in total. We are limited to two per year at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1052">I thank the Minister of State. He is focusing on the fact that only two schemes are being carried out each year. The big issue is that they are aimed at plants that would be taken in charge. These developments are never intended to be taken in charge. They are to be stand-alone plants. A management company is often supposed to have been put in place although it might never have got off the ground. The fact that the plants would not be taken in charge is one of the reasons the residents are not able to access the existing grant scheme. The scheme needs to be modified. We are really only talking about small money. Less than €2 million a year is spent on the current scheme and often the maximum allocation is not spent. The scheme is due for renewal over the next year so it is an opportune time to consider modifying it. We have people who recognise that there is a problem and want to take action and do the right thing but cannot afford to.</p>

            <p eId="para_1053">I would probably agree with the Deputy. The scheme is being reviewed and we should see if we can modify it. A number of Deputies have brought forward different projects and solutions. There is often a question mark over the costing rather than the funding of such projects. Different suggestions have much lower costs associated with them in terms of estimates and so on. That is something we are analysing as well. We will look at it. As it stands, we do not currently have the funding to bring forward any more projects. It is something for the review and I would be happy to consider different ways to make it happen.</p>

She has spearheaded this issue for a long time. The question is about the status of the dog breeding establishment guideline review. We tabled the question because the legislation that is currently in place is not effective. The enforcement of those regulations, poor and all as they are, is practically non-existent and there is a big concern that the review will not be completed as there are media reports to that effect.

            <p eId="para_1058">I thank the Deputy for her question. I am not sure why it was not grouped with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's question. I do not know if that is up to us or somebody else. I will check that. I have acknowledged Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's work in this area on many occasions. I have had some debates with her here on it as well. I appreciate Deputy Daly mentioning that and recognise the work of Deputy MaureenO'Sullivan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059"> The Dog Breeding Establishment Act 2010 provides a robust regulatory framework for,<i> inter alia</i>, the licensing, monitoring and inspection of dog breeding establishments by local authorities and, where a serious and immediate threat exists to public health or animal health and welfare, for the closure of such establishments. More generally, the enforcement of welfare standards regarding all animals is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. A joint inspection regime of dog breeding establishments, involving the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the local authority veterinary service, was inaugurated in 2015 for the purpose of inspection and follow-up action. </p>
            <p eId="para_1060"> My Department is in the process of reviewing the current dog breeding establishment guidelines, in collaboration with the County and City Management Association's dogs working group. Following the production of a first draft revision of the guidelines, it was considered important to broaden the review of the guidelines to a more formal public consultation, both for quality assurance and to address the need for openness and inclusiveness. A wide-scale formal public consultative process commenced on 1 December 2016 and closed on 28 February 2017. My Department is currently reviewing the feedback and data received through the process. I expect the findings to be submitted to me in June 2017, which I will consider carefully and without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061"> I can commit that the review will be completed. I can guarantee that much from my end. It is a matter in which I have an interest, mainly because of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who brought it to my attention. We will try to complete the review as quickly as we can in the Department. I understand that the overall process has gone on for over 18 months at this stage and would be happy to bring it to an end. I hope to do so in the months ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_1062">There will be some comfort taken from the fact that the review has not been shelved. That was a genuine concern. It is precisely because there is not a robust regulatory regime in existence that the review of the guidelines is imminently necessary. There are 73 registered puppy farms in Ireland with at least 30,000 dogs being produced every year. That is 410 dogs per misnamed puppy farm - these are not farms but industrial scale dog breeding establishments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">The comparative figure in Britain is approximately 78 per farm. This is a seriously profitable concern. Many illegal farms exist too. Welfare organisations have said that some farms have more than 500 breeding dogs. The DSPCA maintains that the number should be limited to ten or fewer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064"> We have been identified as Europe's puppy farm capital. This is certainly something we do not want. Last August, the BBC broadcast a documentary that exposed the puppy farm industry, especially in Cavan. It highlighted the lack of enforcement by Cavan County Council. It is important that the review be completed and our standards updated because they are certainly not fit for purpose at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_1065">Again, I wish to confirm that the review will happen. I agree with Deputy Clare Daly for all the reasons she outlined.

            <p eId="para_1067"> The idea behind public consultation is to broaden the conversation around this area. There is considerable interest in this among the public. Several Departments are represented on the working group. It is vital that we have a public consultation aspect to it as well. It delayed the process a little, but that was no harm. The public need to be aware of these matters and they need to be part of the conversation. I hope we will not have any more delays. When the report comes on my desk, I will have no problem discussing it further with a view to making the necessary changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1068">The Minister of State has said this is a priority for him. I believe that and I am glad of it. Many good submissions were made by the public. It would be completely wrong if we were not to take them into account. The reason they were made is that the current system is not fit for purpose. In particular there needs to be a proactive approach in respect of issues such as the use of portable kennels, third-party sales, a ban on selling puppies under eight weeks of age, adequate licence fees, the black market and illegal selling of puppies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069"> The area of enforcement, or rather the lack of enforcement, is critical. A glaring inconsistency has been highlighted across different local authority areas. This has caused extensive problems in terms of the welfare of animals. Ireland's reputation has been already damaged because of the export of greyhounds to China. We are developing a disreputable international name and we need to correct that urgently. It is important not only that the guidelines are updated but that the enforcement mechanism is substantially beefed-up as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_1074">Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness includes the objective that, by mid-2017, hotels will be used only in limited circumstances as emergency accommodation for families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075"> It is intended that the long-term housing needs of those currently homeless, including those families currently accommodated in hotels, will be met through housing supports, such as the enhanced housing assistance payment scheme and general social housing allocations. Significant outputs are being achieved in this regard. Housing authorities achieved more than 3,000 sustainable exits from homeless accommodation into independent tenancies during 2016, which was a record level of activity in a calendar year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076"> Housing authorities are also pursuing a range of supported temporary accommodation initiatives to provide accommodation for homeless families with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotels, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured. Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more co-ordinated needs assessment and support, including on-site access to required services, such as welfare, health, housing services and appropriate family supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077"> We are confident that the mid-2017 objective relating to hotels, as set out in Rebuilding Ireland, will be met. At this stage we are having weekly meetings to ensure we meet that objective. This goes back to ensuring that all those involved in making this happen are fully equipped to do this and to make the resources available. We have asked them about it across a range of measures to ensure we reach this target.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078"> I agree with Deputy Ó Broin. We will be judged on the progress of Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness in the context of that figure. We cannot over-emphasise that point to everyone. Deputy Ó Broin will stress the point to us and he will hold us to account in that regard. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, set that ambitious target on purpose to ensure we get there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079"> Would we have preferred to see more movement earlier in the process? Certainly, we would. However, let us consider the trends now in recent weeks and months. We will get there. We are on track to do it. There has been a high level of presentations in recently months. The level is probably higher than any of us would have believed possible or would have wanted to see. The levels are very high and that is affecting movement here. However, we are still confident we can reach our target by mid-2017.</p>

            <p eId="para_1080">The Minister of State left out three sentences from the commitment in the answer. The document does not simply state that the Government will end the use of hotels by mid-2017. It lists the four types of housing the Government will provide to meet that objective. Nowhere among those four types of housing is there mention of moving people into other emergency accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081"> When I raised this with senior departmental officials last year, they told us the intention was to move these families into long-term housing. Approximately 875 families are currently in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation. I understand the Minister of State has tables of data he might be able to share with us. Of those 875 families, how many will move into one of the four housing types in the Rebuilding Ireland commitment by the end of June? How many will move into other emergency accommodation that is not in the Rebuilding Ireland commitment? Crucially, how many will remain in the hotels in which they are currently, even if the hotel is to be refurbished, given additional supports, and called a family hub? We are not simply going to hold the Government to account on half of the commitment the Government has made. We want to know about the full commitment in Rebuilding Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1082">I will give the figures as they may be helpful to Deputy Ó Broin. Since he believes I have tables before me, I will give him what I have. The figures for the end of March, referenced by Deputy Ó Broin, show 870 homeless families were housed in commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dublin region. The corresponding figure for April fell to 695. Again, that is a trend in the right direction although we would have hoped for more.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083"> I do not have the breakdown of where individuals have gone. I can get that for the Deputy at some stage. Deputy Ó Broin is right. It is the intention of the Department that people will leave hotels for permanent accommodation. That is our desire and that is what we want to do. In some cases it will be necessary for a two-step approach involving more family-friendly accommodation on the journey to a permanent house. We are still committed to this target and to get them into a permanent home over the remaining time. That is what we are trying to do. In some cases, they might end up in some of the new family hubs. I have been to visit them. I am unsure whether Deputy Ó Broin has visited them. Some of them are impressive in terms of the range of services they can provide. They are still not ideal. They are not full permanent homes. The people in hotels would like to move into permanent houses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084"> We are using the HAP scheme as well. Houses have been acquired. We are using the repair and lease-back initiative. All the various schemes are being used for homeless people. We expect 68 new rapid-build construction houses to come on-stream in the weeks ahead. They will be used. Houses have been acquired through the Housing Agency. It is being done through a combination of measures. It is not a case of everyone being moved into the new family hubs. In some cases, some of the old commercial hotels have been reclassified. We are taking over them, re-developing them and changing the services they offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085"> Our commitment is that people will not be in a commercial hotel because that is not a place to live. We want to achieve that, even if some end up in some of the new family hubs. If Deputy Ó Broin visits them he will see that what they can offer is far better than a commercial hotel. The measure is only short-term in nature and they will end up with a house.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086"> The figures for April are down to 695. I will get the breakdown for more recent months. We expect the figures for May, June and July will show further reductions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1087">Any improvement in emergency accommodation for families will be welcomed. Again, I go back to the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland that by the middle of this year families that are in hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation will be moved into HAP housing, rapid-build and procured units. We will want to know, sooner rather than later, how many of those 800 or 900 families have gone into the four categories of permanent housing in the Rebuilding Ireland commitment as well as how many are still in emergency accommodation. We must not forget that many of the families the Minister of State claims will be moving into better quality emergency accommodation have been already in emergency accommodation for up to two years. I am not against better quality emergency accommodation. I want the Minister to keep the specific commitment he made last year, namely, not simply to get families out of hotels, but to get them into the four different categories of permanent long-term housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">It is clear from everything that the Minister of State has said that there will be a number of people - I think it will be a majority - who will continue to be in emergency accommodation, albeit of better quality, from July onwards.</p>

            <p eId="para_1089">It is fair to say that the Minister gave that commitment in good faith and he wants to achieve it. The number one priority for us as Ministers and the Department is that people would be out of commercial hotels because they are not places to raise a family or to try to survive. Some people are there for 18 months to a year, which is not on. The aim is to get them into permanent accommodation. The Deputy was right to say that some will still end up in further temporary accommodation. While a hell of a lot better than a hotel, it is not the full answer for them. We are working with families so that they can transition into their full house.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090"> I will give the Deputy some of the figures. Last year under the homeless HAP scheme, which has been a major addition to help us house people from homelessness, we targeted approximately 550 tenancies. We have reached more than 800 in 2016. These are people who were homeless and got into a house. This year alone there have been more than 600 new presentations that are now in a house under the HAP scheme. These are people who would be in hotels but who are being accommodated in homes. With new presentations and those in hotels, we will achieve these targets. However, I wish to stress that it has been very difficult because of the number of new presentations. While I am at it and given the Deputy was looking for them, I may as well give him the homelessness figures for April. The number of homeless adults is 4,972. The number of homeless families is 1,302. The number of dependants is 2,708. In Dublin only, there are 3,337 homeless adults, with the number of homeless families being 1,091. Again, those figures are slightly up. While we are making inroads in terms of our target of removing people from hotels, the overall number of presentations remain high. That is for a combination of reasons. We can look behind that story some day and see that. </p>
            <p eId="para_1091"> In the weeks and months ahead, there will be more than 550 new family places available. These will help those who will present as homeless in the future. They will no longer be going into hotels. They will either enter a HAP situation or move into one of the family hubs and move on from there. It is important to deal with the hotels today, as well as the number of presentations. We are making great progress in that regard. I wish we could get ahead of it though.</p>

            <p eId="para_1093">I again ask the Minister where we are in terms of an urgent review of the pyrite remediation scheme. As he well knows, currently it is not fit for purpose. It is particularly not fit for purpose for those stuck in the middle, that is, whose properties are damaged but not damaged enough to be remediated. They cannot get a green certificate showing that they are pyrite-free because of the mechanism involved. Therefore, they cannot sell, renovate or move on with their lives.

            <p eId="para_1094">Deputy Clare Daly, along with many others, has been doing pioneering work on the area of pyrite. We are trying to address the issue as much as we possibly can. New presentations of those with pyrite - not of homelessness - is approximately ten a week. There is a fair lot still coming on stream. Therefore, I wish to stress that the scheme will not close.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095"> The pyrite resolution board, with the support of the Housing Agency, is responsible for the implementation of the pyrite remediation scheme.  The scheme is one of last resort and is limited in its application and scope.  </p>
            <p eId="para_1096"> The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with - Deputy Clare Daly probably knows the reference off by heart at this stage - I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material – Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol. In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the board must be accompanied by a building condition assessment with a damage condition rating of 2. This ensures that, having regard to available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave. We have no proposals to amend the eligibility criteria for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097"> At the end of the remediation works, each dwelling is provided with a certificate of remediation for reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material, which is completed jointly by the relevant builder and design professional in accordance with Annex B to I.S. 398-2:2013. The certificate confirms that the dwelling has been remediated to the requirements set out in the national standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098"> A green certificate is issued in respect of dwellings that have been assessed, at the request of the homeowner, in accordance with the standard and considered to be free from pyrite. This issuing of such certificates is a matter entirely for the homeowners and the professional they engage. It is not part of the pyrite remediation scheme. Where a house has been remediated under the scheme, a certificate of remediation is provided and the issue of a green certificate does not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099"> I know the issue relates to the new standard to be brought forward. I had hoped we would have had it months ago. When the standard will be agreed is outside the control of my Department. Most people believe a change in it might help people to progress into category 2 quicker in order that they can be dealt with or that they would qualify for a green certificate. I hope the new standard will bring some changes and some certainty. I do not have them yet. I have asked that they would be fast-tracked as quickly as they possibly can. I have been told by the NSAI that we are talking about another couple of months or before the end of the year. I have said that this is not acceptable and have asked it to fast-track this as quickly as it can. I cannot progress solutions for people under the scheme until the new standards are developed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1100">The problem is not the new standard. The changes in it, although we have not seen it, will alter the situation a little for some people. However, it will not correct the fundamental flaws with the scheme. I know that the Minister of State knows that there are hundreds of people in his constituency who are suffering because of this issue. Having raised the issue at every Question Time involving the Minister, I went to the trouble of drafting legislation to replace the present scheme with one that is based on remediation or certification. The idea is that the scheme, if a house could not be remediated or did not require remediation, would offer a certificate so that the owner could move on with his or her life. I was prevented from even giving that Bill a reading on the grounds that it would involve a cost on the Exchequer even though we had carried out a huge amount of work on it. In other words, the only people who can change the scheme are those in government. Backbenchers will be prevented from proposing legislation on this issue. This is urgent. The flaw in the scheme is that it was based on damage rather than the presence of pyrite. This means that someone whose house has pyrite and is therefore valueless but is not deemed to have enough damage to be remediated is left in total limbo. It is simply unacceptable. These are the victims of the housing bubble that led in essence to the housing crisis. It cannot go on.</p>

            <p eId="para_1101">I agree with Deputy Clare Daly about being left in limbo. We are trying to find solutions to it. I might sit down and look over her Bill with her, if that is okay, to see where we can use it. The problem at the moment is that under some of the standards, the house is still reported to have a pyrite presence. However, it might not be possible to see physical damage to the house. I have been in houses that have been said to have pyrite although one cannot see anything wrong with them even ten to 12 years after construction. No one will buy those houses and the banks will not give a mortgage to buy such houses. However, it would probably be wrong to spend €60,000 fixing the house to remove the presence of pyrite. It is not an easy circle to square or - the other way round - a square to circle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102"> I accept that people are left in limbo and we have to find solutions. I have met people and families who want to move one with their lives. Their jobs or lives might have moved onto a different part of the country but they are stuck in the house they have today. I would be happy to try to find solutions but it will not be possible to get the backing of any Department of Finance or Department of Public Expenditure to spend between €60,000 and €80,000 on a house that has no real physical evidence of damage although we know pyrite is present. That is the difficulty. Where a house must be remediated, the scheme is available. Many houses have been fixed at this stage already. More than 700 have already been completed and there is another 400 to 500 in the system, with more than 1,300 applications in total. We are dealing with houses that need to be fixed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103"> I understand what the Deputy is saying. She is speaking about those who are left in limbo. The solution, however, is not straightforward. I am happy to look at the Deputy's Bill to see if she has a better solution than that which we can find.</p>

            <p eId="para_1104">If a house does not need to be fixed, it would be utterly ridiculous to fix it. No one is proposing that. However, if a property has pyrite, there has to be a system where, it having been studied after another period of time and demonstrated that the damage has not progressed, one could say the level of pyrite has already oxidised and will not develop further or is of such a low level as to be insignificant, meaning that a house could be declared, in essence, pyrite-free. Without the certificate, the only other remedy would be an actual remediation of the property. Those are the only two options. The problem is that we have a remediation scheme that is too restrictive. A house has to be virtually falling down before a person can get onto the scheme. However, on the comfort on the other end if one does not qualify, one cannot get out of jail either. This needs to be built into the scheme. Interestingly, one of the objections raised when I moved the Bill was that there is no definition of a green certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">They could not tell me how it is defined even though it is a term used broadly in the industry and we all know what it should be. I will sit down with the Minister of State. I hope he is still here to do that. I do not mean it in a derogatory way but it is very unfortunate that a lot of these key issues will be subsumed by the internal battles in Fine Gael. I hope we can sit down and address it. </p>

            <p eId="para_1106">I assure the Deputy the internal battles or journey of Fine Gael will not delay anything in our programmes or anything in this matter. It is not as simple as issuing the green certificate. I know what it means. It means one can sell on one's house and people will feel confident to buy it and can get a mortgage on it. I have been in houses that were built 30 or more years ago and pyrite is only now becoming a problem. If there is a presence of pyrite, it is not as simple as being able to tell somebody they can get out of jail or, in other words, that their house is cleared. That is why the standards are being looked at again to see if the testing procedures are right and to see if there is some way to say legitimately that the pyrite will never cause a problem. If one sees a house 30 years on and then a problem is caused by pyrite, it would be very hard for the State to issue a green certificate at a stage when pyrite is present. I would like to find a solution so people are free of it and can move on from it. There are other ways to do it that I am looking at and that I can discuss with the Deputy when we look over her Bill to see if there is some way of doing it with her Bill. I would like to find a solution to this because it affects people I represent and I have seen at first hand the damage it can cause to a family, both financially and socially.</p>

            <p eId="para_1108">In February, the European Commission initiated court proceedings against the Irish Government for breaches of the urban wastewater treatment directive. Infringement proceedings have been ongoing since 2012. I am looking for an update from the Minister of State on the progress on the 38 agglomerations or urban areas that are currently in breach of EU law and what the Government will do to rectify these. How much will be invested year on year from now until 2021 to bring these 38 agglomerations up to standard?</p>

            <p eId="para_1109">The urban wastewater treatment directive mandates the required standards for the collection and treatment of wastewater from urban areas of greater than 2,000 population equivalent. The directive dates from 1991, with the last implementation deadline in the directive being 31 December 2005. By this date, collection systems should have been in place and secondary treatment of wastewater should have been provided for all agglomerations with a population equivalent of over 2,000 people, where the treated wastewater is discharged to rivers, lakes or estuaries. As such, the issue of compliance with the requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive in Ireland is a long-standing problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110"> The European Commission commenced an infringement process against Ireland regarding its implementation of the directive in September 2013. This was followed by a supplementary letter of formal notice in September 2015. A reasoned opinion was then sent by the European Commission in September 2016, with the case being referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union in February 2017. The supplementary letter of formal notice of September 2015 identified compliance concerns regarding a total of 82 agglomerations. However, communications with the European Commission as part of the infringement process have satisfied the Commission that 44 of those 82 agglomerations should be removed from the case. While this indicates the progress being made, 38 agglomerations remain of concern to the European Commission. Irish Water will continue to prioritise key projects in their capital investment plans to address the issues of non-compliance in the outstanding areas. </p>
            <p eId="para_1111"> To address all these concerns, in the various plans, would cost roughly €1.7 billion. </p>

            <p eId="para_1112">Interestingly, the primary reason the European Commission initiated the infringement proceedings was because when Fine Gael took office in 2011, it slashed the capital budget for wastewater treatment plans. Prior to that, particularly when John Gormley was Minister, the investment was between €200 million and €300 million on an annual basis. When Fine Gael took office with Labour, it was slashed to figures such as €150 million and €124 million. Clearly, the reason we are now facing potentially millions of euro of fines is because Fine Gael slashed the funding for those projects. What I am looking to know and what was not in the answer the first time around is, year on year from here onwards, exactly how much is being spent on tackling the 38 agglomerations in breach of EU law?</p>
            <p eId="para_1113"> The Environmental Protection Agency has identified 127 priority locations, including the 38, where they feel there could be future breaches of EU law. What is the plan? Specifically what is the level of capital investment in those, year on year from now to 2021?</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1114">I mis-stated the figure. I said €1.7 billion but that was the total spend. From 2014 to 2024, about €1.1 billion will be required to ensure the compliance for the 38 agglomerations. That is the rough spend. Of the €1.7 billion, Irish Water plans to spend from 2017 to 2021, approximately €623 million is planned for investment in the cited areas. The planned investment builds on an investment of €179 million for the period 2014 to 2016 to develop urban areas. A projected requirement of €286 million for the period beyond 2021 is required. It will bring us to a total spend of €1.1 billion. The €1.1 billion is an increase of €100 million on the previous estimate of what it would cost to fix these.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115"> The Deputy said the current Government and the last Government cut the funding in this area. I do not need to give the Deputy a lecture on economics. The money was not there to spend. That is why we set up the process of Irish Water to be able to put us in a position to spend greater amounts of capital on investment in water and sewage facilities. Trust me, if the money had been at our disposal in our first five years of Government, as in many other areas, we would have been happy to spend it. The money was not there and there is no point in trying to say a previous Government left money in the kitty because it had not. The kitties were bare when we got there. </p>

            <p eId="para_1116">If John Gormley was able to sustain the level of funding in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, when the recession was at its deepest, there is simply no reason why Fine Gael, if it had chosen to continue that level of funding, could not have done so. My question has still not been answered. I want to know, year on year, from now to 2021, what the investment is. I knew the figure was €1.1 billion over that period because of a reply to a parliamentary question a number of weeks ago. Unless we front-load that expenditure starting from this year, next year and the year after, we will face potentially millions of euro in fines. Clearly the officials have not given the Minister of State the figures. It would be good to let me know, in writing, how much of that €1.1 billion is being put in, year on year, next year, the year after and the year after that. The reason the Commission has initiated court proceedings is because it is not satisfied at the progress to date on the 38 agglomerations. I am not only concerned about the 38 but the 127 identified by the EPA. I would be very grateful if the Minister of State could provide in writing at a later stage figures for what capital investment they will get from now to 2021.</p>

I have no problem getting the breakdown for the years. The total figure is €623 million. There is an additional €290 million needed beyond that now.

            <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1125">It is recognised the level of supply in some rental markets can make the sourcing of accommodation very challenging, as we saw this week. The pressures in this regard are borne out by the data published recently by <i>daft.ie</i>, showing that rent asking prices rose nationwide by an average 13.4% in the year to March 2017. The report also shows that rent inflation in Dublin has slowed over the last quarter. It is an early indication that the rent predictability measures introduced under the Government's strategy for the rental sector are having the desired effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126"> The HAP is a flexible and immediate housing support that is now available to all eligible households throughout the State. The increased rent limits introduced by the Government in the last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords. On average in 2017, 325 additional tenancies are being supported by HAP each week, with 22,000 households currently having their housing needs met by HAP and some 17,000 separate landlords and agents are in receipt of monthly HAP payments. Particular additional targeted supports are available to homeless households in the Dublin and Cork regions to assist them in finding accommodation in the private rental market, with the support of HAP. A breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP in each local authority area at the end of March 2017 is available on our website. I am satisfied the HAP scheme is working well, despite the challenging rental market, but we will keep its operation under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127"> I reiterate what I said in a discussion here last week with Deputy Broughan. </p>
            <p eId="para_1128">While I understand the housing assistance payment does not work for everybody, it provides solutions for many, including in the short term. From June onwards, we will rely heavily on the payment to avoid people having to use commercial hotels. The HAP scheme has achieved considerable success in Dublin where approximately 600 new HAP tenancies have been provided since Christmas. Last year, more than 800 HAP tenancies were provided directly for homeless people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129"> I accept Deputy Bríd Smith could cite specific cases and I cannot deny that the housing assistance payment does not work for everybody. However, it works in many cases and is generally better than the rent subsidy scheme that preceded it. For example, recipients of the payment can return to work and increase their income without being penalised. </p>

            <p eId="para_1146">I am disappointed the Minister for Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, is not here. Is the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, not utterly ashamed of his Government? On the day it was revealed that we have reached a new low with 12 homeless families being told to go to Garda stations, some of whom ended up sleeping in parks, the Government claimed it was doing its very best to deal with this issue and simultaneously chose to vote against a Bill which would stem the flow of people into homelessness by reducing rents to affordable levels and preventing economic evictions. That position exposes the utter hypocrisy of the Government. It says it cares about the families who are in this unprecedented and diabolical situation with children and their mothers in parks. It says it wants to do something about it but when it is given an opportunity to do so, it votes against a Bill that would enact emergency measures to prevent people sliding into this dire position. It does so because it wants to protect the so-called market, in other words the landlords and vulture funds who are evicting people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147"> I received a telephone call as I was coming into the Chamber from Sinéad Murphy, a woman whose case I have raised twice with the Taoiseach. For the second time, she has been placed in a hostel in Dublin city centre that is located 12 km from her four year old daughter's school. The council will not allow her to take an available place in a hotel near her daughter's school in which there are people who want a place in town but are not allowed to take it. This is unbelievable. </p>

            <p eId="para_1148">This morning during Leaders' Questions, the Tánaiste stated that everyone wants to see the homelessness problem solved and every possible initiative is being taken. This statement is not supported by reality. According to Focus Ireland, in March last, 77 families in Dublin experienced homelessness for the first time, while in March 2013 five families became homeless. The 4% cap on rent increases introduced by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, in December 2015 is not working. Rents are going through the roof and have increased by 13.9% in Dublin in the past year. There are no meaningful measures in place to stop rising rents, curb evictions, help those in mortgage arrears or prevent land banking to meet the needs of the homeless in a manner that grants them dignity and respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149"> More than 700 families are living in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in Dublin city. Many of them are forced to self-accommodate, sometimes spending whole days ringing around to secure a temporary place to stay in a hotel, unsure where the place will be or for how long it will be available. This practice, which cost the State €39 million last year, creates a massive transfer of public wealth to private hands and is also a violation of the human rights of thousands of women, men and children. The Minister of State indicated he hopes to end this practice by July but at this stage we suspect that is unlikely. When will it stop and what then?</p>
            <p eId="para_1150"> According to figures in Rebuilding Ireland, work started on 549 social homes and 204 social homes were completed in the first quarter of 2017. Dr. Rory Hearne, in a recent analysis of Government housing policy, showed that Dublin City Council will build only 560 new social housing units in the next two or three years based on current plans. At this rate, it will take at least 30 years to house those on the Dublin city housing waiting list. Is there any change of plan?</p>

            <p eId="para_1151">It is unbelievable - can my microphone be switched on please - that, having just discussed a release free of charge of in the biggest robbery in history, and in a country with almost 200,000 empty properties and rents having soared by 66% since 2011, the Dáil voted against a measure that would put a stop to this. Last Saturday, I stood on the Ballyfermot Road to prevent a woman and her two children being illegally evicted. Last night, 30 homeless children were left in Garda stations and parks. What sort of society are we living in? The focus of the Government and media is on the beauty contest between two failed Ministers, one of whom failed us on health in the past and is now failing us in social welfare and the other who is utterly failing us on housing. The Government is disgraceful. I bet the Minister of State that people will be sleeping in parks again tonight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152"> I refer to the question I asked earlier on the housing assistance payment. I bet the Minister of State that if he were to examine the cases of the families who were left homeless last night, he would find that some of them have been failed by the HAP scheme. The scheme is not working because landlords will not take it. The Minister of State should tell Selina Hogan and families who are consistently being refused accommodation that the scheme works. While the Department will give them the money, landlords will not take HAP payments. The Minister of State cannot gloss over the reality and he should stop giving us pretend statistics. We know what is happening in the real world. The Minister of State probably knows what is happening but chooses to turn a blind eye because he gets well paid for doing so. He should wake up, smell the coffee and do something to support these families and give them a real possibility of securing housing. </p>

            <p eId="para_1156">I did not interrupt the Deputy. There is a story behind every family, which is fair enough, and I will not place anyone's story on record. However, the HAP scheme works for many people. Approximately 800 people who were homeless last year are now in accommodation as a result of the housing assistance payment. These people are content but the Deputy wishes to focus only on the negative. While I accept that the scheme does not work for some people and this merits discussion, it is wrong to claim it does not work, full stop. It works for thousands of people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1158">Since Christmas alone, more than 600 people who presented as homeless have secured HAP tenancies and are in a much better position than they were previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159"> I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue and welcome the opportunity to clarify the position regarding what was a very distressing situation for all concerned. The Government is absolutely committed to addressing the issue of homelessness. There is now a focused and co-ordinated approach to tackling it across multiple Departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160"> As Deputies are aware, Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness launched in July last year provides a multi-stranded, action orientated approach to achieving the Government's key housing objectives and tackling homelessness in a comprehensive manner once and for all. </p>
            <p eId="para_1161"> It is important to make clear that statutory responsibility for the provision emergency accommodation to homeless services rests with individual housing authorities. The Department's role involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. Consequently, it does not play a role in operational issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">When a family presents as homeless out of hours in Dublin, the dedicated family homeless action team will work with the family to secure hotel accommodation for the night, with a more detailed assessment of the family's requirements taking place the next day. The family homeless action team is provided through Focus Ireland, which is funded by the four Dublin local authorities to provide this valuable service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163"> Regarding the events that occurred in Dublin city on Tuesday night, 24 May, I understand that the demand for emergency accommodation was at unprecedented levels and there was a scarcity of available hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation. As a consequence, Focus Ireland was unable to source hotel accommodation for all of the families that had been referred to it that night. Dublin City Council's central placement service maintains a number of contingency spaces for families that are intended for use only in absolute emergencies when families present out of hours and no commercial accommodation can be secured. I understand that, when the homeless action team was unable to source hotel accommodation on Tuesday, these contingency spaces were brought into play. Given the unprecedented demand that night, however, these spaces were soon fully utilised, with a number of families remaining unaccommodated. Accordingly, and in line with agreed working arrangements, Focus Ireland referred the remaining families to Garda stations as a last resort and with a view to their safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164"> I understand that the issue of contingency capacity for families was on Dublin City Council's agenda prior to Tuesday night and that the council had been working to increase the volume of its contingency spaces to 14 family units. Unfortunately, this additional capacity only came on stream on Wednesday night. While that was a day too late for the families in question, it is of some reassurance that this additional capacity now exists within the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165"> I have made it clear that I do not consider hotel accommodation to be appropriate for families for anything other than a short period. The Minister has been clear on this as well and has committed to end the use of hotels. The events of Tuesday night highlight that a reliance on hotel accommodation is not only inappropriate, but precarious. It was with this understanding that Rebuilding Ireland included an explicit commitment to ensure that, by mid-2017, hotels would only be relied on for emergency accommodation in limited circumstances. To meet this objective, there has been a focus on meeting families' long-term housing needs through housing supports such as the enhanced HAP scheme and general social housing allocations. Significant outputs are being achieved in this regard and housing authorities achieved more than 3,000 sustainable exits from homeless accommodation into independent tenancies during 2016, which was a record level of exits in a calendar year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1166">This morning, Mr. Mike Allen of Focus Ireland stated that emergency accommodation would not solve the crisis and, specifically, that we needed legislation to stem the flow of families into homelessness. A few hours later, we had a Bill in the Dáil that would have done precisely that - stop economic evictions and reduce rents to affordable levels - but the Government and Fianna Fáil voted it down to protect the landlords and vulture funds. How can the Minister of State live with himself when families are degraded to the level of sleeping in parks, when young children are put in danger and when people are neglected in this way and the Government still votes down measures that could do something about the situation? How could the Taoiseach write to me to say that the Government is making progress when the numbers in emergency accommodation have increased by 462% since Fine Gael entered government in 2011? It should be ashamed of itself. This is unbelievable.</p>

            <p eId="para_1167">There are still no effective rent controls or taxes on landbanking. Airbnb is making the housing crisis worse and operates in a strange place legally. Last year, An Bord Pleanála upheld a Dublin City Council ruling that an apartment owner in Temple Bar needed to apply for planning permission if the owner wanted to continue renting the property out via Airbnb. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, promised to address the issue. In August, there were 4,931 Airbnb listings in the city area, the bulk of all Dublin region listings. By February, that number had increased to 6,729, or 36%. It seems that having long-term tenants is a mug's game these days. One man recently told RTE that he was subletting 40 rooms on Airbnb after renting them from landlords around Dublin and that it was a lucrative business. The apartment at the centre of the An Bord Pleanála case reportedly made €79,000 in one year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168"> This is a criminal development in the middle of the housing crisis. Starting this month, home owners in central Barcelona are only permitted to rent out one place on Airbnb. How is the Department getting on with its plans in this regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_1169">Deputy Wallace stated that having tenants is a mug's game, but it is sometimes the same in the context of HAP. Someone joins HAP and, after a year, the landlord issues him or her a notice to quit in order to sell the property, mar dhea. Our Bill would have stopped such properties being sold except in exceptional circumstances. This is happening on a large scale because landlords can make profit as the price of houses increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170"> The Minister of State should not pretend that the homelessness crisis will be sorted by the type of diatribe that is written on both sides of this page. It means nothing. The Government gives us this answer every day and every day there are more families facing homelessness. The Government's solution is to stick them into the Bargaintown premises in Coolock, which is like something in which refugees in Athens would be housed. Stick them in Bargaintown and tell them it is temporary when it is actually permanent because the Government does not have a permanent solution to the housing crisis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1171">Permanent solutions can only be provided by increasing the supply of housing. It is as simple as that, regardless of how one looks at it. We must increase supply. I will not go through all of the interventions that the Government and Department are making to achieve that, but much more housing is coming on stream this year, including through the use of vacant properties. Housing authorities are also pursuing the delivery of additional and enhanced supported temporary accommodation that is more suitable for the short-term accommodation needs of such households than commercial hotel arrangements, which have existed for years, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured. This includes the procurement of properties that are suitable to serve as new family-focused supported temporary accommodation and the reconfiguration of existing private emergency accommodation to provide improved family facilities and supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172"> Capital investment in the region of €25 million is being made in a range of projects to provide custom developed facilities that will offer appropriate temporary accommodation for homeless families. These will come on stream in May, June and July. I have visited some of those facilities. I accept that they are not a permanent solution, but what they offer is a hell of a lot better in terms of services and accommodation needs-----</p>

            <p eId="para_1176"> In April, we saw for the first time in many months a reduction in the number of families in commercial hotels. While the overall number in emergency accommodation showed an increase last month, the number of families in hotels and bed and breakfasts in Dublin reduced from 870 to 695. We are continuing to work closely with the Dublin local authorities to ensure that this downward momentum continues as we work towards achieving our mid-year target.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177"> Since Christmas, more than 600 people have presented as homeless and have been found solutions in HAP housing. Many people are finding other accommodation as well, but we are dealing with the day-to-day presentations, the number of which is still quite high, while also trying to deal with people who have been in hotels for 12 months, 18 months or longer than they should have been. We are making progress. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has set a target and we will achieve it. People will not be in hotels by mid-2017. That is what we are trying to do. The Deputies mentioned a number of the places in question, but I urge them to visit some of the new family housing units and see what they provide. They are not full-time-----</p>

            <p eId="para_1183">I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue on the floor of the Dáil and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184"> The future of the An Post network - both the post office network and the mail distribution network - has never been more uncertain. I will discuss the Athlone mail distribution centre in particular. It is regrettable that the responsible Minister is not present to answer questions, given the fear among staff in Athlone. I have met some of them and spoken with many more. The Athlone mail centre is ideally located in the heart of the midlands. It has excellent transport links to all parts of the country and is located in the same business park as DPD Ireland, which recently doubled its premises in size to form its national hub. That shows how ideally located the area is. The mail centre's 183 staff are extremely efficient, having won many awards for their work. Not only that, but they have been flexible. In the face of decreasing volumes of mail in recent years, they have collaborated to achieve significant staff savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185"> I understand that consultants have been employed to examine the future of the mail distribution network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">The only centre those consultants have not visited is the mail centre in Athlone. I do not think that is fair or right. At the very minimum, I want to receive a guarantee today that those consultants will engage with the management and the unions representing the workers in Athlone's mail distribution unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187"> Second, in regard to the An Post network, who is the responsible Minister? It was the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, but, seemingly, he now does not want it and it is going back to the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten. Is that true and, if so, when will the Minister take responsibility? Does the Government agree with the sentiments expressed by the CEO of An Post in regard to the number of closures needed? Does the Government feel the An Post network is an asset and, if so, is it going to invest in it? The Irish Postmasters' Union signed up to the Bobby Kerr report under the last Government. Its members are wondering when the recommendations of that report will be implemented, because we should be implementing them now, not analysing and discussing a new report.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eugene Murphy<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1188">I support Deputy Troy in bringing forward this matter and in regard to the strong case he has made. People are worried and concerned about the Athlone mail centre. When we lose our mail sorting centres in the counties, they go to the regions. That is fine and the regional centres are doing a good job, but if we lose that, it is a big concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189"> I find it bizarre and unbelievable that, yet again, not one of the Ministers is present. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is a good replacement and he is well able to fight his corner. However, we have been told from the start that the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Naughten, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, had responsibility for different areas of An Post, yet not one of them is present. I understand people get caught up and have to go places, and that is acceptable, but we have three Ministers and not one of them would come in here to face the music this evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190"> I have said before and repeat now that this is part of a collapse that has been deliberately allowed by the Government - it wants to get rid of 40% or 50% of An Post and it will then come in with a deal. It is unacceptable. It is not the way to govern. The Minister of State should tell us what is happening and whether we are going to have any postal service in a couple of months.</p>

            <p eId="para_1191">I welcome the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, to outline the position in regard to the post office network and I would like to thank Deputies Robert Troy and Eugene Murphy for raising this issue. The Minister sends his apologies. I accept the Deputies' point that many people are concerned and I will try to deal with the questions the Deputies have raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192"> As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, has responsibility for the postal sector, including the governance of An Post, to ensure the company is fully compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the governance functions included in the statutory framework underpinning An Post. Day-to-day operational matters, including decisions in regard to the restructuring of An Post and the operation of the post office network, are matters for the board and the management of the company and not ones in which the Minister has any role or statutory function.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193"> It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service, and that it maintains a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community. The post office network consists of just over 1,100 post offices nationwide. The post office network is a unique social, cultural and financial institution that makes a vital contribution to the Irish economy. That is the Government position. The post office is regarded as a dependable, trustworthy provider of choice to a vast number of our citizens for State services and other commercial transactions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194"> The Post Office Network Business Development Group was established at the end of 2014 by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to explore the potential for commercial and additional Government services which could be transacted through the post office network. Following publication of the final report of this group in January 2016, two working groups were established to progress the recommendations of the report. These were the network renewal implementation group, chaired by Bobby Kerr, and the post office hub working group, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Ring. On foot of the reconfiguration of Departments in July last, responsibility for the post office network transferred to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Arrangements are now in hand to transfer responsibility for the post office network back to the Minister, Deputy Naughten's Department, under whose remit the corporate governance of An Post rests. Mr. Kerr submitted his report in December last. The final report of the post office hub working group was published in March and its recommendations will continue to be finalised between both Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195"> Colleagues in the House will be aware that An Post is operating in a very challenging environment and is facing a very difficult financial situation. The An Post AGM was held today and the company published its annual report and financial statements for 2016. The Minister has noted the fact An Post recorded an operating loss of €13.7 million for 2016. Clearly, this is a very significant loss and losses of this scale cannot be sustained.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196"> An Post is carrying out a fundamental review of the company with a view to identifying the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing, and that review is nearing completion. McKinsey is assisting An Post in this review but, as I stated, any decision in regard to the restructuring of An Post is a matter for the board and management of the company. The Minister is, of course, closely monitoring the situation and the Government will be briefed once a definitive strategy has been agreed. It would not be appropriate to comment further on this process at this time.</p>

It is over 12 months since the Government was formed and this is being played like a football between the Minister, Deputy Naughten, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring. No one wants to take responsibility for the network which, as we have just heard from the Minister of State, is lionised as a fabulous network in which the Government has great pride. Yes, it is facing serious financial challenges but those challenges will not be addressed by the Government shirking its responsibilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198"> The Irish Postmasters' Union signed up to the Kerr report so why is not being implemented? The question is very simple. Does the Government believe this is an asset? If so, is the Government going to invest in this asset - yes or no? Does the Government agree with the position of the CEO of An Post that we are facing the closure of up to 300 post offices across this country - yes or no?</p>
            <p eId="para_1199"> With regard to the mail distribution centre in Athlone, to which the Minister of State did not refer in his reply, does he think it right and proper that this centre, which is ideally located in the centre of Ireland, is treated in this way? It is located in the same business park which DPD, an international courier company, saw as the right location in which to double the size of its operation and offer enhanced employment opportunities. Does the Minister of State think it right and proper that McKinsey consultants, which were looking at the future of the mail distribution system, did not even engage with the management of one of the most efficient units or with the unions representing the workers? Will he give a guarantee on behalf of the Government that, at the very minimum, those consultants will engage with the management and the unions there? I understand the Minister, Deputy Naughten, visited the centre yesterday, which is welcome, but the consultants need to visit too.</p>

            <p eId="para_1200">I have listened with interest to the important points raised by both Deputies. I also welcome the fact the Minister, Deputy Naughten, visited yesterday. The post office network plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike. This is at the forefront of An Post's mandate. The post office network has evolved a social role in the widest meaning of the term and this is highly valued by local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">The Minister, Deputy Naughten, envisages a strong future for the post office network by using its existing strengths to remain a significant player in the provision of Government financial and other services. That is a commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202"> It has also been a long-standing policy that An Post should remain in a position to compete in a liberalised market and continue to provide wide-ranging services to urban and rural communities. I accept many of the points the Deputies made that there are opportunities available to An Post to develop new or enhanced product lines for the business. The fundamental review of the company being undertaken will form the basis of the significant restructuring required, but this will take time to deliver. I will also raise the issue relating to the consultants and the mail centre in Athlone. I will bring that strong message back to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203"> The Minister is cognisant of the challenges ahead, but is working with the company to ensure that An Post can maintain its sustainability and relevance to customers.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Scanlon<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1204">I take this opportunity to raise the issue of the potential for the north west be developed as a key growth centre; to highlight again the country's two-tier recovery and unbalanced regional jobs growth; and to call on the Government to create a balanced jobs policy by investing in infrastructure and public service jobs in the north west.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205"> I support a national review to examine further redeployment of public jobs and of all State agencies to regional and rural areas. Previous redeployment of Government staff outside Dublin created real economic value and brought long-lasting sustainable employment. Thousands of civil servants from Departments are located in counties outside Dublin. Many of these positions have contributed to sustaining employment levels during the crisis period in smaller towns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206"> There is huge potential for Sligo and Leitrim to be developed as the key growth centre for the north west. We need to see viability and economies of scale in the north west. Sligo-Leitrim is a large rural region and Sligo is the best located large urban centre to support development throughout much of the north west region. With redeployment and recruitment of public sector jobs, along with effective links to other urban centres throughout the region and improved connectivity, Sligo can become a more effective regional driver, supporting a greater share of population, economic and employment growth in Sligo itself and the wider north-west region. Furthermore, the most recent CSO figures show that Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim are among the counties in Ireland with the highest percentages of vacant dwellings. Many properties could be brought back into use in these regions and this would boost local development and ease pressure on prices and rents in Dublin and other areas experiencing vigorous growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207"> There is clear evidence of a two-tier recovery with new job creation heavily concentrated in the greater Dublin area. The reality in the north west is that any improvement is happening at an extremely slow pace. There are serious barriers to job creation in this region that must be urgently addressed. The greater Dublin area accounted for about 40% of total employment gains in 2016. Disproportionate concentration in non-rural areas confirms that Government policy is skewed towards an unbalanced regional recovery. The Small Firms Association, representing over 200,000 businesses, has stated that the recovery has not been consistent regionally or sectorally. Many small businesses are still waiting to feel the upturn. Unequal recovery has been backed up by a Department of Finance paper, which stated that economic recovery in Ireland has been uneven across the country, with the recovery thus far primarily concentrated in Dublin and other urban areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208"> There has been a clear failure by Government to create a balanced jobs policy towards the regions, with job creation concentrated nearly exclusively in the capital and commuter belt region. The Government has still a long way to go to reach its 2020 target of ensuring every region's unemployment rate is within 1 percentage point of the national figure. I wish to outline a few statics relating to IDA Ireland jobs. Some 45% of all IDA Ireland site visits in 2016 were in Dublin and 50% of all IDA Ireland jobs were in the capital and commuter belt area. In 2016, 48% of all IDA Ireland jobs were in the capital and commuter belt area. The midlands, north east and north west have been almost ignored, with the number of IDA Ireland jobs there accounting for 2.1%, 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209"> There is a very disproportionate concentration of our economy in one region which is not sustainable. To put this into perspective, London accounts for 20% of the UK's total GDP. The Irish concentration in our capital is over 40%. I appreciate that IDA Ireland does not decide where an industry locates. An industry locates in areas where it can get the things it needs to grow, with factors such as skill base and education being important. The Government, however, can decide where to locate public jobs and there is no shortage of highly skilled, qualified and capable people in the north west who are actively seeking work but the jobs just are not there.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Seán Canney)<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1210">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. As a Deputy from the west of Ireland, I understand his concerns about balanced regional development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211"> As the Deputy will be aware, the decentralisation programme announced in December 2003 involved the relocation of over 10,000 civil and public service jobs to 53 locations in 25 counties. Up to the date of the cancellation of the programme, approximately one third of the target numbers, over 3,400 staff, were decentralised. While the decentralised offices account for less than 10% of serving Civil Service staff, taken together with the pre-existing regional and district offices of Departments the proportion of civil servants working outside Dublin is now just over 50%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212"> Non-property costs of the order of €30 million were incurred in respect of the decentralisation programme. These included costs incurred by decentralising offices and the OPW's spend on dedicated staffing for the programme. The staff relocation was accomplished on a voluntary basis without payment of removal expenses or incentives. It was also accomplished with minimal disruption to the ongoing business of the Departments concerned due to the graduated approach and risk management strategies adopted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213"> In November 2011, the Government agreed that the decentralisation programme should be cancelled in the light of the budgetary and staffing outlook. It was also agreed that a review of 22 projects should be carried out. Following completion of that review in January 2012, a total of 43 projects had been cancelled, while 50 were maintained, to be managed in the same way as other regionally based offices and Departments. It was agreed that one project, the Defence Forces in the Curragh, should proceed, on a cost-effective basis, as soon as budgetary resources permit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214"> There is a need to focus Government expenditure on programmes and projects that will best support economic recovery as well as the ongoing necessity to control public expenditure and pay, and the need to achieve efficiencies. The Deputy will be aware that the general government debt forecast is 76% of gross domestic product. Ireland is subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, which links public expenditure growth with the medium-term growth rate of the economy. This means we have very limited resources or fiscal space for increased expenditure in the next four-year period. For these reasons, there are no plans at present to introduce a further programme of decentralisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215"> The Government is firmly committed to the successful implementation of the PEACE and INTERREG programmes. It is particularly proud of its role in securing EU funding for a fourth PEACE programme. Along with its sister INTERREG programme, it will see investment of more than €500 million in the region over the period between 2014 and 2020. The programmes are important drivers of regional development in a cross-Border context. Through EU-funded co-operation, a range of Departments and agencies, North and South, have engaged in and benefited from a variety of cross-Border and cross-community projects. Support for the two programmes from the European Regional Development Fund is not only an important source of funding but also a key element of the European Union's continuing commitment to the process of peace building and reconciliation in the region over the last quarter of a century. Since 1991, successive INTERREG programmes have collectively contributed €1.13 billion to the economies of Northern Ireland, the Border region of Ireland and, since 2007, western Scotland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216"> In February of this year, the Government launched Ireland 2040. The plan is a discussion about how to secure sustained, long-term and regionally balanced progress on social, economic and environmental fronts. It is now time to think about the longer-term future of all parts of Ireland and to plan for that future. This is important and it is why it was included in our programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217"> With the return of stability there are a number of projections and challenges that are likely to be realised and we need to start planning for them now. This paper is the start of a major consultation process so that we can avoid the planning mistakes of the past. All communities and regions need to have their say. Decentralisation is not a panacea for the problems facing parts of Ireland, including the north west.</p>

            <p eId="para_1218">I am disappointed to hear the Government is not even considering redeploying jobs into rural areas. I agree with the Minister of State that decentralisation, which was first mentioned in 2003 to 2004, became a dirty word ultimately. It was a very good idea and the only thing that was wrong with it is that the three-year timeframe was too ambitious. It could not be done in three years. What happened is that when the Departments went to buy property and sites, the gun was put to their head and they were asked for ten times the price. If the plan was to be phased over a ten-year period, it would have given people a chance and senior civil servants could have had an opportunity for their children to finish school, for example. If that had been done, decentralisation would and could have worked.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219"> There are motorways everywhere in the south of the country but there is nothing when one reaches Mullingar when travelling from Dublin. Galway is fortunate to have a motorway all the way to the city, but the same is not true when one travels to Sligo. When I spoke to the IDA, I was told that when it brings people to the north west, those who make decisions are not interested once they reach Mullingar and find there is only a single carriageway road. They are not interested in travelling to Sligo or the north west because of the lack of a proper road structure. Unfortunately, that is the reality. It is not the fault of the IDA either. The people who make decisions on location are company executives. Whatever chance one has with proper infrastructure, one has no chance without it. That is why the Government should reconsider its approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220"> I spoke to a friend of mine yesterday whose son is buying a house in Dublin - two up and two down with a ground floor bathroom. The cost is €415,000. One could buy three houses for that amount of money where I live. The quality of life would be totally different. If people had an opportunity and time to make a decision and sort out their affairs, they would move because there is a good quality of life in the north west.</p>

            <p eId="para_1221">I thank Deputy Scanlon for his remarks. We are two west of Ireland people talking about the west and the north west. My philosophy is that we need to put in infrastructure which leads to development. We talk about infrastructure in terms of roads, railways and broadband. That is what the programme for Government is about. We need to make sure we end up with a balanced economy. We must develop the Atlantic economic corridor, for instance, which is in the programme for Government, in order that we create a counterbalance to the east coast along the west coast from Cork to Derry. We want to have equality in everything. People living in Dublin who have to pay €415,000 for a house are suffering and people in the west are suffering because we do not have economic opportunities for them. The programme for Government is all about creating balanced development for this country and creating a counterbalance to Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222"> A total of 600 jobs were decentralised to Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Galway in the previous decentralisation programme. Jobs in the Department of Social Protection were decentralised to Sligo. I agree with Deputy Scanlon that it is necessary to have infrastructure and to extend the roads and motorways. That is our intention. The vision for the Atlantic economic corridor is to create such infrastructure in order that we end up with a situation where our children can grow up in the west and north west, be educated, get jobs and raise our grandchildren there and that the future is safe for them all. It is about creating a balance in society. It is not a huge country but it will take a bit of effort to achieve and the programme for Government has set that out clearly. I look forward to working with Deputy Scanlon in achieving those goals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1230">I am sorry but Members are using my time. This is the second time I have had a matter selected for the Topical Issue debate concerning University Hospital Limerick for which the Minister has not turned up. On the previous occasion the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, substituted for him and she said she would come back to me with the answer but she did not do that. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, if he commits to it that he will ensure I will get a response from the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231"> The issue I raise concerns the imminent opening of the new emergency department in University Hospital Limerick, which is very welcome. It is hoped to open the department this month. I am delighted to see €24 million is being invested in a critical piece of infrastructure for our city. The amalgamation of Ennis, Nenagh and St John's hospitals was rushed and the promised centre of excellence was not delivered at the time. To date, the amalgamation has been nothing but a disaster which has led to the present emergency department being described by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in recent years as unfit for purpose. The situation remains the same today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232"> While it is great that the new emergency department is opening, I wish to address some concerns surrounding the move to the new facility that the Minister will, I hope, address. People in Limerick and the entire mid-west have waited a long time for the new emergency department which will benefit patient care and staff working conditions significantly. Having waited for years for it, it is essential we get it right.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233"> The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has raised serious concerns about the move to the new emergency department. According to HSE management, a minimum of 24 patients will be placed on trolleys and recliner chairs in the new emergency department. That has come as a severe shock. The use of trolleys in emergency departments is unacceptable. We need to move away from that means of operation and not embed them into new plans. It is unacceptable that HSE management in the hospital intends to transfer the existing trolley problem to the new emergency department rather than use it as an opportunity finally to solve the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234"> In addition, the INMO has suggested to management that space freed up in the old emergency department could be used to accommodate patients. That would lead to less overcrowding and increased patient safety, but the suggestion has been rejected by management. Other concerns raised by nurses working in the hospital include insufficient staff being assigned to the new emergency department and a lack of staff with an emergency department specialist qualification. I have long campaigned for adequate staffing and funding for University Hospital Limerick. I know how important the hospital is to Limerick and the wider mid-west, and I want to ensure the new emergency department is staffed and resourced adequately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235"> I know the staff will do their best, as they always have done for many years, to ensure patients are properly looked after when they move into the new emergency department, but they need assistance from management and the Government to address issues they can foresee as they are on the ground. Will the Minister of State ensure the Minister commits to addressing the concerns highlighted and that he will come back to me on them?</p>

            <p eId="para_1236">I thank Deputy Maurice Quinlivan for raising this very important issue. I know he cares passionately about the hospital in Limerick. I will convey all his concerns to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, who sends his apologies for not being present today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237"> I welcome this opportunity to address the House on this issue. Delivering the new emergency department at University Hospital Limerick is a key project for both the Department of Health and the HSE and is identified as a priority in the HSE National Service Plan 2017. The building is now complete and should be ready to open shortly. There is a bit of good news. The emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is one of the busiest in the country, with approximately 65,000 attendances annually. I am mindful too that demand for emergency department services at the hospital continues to rise. In 2016, University Hospital Limerick experienced a 4.6% increase in new emergency department presentations and we have seen a further increase, of 1%, so far this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238"> The House will be aware that overcrowding at the emergency department in University Hospital Limerick has been a concern for some time. I am well aware of the situation there as I have been in the hospital with family members in the past. It is clear that the accommodation and resources in the existing emergency department are not sufficient to support a modern emergency department. The emergency department in University Hospital Limerick frequently works above capacity and that contributes to inefficient ways of working and poor patient experience. However, the end is in sight and there is no doubt the opening of the new emergency department will represent a significant boost for patients in Limerick, Clare, north Tipperary and surrounding areas. Staff too will benefit from the very much improved working environment. I am delighted, therefore, to confirm that the new emergency department will be three times the size of the current department and will provide modern, safe and fit for purpose facilities that meet the expectations of patients and families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">At the same time the new facility will provide high quality, comfortable accommodation that protects patients’ privacy and dignity. This is a very important issue for patients and their families. I understand that the new accident and emergency department has been designed on a pod-based system. The design will improve efficiency and once patients have been triaged they will be assigned to different areas of the emergency department, depending on the seriousness of their condition. Each of these units or pods will have its own waiting area which will accommodate patients waiting to be seen by a clinician following triage. This is very important and is good news.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240"> Clinical teams will be assigned to these units and will be responsible for the treatment, discharge or admittance of patients, within their particular unit. Because of these separate units, it is expected that the time from triage to treatment will be much improved, resulting in fewer patients waiting extended periods of time in the emergency department, and an improvement in the patient experience time. It is also planned to open an interim short-stay unit for admitted patients in the area of the current emergency department, which was occupied by paediatric patients and the clinical decision unit. This unit will have capacity for 17 patients and will dramatically reduce the number of patients waiting on trolleys in the emergency department. The CEO of the UL hospitals group has confirmed that there is no basis for any suggestion that 24 patients will be accommodated on trolleys in the new emergency department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1241">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I must take him up on his comment on the 24 patients on trolleys because the INMO is insistent that this is what they have been told by management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242"> I welcome the positive development for Limerick. This emergency department will be a great benefit to many people. I will be visiting the hospital tomorrow at the invitation of the CEO. Limerick has waited long enough for this investment. Everybody has agreed that the old emergency department was not fit for purpose but the concerns of the nurses working on the ground are worrying. A new building and facilities will be of little use if there are no trained specialists there to staff them. These nurses from the INMO are on the ground and know the issues better than anyone. They know what works and what is needed. I suggest the Minister of State listens carefully to their concerns and addresses the problems they raise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243"> The nurses have also highlighted the need for more preparation for the move to the new facility. Only one dry run of the new facility has been undertaken to date and problems were highlighted in this. It is my understanding that normally two or three dry runs are done before a move like this. Nurses want more preparation and more run-throughs before patients start coming through the doors. Management is clearly not listening to the INMO and that is why I must raise it here. I look forward to the Minister of State taking action on these issues. I welcome what is happening and I hope the Minister of State does not turn what is such a good news story for Limerick into a bad news story by not addressing the issues raised by the nurses.</p>

            <p eId="para_1244">Of course I will bring Deputy Quinlivan's points to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris. I take the Deputy's point that it is very important for us to listen to the voices of the nurses on the ground. INMO has always been very positive and constructive in the negotiations, especially in the last 12 months, because both sides have the patient at heart. Their voices should be heard when we are involved in the development of the health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245"> We have a problem in relation to filling nursing positions. It is a difficulty and the Government is working hard to tackle this. We have the money for it in the budget, but it is difficult to recruit some of the nurses. We are trying very hard, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, is working very hard on that matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246"> The new emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is absolutely state of the art. It will be open soon and I wish everyone in it well. It shows that when we do things we can do them well. Let us hope we can always improve patient safety and best practice.</p>

        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_371">
          <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1247">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">This Bill is part of a two phase process. I have produced it in its current form to ascertain the views of the House on the matter. If the House is prepared to support it I will then bring forward legislation to provide for a constitutional referendum so this prohibition can be written into the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249"> I understand that we do not have the resources available to the Minister and the Government when we draft. There may be technical flaws but I am not worried about this as we can iron those out as we go along. This evening I am trying to ascertain the views of the majority of the House on the matter and on whether these types of levies should be prevented in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250"> I shall provide the House with some context. The State pension, relied on by many of those aged over 66, is coming under tremendous pressure and will come under more pressure as the years go by. I will demonstrate this shortly. We must try to encourage people to save to provide for themselves so they will not suffer penury in their old age. To do this we must have incentives for people to save, but we must also remove the disincentives. There is no doubt that this levy was a powerful disincentive to people who wished to put away part of their earnings to provide for their future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251"> People are living longer, which is a good thing, but it presents huge challenges for the traditional type of pension the State provides for its older people in retirement. This has already been recognised in the extension of the pension age to 67 as the age at which people become eligible for the State pension, and to 68 in future years. Growing life expectancy and the increasing duration of retirement is ratcheting up the pressure on the State pension year by year. CSO statistics published in 2013 predict that mortality rates will decrease and this will result in gains in life expectancy from birth. For males this will be from 77.9 years in 2010 to 85.1 years in 2046. For females this increase in life expectancy will be from 82.7 years in 2010 to 88.5 years in 2046. These statistics also reveal that the total fertility rate is expected to decline by 1.8% by 2026. The combination of decreasing fertility rates and increasing life expectancy will have serious implications for the State's ability to meet pension costs into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252"> The national pensions framework in 2010 highlighted that currently for every pensioner there are six people at work to support the pensioner. By 2060 the figure will be less than two people. Expenditure on the State pension and related welfare schemes, which was discussed last week at the welfare Estimates, amounted to approximately €7 billion in 2017. This is 35% of the total current expenditure for the Department of Social Protection. According to a report published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, over the period 2016 to 2020 there will be an average increase in the numbers of people collecting the State pension of more than 20,000 people per annum. There will be an estimated increase in cost of €233 million per annum, at current money values. This is with no increase in rates. The same report states that, even accounting for the rise in the eligible age of the State pension from 66 to 67 in 2021, the average increase in numbers collecting the State pension will be 22,600 per annum, from 2022 to 2026. The estimated costs will increase by €260 million per annum, again even with rates standing still.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253"> The CSO's quarterly national household survey, published in May 2016, revealed there was a fall in the number of people who had a private pension in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to the same period in 2009. In the fourth quarter 2015, 47% of all workers aged between 20 and 69 had an occupational pension, personal pension or both. This compares with 51% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 54% in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">The CSO statistics also revealed that pension coverage remained lowest among younger workers. As I said, the State has sought to confront this problem in various ways, including, because of increasing longevity, increasing the age at which people would be entitled to the pension. That legislation is in place and will come into effect in 2021 and 2028.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255"> The State has also been providing tax relief. I do not have the exact figure for the total revenue foregone per annum by the State in respect of tax relief for people who contribute to their pension but it runs into billions of euro. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in a reply to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on 26 May 2015 said that if we were to limit to the standard rate the relief that could be deducted for pension purposes in 2015, the amount gained by the Exchequer in 2015 would be approximately €480 million. That would be the amount accruing if the rate was standardised and is not the total cost of tax relief on pension savings. On the one hand, we are spending billions of euro encouraging people to save and on the other hand we have a levy in place which is a discouragement to saving. The Minister will be aware that I have brought forward a Bill on mandatory retirement - a similar Bill has been brought forward by Sinn Féin - which seeks to abolish mandatory retirement at the age of 65. There is no law in this country that requires that a person must retire at 65 years of age but the contracts to which people sign up usually provide for retirement at the age of 65. The legislation I have proposed seeks to make that illegal. I would like the Minister to indicate when that legislation will progress to Committee Stage. If enacted, it would alleviate the situation to some extent but more needs to be done. </p>
          <p eId="para_1256"> There has been talk about auto-enrolment, which where one provides for a supplementary pension in addition to the basic State pension. As for how it works, the employee, who is enrolled in the scheme but can choose to remain in the scheme or to opt out of it, pays a set amount, which is matched by the employer and similarly by the State. That system has been introduced in the United Kingdom and I understand from a recent Mercer report that it is working very well. As far as I am aware, 80% of people have not opted out thus far. It also operates in Australia and other countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_1257"> I have to hand a copy of a document issued following a press conference on 3 March 2010. The conference was attended by the then Taoiseach the Minister for Finance, that is, the Minister himself and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. The announcement states that the Irish State pension system will be reformed and will remain as the fundamental basis of the pension system in Ireland but that a new supplementary pension scheme will be introduced to provide additional retirement income for employees who are not already in a pension scheme. It is stated that in terms of operation, there will be a contribution from the employee who can choose to remain in the scheme or to opt out, a contribution from the employer and a contribution from the State. This was supposed to happen in 2014.</p>

          <p eId="para_1261">My apologies, the Minister is correct. To the best of my recollection, the Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government contained a similar commitment. Deputy Burton, when Minister for Social Protection, mentioned this numerous times but we have seen no action on it. The current Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, in his recent campaign for the leadership of Fine Gael announced a new SSIA-type pension scheme for Ireland, which appears to be a new idea but is really the auto-enrolment system under another name. As I said, this system as operates in Australia and the UK and so on. Even if we do proceed to the auto-enrolment system it will not obviate the need for further savings. We must continue to encourage people to save and we must also ensure that if such system comes into effect, it cannot be subject to a levy. That pot of money must not be subject to a levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262"> The introduction of a levy on private pension savings was, therefore, the opposite of what we should have been doing. In their lifetimes, Irish people today have seen two major financial crises, one in the late 1980s and another starting in 2008. The response in both instances was to introduce a levy on private sector pension funds. As a solution to a shortfall in national income, pension funds have proved an irresistible temptation to Governments that have an urgent need to secure ready cash. This does not only happen in Ireland. Argentina nationalised approximately €30 billion of pension assets in 2008. In 2013, the UK reduced its current budget deficit by taking £24 billion of Royal Mail pension assets. In Hungary, in December 2010, the Government seized €14 billion to reduce public debt. There is an ongoing situation in Poland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263"> Private pensions are savings that hard-working individuals have carefully put away over the years in order that they can care for themselves in old age rather than rely solely on the State. We are hearing an ever-growing refrain about the pension time bomb and the need for people to save for their retirement. The levy imposed between 2011 and 2015 ran totally contrary to this. We should be increasing rather than reducing a person's incentive to save. This levy undermined faith in pension savings. It is no wonder therefore that the participation rate is falling. People do appreciate the need to save: they just do not trust the system. Hence, the need to discontinue levying private savings. It is akin to seizing part of a person's bank deposit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264"> Between 2011 and 2015, the levy took approximately €2,393 million from private savings and hit 750,000 people. It undermined the principle of saving for retirement. It had implications for the financial security of individuals in retirement. It penalised those who were most prudent in saving for retirement. It also had other consequences. For example, it added to the difficulties of many defined benefit pension schemes already struggling to pay pensioners their entitlements. The pension schemes were already in crisis before the levy was introduced and its imposition only served to increase the financial strain they were already under. Hundreds of defined benefit pension schemes have either closed or are closed to new members. The levy was a significant contributory factor in that regard. There were other manifest injustices. For example, pensioners in defined benefit schemes paid the levy, whereas those that had their pensions secured by annuities did not. Individuals who transferred their benefits here from overseas, who had not benefitted from one penny of Irish tax relief, were nevertheless subjected to the levy. </p>
          <p eId="para_1265"> A key feature of pension schemes is that the money is locked away until a person retires, which could be for 40 or more years. For this reason, pensions are increasingly perceived by people as being highly insecure and susceptible to the whims of future Governments. We need a pension system in Ireland that is secure, fair and straightforward. Given the manner in which State benefits for the elderly have been eroded in recent times and will be even more difficult to provide for fully into the future, we must ensure that such a punitive disincentivising measure cannot be imposed on our citizens again without their acquiescence. Public sector pensions were also reduced but these are in the process of being restored under the FEMPI legislation and they are secure, including the pensions of Members of this House. It is time we focused on protecting and securing the pensions of workers in the private sector, which is the purpose of this legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_376" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2017-05-25T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1266">I am pleased to speak to the Bill presented by Deputy O'Dea, which seeks to prohibit any future legislation that would impose a levy, or similar charge, on pension funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">Specifically, the Bill proposes that, "No legislation, Statutory Instrument, or Ministerial Directive shall be proposed or accepted which would allow the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, any amendments to those Acts, or any similar existing or future legislation, to provide for a Stamp Duty Levy, or any similar charge, to be unilaterally applied to pension funds legitimately set up under appropriate pension legislation."</p>
          <p eId="para_1268"> At the outset, I want to outline some important legal issues in relation to the Bill. I am advised that the proposed fettering of discretion in this manner is contrary to the exclusive legislation-making power of the Oireachtas, contrary to Article 15.2 of the Constitution and the ability of the Oireachtas to amend law in the future. The Bill is also arguably contrary to Article 17 and 28 of the Constitution as it fetters the power of the Executive to propose a money Bill to raise future funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269"> I am further advised that these two fetters on both the Oireachtas and the Executive would require a constitutional amendment to allow for such legislation into the future which would bind successive Oireachtas and the Executive. It will also have a significant impact on the Executive as to how it proposes to raise public funds in accordance with the constitutional architecture for tax measures under Articles 11, 17 and 28 of the Constitution. While it is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle to determine, I am advised that there is also an argument that the Bill is a money Bill, since Article 22 of the Constitution also refers to Bills which either repeal or relate to the remission of taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270"> The Bill is a measure to prevent a type of taxation in the future and a way of raising money. I note that Deputy O'Dea acknowledged, in his comments when he was initiating this Bill, that it would inescapably involve an amendment to the Constitution. However, I note that the Bill he has presented for debate today makes no reference whatsoever to the Constitution. It is not clear, then, how section 2 of the Bill would work as it provides that the Bill would become law 21 days after having been passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271"> More broadly, the function of our Constitution is to set out our fundamental legal provisions in areas such as how Ireland is governed and the rights of Irish citizens. A hallmark of successful constitutional arrangements is that they provide both stability and the necessary flexibility. Bunreacht na hÉireann, like most basic laws, is a relatively rigid constitution in that it can be changed only by amendment or replacement entirely through a referendum of the people. The necessary flexibility is achieved through decisions made by the Oireachtas and its constituent elements, the legislature and the Executive. This flexibility is vital so that government, in the broader sense of the word, can be in a position to react appropriately and sometimes swiftly to changing circumstances and events in the life of the nation. The Deputy's Bill would involve a deviation from that fundamental constitutional construct by requiring the placing of a provision directly into the Constitution in relation to a very narrow area, concerning a specific asset, namely, a pension. That is not a sound legal practice and is not something, therefore, that the Government can support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272"> The circumstances in 2011, when the stamp duty levy on pension schemes was introduced, were probably the most perilous economic conditions the State has experienced since its foundation. It was necessary that every sector of Irish society made its contribution towards our national recovery. It is an unavoidable fact that the unprecedented economic situation required extraordinarily hard and very often unpopular decisions. Radical action simply had to be taken to preserve and boost jobs. The pension levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. Stamp duty levies applying to the assets of funded pension arrangements were introduced in 2011 to pay for the jobs initiative, the chargeable persons for which are the trustees of pension schemes and others responsible for the management of pension fund assets. The original 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets ended in 2014. The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund the jobs initiative, also ended in 2015. It is worth noting that annual tax relief on supplementary pensions is estimated at €2.4 billion, while the total yield of the pensions levy between the years of 2011 and 2015 was €2.4 billion. The intention was to claw back some of this with times being so bad. The alternatives were to go after the ordinary worker with income tax increases, more USC or more VAT and excise. The recovery in the economy helped pension funds to grow subsequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273"> The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the jobs initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the initiative has been a success in this regard. The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the temporary halving of the lower employer PRSI rate. The funds raised by way of the pension levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy, that is the pension scheme trustees, etc., will benefit from the changes which I began in budget 2015 and which have continued in subsequent budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274"> I note the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Dea when he introduced his Bill in relation to the sustainability of pensions in Ireland having regard to an ageing population and the future ratio of workers to people aged over 65. The Deputy will be interested to know that, consistent with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to work to make our older years better years, the Minister for Social Protection is currently developing an action plan for pension reform. This is expected to set out a vision and a five-year plan to enable sustainable and adequate income for people in retirement. My understanding is that the Minister is examining areas for inclusion in a comprehensive plan including reform of the contributory State pension, the introduction of automatic enrolment in a new earnings-related retirement savings system, measures to provide for improved standards and governance in existing schemes and the establishment of an interdepartmental pensions reform and taxation group. The action plan is expected to be brought before Government before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275"> The Deputy will also be aware that the Minister for Social Protection recently announced that the Government had approved the publication of the general scheme of the social welfare and pensions Bill 2017. That Bill contains key measures to increase protections for members of defined benefit occupational pension schemes, DB schemes, and to respond to the difficulties in defined benefit schemes. First, it requires employers who sponsor DB schemes, whether or not those schemes are in deficit, to give 12 months’ notice of their intention to cease contributions. For a scheme in deficit, the employers and trustees are required to enter into discussions to agree a funding proposal before the 12-month period expires. The Bill also introduces a time limit of six months from the date of the actuarial funding certificate for trustees of a DB scheme which is in deficit to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Authority. The Bill further provides powers to the Pensions Authority to determine a schedule of contributions that will restore DB pension schemes which do not satisfy the funding standard, or the funding standard reserve, to an adequate funding position in circumstances where a funding proposal has not been agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276"> Taking the various factors I have mentioned into account, including the legal and constitutional issues I mentioned at the outset of my speech, the Government cannot support Deputy O'Dea’s Bill. However, I thank the Deputy for initiating a very interesting discussion which I am sure he will continue to pursue with whoever is the new Minister for Social Protection.</p>

          <p eId="para_1277">It is not too often that Irish politics can still shock in its hypocrisy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">We have become immune to brass necks and parties brazenly pretending to be one thing when their record shows the opposite to be the case. This Bill takes the biscuit. The party that ploughed the National Pension Reserve Fund into the bad banks now wants to protect people's pensions. The party that wrecked the economy wants to be responsible. It is not credible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279"> I do not think this is a serious Bill. This is not how we make laws. It is being suggested that we should put a law in place to prevent another law being introduced. However, if the Government tomorrow decided to bring that law in, it would simply repeal this one. This is not a serious Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280"> On First Stage, Deputy O'Dea claimed this Bill would provoke a constitutional referendum. I have read the Bill and see no evidence that it would cause a referendum. Fianna Fáil promised a constitutional referendum. That being so, why does the Bill not do that? The Deputy sees this as a test Bill. If it passes, another piece of legislation will introduce the referendum. Deputy O'Dea said that he brought this Bill forward to ascertain the views of the House. That could have been done by means of a phone call or conversation. This Bill smacks of a cynical and meaningless move by Fianna Fáil, which made a promise it has no intention of keeping. Nevertheless, I understand why such a move should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281"> The pension levy was a brutal and clever piece of austerity. It took billions of euro out of people's pockets but, because of the way it was done, it did not register as the massive tax that it is and was. Only recently have some have become aware that they are being charged a levy to make up for the hole the last Government scooped out of their pension pot. Over 750,000 people are now directly affected by the pension levy. When Members raise questions on this issue, the Government washes its hands, as the Minister has done repeatedly, by saying it is a matter for the trustees, as if it was not the Government's doing in the first instance. Sinn Féin opposed this levy, as it opposed all austerity measures brought in by previous Governments. On the introduction of the pension levy, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stressed that it was a temporary measure but now, years later, it is becoming apparent that for many workers this levy will mean a permanent reduction in their pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282"> When the levy was mooted, Sinn Féin called for extra safeguards to ensure it was not passed on to pensioners and workers. Our proposals were rejected. Years later, the bitter fruit is now ripening. In 2015, Deputy Pearse Doherty persuaded the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to write to the Pensions Ombudsman to express the anger of many workers who were getting letters telling them their pension would be cut for the rest of their lives. The Ombudsman did not pull his punches when he said the imposition of the levy was legal, though not necessarily fair. </p>
          <p eId="para_1283"> At the time of the imposition of the levy, Government spokesmen expressed the hope, or even expectation, that employers could be requested or required by trustees to make good the levy. That was never going to happen. Approximately 80% of funded defined benefit schemes were already in deficit, as measured by the minimum funding standard under the Pensions Act, and the majority of employers were experiencing financial difficulty in any event, even disregarding the deficits already accumulated in the occupational pension schemes. Consequently, most trustees of defined benefit schemes had no option but to pay the levy from the assets of the scheme. Let us be honest: it is not the pension funds that are to blame - it is the wrecking austerity resulting from the scorched earth economic policy of Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284"> Deputy O'Dea mentioned the Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill 2016. I acknowledge that he put forward a Bill which was due to be debated in the House and pulled that it in order to row in behind the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2016 that I brought forward and which has gone through Second Stage and been sent for pre-legislative scrutiny. We are now waiting on a money message from the Minister to allow that Bill move to Committee Stage. Thousands of people are coming to the age where they will be forced out of employment not because of an inability to do the work but solely based on their age. Many of them have the ability and want to remain in work. There is cross-party support for my Bill, which is important legislation. I ask the Minister to address that issue. A money message is needed to allow that legislation move to the next Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285"> My party is not opposed to the Pension Fund (Prohibition of Levies) Bill but we are aware that in all likelihood it is not intended to be progressed in any serious way. It certainly does not belong in the Constitution.</p>

          <p eId="para_1286">Deputy O'Dea has expressed concern about pensions and their sustainability. He has published a separate Private Member's Bill in regard to defined benefit schemes. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, is conscious of the need for reforms in the area of defined benefit pensions schemes and in that regard he has published the general scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. That Bill aims to change the current position whereby the employer can trigger events that wind up a scheme and have no responsibility for bringing a scheme back to a stable position. The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 provides for improved engagement between employers, pension scheme trustees and scheme members as well as providing a 12 month lead-in time in situations where an employer intends to wind up a defined benefit scheme. This reform is very important in view of the unfortunate cases where employers ceased contributing to defined pension schemes with very little notice to scheme members. The Minister's proposed amendments would give time for engagement and negotiation between trustees, scheme members and employers as well as giving time for trustees and scheme members to plan the wind-up of the scheme and discuss and consider alternative pension provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287"> The Bill provides for more certain timelines than is currently the case. Specifically, it proposes to introduce a six-month timeline for the submission of funding proposals for schemes in deficit and obliges employers sponsoring defined benefit schemes, whether in deficit or not, to give 12 months' notice of their intention to cease contributions. The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 will provide an incentive to employers to engage with trustees and to ensure employees and the Pensions Authority are informed of the employer's intention with a significant lead-in time. This compares favourably with the current situation whereby employers can walk away from a scheme at any time. The proposed amendments improve protection for members of defined benefit schemes while strengthening the obligation and incentive for employers and trustees to reach agreement to eliminate any shortfalls in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288"> The Minister is also working to give practical effect to the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to make our older years better years. He will be bringing forward a five-year action plan for Government approval which will provide a blueprint for sustainable and adequate incomes for people following their retirement. These measures demonstrate the Government's commitment to this area. I thank Deputy O'Dea for giving us the opportunity to debate the important issue of pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289"> There are now no levies on pension funds. The primary levy ended in 2014 and the smaller levy ended in 2015. The Government has no intention of reintroducing the levies. There is no issue arising from the programme for Government that would suggest that there is any prospect of a levy in the immediate future. Consequently, the very far-ranging imposition on the Constitution proposed by the Deputy is disproportionate, in my view, to the prospect of a levy, which no one intends imposing, arising in the future. While I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to debate the issue, I do not think he should proceed with this particular Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290"> The levy was introduced in desperate times. The option being pushed at us by the troika was to abolish the tax relief on pensions. We refused to do that. If one looks at the simple arithmetic of it, approximately one quarter of what was given to pension funds in terms of tax relief was taken back by the Exchequer over a very temporary period. There is no intention of doing that again. Very generous tax breaks are still allowed for those who save for pensions. This will remain the case and it is the intention of the Government to continue on that basis. The money collected at the time was put to very good use. The hospitality sector and the tourist industry were restored by the drop in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9%. In the context of a wider economic framework, the restoration of economic growth and of so many sectors in the economy has underpinned pension funds in this country, has made such funds viable again and has increased the potential benefits to pensioners. Taking it in the round, the levy was a good temporary measure in an emergency but not to be advocated as a permanent part of the tax code.</p>

          <p eId="para_1291">I appreciate that there is no levy in place now but we want to ensure that it will not, at some point in the future, be brought back in the format in which it previously existed. No Government wants to bring in a levy like that, but the amount of moneys held by pension funds is an irresistible temptation to Governments when times are hard and when ready cash is needed. The Minister mentioned the tax relief for pension contributions, which is very generous, but unfortunately the problem with the tax relief for pension contributions is that it operates in a very skewed way. I saw figures recently which suggested that 70% of that tax relief went directly to the top 20% of earners and less than 0.5% went to the bottom 20% of earners. We have to try to find a better way to do it. In view of what the Minister said about the Constitution and in view of the advice he has got I will not push this Bill to a vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292"> Deputy Brady said that this is not the way to go about making laws. That is rich coming from the masters of the one or two-line Bill. They give the impression that they are doing something and that they have some concerns about people from any walk of life. I could cite a list of them here now but I will not delay the House.</p>
