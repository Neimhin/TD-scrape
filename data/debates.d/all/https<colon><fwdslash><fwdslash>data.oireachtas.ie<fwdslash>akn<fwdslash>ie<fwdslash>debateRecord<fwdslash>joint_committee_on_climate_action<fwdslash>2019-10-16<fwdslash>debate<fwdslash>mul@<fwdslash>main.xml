At the request of the broadcasting and recording service, I remind members, witnesses and visitors in the Public Gallery to ensure their telephones are turned off or switched to flight mode. The meeting will consist of two sessions, the first of which is an examination of the Climate Change Advisory Council's annual review for 2019. I welcome Professor John FitzGerald, chairman of the council, and Mr. Phillip O'Brien, member of the council secretariat.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. </p>

          <p eId="para_22">I thank the Chairman. We are already experiencing the effects of climate change. Moreover, no matter how successful we are in our efforts to mitigate them, those effects will get worse over the next 50 years because of historical and continuing global greenhouse gas emissions. The impacts of climate change often seem distant from everyday life but, in recent years, we have experienced several extreme weather events, the cumulation of which clearly shows the adverse consequences of changes in our climate. Public awareness of the need for adaptation remains low. Adaptation is not only a matter for Government but will require an even greater response and investment by households and the business sector in planning for higher temperatures, flooding and so on. While sectoral and local adaptation strategies have been developed, we have identified gaps in respect of coastal areas, housing and planning. These areas have not been properly addressed under the current plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Robust carbon pricing is essential to support action by individuals and businesses to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. While it will directly encourage households and businesses to reduce emissions, the major effect will come from encouraging investment in low-carbon or zero-carbon technologies, including in heating and cars. That is where the real pay-off will come. The revenue raised should be used to ensure a just transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable economy and society. We welcome the budget provision of €90 million for that purpose. The Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, had recommended that the carbon tax be raised to €35 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in budget 2020, increasing to at least €80 per tonne by 2030. Nevertheless, the modest increase in carbon tax announced last week is welcome. While the Minister expressed the view that similar increases should continue every year until 2030, it would have been better if that commitment had been enshrined in legislation. The commitment in this committee's report to such a strategy is welcome and offers an assurance that we are beginning a journey in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> This year's budget began the process of ring-fencing revenue to support a just transition. Urgent actions are necessary in the agriculture, forestry and land use sectors. The council has given particular attention to these sectors, which we outlined in a special chapter in our annual review. We recognise that opportunities exist to reduce emissions while, at the same time, safeguarding farm incomes and providing multiple co-benefits to society. Beef and dairy production in Ireland is relatively efficient in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per unit product. However, improvements in efficiency have not been able to keep pace with the observed increase in absolute emissions. In recent years, the expansion of the national dairy herd has been a major contributor to increases in agricultural emissions. Reduction of the suckler herd would make an important and cost-effective contribution to mitigation and could support alternative land uses such as increased woodland, raise farm incomes and reduce the exposure of the sector to external market shocks, including Brexit. However, the dairy sector must also play its part through the implementation of technologies and management practices which reduce emissions. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is an important opportunity to design supports which will help farmers to restructure in a way that increases their income and rewards environmental and climate actions. </p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The CCAC is concerned about the low rates of afforestation achieved in recent years. Research and policy innovations are required to overcome the barriers to afforestation. It is only by talking to people who own the land that we can understand what those obstacles are. Afforestation activity might look like a win-win on a spreadsheet but it is not happening and we need to work out why. Each individual will have a different answer to that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> The council has recommended that the Government publish a detailed plan for achieving its commitment to end the burning of coal at Moneypoint by 2025. We also recommend the cessation of peat-fired electricity generation in 2020. </p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The construction and building sector is operating near full capacity. There is an urgent need to increase its ability to deliver the necessary retrofit programme without impacting on the delivery of increased numbers of houses. The Government should lead by example through investment in retrofitting local authority housing. This would provide certainty to construction firms of a long-term commitment to retrofitting, as well as providing multiple benefits to low-income households and developing the capacity of the building construction sector to deliver for everybody who needs to upgrade a dwelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The CCAC welcomes the climate action plan as providing a significant step forward in tackling climate change. The plan includes proposals for a wide range of measures and new governance arrangements which will enable us to meet our 2030 targets. However, implementation in a cost-effective manner and robust governance of the implementation of the plan are critical if we are to realise our ambitions.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">Professor FitzGerald noted that beef and dairy production in Ireland is relatively efficient in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per unit product. However, he went on to identify two difficulties with those sectors, the first being the size of the herd and the second relating to the need to implement new technologies and management practices. Will Professor FitzGerald elaborate on that point?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from> Professor John FitzGerald<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_30">Teagasc has laid out a range of measures in this regard, many of which will save farmers money and some of which will not have much impact. The latter include changing fertiliser, which would reduce nitrogen oxide, NOx, emissions. It is a question of actually implementing those measures but, realistically, these things do not happen overnight. If they could be done overnight, we probably would not be worrying as much about the size of the herd. We expect they will be implemented gradually, but not fully, over the next decade, which could leave a gap. At the moment, as we all are aware, beef farmers are making nothing net out of their work and Brexit is likely to make that situation much worse. My understanding is that for many farmers, shifting some of their land to less intensive farming - using some of it for woodland, for example - could increase their incomes. It might also provide a more secure income. I have been working in agricultural economics for 43 years and beef farming has always been a difficult business.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> With Brexit and with artificial beef coming along and a whole range of other issues, reducing the herd could secure farmers' income and lead to a substantial reduction in emissions. The problem is how to implement that change. I am 70 this month and if I were asked to turn into a farmer tomorrow, it would not happen. Likewise, it is not easy for beef farmers to turn into foresters and it will not happen overnight. This is something the farming community will do because it wants to do it and because it sees that it will be profitable and manageable. We need to look at overcoming the obstacles if we are to facilitate a transition that could be a win-win for farmers and for climate action. Such a transition can make a major contribution but it will not happen overnight.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">I thank Professor FitzGerald for his presentation and his ongoing work in advising us in his role as chairman of the council. The priority recommendations in the committee's report impose a large degree of the encumbrance of the work that needs to be done on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and on Teagasc. We must see those bodies being held to account. I am confident the Department will deliver in this regard. In fact, one of the best presentations to the committee was from that Department, which showed a clear understanding of the scale of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">We need to see actions and timelines to implement and promote the uptake of these measures, particularly the mitigation measures and the pathways mentioned by Teagasc. We need movement on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> I am taken by the witnesses' analysis and think it is on the money regarding what is happening in agriculture. There is an intensification in the dairy sector in recognition of market demand. At a recent conference I attended, I heard somebody from the dairy sector talking about a 30% increase in the dairy cow herd in the past three to four years. This person is working on the basis of a further 30% increase in the next four to five years. What are the witnesses' views on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> There is a very specific reliance on the suckler beef herd on less good land, possibly more as a way of life than as a means to an income. This cannot be underestimated. Professor FitzGerald's final comment probably spoke to that. Turning a suckler beef farmer into a forester will not happen. There is a connection with the land and the production, purchase and sale of animals that is a way of life. It is like telling a musician to go and play basketball. It is as stark as that for farmers in that sector. The overintensification on the dairy side has a very significant knock-on effect. Notwithstanding the emissions related to it, it is having a very considerable knock-on effect because it is increasing supply into the beef market and reducing the price. Have the witnesses any views on the strategy around our dairy herd and dairy output? How do they view that?</p>

          <p eId="para_36">What we say is that we really do not have space to increase significantly the dairy herd and its related emissions in the coming decade. If that happened, we would need a dramatic reduction in the beef herd. The Deputy made the point that they are not totally separable. Calves are produced in dairy herds and end up in beef herds. We would be concerned that the agricultural emissions targets would not be met if there was a 30% increase in the dairy herd. That would pose major challenges to the sector in terms of meeting its targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Interesting work is ongoing in terms of how, without changing a way of life, we can reduce emissions or increase the amount of carbon being fixed. One thing worth looking at that is being researched is increasing hedgerows so that we use them instead of barbed wire. A certain amount of land will be used but the hedgerows may fix carbon. That is an option that would not require a change of life. I am not saying that is a solution but research on it is ongoing. It could be interesting and would be compatible with existing farming practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> Research is ongoing in Armagh into planting trees in pasture at intervals. The trees suck up the moisture when it is very wet in winter and farmers may be able to have their cattle out for 12 weeks longer, which brings about a significant reduction in NOx emissions. There higher NOx emissions when cattle are inside. Feeding cattle is expensive over winter. There are things that can be done. Further work that has not yet been factored in could see progress. Going back to the really important issue raised by the Deputy, a large increase in the dairy herd would pose major problems.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">We have to look at that. Regarding land use and management, we need to have a plan in place for the next round of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to capture that money. In my constituency office, I deal on an ongoing basis with farmers whose payments are cut because they overdeclared for a parcel of land that in the minds of those in the Department was not in active farming. It was not in grassland. When the satellite passed over and took a picture of the land, there was an area of scrub so the Department sought to exclude that and, therefore, reduce the area for which the farmer claimed. This has a knock-on effect on the farmer's payment because he or she is not regarded as actively farming the land. In truth, the area that has perhaps gone wild and is not grazeable is of greater benefit in terms of biodiversity and carbon capture in the long run. We have a lot to do in terms of that because we are forcing an unnecessary clearing of that land whereas farmers seem to be happy enough with. Perhaps it is poor land in the first instance where not much grass can be grown. If something else grows on it, so be it.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I agree with the Deputy, who is more expert on this than I am. What he is saying sounds eminently sensible and consistent with improving our performance on climate change. There is another CAP related issue about which we need to think. Peatlands absorb a large amount of carbon. As we move out of peat, they will need to be managed, but what happens if there is no income coming from it? We need people to manage peatlands. We cannot just leave them there. The question arises as to whether CAP should provide some compensation for farmers who manage peatlands in a manner that does us all a service by stocking carbon dioxide. We need to think of land use in new ways that will be good for farmers, biodiversity and the climate.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">Deputy Dooley has covered most of the points I wanted to raise. Regarding Professor FitzGerald's point about not becoming a farmer overnight and Deputy Dooley's point about a suckler farmer not becoming a forester overnight, how do we change that mentality so that a farmer wants to become a forester? I am not defending one way or the other. I agree with what Professor FitzGerald is saying. He talks about moving away from the suckler herd to afforestation, but at the same time, he mentions displacement of beef that has been produced efficiently, as he rightly noted, by imported beef from Brazil, where they are cutting down rain forests. How do we overcome that argument with the farmer, because an element of, to use an abrupt word, stubbornness kicks in at that stage? While farmers might see the logic in what Professor FitzGerald is saying and see the financial benefits, they will ask why they should be reducing their herds that have come to them from their fathers and grandfathers, because as Deputy Dooley noted, it is a tradition in families, when all this is happening across the globe. This is a global issue. If we solve our problems in Ireland, how much of a factor will it be in the overall picture? Regarding the point about a farmer not becoming a forester, he or she will have to, so how do we cajole him or her into making that change?</p>

As one gets older, one may be replaced by younger children who may have a different view. From talking to younger farmers, I can say that they see more of the logic in this. Those of us who are parents and grandparents may be influenced by our children to change our ways as we get older. We are not looking for an overnight revolution. We are looking for an evolution over an 11-year period as people realise that they might be able to do better through farming in a different way.</p>

          <p eId="para_44"> Another matter is that of Departments working in cohesion, for example, on the issue of planning further down the line for solar panels on agricultural buildings or lands, with feed-in tariffs etc. An amalgamation in this regard could give farmers an impetus to achieve carbon neutralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> I have a problem with something, and if I have a problem with it, then so do farmers. I am referring to the carbon footprint of food production in Ireland versus in South America. Will Professor FitzGerald comment on this issue?

          <p eId="para_48">I will be brief, as most of my comments have already been made. What is Professor FitzGerald's view of the dairy industry? He mentioned where he thought it would go and the most appropriate way it could develop over the next decade. It will probably be one of the key issues for the question of affordability. Consider what the commodity market is doing in terms of farming. Given production costs, the money realistically will be made in dairy. That is why there has been an influx of farmers, in particular younger ones, into dairy production from beef outlets. Could changes in dairy practices form a major part of the expansion? We use terms like "anaerobic digestion" and have policies to ensure a biogas network is built so that excess slurry and grass can be used to generate energy. Could a combination of anaerobic digestion and an expansion of the dairy herd allow rural Ireland to be profitable? There is a global drive for dairy products at the moment but no such global drive for beef products.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> I do not mean to be rude about it, but forestry in certain parts of the country is considered to be on bad land. Is there a social responsibility on all farmers to give over a certain percentage of their holdings, big or small, dry or wet, to forestry? If so, how would that work?</p>

          <p eId="para_50">I thank Professor FitzGerald for his presentation. Speaking as someone from Offaly in the midlands, where a third of our county is peat soil and has been used for harvesting turf for electricity generation for decades, the future of the peatlands is at the forefront of my mind. A certain amount of the boglands is being rehabilitated and restored by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Bord na Móna has completed harvesting except on some bogs. Given that its main client no longer requires as much peat as was intended, though, a serious issue arises in that regard. Private operators are harvesting peat for horticultural use and exports to the UK and so on. Has the Climate Change Advisory Council had an opportunity to consider how all of that will be managed in terms of the rehabilitation and restoration that are required? If the boglands are not being used for harvesting as they were in the past, how much carbon can be saved? I believe that the average figure for carbon sequestered by peatlands throughout the country is 57,400 tonnes per year, which is significant. Has the council had time to go into that in detail?</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> Has the council had a chance to consider the implications for Bord na Móna and the ESB of the recent An Bord Pleanála decision concerning the west Offaly power station at Shannonbridge? The station's application to co-fire peat and biomass to 2027 has been refused. We all agree that there should be a just transition, but it needs an agreed timeline and, all of a sudden, the transition has been fast-forwarded to 2020, if not the end of 2019 when the PSO runs out. The implications for the workers in the area are very severe. I would like Professor FitzGerald's view on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">On 9 May, which was Europe Day, a joint sitting of this committee and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine held an interesting debate. Dr. Sinéad McCarthy from Teagasc appeared before us. We considered the questions of food and carbon emissions from our beef industry. One issue that arose related to how most of the plant-based protein foods that we might rely on as alternatives to meat were imported. This was striking. None of those foods that one buys from Tesco or some other shops is made in Ireland. My understanding is that our soil and climate are not best suited to the types of crop in question. Such crops would have to be imported. If they are coming from the tropics, then we are talking about developing countries that face their own food shortage challenges and about the carbon footprint of bringing the food to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Dr. McCarthy expanded on the notions that we were best placed to get our protein from meat and dairy as opposed to beans and other plant-based protein crops, given that our cattle were grass fed, and that, as one got older, one would have to eat more beans to meet one's protein requirements compared with meat. Perhaps these are not matters that the council has considered, but they need further discussion. The issue of food is emotive and the debate has not been expanded upon enough. The debate has been slanted by people who have not looked into it enough, and while there is a bigger discussion in the round, beef is getting a bashing. At the end of the day, though, we have to eat food. There are many dimensions to this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I hope I manage to deal with them all. Taking Deputy Neville's and Senator Mulherin's together, Ireland has set an obligation to reduce our emissions by 2030. While we are more efficient than many other countries, we are less efficient than some. The council's supplementary working paper shows that, although Ireland is top of the class in some cases, it is not in others.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I will turn to the issue of carbon efficiency and what is coming down the tracks, particularly in terms of what Senator Mulherin mentioned. In July, I was babysitting my grandchildren in Boston. I took my 11 year old grandson and my seven year old granddaughter to the Museum of Science, which is one of the best in the world. There were two 15-minute lectures on that afternoon. My grandson stated that he wanted to go to one on synthetic biology and another on climate change. The former was well delivered and my grandson got all the issues. I did too, and I learned a certain amount. It covered how DNA had been transferred from beef to vegetable matter, specifically soya, and how beef was now being produced from that matter. <i>The Vegan Times</i> panned it, saying it was awful because it tasted just like beef.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> The next day, my grandson said he wanted a falafel sandwich. He knew a place near the children's hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">I took him there and he got his falafel sandwich but they were selling burgers with artificial beef. I did not try one as I did not fancy it and nor did he but two weeks ago, Barclays said that, within the next ten years, 10% of the world's beef would be met from artificial beef, which we will not be able to tell from real beef. The beef sector will be under huge pressure and if 10% of the world's supply is taken out by a cheaper alternative, the worldwide market will be much more difficult. Farmers in six states of the United States have got together to lobby for Burger King to have to label artificial beef as such, because they are very concerned. There will be knock-on effects because of the relationship between milk and beef, which Deputy Dooley identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> Senator Mulherin asked about imports. Two thirds of everything on our supermarket shelves are made in the United Kingdom or imported through the United Kingdom. We produce dramatically more beef than we need to feed ourselves. The agriculture sector has to look at these issues independently of issues around climate change. Climate change will not be the saviour but it could be the reason compensation is paid to farmers to transition out of the sector. Senator Lombard asked about offsetting with anaerobic digestion. Teagasc has assumed all these things happen with a stable dairy herd, which is necessary to meet the target. It would not allow us to increase the dairy herd and it is taken for granted that we will implement all these measures to reduce costs and emissions if we are to meet our target. I do not see it as a get-out-of-jail card.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> It was suggested that farmers be required to have a proportion of their land in forestry. As a non-farmer, I am reluctant to force farmers to do anything and it would be better to try to persuade farmers that it is in their best interests to do it. The CAP can be framed in different ways and there may be mandatory elements but we have not got involved in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked about peat. Co-firing is not an answer because if the biomass comes from Ireland, it can be much more effectively used for heating in rural areas. If it is imported, it is a double no. In any event, a lot of peat would be consumed anyway and the combined emissions would still be awful. I take the point that bringing forward the closure to today is very disruptive. Bord na Móna was planning for a longer term. I was down on bogs in Offaly and Kildare to look at what is involved and it was brought home to me that we cannot just abandon bogs - we have to manage them. It will involve much lower employment and somebody will have to pay for it because Bord na Móna will make no money if it is not selling the peat.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> I was asked about alternatives under just transition. There is €20 million which has been put aside in the budget for developing a retrofitting capacity in the midlands. One option could be for some of the workers to be trained to provide this service so that we would keep the activity and keep employment in the midlands. It is an innovative idea for using some of the €90 million in revenue. Bord na Móna showed me a number of things it is doing to prepare for alternative employment but these are not ready yet. From an environmental point of view, it was important to bring forward the closure of the bogs but how it is handled is important as a demonstration that climate change will not impose massive costs on a particular community.</p>

From what we can see, dealing with climate change will be compatible with protecting farmers' interests in the long term. We are not taking a position on the issue of alternative foods. We are saying that this is happening in the outside world and, whatever we do in Ireland, it will affect the market for agricultural produce. Given that the vast bulk of our beef and dairy products are exported, it is something we need to be concerned about and we suggest that transitioning to an alternative land use would be helpful for farmers and give them security in this uncertain external environment.</p>

It has many contentious proposals but climate change raises many challenging and contentious issues with which we need to deal, one of which is the reduction of the national herd. If we reduce our herd and our output to reduce carbon emissions, it has to be seen in the context of demand and if people still demand beef or dairy products, they will get their beef and dairy from elsewhere. I believe beef coming from South America will be the big challenge, not artificial beef. Does that not defeat the purpose of protecting the environment by reducing our national herd?

One of the reasons she won the Nobel prize was that instead of designing great schemes, she argues that economists need to get their hands dirty in understanding why schemes do not work. They are dealing with real people, who can be different. We need to look at why the schemes that are there, which look great in a spreadsheet, are not working.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">I am told many farmers could make more money, so what is the reason they are not doing so? It is not because they are stupid but because there are obstacles. I did research on the economics of biomass with ESB International and Teagasc 20 years ago. One of the problems for farmers was that if they produce biomass and there is only one buyer, farmers would have much experience of being beholden to one buyer and being screwed. We would need to look at developing the market. If farmers plant more woodland, will there be only one buyer and will they be screwed? We have not done that research. We are saying there is a problem. It looks as if the practice is profitable but it is not happening. The Department should design a scheme as the existing schemes are not working. They should be recalibrated so they will work.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">I thank Professor FitzGerald for his response. There needs to be a balance between land use for energy production, whether that is solar, wind or the other options, and land use for food production. Has the council done any analysis of how we achieve that balance or is it for others? Quite rightly, Professor FitzGerald spoke in his opening statement about the just transition and we are talking specifically about farming and agriculture. What Department or agency should anchor the just transition for that sector where farmers need to make the transition from the beef, dairy or whatever sector they are in to something else, whether that is mixed land use, afforestation etc.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has primary responsibility for agricultural matters because the CAP will be a major instrument. All of the income of beef farmers comes from the CAP because, on average, they make nothing from producing beef. This will be about how the CAP will be reconfigured in a way that is consistent with tackling the problem of climate change and rewarding farmers in a fair way. It is the challenge for the Department. In a small way other Departments are involved, but with the farming community it is probably primarily for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to deal with this. They can fight it out and I am not here to arbitrate between Departments. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is providing €3 million from the total of €90 million for green agriculture pilots. Although other Departments are involved, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will take the lead.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">The Soviet-style national planner might have said a certain amount of land should be used for this, that or the other. Telling farmers what they are to do is not the route to go. Using much more land to suck carbon from the atmosphere is important. We should remember that grassland, if used correctly, can perform some of this role. We need to shift from the land use that currently contributes to the problem to land use that can help solve the problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">There has been mention of a 70 year old farmer who might find it very difficult to make the transition. Has there been much engagement with the younger cohort, which may well be more positive about a transition that would improve the land as a carbon sink? I know Professor FitzGerald does not wish to talk about the dietary aspects but that research is important. In my niece's school and other schools, there is what is called meat shaming when kids bring in their lunch. Many kids, particularly young girls, are hiding their sandwiches or pretending they are vegetarian. There is a big shift to vegetarianism and veganism. There is a fundamental change in younger generation's lifestyles. Food Wise 2025 is seeking increased exports, so will we have to increase those exports further if we are to continue with a beef and dairy herd in the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> The period of 11 years would not be long enough for evolution. It would be more like a revolution if it happened within a decade. If farmers decide to change practice and the focus of what is done with the land, could we judge the compensation they receive by how the local environment and community is improved, all in the context of the just transition? There would be a dividend that would depend on the effectiveness of improvements to air quality, a reduction in pollution, soil fertility etc.</p>

The Senator is right that this would not deal with the matter. I would be very cautious as an older gentleman about going around telling schoolchildren what they should eat.

          <p eId="para_89">It is not going to make any difference to emissions. The CAP is required to be framed to provide compensation for environmental benefits from agriculture. That should be the bigger emphasis. I am reluctant to place too many obligations on farmers by saying they must act in ways that are good for the environment, their incomes and the local community. We cannot place too many obligations on farmers. Setting up incentives for them to farm in a way that is good for biodiversity and climate action should be part of the process and it would provide income as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">It is a question of whether it would be a significant factor in helping us meet our climate change targets. We have limited resources and we tend to stick to the high level by recommending changing land use to woodland or crops. We say these changes suck carbon out of the atmosphere and are they the way to go, rather than getting too prescriptive about the crops. Research has been done showing different grasses in the sward suck in more carbon at night and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">My second question relates to Professor FitzGerald's earlier intervention when he spoke about the need to legislate for the carbon price or tax trajectory. What would such legislation look like? If the Climate Change Advisory Council were to legislate for this tomorrow morning, what would it advise the Government to do? What would that legislation look like? Would it be highly prescriptive on the trajectory? Would it set out a certain price for every year leading up to a given target?</p>

          <p eId="para_99">I would have liked legislation stating that the carbon tax will be €26 per tonne in 2032 and then specify up to €80 thereafter and so on. The precedent for this is corporation tax. Going back decades, the Government said corporation tax would fall to 12.5% ten years hence. Of course, one Oireachtas cannot bind the next Oireachtas so it does not give us a guarantee. However, given the commitment to this in the committee report, I anticipate that if it was enshrined in legislation, it might even make it easier for the next Government, whatever its composition. Instead of making the decision to introduce a carbon tax, the Government could simply do nothing and the tax would rise in line with the recommendation. That is how I would do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">My next question relates to the financing of climate action. It is difficult for us as Members to draw a line under what is currently allocated for climate action. The whole philosophy is based on behavioural change. The people I represent are not in a position to switch from a diesel engine to a fully electric engine. They are not in a position to spend between €50,000 and €80,000 retrofitting a 1970s bungalow. If we are talking about financing, incentives have to be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> Local authority housing has extraordinary potential to take carbon out of the atmosphere. What would a scheme look like? Has the Climate Change Advisory Council given consideration to the cost of such a scheme? Has it looked at the entirety of the local authority housing stock in the country? We are starting with a project in the midlands, for which €20 million has been provided. We all absolutely welcome that, but I represent the people of Cork East. There are many people in Cork East living in local authority houses who do not believe they are eligible for such schemes. It is a question of how we incentivise private homeowners and those in local authority houses. I put it to Professor FitzGerald that if we do not have an entire figure for what has been allocated to retrofit houses, it is difficult to do an assessment of what we could allocate per house. Does the advisory council have a perspective on how we would finance that? I suggest that it must be part grant and possibly part savings. It is conceivable that when people reach a certain age, for example, when their children have flown the nest, there may be a few bob in the credit union. Maybe we could combine a grant, part savings and part loan. Has the advisory council given some thought to this?</p>

          <p eId="para_104">I identified €71 million within an hour. Then, three days later, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published a very good note that sets out where all of the €90 million will go. Of course, there is a great deal more in terms of public transport investment and so on. It would help if there was a green budget so that we could see where all of the money is going. My suspicion is that far more than the total revenue from the carbon tax is going on climate change issues, including the SEAI budget, for example. We could do better to help people find out what is being done in this area. While we are not doing enough, it would be better if people knew about what little we are doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">The vast bulk of it will have to come from their own resources. The State cannot pick up the tab. It would require a major increase in taxation or a reduction in other services to do it. That is a big ask. The question is how best to go about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> Many people are prepared to spend their own money but do not how to do it. I have talked to a significant number of people about the problems in doing it. The €20 million ring-fenced for the midlands is a beginning to the strategy. We know the State owns 100,000 or 150,000 local authority dwellings. As the landlord, the obligation is on the State to upgrade those dwellings. We could begin there and offer several contracts to upgrade 1,000 local authority dwellings next year. The number the following year could increase to 2,000 and then 5,000 after that. In that way, a builder can know that if he specialises in that area, he will have a growing volume of activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> There is one case in Kilkenny. Kilkenny County Council upgraded a local authority estate. It got an engineer and sourced a builder. Since the council was doing a large number of houses together, it got a good deal. An engineer checked that the specifications were right and the job was done correctly. What happened was that the private owners of the former local authority houses in the estate asked if they could pay for their houses to be retrofitted too. They were prepared to pay for their houses to be done because the hard work had been done by the council. That is the model. We should begin with the local authority dwellings. It has the benefit that, on average, people in local authority dwellings are less well off than people in the community as a whole. Also, many of them are elderly and may not spend enough on heating. If we upgrade their dwellings, it may lead to a health improvement. There will certainly be an income distribution benefit. Moreover, we help to develop the capacity for the rest of the community. That is why we have suggested beginning there.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> Giving me a grant to do up my house is a waste of money. For many people, the problems of doing up the house and the disruption are a far greater concern. I wrote about how my wife and I did a job on our house a decade ago. We probably need to do another one. It was driven by my wife because she said we needed to be ready for our wheelchairs. The chaos in the house was something else. I will not say it caused a divorce - happily, we have been married for more than 40 years - but the disruption to life in making the change was significant. If a homeowner upgrades the house to a BER A2 rating, it may be necessary to put in underfloor heating. That means taking everything down. We need to look at how to do this in the least disruptive fashion and help people to do it. I will go back to what I said about schemes with farmers. We need to understand the obstacles first. We should begin with local authority dwellings where there are multiple benefits, spend the scarce resources there and see how we get on.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_111">I agree with the last point made by Professor FitzGerald on the benefits of retrofitting local authority houses. I see this in my area and it is an extraordinary benefit to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> I want to focus on the principle of carbon taxes. It is something of an accepted narrative that where countries have introduced a significant carbon tax, emissions have declined significantly. I put it to Professor FitzGerald that there are other explanations for the decline in emissions in some of the models we looked at, including British Colombia and Norway. Some of it had to do with industry switching from coal to gas, outsourcing to other industries or periods of recession when manufacturing was at low levels. There is a lack of evidence showing that significant increases in carbon tax actually reduce emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">A considerable part of it is because, as we just heard, carbon tax does not change the behaviour of people who cannot afford to change their behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> Professor FitzGerald's former colleagues in the ERSI told us here at a separate meeting that they disagreed with the model of carbon tax that the Government is introducing. They favoured a fee and dividend model. We have a problem here, however. I refer to part of the admiration Professor FitzGerald has given this committee for the work we have done on the carbon tax. One of our key priority recommendations was to advise the Government to conduct a fuel poverty survey of the country to establish the levels of fuel poverty, not only by looking at who gets fuel allowance but more broadly, and to come back to us then about the carbon tax. The Government never conducted that. I ask Professor FitzGerald to comment on that. Should the Government do so now?</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> It was not the only key recommendation we made on carbon tax. Recommendation No. 4 argued that an inquiry should be conducted into the revenue that could be realised through the introduction of a carbon tax on the profits of corporations directly linked to the production and sale of gas, oil and coal and other fossil fuels. As an economist, does Professor FitzGerald think there could be a model of tax that would disincentivise the fossil fuel corporations, the hedge funds and the investment banks which benefit from all the fossil fuel corporations and their behaviour, and could we use the taxation system to effect necessary change from them? I have one more question presently.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_59">
          <from> Professor John FitzGerald<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_116">There is a significant body of evidence that carbon taxes work. Deputy Boyd Barrett put this issue to me in June at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. I talked to one of the experts on the area and there is research which showed it worked in British Columbia. Deputy Bríd Smith quite correctly states that much is going on simultaneously and one needs fairly sophisticated economic research to separate out the effects. Since 1992, there is a paper a year from the ESRI on this subject. There is a vast literature out there. Professor William Nordhaus, who won the Nobel price for economics last year, is another of these people who have done work on it. This is not just an issue in Ireland, but across the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> If one raises the price, one changes investment behaviour. For example, Volkswagen is not necessarily a nice company. The company is investing heavily in electric cars because it sees the taxation on fossil fuels going up all of the time. The company will go out of business if it does not produce a cheaper alternative. In Ireland, within three years, one will be able to buy electric cars as the cheap alternative. The price changes the decision on investment in a crucial way. If one looks at Dublin's taxis, how many Toyota Prius cars are there? The reason is not necessarily that taxi drivers care more about climate change than the rest of us. It is because it is the cheap solution given the price of fuel. In particular, higher prices discourage one from burning fossil fuels; it is an investment decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> On housing, why do people retrofit their houses? Many of those who have done so to date have probably wanted to do the right thing, but one will not have this level of investment unless by so doing people save money because it is the saving of money that will finance future investment. Going back to Deputy Sherlock, there is a model in The Netherlands, which works there, where they will retrofit one's house for free providing they can make the savings on energy over the subsequent 30 years. I am not sure that model would work well here but it might be worth looking at.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> People make the change because it is the cheap solution. The evidence is universal that this works. It is the investment decision that is important. The reason we want to see a promise to ramp it up over time is so that when the Deputy goes out and buys her next car, even if the petrol car is cheaper, the Deputy will know that over the lifetime of the car she would be better off with an electric car. That is the argument for carbon taxes.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">That is an argument but there is other evidence to show that it does not dramatically decrease emissions. If we look at the dramatic increase in emissions overall over the past few decades, this may be borne out. Carbon tax imposed on ordinary people to change their behaviour is a bad model, particularly in the model in Ireland where we have poor public transport, do not have access to cheap retrofitting and electric cars are expensive. Could Professor FitzGerald comment on the other part of my question?</p>

          <p eId="para_128">Having been there, they do not have a corporate view. Anyway, if one looks at the Dr. Barra Roantree paper, it looks at a range of different options, as does the Dr. Lynch paper, both of which I am familiar with.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> In terms of looking at fuel poverty, the Dr. Roantree paper, the Dr. Lynch paper, the Dr. Sue Scott paper of 1992 and a whole series of papers have looked at this. The Dr. Roantree paper, in particular, shows how one could give back the money in different ways which would leave people on low incomes better off. What the Dr. Roantree paper stated about the use of the fuel allowances is it will make those in receipt of fuel allowances significantly better off but the problem is that there are people who are not in receipt of fuel allowances who will not receive the compensation. Dr. Roantree, if one looks at the model there, recommended a broader change in social welfare. One does not spend all the money but in spending 30% to 50% on compensating, one could ensure that those in the bottom 30% of the income distribution would not be affected. The research is there. It is open to the Oireachtas and, through the Oireachtas, the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">This the problem though. The Government was to give us a piece of research that incorporated everything Professor FitzGerald is talking about to look at fuel poverty and to come back on that before it introduced a carbon tax. We worked hard at it for days trying to come up with a form of words that would put the onus on the Government to examine fuel poverty before the introduction. Professor FitzGerald is advising the Government. Could Professor FitzGerald advise us on what he would say to the Government on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_134">Our remit was ignored, I am afraid.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> I want to come back to the question of the role of the climate advisory council. One of its roles is to provide policy evaluation to Government based on the best available science. My question pertains to the advice that Professor FitzGerald provided to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the future of gas and oil exploration in a letter date 20 September 2019. Professor FitzGerald used what he called "compelling" evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, about the combustion of known reserves of natural gas. That line was used to justify the continued exploration for oil and gas, and especially gas, off our shores. The scientists Professor FitzGerald is supposed to refer to, such as those in Oil Change International, have told us they have seen the letter and that there was particular isolated use of the letter. One of the points Professor FitzGerald stated is that natural gas has been identified internationally as an important transitional fuel. The scientists state that there is a formidable body of evidence to show that they have a diametrically opposed position. The response of oil and gas was to state that the letter that Professor FitzGerald used considering each fossil fuel in isolation <i>vis-à-vis</i> carbon budgets has no reasonable scientific basis. I have every respect for Professor FitzGerald and his job, but his council is made up mainly of economists, not of scientists. Professor FitzGerald's role to use the best science available to advise the Government was not properly used in this case, particularly in relation to gas exploration.</p>

          <from> Professor John FitzGerald<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_136">The note the Deputy mentioned was a piece of evidence we considered. However, we also considered a wide range of other evidence. There are two particular issues. The first is how to get to zero net emissions by 2050. The work done by University College Cork, UCC, suggests that, given known technology, the only way we will get there by 2050 is if we balance a very large amount of wind and solar with gas-fired generation incorporating carbon capture and storage so that there will be no emissions from the use of gas. We need some kind of technology. Technological developments may give rise to alternatives, but not at the moment. Gas will be needed beyond 2050. The UCC study is not unique. Our sister organisation in the United Kingdom, the Committee on Climate Change, which has more resources and is much further advanced than we are, has identified the same issue in the context of how to address the intermittent availability of renewable sources of energy. Said intermittent availability means that we need gas. To meet the 2050 target, we have an urgent task to turn transport around . We are concerned that the target set may not be achievable unless there is a dramatic change in policy on electric cars. The technology is not yet available for electric heavy goods vehicles. However, the move to compressed natural gas will substantially reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide from heavy goods vehicles and will greatly reduce emissions in urban areas which are damaging to health. Gas will be needed. That is the first set of evidence. We have considered evidence from UCC, the UK Committee on Climate Change and work done elsewhere in Europe on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> The second set of evidence relates to a series of papers dating back over a number of years. We did not do a note on this. I authored the 2015 paper and it was published by the ESRI. The paper was commissioned by the Department of Finance a year and a half before Brexit and it related to the implications of the latter for Ireland. The ESRI published a series of papers in November 2015, including one by me on the implications for energy. It is the last of a string of papers by the ESRI over 15 years on the security of the Irish energy system. The concern has been that if the gas disappeared tomorrow, the lights would go off and we would be left to freeze. We doubled the capacity of the gas interconnector between Ireland and Scotland. We then paid for a doubling of the onshore gas pipeline in Scotland to protect ourselves. However, the advent of Brexit raises an issue. If, for example, there was a major interruption in the gas supply in Austria, which would affect all of Europe, under EU law, if there is a shortage of gas, member states must share it. However, the UK leaving the EU will mean that there is a state between us and the EU. I am old enough to remember the Suez crisis when they kept the oil for themselves when there was a shortage and the same applied during the Second World War. If there was an interruption or a shortage of supply in Europe, we could be cut off as a result. That would leave us , which leaves us insecure. Last week, National Grid published a paper voicing concern about the security of supply in Britain because if there was a shortage in the rest of Europe, it could be cut off. Under EU law, it is protected but that will no longer be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> Security of supply is not just an issue for Ireland. How should we deal with that matter? Previously, we doubled the pipeline. While the Corrib Field will remain in operation for the next decade, we have an alternative supply. We might not have it for heating, but would have it for net essential electricity if it was cut off. What do we do when the Corrib runs out? We could have an LNG terminal somewhere and bring in LNG or if we discovered gas, it would be of value in terms of security of supply. It seemed to us that there is little benefit to Ireland in drilling for oil. With gas, there is a potential benefit from the perspective of security of supply. Irrespective of what we do, it will make no difference to Ireland's emissions, which is our primary remit. I have a concern in the context of spending too much time on this issue, which will not affect our emissions. It is a distraction. We are far behind and we need to make big efforts. Devoting considerable time to this issue will make no difference to our emissions. We have answered the question and I have given the committee the evidence on which our decision was based.</p>

          <p eId="para_146">This is my final comment. In the context of this critical issue, scientists claim we must keep fossil fuels in the ground. There is a serious divergence between Professor FitzGerald's advice to Government and what the global scientists scream at us every day.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_147">I will make a comment that is useful to the discussion before asking questions. The environmental movement globally wants to move away from putting all the emphasis on individual responsibility and concentrate on tackling the problem at source. That is why we are fixated and interested in keeping fossil fuels in the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Professor FitzGerald is right in saying there is an issue of security because of what is happening in the UK. In lengthy discussions with people involved in that process in the past three years, I have never heard anyone state that the UK negotiators are considering weakening the energy security arrangements or co-operation in respect of energy. As the professor indicated, the UK is absolutely exposed because its North Sea offshore gas flows are decreasing by 7% or 8% per year. The UK is critically dependent on Norwegian and continental gas connections for its security. That issue can be and I believe will be addressed in whatever Brexit outcome arises. If the UK tries to operate as an isolated system, it will be left with the most incredibly expensive electricity, in particular, which will kill its digital and other industries. The alternative to such investment in gas infrastructure is in electricity interconnection to allow that balancing capability on a big scale. This is big thinking. That would be a much more secure investment because investing in fossil fuel must stop now.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> What Professor FitzGerald said about the budget is true. There is no clarity coming from the Department of Finance. In the area of transport, for example, it is just given as a lump sum for land-use transport. There is no breakdown between public transport and roads. I have asked the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the Parliamentary Budget Office if they could answer that question but they have never been able to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> Let us put aside the existing expenditure. I know that is a bad habit in our budgets. We are always looking at the new. What is new in the budget is that we provided a potential €1.5 billion as a cash payment to businesses in the event of a no-deal Brexit and we gave €90 million to climate action. Would it not have been far better to give €1.5 billion to climate action in a way that would also have protected those sectors most at risk from Brexit to pay farmers to do as Professor FitzGerald suggested and take the corner part of a field to plant native forestry, which a farmer could do. They would be learning forestry by doing that. They could also cut the hedgerows. We could also invest radically in cycling and walking infrastructure or in apprenticeships to allow young people to build up expertise for retrofitting. Was Professor FitzGerald disappointed with the budget in that context? I would characterise it as €1.5 billion going to business as usual versus €90 million to some climate initiative?</p>

          <p eId="para_151">The Deputy is asking about a matter on which I have not briefed myself. There is €800 million to compensate and €365 million for increased social welfare expenditure.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I take that point. It was also slightly unclear. It was as unclear as the other one.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_85">
          <from> Professor John FitzGerald<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_153">This has come up since the council considered it. My personal view is the money for farmers as is the case of all compensation it must be temporary. It is a transitional payment. It is not €800 million a year for the future whereas there is a very substantial ramping up of investment, much of it in housing. However, it makes sense to use the money to help farmers transition out of sectors that are very badly affected, such as beef, into other sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">I would not write off all of that €800 million as being non-climate sensitive. It is temporary. Obviously, I would have liked there to have been more. My concern is that it is difficult to identify in the investment. If one thinks about the investment in housing, it is in local authority housing or social housing where all the houses have a BER of A. It is not like the cost of retrofitting but embedded in that is a significant amount of additional expenditure, which is related to moving the BER from, let us say, C to A. It is very difficult to identify what relates to climate change in the investment programme. Is climate change the reason for much of the investment in public transport? It is good for climate change but it is being done to get people from A to B because of congestion. It is difficult to break down, but it would be a help if the Government did provide a breakdown. It would exaggerate the environmental benefits out of the investment programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">I will be very brief. My second question relates to land use. Professor FitzGerald referred to 40 years of agricultural economics. As he stated, it is really difficult for us to change habits. This committee recommended in its report the merits of a national land use plan, not just in respect of farming but also the restoration of peatlands, and the importance of that in respect to flood management, the protection of the wilderness and the restoration of nature. To my mind, we would move towards a completely different forestry model not just composed of commercial plantations because we face a biodiversity crisis as well as a climate crisis. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc seem to have set themselves stridently against such an overview plan. Has Professor FitzGerald looked at the merits or otherwise of that kind of big-picture or long-term view as to where we might be going in this transition for fear that we would end up with a series of piecemeal and sometimes contradictory measures?</p>

          <p eId="para_159">What the committee suggests sounds very sensible to me. It is a question of what one calls it. The Government would be reluctant for the plan to be construed as something telling people what they are to do rather than saying what would be desirable for us all to do, if we were to put it in those terms. One other thing Deputy Eamon Ryan did not mention is how much land we want to devote to housing in terms of the density of population. It seems that it would be a sensible and useful thing to do. It is how one explains it. As a piece of research, it would be helpful if we could look at what has happened to land use in the past 50 years and where we would like to go in the next 50 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_166"> My first questions are brief and relate to economic matters. Like others, I have been struck by the fact that €90 million is peanuts. Given the many strong cases being made about areas that will need transition support, I have been struck by the difference between the €6 million just transition fund compared to the €650 million envisaged in the case of a no-deal Brexit. I accept that the timing is different. As Professor FitzGerald is aware, there are differences of opinion on the extent to which carbon taxing incentivises us or engages us in behavioural changes. That is not the rationale used in the context of its introduction. The core economic rationale has been environmental externality and the fact that the social and environmental costs of fossil fuels have been borne by society and, in effect, we have subsidised an artificial commodity price over a long period. That is the rationale that was used in terms of initially bringing in the carbon tax. Given that that is the rationale, should it not be the case that every penny of the carbon tax, not the increase, which is attached to an incentive logic, all of the €35 for example, be ring-fenced to deal with those external costs such as mitigation and adaptation? Given that that is the logic, should all of the €35 be clearly designated?</p>

          <p eId="para_172">Building on that and in light of the environmental externality argument, the tax applies to carbon, but does it not also apply in respect of other greenhouse gases that are part of the fuel mix, for example, to methane, which is a large component of shale gas? The costs relating to methane as a greenhouse gas are being carried socially and environmentally by society and that should be reflected in the same way as carbon.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">Its carbon content is one thing. This is a core issue. The UNFCCC has said that 1 tonne of methane is equivalent to 34 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Professor Howarth made a very clear point to the committee last week. It is interesting that the EPA does not measure carbon dioxide in its national emissions inventory, it measures carbon dioxide equivalent. Should we be measuring other greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide equivalent and applying environmental externality?</p>

          <p eId="para_180">The levels do not seem to match. We are adding 75 cent on natural gas at the moment, versus the increase in carbon tax. If that is the case, I accept that. I will come back to Professor FitzGerald.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I was very surprised about the letter the council sent to the Department. I was not just surprised by the content of the letter but its timing. The council is an independent body responsible for reviewing policy. The timing of the letter was very strange, politically, just before a statement, and it did not seem to reflect the council's own review, which is what we are discussing here, the annual review of the Climate Change Advisory Council. In the sections on energy, there were not lengthy opinions on the role of gas and continued gas exploration. That was not something that had been analysed in detail but seemed to be closer to the letter from 2015. It was said the combustion of all known reserves of natural gas globally would not in itself exceed 1.5°C. Obviously, any one measure is not enough but the key concern is that it contributes to the overall level.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> The other issues that were mentioned were carbon capture and storage. The evidence we heard last week is that methane has a quicker rate of absorption, that, in fact, it can narrow the period that we have and that carbon dioxide has a longer lag time in the context of absorption. Are we effectively shortening the window of time by taking this approach? It is not a bridge, rather it shortens the road we are on.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">First of all, the science on methane is different from that relating to CO2. It is currently converted at a particular rate but methane disappears from the atmosphere in ten to 12 years, whereas CO2 is there forever. That makes carbon dioxide the primary focus. The metric treats them as equivalent for the 2030 targets. I refer the committee to the range of caveats in our letter as to how the gas is used.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Deputy Pearse Doherty asked about the issue of timing at a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the Taoiseach and the Minister have also asked about it. There seemed to be a broad political interest in answering that question. In terms of preparation for the meeting, because the council have very scarce resources, I did not get the secretariat to prepare a paper covering all the other evidence but we are aware of other evidence. I dispute the suggestion that everything turns on the briefing note because that was a briefing note on one set of evidence. We made a considered decision on this and there are caveats to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_185">In one of those caveats, Professor FitzGerald mentioned that natural gas is a suitable alternative back-up technology. However, we are now looking at importing LNG and, wherever emissions happen, they affect the global emissions piece. The Professor will know that if that becomes a project of common interest, PCI, it will come with expectations, for example for higher priority access to the grid. If natural gas is given the elevation of becoming a PCI and a level of priority is given to importing LNG and building a terminal, is that compatible with framing natural gas as a back-up? It seems to me that is putting it pretty well centre stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">I thank the committee for inviting me to attend. It is an honour to be able to present some of the key findings from the report. In the interests of time, I will not go through this presentation in detail but I will refer to some of the graphical elements from the summary for policymakers. I will show those on the screen as I go.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The IPCC’s special report on climate change and land was approved by governments in Geneva in August 2019. It is the second of three special reports of the current IPCC assessment cycle, building on the special report on global warming of 1.5°C approved in 2018. The report was prepared under the scientific leadership of all three IPCC working groups including the task force on national greenhouse gas inventories. This came at the request of seven member governments - including Ireland, it is important to note - for a report focusing specifically on land and its interactions with climate change. The report was prepared by 107 experts from 52 countries and was the first IPCC report with a majority of authors, 53%, from developing countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> The following is a summary of some of the key messages. Land is a critical resource upon which we all rely but it is under increasing pressure from humans and climate change. Through sustainable management, land can be an important part of the solution to climate change but land cannot do it all. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors is essential if global warming is to be kept to well below 2°C.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> I will now outline some of the key messages from the summary for policymakers. I should point out that this summary condenses the assessment of seven chapters of the main report and if any member of the committee wants further detail on any sections, I am happy to direct them to the right chapter.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Starting with the current situation, the report assessed key trends in terms of climate change and land use and many of these are summarised in figure SPM1. Humans affect more than 70% of the ice-free land area and a quarter of that land is already in a degraded state. In 2015, approximately 500 million people lived in areas undergoing desertification. That is an increase of 300% since 1961 and therefore one can see that the effects of climate change are exacerbating the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Population growth, changes in consumption of food, feed, fibre, timber and energy have caused unprecedented rates of land and fresh water use in the past 50 years. Since 1961, cereal yields, for example, have increased by 240% globally but so too has the intensity of land use.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Over the same period, there has been an increase of approximately 800% in the rate of nitrogen fertilizer used. There has also been an increase in ruminant livestock numbers globally. Consequently, there has been an increase in both methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture – both of which are potent greenhouse gases. Agriculture, forestry and other types of land use account for 23% of human greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, on the other side of the equation, natural land processes absorb almost one third of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry. The report found that natural carbon sinks and their capacity to continue to store carbon are under threat from climate change and unsustainable land management. It also found that the way we produce food, what we eat, and food loss and food waste all contribute to climate change, the loss of natural ecosystems and declining biodiversity. </p>
          <p eId="para_209"> To move on to some of the risks assessed, the report assessed risks to human and natural systems as a function of increasing global mean surface temperature. This is shown visually in figure SPM.2 in my submission. Current levels of warming are associated with moderate risks for soil erosion, vegetation loss, coastal degradation and tropical crop yield decline. These are the risks we are already experiencing. At around 2°C of global warming, risks from permafrost degradation and food supply instabilities are projected to be very high. It is also important to consider risks as a function of trends in population and consumption. The report also did this by looking at socioeconomic pathways. It found that pathways with higher demand and lower levels of technological development are associated with higher risks of land degradation, food insecurity and desertification. Further details on pathways and how they look in terms of land use change are also provided in the report, but I will not get into that now, although I can do so if the committee would find it useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> The report also considered what can be done, that is, solutions. This is one of the most important parts of the report. It looked at solutions in terms of integrated response options to address climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, tackling desertification and land degradation and improving food security. This is shown visually in the table, figure SPM.3. In the interests of time I will go through this quickly and focus on some of the key messages. The message is positive in that many of the response options are positive across all categories. Positive options are highlighted in blue in the submission. Many are at an advanced technology level and many can be undertaken at a relatively low cost. One message to take away is that there is much we can do right now.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> The report considered the food system as a whole, that is, both demand and supply. Many response options with regard to production could be applied or upscaled in Ireland. These include improved livestock and pasture management, agricultural diversification, agroforestry, increased productivity through sustainable intensification, and increasing soil carbon. Protection of current carbon stocks and restoration of high carbon ecosystems, which are identified as response options in the table, are applicable in respect of Ireland's peatlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> On the demand side, the report found that dietary choices present an important route to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pressures on land. Some dietary choices require more land and water and cause more greenhouse gas emissions than others. Balanced diets, featuring plant-based foods and animal sourced food produced in resilient, sustainable and low greenhouse gas emission systems, present opportunities for adaptation and limiting the effects of climate change with coincident benefits for health. Food loss and waste is also an important issue on the demand side. The report found that between 25% and 30% of total food produced globally is lost or wasted. Reducing food loss and waste presents significant opportunities to improve food security and reduce associated greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> The report also found that some of the response options and their deployment could be a cause of concern. This is specifically related to the deployment of bioenergy and forestry. This needs to be done carefully to avoid negative effects on food security and biodiversity. These measures work best when they are integrated into diverse production systems and located on suitable land. In the interests of time, I will conclude at this point.</p>

          <from> Mr. John Spink<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_214">I thank the committee for the opportunity to present Teagasc’s views on climate change and land use. I apologise for the absence of my colleagues. They would like to have been here but were unable to attend owing to a clash with the policy debate on the agrifood strategy to 2030 in the Aviva Stadium.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> Ireland can grow high yields of a wide range of crop species, including grass. The Teagasc sustainability report shows that mainly tillage farms have much lower CO2 equivalent emissions per hectare than livestock systems. Based on these types of reports, it is often suggested that ruminant-based agriculture should be reduced. While there is scope to increase tillage and horticultural crop production in Ireland, where profitable, these are not particularly land hungry systems and would not displace much land from grassland-based agriculture. It is also worth noting that Irish mineral soils are estimated to contain approximately 1,800 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, which is roughly equal to 30 years of our total national CO2 emissions or 90 years of our agricultural emissions. A huge amount of carbon is stored in our soil. Cultivation of long-term permanent pasture can result in large emissions of CO2 from this stored carbon. It is not a simple matter of converting from pasture-based farming to crop production. Ongoing research is investigating the optimisation of land use for multiple agronomic and environmental benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> A large number of factors need to be considered when considering optimum land use. Not only the impact on greenhouse gas emissions, but the implications for biodiversity, water quality and economics, need to be considered. An example of these conflicts comes to the fore when considering forestry. Commercial conifer plantations offer the greatest economic return for the landowner and the highest levels of carbon sequestration, which is related to the growth rate of the trees, but greater biodiversity might be achieved by leaving the land in unimproved grassland or planting mixed native broadleaved forests.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> As the chief inspector will outline, in addition to large-scale changes in land use, there is significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing farming systems through changing practices. These are identified in the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, which quantifies the potential scale of impact changing a given practice can have and the cost per unit of CO2 equivalent reduction. Two of the practices which can have a relatively quick impact at large scale and reasonable costs are increasing the amount of slurry applied using low emissions slurry spreading, which involves the use of a trailing shoe or hose, and increasing the proportion of nitrogen fertiliser applied as protected urea, which has the additional advantage of reducing ammonia emissions. These and the other measures included in the Teagasc MACC are being promoted by Teagasc advisers as part of a new climate change campaign and are being demonstrated in the new climate change demonstration farm initiative, which we are starting next year. The objective of this promotion is to achieve rapid uptake of these measures. In addition to this enhanced advisory activity, Teagasc has expanded its research programme relating to greenhouse gas emissions. Ongoing research is focused on identifying and validating new actions to reduce emissions or improve carbon sequestration such as reducing ruminant methane emissions, ensuring feedstocks meet sustainability standards for anaerobic digestion and increasing carbon sequestration in soils.</p>

          <from> Mr. Bill Callanan<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_218">I thank the committee for the opportunity to address members and to highlight the ongoing work on climate action in the agrifood sector. The Department welcomes the special report on land published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, on 8 August last. This report confirms that our strategies to reduce emissions from our agrifood sector are on the correct path.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">This is the second in a series of special reports to be produced by the IPCC in the sixth assessment cycle, following last year's release of the special report on global warming of 1.5°C, which adds detailed information on land-related issues, and a third report entitled, The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, which was published on 25 September 2019. This report highlights that the global food system contributes to between 21% and 37% of human generated greenhouse gas emissions, while the land biosphere acts as a sink for 30% of human generated CO2 emissions through vegetation and soil. The problem is that this land sink is vulnerable to climate change impacts, as well as other environmental and human pressures.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Furthermore, the report stressed that food production systems are increasingly vulnerable to climate change. Risks related to food security are greatest in pathways with lower incomes, increased food demand and increased food prices resulting from competition for land, which generates more limited trade and other adaptation challenges. The special report on climate change and land enforces the call for urgent adoption of mitigation and adaptation actions globally, including sustainable land-related strategies. The report demonstrates the impacts, vulnerabilities and risks of further global warming to our societies and natural systems. It also highlights that balanced diets, featuring plant-based foods, such as coarse grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and animal-sourced food which is produced in resilient, sustainable and low greenhouse gas emission systems, present major opportunities for adaptation and mitigation, while generating significant co-benefits for human health. The message that food production is causing major global environmental risks is clear. Sustainable food production should use no additional land, safeguard biodiversity, protect water quality, reduce fertiliser pollutants, produce zero carbon dioxide emissions and cause no further increases in methane and nitrous oxide emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Climate change is impacting food security all over the world, as food systems are already coming under different pressures and it also has adverse effects on associated populations. We have seen this in Ireland as recent weather extremes highlighted our own food system’s vulnerabilities. The IPCC's conclusion poses a major challenge for the sector but it is simultaneously an opportunity for the Irish agrifood sector, as our production system is recognised by international independent analysis as having one of the lowest carbon footprints in the European Union. The Food and Agricultural Organization, FAO, has recognised the efficiency of our temperate grassland-based production systems. Evidence of this is further reflected in the EU Joint Research Centre report of 2010, which illustrates that while intensive dairy systems create less methane and nitrous oxide emissions than extensive ones, this is countered by higher emissions from land use and land use change. This report found that Ireland is the most carbon efficient producer per unit of dairy production in the EU, and is the fifth most carbon efficient producer of beef per kilogram. We are therefore in a good starting place due to our highly efficient farmers, coupled with a well developed research and advisory capacity and global recognition of our Origin Green objectives. However, it is clear that we need to do more to address these significant challenges. That requirement is not only regulatory but is also demanded by the market. The consumer of tomorrow is clearly asking for verifiable sustainability credentials.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> The all-of-Government climate action plan was published this June and set out over 180 actions to meet Ireland’s EU targets for 2030, namely, a 30% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions based on 2005 levels. This plan has set an agricultural sector target to reduce emissions from 20.2 Mt in 2017 to between 17.5 Mt and 19 Mt by 2030, which is a reduction of between 10% and 15%. Furthermore, this plan requires the sector to enhance CO2 removals from the landscape by at least 26.8 Mt CO2 equivalent, while also contributing to the development of sustainable decarbonised energy systems. The combination of both these commitments sets our ambitions in line with the carbon footprint of the sector. This will require full implementation of the actions set out in the Teagasc report, also known as the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, coupled with increased afforestation and the appropriate management of a significant area of farmed peatland. These actions are ambitious and challenging for the sector and require early and extensive adoption of mitigation measures, particularly focusing on nitrogen use efficiency and animal breeding technologies. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will shortly launch a roadmap consultation process on how the sector will transition and achieve its CO2 equivalent reduction targets over the next decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> The IPPC report outlines that an overall focus on sustainability, coupled with early action, offers the best chance of tackling climate change. This underlines the importance of the climate action plan and Ireland’s next agrifood strategy to 2030. As we speak, the Department is conducting a public engagement with more than 400 attendees on developing its next strategy to 2030. Economically viable and sustainable production is at the heart of this process. This strategy will be instrumental in providing a framework for the sustainable growth of the sector. As with all strategic plans, it must evolve and respond to rapidly changing circumstances. In addition, the Department has commenced the process of developing its strategic plan for the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and climate delivery will be a key component of this. However, the CAP and strengthened regulation will not be enough. Industry will need to step up and collaborate to drive innovation and adoption of best practice to ensure the agriculture sector plays its part. We have already commenced this journey with the nitrates derogation review of 2019, which recommended tighter measures aimed at further strengthening the protection of water and attaining optimum soil fertility that are consistent with efficient agricultural production, effective water and air quality and delivery of our climate ambitions. The greater focus on improving nitrogen use efficiencies on intensive farms will provide additional environmental protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> While acknowledging that the agriculture sector produces emissions, the sector should also be seen as part of the solution to our transition to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. Considerable opportunities exist within the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors to address climate change while providing many co-benefits to society. Unlike other sectors, no one-off technological fixes can be applied. Mitigation requires the sustained application of improved management practices by farmers over time. Some land use mitigation responses, such as the conservation of peatlands, wetlands and forestry, have relatively immediate impacts. Others, such as afforestation and restoration of high carbon soils, will take longer to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> As part of a special allocation of €3 million in the recent budget to fund additional pilot projects aimed specifically at climate measures in agriculture, a call for a new pilot European innovation partnership project on reduced management of farmed peatlands will be announced in due course. This is designed to increase carbon sequestration and contribute to meeting our commitments as part of the Government's climate action plan. It will also enhance the protection of biodiversity and water quality and provide a template for action in advance of Ireland's next Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> The latest research from Teagasc identified significant additional abatement potential for the sector. Agriculture can potentially make major contributions to meeting renewable energy targets, although this mitigation effort comes at a cost. If we are to achieve these ambitions for the sector, it is important to continue to incentivise positive action through our afforestation programme and a well funded and appropriately configured Common Agricultural Policy. We have already been doing much with the current Common Agricultural Policy by supporting farmers to deliver environmental dividends through agri-environment schemes. We are operating several schemes to ensure the sustainable use of land, the maintenance of natural resources and the limiting of climate change. We have provided a number of statistics on that which I do not need to repeat.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> Ireland welcomes the proposal that 40% of the CAP budget post 2020 will contribute to climate action. This approach aligns well with the advice of the Citizens’ Assembly, which recommended that farmers be rewarded for good environmental practices. These provisions will enable us to continue on our path towards carbon neutrality by promoting sustainable intensification of food production and maintaining a vibrant rural economy. This will require collaborative action. There are also challenges regarding food waste, as the EU requires us to reduce food waste<i>
						</i>by 50% <i>per capita</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> It is important to remember that Irish agricultural production is recognised by international independent analysis as having one of the lowest carbon footprints. The efficiency of Ireland’s temperate grassland-based production systems is also recognised. We will continue to work at building consensus around the need for the agriculture sector to make a positive contribution to climate action. This is about getting better, not just bigger, and focusing on productivity and efficiencies rather than numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine fully agrees with the finding of the special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, that land is under growing human pressure. Land has a lot to contribute to ensuring the agreement is met but it cannot do everything.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I thank the witness. I will start with Dr. Haughey. He indicated in his presentation that dietary choice has the capacity to help with CO2 emissions. That follows from the IPCC report. Am I right in saying it does not propose a ban on meat consumption, but rather calls for animals to be produced in a less greenhouse gas-intensive manner and for diets to be more inclusive of grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds? Could Dr. Haughey go into more detail on that? The overarching concern here in Ireland is our reliance on the agricultural sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> Turning to the representatives of the Department, I refer to the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP. That will be a huge incentive to help farmers make that transition. Could Mr. Callanan expand on the schemes the Department would like to see? I know some schemes are currently in place. Could Mr. Callanan expand on measures that would be helpful for farmers in making this transition?</p>

          <p eId="para_232">The Chair has raised one of the report's key findings. Interestingly, the authors looked at the food system as a whole, including both the demand and the supply side. Previously a lot of efficiency work took place on the production side, which is very efficient here in Ireland. There was less work on the demand side. The message from the IPCC was very clearly and carefully worded. It suggests moving towards a plant-based diet, but its suggestions include animal products produced with low levels of greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable and resilient systems. The report definitely does not state that one should not eat meat. The IPCC provides advice. It does not tell people or governments what to do. There is certainly a place for meat consumption. However if one was to change one's diet to reduce its carbon footprint, reducing consumption of animal-sourced protein would have the biggest effect. That is what the report found.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> If we continue to consume meat, the best thing we can do is ensure it comes from a system with a low greenhouse gas footprint such as a grassland-based system. Systems with low external inputs tend to be the most efficient. Our grazing system is efficient because the animals are at pasture for most of the year. Inputs from external sources, such as protein, are low in comparison with systems where the feed is grown somewhere else and then brought to the animals indoors. In that regard we are in a good position but there is no doubt that if dietary change is to make a contribution globally, consumption of animal-sourced foods must decrease. This is difficult for Ireland but we are in a good starting position. </p>

          <p eId="para_234">I thank Dr. Haughey. I wish to ask Mr. Callanan about the CAP. What schemes will be needed to bring farmers on board to reach our targets in this transition?</p>

          <from> Mr. Bill Callanan<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_235">I am somewhat limited in what I can say. At the moment the process is at a very consultative stage. The Minister has set up a consultative committee which includes other Departments, various stakeholders etc. to inform the development of our strategic plan. At the same time we are holding several public meetings. I cannot pre-empt what will come from them. The best way I can articulate the evolution that is taking place is to refer to the agri-environment schemes of several years ago, such as the rural environment protection scheme, REPS. That scheme pertained to the whole farm but the actions represented a light touch. The next iteration of the rural development programme included the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which encouraged farmers to take the right actions in a more detailed way. The current iteration of GLAS concerns taking the right actions in the right locations. We are using resources like the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, map of high-status water quality as a selection tool to prioritising entry to the scheme. We then make prescriptions for water quality in those specific areas. All I can say about the process is that CAP expenditure is increasingly targeted and focused. That will naturally evolve in the next round.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Under the most recent iteration of GLAS we have helped to plant more than 1,200 km of new hedges. Some 4,500 farmers have been supported in using low-emission slurry equipment. We have supported 270,000 ha of low-input permanent pasture. This is the type of action that is conducive to the delivery of carbon ambitions. We will have to grow and develop on these gains. About 2,500 farmers have applied for structural funding grants to purchase low-emission equipment. That is also indicative of our support for farmers implementing the actions within the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC. </p>
          <p eId="para_237"> At the same time we have carried out a review of derogation farmers. Those are the more intensive farmers and represent a sector which has grown in size. We went through a public consultation to ask what more they could contribute. One of the measures that has come out of that is earlier use of trailing shoe technology as a mandatory requirement for those farmers. From April 2020 about a third of the slurry in the country will be applied using trailing shoe technology, which is a major advance towards our objectives concerning both ammonia and climate change. </p>

          <p eId="para_242">I invite the witnesses to pick up on the final point made by Mr. Callanan concerning the trailing shoe. That is welcomed and it is the right direction. I will not open old wounds, but we have had the argument about extensions on slurry spreading. From a water quality point of view it is totally contradictory that farmers have to farm by calendar and are forced to have the slurry out by Tuesday on saturated ground when spreading slurry during a dry spell, by trailing shoe or a splash plate, will not cause nearly as much environmental damage. We have to stick adamantly to calendar dates. Let us look at the big picture here. We are trying to use the most environmentally friendly methods. Is it not imperative that we will have some flexibility in the process and procedures to get the best outcome in the interests of the environment?</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> I have a couple of questions about our previous report. That called for the Department to undertake a review of the management and import of nitrogen fertilisers. Has that commenced? What stage has it reached? </p>
          <p eId="para_244"> I also wish to direct a question to Teagasc and the Department. I will not go into specifics but based on all the aforementioned we are all on the same page. What, if any, changes have been made to the curriculum in agricultural colleges with a view to training young farmers for the future, that is, for the necessary changes and diversifications Teagasc has identified? Has there been any change in the curriculum in the agricultural college since this debate commenced? </p>
          <p eId="para_245"> I would also like to know what actions and timelines the Department has set and what incentives it is using to encourage the agricultural fraternity to undertake the 28 measures in Teagasc's mitigation pathway. Is this being discussed? It seems that the agricultural sector as a whole, including both the representative bodies and the Department, has accepted the pathway. What progress has been made in selling that to the farmers to get uptake from them? I may have supplementary questions based on the answers. </p>

          <p eId="para_248">Regarding flexibility, the first fundamental principle is that slurry must be considered a fertiliser. From the agricultural catchments programme, which we have supported and Teagasc has implemented over many years, the evidence is quite clear that the greatest loss of nutrient occurs with the application of slurry over the winter period.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">To put it in context, before the nitrates regulations, and I have been there from the beginning, less than 5% of slurries were spread at that time of the year. We seem to be fixated on that, although it is a relatively modest volume.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> Second, in terms of fertiliser value, a typical four-bay double-sided shed, which every farmer would understand, has about €1,000 worth of fertiliser. The inherent difficulty with applications towards the back end is that one has to ask whether somebody would go out and buy €1,000 worth of fertiliser and spread it on this day of the year, and the answer is generally "No". We have brought up this issue of calendar farming and we discussed it with the Commission at one stage in regard to the question of flexibility. The Commission was quite clear in its direction to us that if one wants to consider flexibility, one has to recognise it cuts both ways, and that could result in the increasing of the closed period instead of decreasing it, if that is what people want. That requires more concrete action. Basically, people have to increase their storage requirement if that is the approach they want to take. </p>
          <p eId="para_251"> I would caution farmers in general. When we explained to them the reality of the closed period and seeking flexibility, and how it is going to increase if the weather conditions are not right, which would mean farmers have to construct additional storage to cover that, it becomes a more focused conversation.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> We structurally changed the system to allow dairy farmers to spread soiled water during winter and to dilute it. However, we still seem to have a problem where farmers are not using as much slurry as they can in the springtime and the summer, which is more ideal than autumn spreading, because, when the growth is not there, they are not getting a return on the fertiliser. The evidence is clear that the spreading of slurry during the winter months leads to higher nutrient loss. I must also confirm that the nitrates regulations are under the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, although we give a lot of assistance. </p>
          <p eId="para_253"> We must also reflect on the fact that our nutrient load has been increasing. Our fertiliser usage in the past three years has been growing and, at the same time, our water quality has been diminishing. We are about 3% down in terms of water quality over the last reporting period and while we do not have data for the most recent couple of years, we do not expect that this trend has been reversed. People have to reflect on that. While I appreciate fully that it is a frustration for farmers, we have to recognise that, within our climate change objectives, we see slurry as a fertiliser best used with the likes of trailing shoe technology and at the most appropriate time of year. </p>

          <p eId="para_254">Nutrient value aside, it was water quality that I was coming at. If, for whatever reason, there is a percentage of farmers who have to put it out and who were forced to put it out before Tuesday, when the ground was saturated, that is not helping water quality. That is the argument I am making.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">The objective of somebody who is spreading slurry at this time of year is that they are managing their tanks, they are not managing their slurry. That is the unfortunate reality. If farmers have to apply at this time of the year to empty their tanks, they are invariably just managing the capacity for the winter ahead, whereas we would see slurry as a particularly important and valuable nutrient. It is recognised by the vast majority of farmers as such and they try to optimise the use of the slurry in terms of their system. That generally requires application in springtime or early summer, and certainly not at this time of year.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">I am not arguing that point. However, as they say, doctors differ and patients die. There will be people who are caught and we are forcing them to put it out on saturated land, which is the reason our water quality is dropping.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">I have tried to answer it as best I can in terms of the challenge. With regard to nitrogen fertiliser, we track our fertiliser usage and that is important in that it is a contributor to our overall emissions from the sector. We want to see optimisation of that. The Teagasc marginal abatement cost, MAC, curve identifies the benefit of things like protected ureas. We have engaged with industry in terms of a movement towards protected ureas into the future, and we see that as important.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> On the uptake of the 28 measures, we see these as key. The Department will be publishing a roadmap in terms of its delivery of actions that we have committed to within the climate change plan. This has been the focal point in regard to the discussions around CAP and how we get the balance right between regulating and incentivising, through measures such as CAP, the delivery of these actions. It certainly is front and centre in terms of the departmental thinking on that issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_259"> By way of example, we have a dairy sustainability initiative where all of the stakeholders get around the table to discuss how the dairy industry can grow and develop but, at the same time, contribute to its environmental objectives. Out of that came a very positive project where the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has put ten advisers on the ground, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is committing ten advisers, and Teagasc is implementing that. At the same time, industry is putting in ten advisers to work with farmers in areas of vulnerability in terms of water quality. We see this as important collaboration between the dairy industry and the two Departments towards the achievement of sustainability, and, naturally, that has benefits in terms of climate as well. We are very interested in that engagement between industry and Government in regard to the delivery of those actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> I will leave the issue of curriculum change to Teagasc. </p>

          <p eId="para_261">On curriculum change in regard to the MAC measures, forestry has been a part of the green cert since September 2018, so that is covering off the forestry side. In terms of the curriculum more generally, we have produced guidelines for all of the Teagasc farms, including the college farms, whereby they must be managed using practices such as protected urea and trailing shoes in regard to climate change, but also broader sustainability in regard to things like hedgerow management. All of our farms, including college farms, will be managed in that way so it will be an inherent part of the curriculum. When students come into the colleges, they will be seeing in practice the things we are recommending.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> A further part of the question concerns what we are doing in terms of promoting the uptake of the MAC or the actions within the MAC. All of the actions within the MAC are being incorporated into our standard advice. All of our dairy specialists and livestock specialists, through in-service training, are being brought up to date with the measures in the MAC and issues such as protected urea. The advice that comes out from next spring on fertiliser use will all be in line with the MAC. In 2020, we will also be setting up a network of climate change demonstration farms around the country so farmers can see first-hand some of these practices actually taking place.</p>

          <p eId="para_270">I will not claim to be an expert on the food waste side of things, but we can get back to the Senator with some material on that. There is Bord Bia's Food Dudes programme, which encourages good practice among kids in respect of food. The Senator raises a very important point about the discussion surrounding agriculture and climate. The European Council conclusions as well as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report recognise the inherent challenge in our having to balance the demands on agriculture with the necessity of food production. The Council conclusions recognise that these are intrinsically linked. So does our national policy, which is an approach to carbon neutrality that does not negatively impact food production. We have a responsibility in this regard, as Senator Daly said. The figure we work off is the requirement to increase investment in agriculture for food by at least 60% by 2050. We must contribute to that environment but must equally contribute to the national ambitions. That is why the balance between reducing our own footprint and committing to carbon removal through sequestration, be it afforestation or management of peatlands, etc., is critical. This is the reason for the €3 million that has been assigned to the Department to carry out pilot projects in respect of carbon removal, which will include at its forefront peatland management measures. These projects are critical to striking the balance between food and carbon removal and delivering on both objectives.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">I thank all the witnesses for their contributions. I have a question about the IPCC and the awful scenes we saw of the forest fires in the Amazon and the horrendous damage being done there. That can be contrasted with the significant efforts we are now making here to tackle climate change. I think there has been broad acceptance in recent years that the climate is changing. We had a very big problem previously with climate deniers. How do the witnesses perceive a global effort being made? Is it possible? As I said, contrasting our little country of 6 million people with what is happening in the Amazon, people rightfully ask, no matter what we do, whether it will make a difference. While we know we need to make an effort, it is very challenging to get that message out to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> Has the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine made any progress on an anaerobic digestion strategy? We hear that it is the way to go and will be a good solution for farmers - some anyway - yet we have heard some negative feedback from certain areas. Will the Department brief us on any progress that might be made on this? Has the Department made any progress on a response to the IPCC special report on climate change and land?</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Has Teagasc carried out any research on the use of rewetted peatlands? We mentioned paludiculture, which - the Teagasc representatives do not need me to tell them this - is the productive use of wetlands in the growing of plants of one sort or another, particularly for biomass. Do they have anything to say on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> My other question for Teagasc concerns the tree planting targets. I think I read somewhere that we will have to plant 250 million trees. If we are to try to achieve that, how will we convince members of the farming community, who take pride in their land, especially if they have very good land, arable land, to plant trees? That is an awful lot of trees across our small landmass, bearing in mind that 20% of it is peatland.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">I will start with the question about anaerobic digestion, AD. As far as progress on it is concerned, we have committed to supporting the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on AD because that Department is the main driver on it. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine sees it as inherently valuable to the overall contribution. We must recognise where it might fit in, which would be particularly around biomethane because the transport fuel alternatives are quite limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> Let us be honest. There are political decisions to be made as to how to manage the cost differential. I discussed this recently with Gas Networks Ireland, representatives of which were before the Joint Committee on Climate Action and Environment yesterday. I spoke to Denis O'Sullivan quite recently about this and met Ervia to discuss it as well. Somebody will have to resolve the issue of pricing and how this is supported. The current gas price is approximately 2.5 cent per kilowatt hour, whereas biogas is 8.5 cent and biomethane is approximately 11 cent. That is quite a substantial differential that has to be filled. How that is done is a matter for another Department, but this Department sees that there are viable uses of animal manures and for a certain amount of grass into that system. From our perspective, however, we must resolve the issue of compliance with the sustainability criteria. Then one must get good yields with very little nitrogen input. These are just the rule requirements. I think Teagasc has commenced a project on how this can be achieved. It has also set up a small biogas plant in Grange to investigate this. That is the position in respect of AD. We see it as valuable but it is very costly, and that must be resolved in advance of any major progression of it.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_157">
          <from> Dr. Eamon Haughey<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_280">Sure. There are a few points to be made. I will roll back a wee bit to the 1.5°C report that came out last year. It set the scene for the urgency required and the transformation we need of global energy and land systems. To put this in context, the report considered what the land sector could contribute globally. As for limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, we need an increase in forestation of 3.4 million sq. km. That is more than the size of India. That gives just an idea of the transformative action we need by 2050 to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. That is just to put it in context with forestry. It is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> What we have seen in the Amazon is very shocking and sad and is obviously undoing much of the good work being done globally. It also highlights one of the dangers associated with both increased levels of warming and the limitations of natural solutions. As the temperature increases, this assessment shows that risk of wildfires, for example, will increase. If we go to 2°C above pre-industrial levels, the risk will increase. If we go to 3°C, it will increase even more. Those carbon stores in forests will then be more vulnerable. The other side of it is management. One can store carbon in forests, but that is potentially vulnerable to future mismanagement, so there is always that risk that the good work can be undone.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> Bringing it back to Ireland, there is another question over the level of afforestation. I will not go into that as it is not my area, but it is worth noting that we have a massive amount of carbon stored in our peatlands. In a way, they are our equivalent of the Amazon rainforests. That is a crude comparison but it is one that can be made. How we manage this is something we can act on now in the context of conservation and possibly restoration of some of those lands.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">Regarding the engagement with the IPCC special report, it is important to recognise that Ireland was pivotal to having the report done. It is one of three special reports that has been done by the IPCC in its sixth assessment cycle. Ireland had a key role in suggesting that it be done, and it was agreed by the IPCC bureau in that regard. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine engages and collaborates very strongly with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in how we engage with the IPCC and the UNFCCC and the international meetings on climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">We are happy to continue on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Some of Dr. Haughey's work would be key to informing some of the gaps and opportunities that exist for Irish research to try to engage and address what sort of enhancements and better understanding we need to do around soil carbon pools, the fluxes that are around that in the changing climate, and how we work to develop better farm practice in terms of trying to protect those soil carbon pools. There is a coherent piece working between the EPA and ourselves and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in this space. We will be maintaining this as time goes on to ensure this is well represented.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> We are looking forward to having this special report on agriculture and climate discussed at COP 25 in Chile later this year. That is one of the important things we would see. It is also important in the UNFCCC that there is an agenda item on issues relating to agriculture. That will be concluding in COP 26 in the UK next year. This is a work in progress and a number of the workshops that have been going on over the past two years in this space are primarily on some of the actions that are being recommended here around neutral management planning, better afforestation, and line management practice. All the same issues are coming back but the question is how to get greater and quicker uptake of these actions than we have been seeing to date. There is a big piece as to how we engage on the behavioural aspect.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">On anaerobic digestion, AD, Mr. Callanan mentioned that we were starting some work. For biogas or electricity from AD to be classed as a renewable fuel, it has to meet certain sustainability criteria. One of those is a 70% reduction in energy costs compared with the alternative. That is work we are starting now, looking at how we can sustainably produce effectively from grassland feedstocks that will meet the sustainability criteria. If we do not meet them, it is not really worth investing in AD in the first place. In terms of the rewetted peatlands and paludiculture, I am not aware of any research we are doing in that area currently.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I am not aware that we are but that is not to say that I do not have a colleague somewhere who is working on it. The Deputy mentioned the tree planting targets. The Department funds my colleagues in the forestry department in Teagasc in terms of a forestry promotion campaign, and they are very actively involved in providing technical information to the industry in respect of forestry. Mr. Coggins might be better placed to discuss that.</p>

          <from> Mr. Karl Coggins<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_290">On the number of trees planted in the forestry programme, since 1 January 2015, we have planted about 42 million individual trees, and so far in 2019, we have planted about 8 million, so 250 million trees is a really achievable target. In terms of encouraging landowners and farmers in particular to plant, the Department has been especially active in the area of promotion. That includes funding Teagasc to develop a curriculum for the green certificate that was mentioned earlier. We also funded 15 individual promotion projects throughout the country, increasing awareness among the public of the multifunctional benefits of forestry as well as encouraging afforestation among farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> In terms of a strategy, the Department very much encourages the farm forestry approach where it is not so much about forestry or farming but rather about forestry and farming working together. We can see from the national farm survey that a significant number of farms could plant some land with trees while maintaining herd number. That would create a valuable asset both economically and environmentally by planting trees. Under the current forestry programme, we will continue to offer generous grants that cover 100% of the establishment costs of afforestation as well as the premium payments that we pay each year for 15 years up to €680 per hectare.</p>

          <p eId="para_292">On slurry spreading, I heard what Mr. Callanan said about it being calendar based as opposed to based on weather conditions. There is a point in what he is saying which is understood. The problem arises when we have a wet autumn like this one and cattle are moved off the land a lot earlier. This year there is late grass but ground conditions are getting very bad. We could have a different type of autumn where it is colder with less grass but is still very wet. The cattle are going in early. We have seen it happen over the Christmas period or the period directly after Christmas that there is a dry spell and then, lo and behold, come the middle of January when it is time to go and spread, there are downpours again. That is the problem. It is not an easy one. Mr. Callanan referred to capacity, and I understand that, but it is very hard in terms of management for some farmers to work that. If cattle are brought in quickly and they are standing on slatted units, if they are there earlier than expected, we get to January, the date comes for spreading and better days may have passed in the week or two previous to that. I just want to raise that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I would also like the Department officials to deal with the issue of the derogation on pig slurry. My recollection is that we sought an extension of the derogation on spreading pig slurry about a year ago. I am open to correction on all of this. Where stands that? The number of units in the country has dropped but the units have got bigger. There is a particular problem with how we manage the slurry from those units. The IFA and others were worried about it a year or two ago and there was a derogation sought at that point. How can that be moved to a more sustainable basis?</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> My other question for the Department is about forestry. I am pleased to hear Mr. Coggins talk about farming and forestry. That has been a big bone of contention. I represent Laois-Offaly. In the Slieve Blooms there has been concern about forestry replacing farming. There is a particular problem in Leitrim, as I know from my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny. Driving around Leitrim, we can see it happening, particularly with the widespread monocultural plantations of spruce.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> In the context of the coming Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reforms and the new CAP programme, is the Department developing proposals around having sustainable hedgerows such that farmers are rewarded for maintaining bulky, high hedgerows? They are one of the great sources of habitat and are very important for drainage and shelter. The people who planted them understood this hundreds of years ago but somewhere along the line the human race got so clever that we decided that what those people thought did not matter and we should just get the hedgerows out of the way. Teagasc advisers at one stage - I am not particularly having a go at Mr. Spink here - were saying to people to push them out of the way, and we closed up drains and moved those natural barriers out of the way. We took away habitats. Now we have to use more chemicals to spray the crops because there are no habitats to keep the little fellows happy, to keep the insects that are attacking crops under control. Is there a move in the Department to come up with specific proposals regarding sustainable hedgerows? I know there is a programme for planting more hedgerows, which is good.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> I want to bring this to the officials' attention because I say this to the county councils the whole time. The county councils are allowing widespread destruction of hedgerows. In the conditions of planning permission for building a house, I cannot see why we do not require people to maintain the hedgerow in front of their house. Many people like showing off, so they want to bulldoze the hedgerows, or ditches as we call them down our way, out of the way and put up a bloody wooden palisade fence so everybody can see their house. We should be doing more to try to protect the hedgerows.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> I will move on to Teagasc.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Some would say that the ship has sailed on beet production. I am not a soil expert but the witnesses are. Sugar beet was grown extensively in my part of the world. When sugar beet was being grown, whatever crop was sowed on the same land after sugar beet there was a great yield the following year. Sugar beet was a great rotation crop and it provided ground cover for six months of the year. I have often seen beet harvested right up to Christmas so the fields were covered for six months and, therefore, the crop has great potential for sequestration. Beet Ireland is a group that tried to regenerate interest in beet production but it has postponed such plans. Has research into beet production ceased? Has beet production been completely forgotten about? I firmly believe that soil quality and the environment are poorer without beet production. Also, farmers are poorer because beet production generated a handy cash crop, particularly after Christmas when there was not much else. Beet tops were also fed to cattle. We did not need as many slatted sheds because one could allow cattle and sheep to graze on the beet tops that remained after beet was harvested. </p>
          <p eId="para_299"> I have read reports that this country imports 90% of its vegetables. I know we cannot grow avocados. I would love if we could grow avocados, grapes and a whole lot of other varieties but we can grow a lot of vegetables. I have not got a sense from mainstream farming and the farming bodies that there is a great desire or shift in mindset. The carbon miles on what we eat in this country are unnecessary. Some people in vegetable production have said that we can grow 75% of our imports of fruit and vegetables. I ask the delegation to deal with that issue also.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> I have one last question for Teagasc. Mr. Spink said in his statement that "commercial conifer plantations offer the greatest economic return for the landowner and the highest levels of carbon sequestration, which is related to the growth rate". He means that conifers grow very quickly so there is carbon sequestration. I contend that the practice clears the forest floor, kills all known germs and everything underneath, including animals, plant life and everything else. The practice also causes pollution in terms of water quality. Should we not move from monoculture conifer plantations to more sustainable forestry and put a premium on varieties that carry over from one generation to the next?</p>

          <p eId="para_305">Teagasc has organised a hedgerow week that will be launched next Monday at the Teagasc college in Kildalton. The Deputy's question concerned carbon sequestration. I am not aware at the minute that we have a way to quantify how much carbon is sequestered by hedges but I am talking to my Teagasc colleagues in the environment research unit at Johnstown Castle about starting to do some work on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> The next issue was sugar beet. We do not currently do any research on sugar beet. We did a small amount of work when Beet Ireland developed its plans. Part of our work was on how much the yield potential of new beet varieties had increased since sugar beet was last grown here. The work was part-funded by the Irish Farmers Association. Our work showed that there had been an increase in the yield potential of beet since the industry closed. At present we do not have a programme because there is no market. As far as I am aware, Beet Ireland has shelved its plans. However, we recognise the value of beet production in crop rotation and the value of break crops in crop rotation. For the last few years, we have conducted a large programme on break crops and analysed the benefit of beans and oilseed rape in animal feed. Initially, the research was funded by the IFA and we have recruited a permanent researcher to work in that area. We recognise the value of crop rotation and how non-cereal crops greatly benefit cereal crops. </p>
          <p eId="para_307"> The Deputy made a point about horticulture and he is right. As I have mentioned, there is scope to significantly increase our horticultural production. It is not a particularly land hungry enterprise and, therefore, it will not replace the thousands of acres of grassland currently used for livestock production. There is potential to significantly increase our production if it is found to be economically viable to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> There was another issue and it is not an area in which I am expert. The Deputy mentioned avocados. Members of the public are no longer used to eating seasonal vegetables. People want to eat avocados on Christmas Day as well as in the middle of the summer. Our domestic production is seasonal so we will not necessarily be able to replace everything that we import.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> The Deputy made a final point about forestry, which I might start to reply to but my colleague, Mr. Coggins, might finish answering. The Deputy made a few points about conifers and their impact on water quality. At present we are harvesting forests that were planted between 25 and 30 years ago. The rules and regulations for forestry have dramatically changed in the intervening period. One now needs 30% of broadleaves when establishing a new forest and there are setbacks from rivers, houses and things. One might have forests there now that are planted right up to the edge of a stream and are being harvested, which is causing pollution problems. That is no longer the case and Mr. Coggins might have more detail on the matter. </p>

          <p eId="para_310">When people consider mature forests they do not look great from a biodiversity point of view. The forests that are being planted now are completely different. We have learned an awful lot about designing forests. To be eligible for grants and premiums, under the afforestation scheme, one must plant 15% broadleaves. There are certain setbacks from watercourses that have been set down in an environmental requirements document that was launched a number of years ago. If areas for planting have rich habitats then the Department will pay for the areas to be retained as areas of biodiversity enhancement. The highest grants and premiums that the Department pays are for the retention of broadleaf plantations and in the recent mid-term review we increased those rates. Mr. Spink mentioned that the target for broadleaf planting is 30%. The percentage was in the region of 19% at the beginning of the forestry programme and we hit 27% last year and the higher rates that we introduced contributed to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> Earlier Mr. Callanan mentioned the dairy sustainability initiative. The planting of native woodlands and riparian zones are a solution that is offered to protect sensitive waterways as part of those measures. </p>

          <p eId="para_312">In terms of slurry spreading, I have articulated the challenge as best as I could but I will make an additional comment. The Commission has been very clear that if we continue to give derogations and flexibility in terms of the closed period it will think that we have a problem with storage capacity. People must recognise that. Deputy Stanley's constituency has 16 weeks storage but all adjoining countries have substantially higher storage capacity. A challenge for is the balance of being honest with farmers by saying, yes, it might suit a small number to be flexible on the practice but it will come at a cost to a vast majority of farmers if we continually move towards granting that. I appreciate what was said about the January window. Often people say that the weather was great and it is dry, the ground is frosty and they could have gone out. There are two conditions if one wants to treat slurry as a fertiliser. Yes, one must have ground conditions that suit the application of slurry. Equally, one must have growth conditions that suit its uptake. Certainly one does not get the growth in January to take up the nutrient if it is applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">That is not in keeping with what is clearly set down in the overall policy, which is slurry as a fertiliser-nutrient, not a waste, and to apply it at best timing. Those are the messages we are giving farmers. </p>
          <p eId="para_314"> On the derogation for pig farmers, the nitrates directive introduced in 2006 provided that the land area requirements for the spreading of the slurries that were already there would have to be quadrupled because people were spreading at a higher level than crop uptake was allowing for. While it was not exactly a derogation, a concession was granted for pig slurry which diluted the phosphorus content. A doubling of the spread lands required was allowed for. We negotiated around 2008 or 2010 a ten-year glide path to full compliance with nutrient loading. That period has now elapsed. The pig sector is now complying fully with the requirement that the application of nutrients in slurries be absolutely appropriate to the crop need that it is being applied to. That issue has been largely dealt with in regard to compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> On the sugar beet industry, I agree that sugar beet was a very valuable break crop but particular challenges arose with it, especially with regard to the price of sugar. The same situation arises at the moment. The programme for Government includes a commitment by State agencies to look at viable submissions on the re-emergence of a sugar beet industry. As Mr. Spink has said, no such proposal has come forward. One can see the logic in that as sugar prices are poor and the application of sugar taxes has reduced demand for sugar. While yields here had improved, they would not be equivalent to the yields that can be achieved in continental sugar beet production or sugar cane production. From our perspective, we have not had a viable proposal put before us on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> On horticulture, the Deputy is entirely correct, we are not best suited to certain agricultural production, for example, avocados, pineapples and bananas. However, there is a significant amount of field vegetables that could be displaced. We have a well funded €6 million annual investment in the horticultural industry. We also have the producer organisation, PO, which aggregates multiple producers to give them clout when dealing with supermarket purchasers. We have a very strong history in that regard on the mushroom side where we have had a strong PO for some years. We have constructively engaged with industry, through the horticultural industry forum, to try to encourage greater use of producer organisations which, as in the case of beef, bring growers together. We are comfortable that this engagement is having some success. People are willing to engage with the process because they can draw down additional support at EU level through producer organisations. This can be used for marketing, professionalising supply and achieving the scale that is necessary to deal with the supermarkets on an equal rather than a small supplier footing.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">Deputy Stanley has touched on some of the issues I will raise. I will group my questions and then ask one follow-up question on a different issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> Perhaps Dr. Haughey will respond on the nitrates issue as we have heard mainly from the Department. In the IPCC report, one of the most significant changes in land use in the past 50 years has been the 800% increase in the use of nitrates. I understand the graph had to be amended to show this. I ask Dr. Haughey to explain how urgent it is to address that issue at global level. This is a huge outlier and one of the major interventions. The increase in the use of nitrates has been more than four times higher than increases or changes in any other single area. I will not ask Mr Callanan to outline again the various ameliorating measures. Is there a timeline or pathway for Ireland moving away from seeking a derogation from aspects of the nitrates regulation? We are negotiating derogations from various measures. Mr. Callanan mentioned that we had a ten-year derogation in the area of pig slurry which has expired. In general, what is the timeline for moving away from our position of seeking derogations from the nitrates directive?</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> Peatlands have been identified as one of the core means by which we can store carbon. I will not delve into the regressive step of de-designating natural heritage areas, which is being debated in the Seanad. Are there plans to restore some of the peatlands that are not in natural heritage areas and that have been drained for agricultural or forestry use? If so, what is the scale of such restoration to the peatland and carbon sequestration function? Rewetting might also be an issue for Teagasc to address, including the question of how rewetting projects can be accelerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> Another issue that has been brought to my attention, which was touched on in relation to forestry, is the link between the ecological and climate functions. How do we link those functions? I would like to see more of this in the IPCC report. We have heard, for example, that beekeeping could have an increased role in rewetting. Section B4.3 of the IPCC report refers to the importance of natural vegetation restoration, in which pollinators, of course, have a key role. How do the national pollinator plan and pollination feature in the plans we are hearing about regarding land use? Pollination is crucial in the restoration of natural vegetation and in ecosystems and forests but is also crucial in horticulture, which has been mentioned. On a global and national level how are we prioritising actions around the pollinator pathway and their intersection?</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> Deputy Stanley mentioned very eloquently the quality of hedgerows, not simply awareness of them. Hedgerows are key pollinator pathways across the Irish landscape. They are very important in that function.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> I thought 12 km is a small amount-----</p>

          <p eId="para_328">My apologies for my mistake. Under the Heritage Act, where persons cut hedgerows for road safety reasons, they no longer have to report doing so to a local authority. Has that affected the accuracy with which we can measure hedgerows? Is it anticipated that, under CAP, the measurement of the carbon sequestration role of hedgerows will be done alongside their habitat role? Will we have a suite of measures under which farmers in GLAS or its next iteration will report? How detailed will the description of the quality of hedgerows be in that process?</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> On horticultural issues and food waste, are there measures around matters like heirloom diversity? That is a question for Dr. Haughey. </p>
          <p eId="para_330">Are there tensions between fodder and food when decisions are being made in respect of land use? Land is used on a global level for ruminants, for fodder and for food.</p>

          <p eId="para_331">I know Dr. Haughey cannot deal with all of the issues. I ask him to address as many of them as he can from his own perspective.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_178">
          <from> Dr. Eamon Haughey<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_332">The use of nitrogen has increased by approximately 800% since 1961. There are a few reasons for this massive global increase. The use of nitrogen began from a very low base, particularly in the developing world. It has increased most dramatically in Asia over the period. It is clear that there are issues with water quality. We talk a lot about sustainable intensification. This report sets out some statements on limits to intensification when it becomes unsustainable. When water quality is reduced and it is obvious that there are inefficiencies in the system, I would say the use of that fertiliser is no longer sustainable. A related finding is that there has been an increase in nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture globally over the same period. That is linked to the increase in ruminant agriculture and fertiliser inputs. There are several things that can be done here in Ireland. Teagasc is doing a great deal of work on the need for an uptake in the use of clovers in grassland swards. It is an active research area. Clover can reduce the amount of nitrogen that is needed because it fixes it naturally from the atmosphere. It is a win-win. The protein content of clover is higher than that of grass, which makes it another win. The protein sufficiency of farms can be increased in this way. I mention that in response to the point that was made about the land area required for feed.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> I will explain why biodiversity was not covered in the special report on land. Part of the reason is that another report from the UN - the IPBES report on biodiversity - was published earlier this year. Biodiversity was not dealt with as a main issue in the special report, which focused on climate. The Government did not ask for biodiversity to be a main chapter in the special report. One of the outcomes of the special report is the recommendation that we need to act by using integrated response options which consider many challenges at once. It is not necessarily the best idea to focus solely on targeting mitigation, for example. Some of the high nature value grasslands we have in Ireland, particularly in the north and the west, where there are less productive soils, might not be the best place to put forestry because that would have a really negative impact on biodiversity. Regional specificity is certainly an important part of that kind of thing as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> My final point relates to food waste and horticulture. Agricultural diversification is identified in this report as one of the response options. I am looking at a table that is referred to as figure SPM.3. Agricultural diversification is positive across mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security. Ireland has one of the lowest rates of vegetable and horticultural production in Europe. If we could improve that, it would be beneficial for farmers' incomes. Having a more diverse income stream can buffer against the food price shocks we associate with dips in the price of milk or beef. It could be of benefit to have another income stream. Potentially, there is a lot that could be done with regard to diversification.</p>

          <from> Mr. Karl Coggins<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_335">I will speak about the link between biodiversity and climate and the pollinator plan. The Department supports the planting of native woodlands through its afforestation scheme. I will refer to the number of trees as a metric. At the beginning of the forestry programme, we planted approximately 350,000 native trees. In 2018, that increased to just over 1 million native trees. So far this year, we are on target to exceed last year's target in terms of native woodlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> On the pollinator plan, I remind the committee that native woodlands create very valuable habitats for pollinators. On World Bee Day earlier this year, the Department wrote to the owners of native woodlands to invite them to contact the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations and the Irish Beekeepers Association with a view to establishing hives in those woodlands, which we helped them to establish. The Department has done many things to help to increase native woodland cover. The increase in rates in the mid-term review was mentioned earlier. The Department recently announced the name of the first business that will contribute to the establishment of native woodlands under the Department's new woodland environmental fund. We believe this fund offers real potential to incentivise even further the planting of native woodlands.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_180">
          <from> Mr. Bill Callanan<recordedTime time="2019-10-16T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_337">The Department financially supports the pollinator plan and promotes it in its publications, etc. Some positive pollinator actions that farmers can take are set out in a couple of interesting booklets. They are supported by the actions taken in schemes like the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme. Things like bee habitats and wild bird cover are tremendously positive for the likes of pollinators. This is what we mean by co-benefits. Our campus in Backweston was managed in a pollinator-friendly way this year. Large areas of the campus were not cut. We are very keen to support pollinators. We introduced bees to the roof of Agriculture House earlier this year. A number of locations in central Dublin are now used for beekeeping.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> Reference has been made to grant aid schemes. Under the horticulture aid scheme, support is given to the Irish Beekeepers Association for physical infrastructure. We also provide a service with regard to diseases in bees, etc. This is being implemented through the Backweston campus as a further service to the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> We were also asked about derogations, etc. The demand for flexibility during the closed period is an issue that we have discussed. Dr. Haughey has articulated the reasons we are so keen to proceed in this regard. The most attractive way to reduce the use of nitrogen fertiliser is to use slurries in a better way. That is driving our thinking. I would be wrong to suggest that we are lax in our implementation of the nitrates directive. There is a role for housing in this regard. The whole-territory approach taken in Ireland is not common everywhere. Ireland is one of just seven or eight countries that include phosphorous, as well as nitrogen, in the implementation of the nitrates directive. The impact of phosphorous on water quality is as big as that of nitrogen. Overall, we are taking a strong approach to the implementation of the directive. We avail of a derogation by allowing some more intensive farming to take place. That comes at an additional cost to the farmers in question, who are required to take additional measures. There is a <i>quid pro quo</i> in this case. Generally speaking, pasture land does not tend to be a leaky as other types of farming land. This has an impact on the risks associated with it. We must comply with certain conditions that apply when a derogation is being applied for. We take a strong approach in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> On the quality of hedges, I should point out that hedge cutting is not controlled by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. As I have pointed out previously, the issue is the timing of hedge cutting rather than its impact on the carbon content. There is ongoing work in this area. I have cautioned people in this respect on a few occasions. Hedgerows are a big sink in terms of carbon emissions and sequestered carbon. They account for approximately 6% of the landscape. We see them as important. The only thing that is of value, in terms of credit, is the additionality. Work is ongoing with regard to the change of management and understanding the carbon content. Rather than using hedgerows as a get-out-of-jail card by saying we have a significant number of them, we need to focus on the extent to which additional planting is different from what was being done in 2005. No additional credit arises unless the area covered by hedgerows is bigger than the area covered by hedgerows in the baseline year.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">My problem is that we do not know as much about hedgerow coverage as we used to because hedge cutting for road safety purposes is no longer reported to local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> Biogas has been specifically mentioned. I see a potential tension in the future. When methane was discussed last week, we heard that it acts faster. There are concerns that methane, in particular, may need some capping over the next ten years or so as we seek to avoid tipping points.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Biogas is potentially one use of it. It is at least recycling or reusing methane, including methane that may be imported fracked gas. I am not looking at Ireland's overall greenhouse gas emissions but the specific issue of methane. Is there tension about where the acceleration is prioritised? Is the production of methane in farming the area that needs to be transitioned? That is a longer term transition that needs to be engaged in. Is the period for action on methane in the farming sector narrowed if a new methane-intensive import is also brought into the mix by increasing LNG or shale gas imports?</p>

          <p eId="para_345">The Department has just funded a new research project with one of my colleagues in Teagasc. It is focused on reducing methane production from ruminants and looking at various elements to include in the diet. That would drive down the total volume of methane produced in the first place. A decision was taken that, rather than being a CHP plant, the anaerobic digestion plant being established in Grange would be targeted towards biomethane production.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">I am happy to follow up on it. The question of rewetting peatlands was not answered.

          <p eId="para_348">We have identified that our climate commitment and the achievement of reducing emissions while also maximising sequestration, with our contribution to the whole-of-Government plan being 26.8 megatonnes, requires afforestation to deliver 20 megatonnes. The remainder will come from better management of peatlands. We estimate that approximately 40,000 ha are required out of the 300,000 to 400,000 ha of managed peatlands in the country. We have commenced a project that would be ideal in the next CAP. A €3 million fund was committed in the recent budget to support climate projects. We will implement a programme to prepare for a project under the European innovation programme, in which we have quite a number of different projects supported in a results-driven process. I cannot give the quantum but it will be a significant area of peatlands in which we will implement those measures, which we would see as contributing to carbon sequestration, learning from that, understanding how to measure them and where they are located, etc., and building our knowledge for greater ambition in the next CAP.</p>
