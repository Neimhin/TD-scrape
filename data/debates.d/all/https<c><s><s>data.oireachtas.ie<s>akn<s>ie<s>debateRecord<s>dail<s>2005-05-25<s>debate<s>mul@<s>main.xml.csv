#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I apologise to the Taoiseach. In the last number of weeks I have had the opportunity to attend public meetings in Dublin dealing with antisocial behaviour. At a dozen or so of those meetings it was obvious that there is serious concern among members of the public at the rate of increase in the figures for assaults and so on. Deputy Richard Bruton has released information given to him arising from parliamentary questions which shows that the total number of headline offences in Dublin has increased by 8,700, up 23% since 2000. Serious assaults have almost trebled, up 166% from 12 per week in 2000 to 33 per week at present. On top of that some 40 minor assaults per week are recorded.Detection rates have fallen sharply. They were down seven points to 32% in 2004 and these lower detection rates mean that 4,200 fewer serious crimes are now being solved. It is perfectly obvious from the figures given to Deputy Bruton that Blanchardstown, Tallaght and Coolock are the areas where most of these crimes are taking place. It is having a serious impact on the quality of life of citizens in Dublin. The growth of crime in these areas alone accounts for 50% of total crime incidence in Dublin. Of equal concern is the fact that detection rates are plummeting. They are now four fifths of what they were four yeas ago. In seven Garda districts the decline in the detection rates is down ten points or more. In one case it is down by 17%. Two Garda districts, Bray and Terenure, now have detection rates of less than one in five for very serious offences.We have had much bombast, words, waffle and gung-ho from the absent Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform concerning how these matters are being dealt with while asserting that criminality, gangland warfare and the rest of it is the sting of a dying wasp. The figures given to Deputy Bruton and released from his Department show that to be a complete and utter contradiction. I want to know what the Government is going to do about this and what plans are afoot to provide the resources for a restructuring of Garda manpower to deal with these incidents. The figures speak for themselves and we are not being given the truth by the Government in dealing with this very serious matter.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I will come back to that. More importantly, the Deputy has asked what the Government has been doing in this area. We have put additional resources and numbers into the Garda, particularly into some of the areas mentioned such as Blanchardstown, where there has been a particularly difficult crime situation over the last few years. The Garda Síochána, using all its specialist resources, has gone into those areas, set up roadblocks and armed patrols and done house to house searches. It has gone in to break some of the crime gangs in those areas and has had considerable success in the detection and prosecution of criminals and in terms of the numbers of guns recovered and drug seizures. Separate units have been set up to deal with gangland killings. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, both this year and last, has provided an enormous increase in Garda overtime in these areas.

The number of headline crimes recorded in 2004 compared to 2003 has decreased by 4%, and by 14% overall. These are the figures from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The 2004 figures show that despite more precise and more accurate recording of crime by the PULSE system which now includes all statistics, that crime has fallen from about 28.4 incidents per 100,000 of the population some years ago, to 24 per 100,000. It is still too high, but the Garda, in terms of its resources, overtime, manpower and special units, including Operation Anvil, which was launched last week, is doing a good job in these areas. It is not true that they are totally lawless areas.

The source of this information is not some pie in the sky. Rather, it is the reply to a parliamentary question given on Tuesday, 10 May 2005. These are the official statistics from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as given to Deputy Bruton. For the Taoiseach's information, headline assaults recorded in 2000 and 2004, respectively, are as follows: Blanchardstown — 30 in 2000 and 146 in 2004, an increase of 386%; Bray — 15 in 2000 and 70 in 2004, an increase of 366%. These are true and factual statistics. The recorded headline offences rose from 1,821 to 3,554, an increase of 95%. Coolock is up 66% and Tallaght 64%. These are the official statistics from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The detection rates have fallen. In Donnybrook it is down by 17%, in Santry by 14%, Lucan by 13%, Blackrock and Blanchardstown by 11%, Coolock by 10% and so on. These are the official statistics. What we have from the Government is not zero tolerance, but zero performance. Of the 40,000 public servants recruited since 2000, less than 1% of them have been frontline gardaí to deal with detection rates of all the serious assaults and headline offences imposed and put upon the public. It is not zero tolerance but zero performance.

This is appalling in terms of the Government's ability to ensure the public are protected from vandals, thugs, criminals and gangland warfare. The Taoiseach has failed utterly in this respect.

Deputy Kenny can take individual areas and I have already raised the issue about Blanchardstown but that does not take from what I stated, namely that even though there are 400,000 more people in the country, an increase from 3.6 million to 4.04 million, headline crime is down 14%.

We have provided for additional overtime, additional resources for specialist units and more prison places for those who are convicted. We have far more prison places now than we had previously, and they are all full. Detection rates cannot be down when that is the case. A criminal justice Bill with tough provisions is before the House and I hope it will be passed this session. The Government will continue to deal with the thugs and vandals who try to upset the life of ordinary, decent people.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Will the Taoiseach revisit the circumstances depicted in the excellent "Prime Time" programme earlier this week on taxation and how a coach and four is being driven through the tax code to assist the very wealthy and elite in our society in minimising or avoiding paying any tax when the great majority of people who get up at 6.30 a.m. to go work find themselves heavily taxed when one takes into account the number of stealth taxes and charges the Government has introduced? There is great anger among the public at the dismissive manner in which the Taoiseach dealt with this matter yesterday.I ask the Taoiseach to return, first, to the question of tax exiles and the measure he introduced to facilitate people being out of this country under the 183 day rule but at the same time enjoying the hospitality of this country while not paying tax here in terms of their personal incomes. The Taoiseach seemed to tell me, or I thought he told me, yesterday until I read the record, that the question of the 183 day rule, the residency requirement, would be included in the review, but when I read the Taoiseach's answer it does not state that. I ask him again this morning if the residency qualification is included in the review. There is the question of whether, in the light of ten years' experience, it ought to be restricted or limited in some fashion. The Minister for Finance said it is not and he is quite satisfied with the way it is operating.Second, a front page story in The Irish Times this morning is about a named company, Irish Ferries, saving €3 million to which it would otherwise have been liable in tax in 2003.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	36	My colleague, Deputy Howlin, drew attention last October to the fact that the company had decided to lay off 150 staff on the Irish-France routes and to transfer its crewing to a third party agency — in other words, to recruit cheap, non-national labour in breach of the labour regulations and to disemploy Irish workers. Is not the least that we could expect from these companies that are treated so well in terms of our tax code that they would observe high standards in work practices?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	37	On the first issue, there is a major review of all the tax shelters and tax allowances under way. It is my view that as part of that review they all should be looked at. Specifically, in respect of the measure the Deputy raised, as I said yesterday, that has been on the Statute Book for 11 years. Regardless of whether it is working well, it seems that now is a good time to review it. The answer to that question is "Yes", if I was not totally clear on that yesterday. I was informed since yesterday that the Revenue Commissioners confirmed that they are monitoring the application of the non-resident rules in respect of cases being handled by their large case division. The Minister for Finance asked the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to keep him appraised of any developments in this area arising out of the current monitoring of the position by Revenue. The Minister is expecting an update report from Revenue after these have been examined. That is currently under way.With regard to the question on shipping, this measure was introduced three years ago in the Finance Act 2002. It was designed to help the Irish shipping sector. Along with other EU countries, the Irish shipping sector faced competition from ships registered in Liberia and similar countries which were crewed by low cost employees. Several EU countries reacted to these developments by introducing a special low tax regime known as tonnage tax under which tax is paid by reference to the tonnage of the ships. The tonnage system was introduced originally by Greece 35 years ago, which has a major merchant shipping fleet. The system currently applies in 11 other EU countries as well as Ireland. The tonnage tax regime for these EU countries has to be cleared by the European Commission for State aid purposes. The European Commission is conscious of protecting the EU shipping sector.Regarding capital allowances, which Deputy Rabbitte raised, commercial ships have also been entitled to capital allowances. A ship is an item of plant and machinery used in a trade and the capital allowances for plant and machinery are used in lieu of normal commercial depreciation of a business asset. A ship is the main asset of a shipping trade, in the same way as a lorry is the main asset of a haulage business. The existing regime for capital allowances for plant provides that such an asset can be written off at 12.5% over an eight year period. That is how the system works.I am not dealing with these issues on a day to day basis. Therefore, I do not know if there are abuses. That is the system that provides for this measure. If there is any abuse of the system, I am sure the Revenue Commissioners would examine it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Can I clarify the question of whether tax exiles are in the review? The Taoiseach said that they should be but then he went on to confuse that review——

The Taoiseach went on and confused the issue with the large cases division of the Revenue that is examining the position of 250 plus high net worth individuals in this jurisdiction. That is a quite distinctly separate issue. The Minister for Finance said in the programme that he was quite happy with the system as it obtained to the tax exiles in terms of residency and that it was reviewed in 1994 and there was no intention to review it again. I want to be clear, is it included in that review that was specified in terms of the instruments that it encompasses? Are tax exiles in it or not?Second, on the question of a passenger ship, is an examination or investigation taking place on the capacity of a yacht to convert itself into a passenger ship in order to benefit from this?

In ten years' time, many of them will be very shabby. We are refusing to change the specifications to require certain standards to be adhered to by investors who are benefiting from the tax breaks available.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The Revenue Commissioners are carrying out a review and they will report back to the Minister who will take action if he believes there is a need for change. If there is no need for change, then he will not take action. That is the position.Regarding shipping, I do not know if a case is under investigation or if there is any abuse. The rules are clear and the Revenue Commissioners have stringent powers in that area and would use them if anyone was abusing the system. I will not read out the details again.Apartments and other accommodation are part of the tax relief scheme. Deputy Rabbitte has a point in that many of the apartments built under the tax relief schemes are turning into quite shabby accommodation, particularly in city areas. The schemes were used for rejuvenation purposes. However, if people continue to get tax reliefs in these areas, they could create a difficulty in the future. Many areas have benefited from these tax relief schemes for many years and much useful work has been done but some developments are not up to standard. Areas which have not got that chance should get it. The Minister made that clear in his budget speech.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	62	When travelling around the country I presume the Taoiseach has, from time to time, come across landowners and farmers cursed with the problem of criminals dumping waste illegally on their land. From speaking to people affected, he will know it is not only a case of crops being destroyed, scrap metal proving a hazard for combine harvester operators or otherwise but often the landowner is hauled before court and considered liable. Landowners are asked if they knew about the dumping and how they allowed it to happen.The Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is priming the Taoiseach for his reply, probably knows I will mention Blessington. In light of the regionally important aquifer, which is in danger of being affected by dumping in the area, will the Taoiseach indicate how a large company such as Cement Roadstone, found with perhaps 300,000 tonnes of waste illegally dumped on its land from perhaps 10,000 truckloads, can claim no knowledge of it and escape prosecution for the crime, whoever carried it out?Does the Taoiseach regard it as unacceptable and bizarre that planning permission is needed for a finger post sign but that this particular operation does not need it? Planning permission is not required to make an illegal dump legal. We have talked about rules for the rich and the poor. Does the Taoiseach not see a double standard whereby an operation such as this does not need planning permission after an illegal dump and a crime has been discovered?Will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government not to allow a section 55 procedure which would, effectively, permit a company like Cement Roadstone to be sprung from that particular situation and not even have to apply for planning permission never mind face prosecution which other landowners would face if an illegal dump was found on their land?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	63	As the Deputy knows, a criminal investigation is taking place on waste and on the monitoring of refuse in the Blessington area of west Wicklow. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has informed me the quickest way to achieve a clean up and get action in this area is to use section 55 of the Waste Management Act. That requires those responsible under the Act to clean the site and to fully comply with the Waste Management Act. It is far quicker than trying to get planning permission and trying to use that process. The Minister is quite satisfied that the way to get prompt action is to use section 55 which has all the powers necessary to clean up and manage these sites. That does not take away from the overall monitoring and investigation in the area.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	64	As I expected, the Taoiseach did not respond to the charge that a double standard operates and that a smaller landowner would not be given the generosity of section 55 of the Waste Management Act. I know a number of them who have been hauled before the court. Having discovered illegal waste on their land, they must face the rigours of the law in the course of a criminal investigation.Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to end what is effectively a selective approach to illegal dumping and to apply the waste regulations to illegal dumps found before 2002? The Minister is using 2002 as a benchmark but the dump to which I referred was found before that. Is it not reasonable to move back that date and ensure every instance of illegal dumping is covered rather than the more recent ones? Will the Minister look again at that loophole? Section 55 is, effectively, a loophole which means the operator of, or those responsible for, an illegal dump can decide where to locate a legal dump in the future because it regulates the illegal operation which does not need planning permission or to go through the normal site selection. This rewards criminals and must stop.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I do not have enough time to deal with this whole issue. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government disagrees totally. He believes the Deputy misunderstands section 55.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	66	We do not. One could drive a dozen trucks through it.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Taoiseach should take it to the Mahon tribunal.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Section 55 requires the person responsible to clean up the site. On the Deputy's point about it being pre-2002, section 60 makes specific directions that it is covered, regardless of the time period. If section 55, which gives directions, does not cover it, section 60, which covers all sites, applies.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Why make regulations?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	70	That is the view of the Minister and the company mentioned earlier denies that it is responsible for the dumping.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Of course it does. Would not the Taoiseach do likewise?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	72	That is a matter for the monitoring process which follows. Section 55 requires the guilty party to clean the site fully and if it is an old site section 60 covers it. The Minister can and has made specific directions.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The question could take up more time in the Mahon tribunal.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.Progress on the implementation of the programme for Government is kept under constant review. For every full year that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been in Government, we have published an annual progress report. The second annual progress report of this Administration was published on 1 August 2004. Work is under way on the third annual progress report.The progress reports set out the progress to date in implementing each commitment contained in the programme for Government. It is the responsibility of each Minister to ensure the commitments in the programme that fall within his or her portfolio are fully implemented.The Department of the Taoiseach derives its mandate from my role as Head of Government. It is involved to some degree in virtually all aspects of the work of Government. It supports me as Taoiseach, and the Government through the Government Secretariat, the Cabinet committee system and through its involvement in key policy areas and initiatives.The key strategic priorities of the Department are set out in its strategy statement. They include Northern Ireland, EU and international affairs, economic and social policy, social partnership, public service modernisation and the information society and e-Government. I, and the Ministers of State in my Department, answer questions in the House on these issues. My Department works closely with other Departments and offices. Individual Ministers are answerable the House in respect of their specific areas of responsibility.The key areas for which my Department is responsible in terms of An Agreed Programme for Government are supporting the development and implementation of social partnership, working with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to achieve the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects, co-ordinating the e-Government initiative to bring about an expansion in the range and quality of on-line Government services and ensuring that Ireland's key objectives in the European Union are carried forward in the context of my role as a member of the European Council.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The report on the programme for Government is a litany of failure. For example, in the area of health, the promised extra 200,000 medical cards have not been delivered. In June 2002, a total of 1.207 million people were covered by medical cards and in April 2005 only 1.145 million were covered. That is a failure.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The Deputy should address detailed questions to the line Minister responsible and address general questions only to the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	77	We were promised 3,000 extra hospital beds but that has failed and we were promised extra nurses and consultants but again the Government has failed to deliver.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The Deputy is making a speech which is not appropriate on Question Time.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Does the Ceann Comhairle expect me to confine myself to generalities?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I expect the Deputy to submit a question. The purpose of Question Time is to elicit information from the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I am speaking to the Head of Government who is responsible for the programme for Government and the Ceann Comhairle tells me I am not entitled to ask him a question.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The Deputy should not misconstrue what is being said to him. If he listened to me he would understand this is Taoiseach's Question Time, the purpose of which is to elicit information from the Taoiseach, not to make a statement. All my predecessors have ruled that detailed questions about a particular Department for which the Taoiseach does not have first hand responsibility——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The first question is to ask "the Taoiseach if he will report on the implementation of An Agreed Programme for Government".
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	84	General questions are acceptable but detailed questions should be addressed to the line Minister.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Am I entitled to ask the Taoiseach why we have no fully staffed traffic corps, which is part of the programme for Government? Why will there be no metro to Dublin Airport by 2007, which is part of the agreed programme for Government?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The Deputy knows those questions should be addressed directly to the line Minister responsible.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Why is there no competition in the Dublin bus market, which is part of the agreed programme for Government? I could go on and on but the Ceann Comhairle is ruling me out of order. The Taoiseach might comment on the six questions I have raised about the implementation of this programme.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I have reported on the implementation of An Agreed Programme for Government across several areas.Which questions may I answer?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	97	That is not a problem. I just do not wish to break the rulings of the Chair.Our report details every area of our commitments in the programme for Government — health, education and the broad areas of the economy. We have covered many of them. They are not all finished but as in the last programme, we intend to get near to completion by the end of the programme's five year term.I can go through the detailed commitments but in the broad terms of management of the economy, employment and the resources put into the health service, education and medical cards, which the Deputy mentioned, we have honoured our commitments. We continue to extend coverage to more patients, in terms of facilities, whether in general areas or cardiac or cancer services. We have honoured the specific commitments made in all those areas.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The Government has spent the money but has nothing to show for it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I am trying to pick up the Deputy's individual questions. He focused on only one area but I can stray outside that area to say we have honoured, and continue to honour, our commitments on infrastructure through the national development plan, and the EU and Northern Ireland on which we regularly answer questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Whether the Taoiseach answers, he does not have to misconstrue what the Chair said. I always respect the Chair's rulings.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I was trying to stay within the rules.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The Chair told me years ago to ask those questions. He said that is the way to get information from the Taoiseach of the day.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	103	The Deputy should ask them in a structured way to the correct Minister.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The Taoiseach's Department has line responsibility for the agreement with the social partners. The Fianna Fáil programme and the programme for Government made an explicit commitment to allocate 0.7% of GNP to overseas development aid by 2007. That is in the agreement with the social partners, the programme for Government and the Fianna Fáil manifesto and that of other parties. It was the centrepiece of the Taoiseach's speech to the United Nations in September 2000. Not only has that not been implemented but no alternative date has been announced.Shamefully, a programme issued this morning by Development Cooperation Ireland refers to a different target about the achievement of which the Government crows. That is the development aid of 0.15% of GNP to the least developed countries. The Taoiseach, the social partners and the Government committed themselves to what is in the programme for Government.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	105	A question please.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Is the Taoiseach not ashamed that such a clear commitment supported by the people of Ireland and all sides of the House was so disgracefully broken? Even if he is to break that promise about 2007, why does he not announce a year by which we will meet the United Nations target? That is a matter for which he is responsible. He is responsible for the agreement with the social partners. I would like an answer.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	107	We have not and we are not going to reach 0.7% of GNP by 2007 as I certainly would have liked.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The Taoiseach promised to do it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I take the Deputy's point that we have to work to set a new target and we will do that. The Deputy will accept we have put enormous resources into this area. One of the few downsides of the high economic growth in recent years is that even though we have put in record sums of money it still has not done much in terms of the percentage figure.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	110	We knew that in September 2000 when the Taoiseach made the commitment.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	111	We had it worked out when I made the commitment. Let us remember what happened in 2002 when economic growth fell back to 1%. The lower the rate of economic growth the quicker one reaches the target. If there were four or five bad years in the economy and we still put in the resources the percentage would bounce back up the line as happened in a few countries. The fact is we have put in record sums of money and we have committed to putting in record sums of money in the next few years. We will have put in €1.8 billion over the three year period. I have spoken with the NGO organisations as has the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, in preparation for the White Paper to try to incrementally fix a target. While we have not reached the percentage — I have made that clear time and again in the House and outside — we have put in enormous resources and in regard to our development aid programme we have added additional countries. That we have been able to put in several hundred millions of euro into those programmes is hugely beneficial. We rank seven in the world in terms of our aid which is an extraordinary achievement. We will continue to put in resources because it is money well spent and it is the right thing to do. We do not tie aid and do not do what many other countries do, nor should we but our resources are hugely beneficial. I am still committed to the figure but——
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	112	We became too rich to keep our promise.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I ask Deputy Higgins to allow the Taoiseach to reply without interruption.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	114	It is not a question that we have got too rich. Over a three year period we have put in €1.8 billion which is an extraordinarily large commitment. While that is not the figure we want to reach, this country is contributing huge amounts of money and rightly so and in the consultation process we have to take account of what is happening in the European Union.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	115	My apologies to Deputy Joe Higgins who should have been called second.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I graciously accept your apology, a Cheann Comhairle. On the timescale for the delivery of the commitments in the programme for Government, what is the Government's view on how flexible it is? The Taoiseach is completing the third year of his second term of office, a total of eight years, and has two years to go. Assuming the second term continues for the full five years, 60% of the time has elapsed but 60% of the commitments have not been achieved by any stretch of the imagination. While I cannot go into precise details, let us take the 3,000 beds that should be added to the health service, those ripped out in the 1980s. What is the timescale in regard to the health service?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	117	Detailed questions should be addressed direct to the line Minister.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I have to illustrate briefly the point I am trying to make. Does the Taoiseach envisage that in two years there will be no persons languishing on trolleys in hospitals? That is a question on the timescale. There is also the question of class sizes and other issues.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Obviously the Government has two years to run and we have to try to achieve as much as possible. In many areas we have already achieved our commitments in full while in others we have not. On the issue of beds, a further 200 are being put in place. We are using also an enormous amount of private beds which are already built. That is not what we had envisaged but it is a more effective way of putting beds in place. We bought in several hundreds of private beds rather than the State building them.On the issue of schools we have exceeded the expenditure we envisaged putting into the capital programme. I gave the figures yesterday. We put in approximately €2 billion in recent years into the schools building programme, far more than we envisaged at the time. In recent years, under the national development plan we spent €19 billion, €3 billion more than intended. In regard to the projections for the period ahead, admittedly the five-year envelopes in the Department of Finance are rolling and go beyond the life of this Government, expenditure of €36 billion is provided for in the capital programme up to 2009 which is way ahead of what would have been envisaged in the economic model of 2002.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	120	It is clear that An Agreed Programme for Government is not being fully implemented while movement on some of the commitments is in the opposite direction. I will not speak about specifics. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether in the remaining two years the Government will reduce consistent poverty to below 2%? Will that be an achievement or a level hoped for in the same way as the 0.7% of GNP in development aid? Will an evaluation be carried out on how much of An Agreed Programme for Government will be implemented and has been implemented and the areas in which the Taoiseach must apologise for misleading people? For example, there was a commitment to plant 20,000 hectares per annum in forestry while only 11,000 hectares were planted. Therefore, that commitment does not stack up. Will an evaluation be done or will there be an amended programme for Government which will be more honest rather than this one which is fictitious in many ways? How can people judge the Government other than on the programme for Government which does not stack up?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	121	In an honest and transparent way every year we carry out an analysis of every decision and provide an update on the position. Many of the commitments have been implemented. For example, we have far more in employment than we envisaged, we have more in third level education than envisaged and we have done far more in the schools building programme than envisaged. In terms of houses, many more houses have been built than envisaged. In other areas, for one reason or another, we have not reached our commitment. In the forestry programme great efforts are being made by all concerned. I read an IFA document recently on forestry which urged farmers to co-operate to build up the number of hectares under forestry. While one cannot plan accurately what will happen in a given year there are commitments to develop forestry. The Deputy and I agree that far more forestry is needed——

The Deputy will recall only a few years ago it was suggested we were doing the wrong thing and should not have given over so much good agricultural land to forestry. There were criticisms at the time of the number of incentives I negotiated in an effort to develop forestry. The Government is not the only influence. We have surpassed our targets on many occasions. Sometimes the available funding is not utilised for one reason or another. It is therefore not always a question of resources but it is in many cases.

I have not specified the detailed position that Deputy Kenny articulated earlier. I am entitled to complete my question. All I ask is the opportunity to put my question.These are the broad brushstroke commitments in the programme for Government. Will the Taoiseach affirm if the points to which I have alluded in respect of the programme for Government regarding the overall health care configuration remains the Government's commitment? Will he also confirm that an essential means of achieving equal access for all citizens to our health care system is the renegotiation of the consultants' contract?

I asked the Taoiseach to confirm not only the Government's commitment in respect of the areas I have addressed but also that he will advise the House it is also his commitment to ensure that all citizens have equal access to all care provision under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children. I speak specifically about cancer services.

Without going into detail, the question of the consultants' contract is the central issue.In terms of staff, resources, capital, the professions, nobody in the House can argue against the significant funding increases the Government has invested in those areas. There are 5,000 or 6,000 extra nurses. The Deputy referred to the cancer service. A significant number of additional consultants and related paramedical staff have been brought into the service. The statistics show an improvement in the survival rates for people under 65 by 15% in recent years. The units have been set up on a nation-wide basis.

This report provides an overview of progress during 2004 within the main policy frameworks and in the physical delivery of projects.The team also considered the Atlantic way proposal within the wider Atlantic gateway context. It was noted that the gateways study would be completed by the summer and will be an agenda item later in the year. The next meeting of the team is taking place today. The main agenda items are ports and infrastructure delivery under the CLÁR programme.The team serves a valuable role in progressing and resolving issues related to infrastructure planning and delivery and the House can be assured that it will continue to make an important contribution.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Has the cross-departmental team conducted any fundamental review of the very concept of so-called public private partnerships, considering public projects to be delivered in this way will be much more expensive for the taxpayers than need be the case? In regard to construction and housing, did that recent meeting to which the Taoiseach referred, discuss the delivery of the thousands of social and affordable homes that are guaranteed and promised by the Government in the recent partnership agreement? The Taoiseach is pressing ahead with many projects of public private partnership in one form or another in regard to toll roads. Has he not had pause for thought considering the ongoing disaster of the existing public private partnership, if we can call it that, known as the West Link toll bridge over the Liffey. I passed it the other day at 10.30 a.m. or 11 a.m. which is not rush hour and the traffic was backed up to Finglas. What lessons has the Taoiseach learned from this? Can he do something to end the suffering of our heavily taxed motorists who need to use their cars and use this facility?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	147	In reply to the first question on PPPs, any PPP project must be able to show it is more efficient and more cost effective. The Department of Finance has a process for approval of projects. The Department of Finance takes the view that in the majority of cases, the capital programme is a better way, which is the reason it has increased the capital envelope significantly in recent years. There are instances where it makes economic sense to use public private partnerships and in those cases they are examined. The NRA is examining the position regarding the toll road. PPPs have worked effectively in other developments. The capital programme is undertaking most of the roads programme. The NRA budget is almost totally controlled by the capital programme and by Exchequer resources. An Bord Pleanála has made a decision on the M50 and as I understand it the work will commence immediately after Christmas. I am sure the Deputy is familiar with a number of developments on that road both on the airport side and on the Naas Road side. As I understand it, two large sections will start early in the new year on completion of the port tunnel.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	148	What about housing?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	149	On housing, the 10,000 sites were not discussed at the recent meeting, but I reported and answered questions here on the matter since then. The 10,000 sites have been identified. In some cases housing is under construction and in many others planning arrangements need to be considered. Land swaps are also being considered because it is believed that some very good deals can be effectively achieved. While I am not involved in the detail, I understand that many of the houses have been built and that by swapping some of the strategic land in good locations the units can be acquired immediately which would mean that the people on the local authority affordable housing list could get accommodation straight away. In other areas a group is trying to fast-track the development of these sites. However, most of the sites are very good for any housing and would be beneficial for affordable housing where the costs would be considerably cheaper.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	150	When will we see houses?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	151	There are houses in some cases. Some of the land swap deals that have not gone through are going through now. While I do not have the information today, I recently gave the list of ones that are being considered for land swaps and are under construction. There are a number of them in Inchicore and Finglas. I know that planning permission is being sought for the Gormanstown lands, which should not be a difficulty. There are a number of other ones outside the Dublin region where I am not as familiar with the sites. However, all of them are available and the group is concentrating on working with the local authority to get on with building them.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	161	As the Deputy knows, the education project is finished. I do not believe there are any additional ones in the education area. A number of PPP projects are envisaged to deal with waste water, including those in Dublin and Cork, which are completed. These involved local authorities and the Department and it is intended to do a number of others in which the State will put in substantial money. They are considered to be good projects for PPPs and are considered by the Department of Finance to be very beneficial. There are some difficulties with the Ringsend project, which is a PPP, but I hope that will be resolved. It is still considered a good way to deal with waste water plants.Regarding roads, to the best of my knowledge, the Waterford project, which is a very large PPP project, is held up in planning. A number of other large road projects are considered to be good, but unfortunately I do not have a list of them. The biggest PPP project under construction is the Kinnegad road.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I asked the question because the information we have in terms of the kind of project that traditionally would have been done under the capital programme, for example schools etc., seems to indicate it would be far more efficient and cheaper for the taxpayer in the long term for them to be done in the traditional way. While I do not rule out PPPs absolutely, the examinations we have seen of those completed to date does not make pretty reading. When one considers in detail a project like the Cork School of Music, it is a horror story. Last week the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, was reported in the Irish Examiner, as rallying to the cause and saying that matters will proceed in the context of Cork as the European Capital of Culture etc. However, it is a horrific story. On the other hand the private sector indicates that it is very difficult for it to commit to the terms and conditions in the template now agreed by the Department of Finance. Given that we have the capacity to do so, the normal project that would traditionally be completed with normal capital expenditure should continue to be done that way.There may be an argument regarding waste water treatment plants. I am not an expert on what may have gone wrong at Ringsend and I doubt if that is related to the fact that the project is a PPP. Certainly most taxpayers would say that the PPP experience leaves much to be desired in terms of value for money.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	163	That is exactly what has happened. At the start of the capital programme there was a view that the private sector would wish to be involved in many of the infrastructure projects. In many cases private partners did not become involved and in those cases where they did so, while I do not agree with their case, they argued that if they tender for a project and lose out, the cost of tendering, preparing design specifications etc. is very high. However, we cannot just pick a company and give it the contract; there is no way around that. Perhaps in a bigger country such as the UK, which has some experience of this, or other European countries it may have worked better. Portugal has made considerable use of this method, as has Spain. However, conditions in these countries are different. These countries decide to build a road and they get on with building it. They operate to very different time-lines and without constraints.For many of those reasons they are not interested. Many of the companies that showed an interest at the start are not as interested now. The Minister met them earlier in the year and listened to their complaints about the present system. He has considered revising the system to at least streamline it in the areas where there is an interest.Even though the roads programme has greatly increased since 1999 when it was laid down — roads completed and roads started total approximately 580 km — only a small number of them are PPPs. I do not see that position changing except in the niche areas in which there seems to be considerable work and interest. I do not believe people want toll roads throughout the country. Not many companies tender for PPPs in any area. Even with the regulations being eased, I do not believe many of them will be taken up. Unless it makes absolute sense, the Department of Finance would rather complete these under the traditional capital programme.We have convinced the Department of Finance, and everyone is agreed, to extend the programmes into multi-annual programmes. It was not that many years ago, as the Deputy will recall, that there was an annual programme and one never really knew where one was going. Now there are multi-annual, five-year programmes. In transport, it makes great sense to do things over a longer period, and the Department has been convinced of that. It makes far more sense and achieves far better value for the State to do it on a five- or ten-year basis, and that has been agreed.

I wonder and marvel at how quickly house construction has taken place, and perhaps the Taoiseach might be more specific and advise us of the number and details in that regard. He will recall that, last February, he gave us a number.

If it has not done so, will the Taoiseach undertake to the House to encourage it to address the NESC report with a view to its implementation? That is the critical point.Given that some 40% of people in the private rented sector receive rent supplement or allowance — money that goes directly into the landlord's coffers, into a very——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	176	Regarding major infrastructural projects and the PPP system, we have evidence from the Committee of Public Accounts of cost over-runs totalling €9 billion. When one talks to designers, architects and builders, one sees that the pricing element seems very much askew. In his capacity as chairman of the infrastructure sub-committee, where does the Taoiseach feel that the mistake is being made? Is it at the architectural or design stage that the costs are underestimated? It appears that is where the fault lies regarding the determination of the costs in the first instance. The pricing element included does not appear to be relevant to the outcome. Builders nowadays can build practically anything and anywhere from an engineering perspective, but the cost indicators appear to be very much askew at an earlier stage. Perhaps the Taoiseach might comment on that, based on his experience of projects that have literally gone very much off the rails.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	177	In reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin I again make the point, as I have done several times, that 10,000 sites were available. Most developers will tell one that the process takes six years and it was never the intention to make the sites available and to build in the same year. However, the sites are now available, and there are people to get on with it. The quicker they do so, the better. Some of the sites have been used in land swaps where the developer is given the land and people get their houses straight away. Others are under construction, and I hope the local authorities that have now been given this land, which they did not previously have, can get on with it. There seem to be plenty of builders in the country who are very fast at doing this. One hopes that they will simply get on with it. My task was to try to get the State to give those sites from its own land banks. I gave that commitment, which I have now been honouring for almost a year. I have totally fulfilled my commitment, and I would like to see them built, but I am not much help in that regard as I am not a builder — I might not be much good if I tried.

Let us take the National Roads Authority. Several lessons have been highlighted, and the NRA has taken them on board. I am not saying that everything is perfect, and many of the comparisons are nonsensical. It has appointed a cost estimation specialist whose job it is to review all cost estimates, tender and system outturn costs that have been benchmarked and the design and construction standards now in place and when a change is made to take account of it. Often someone decides to build something from A to B and comes up with a rough costing, which ten years later becomes a real cost. Someone comes back to it and says he or she thought we would only spend €10 million but have spent €100 million. Some of the figures used in a recent programme were 1989 rather than 2003 costs. That is like if I asked the Deputy the cost of his house in 2003 in comparison with 1989. It is nonsense.There have been over-runs and we must ask why they happened, why people change specifications and whether there is a need for certain standards. When there is a change, it must be costed and built in rather than done without reference to the fact that someone must pay for it. In fairness, recent contracts, for example those in 2000, have improved significantly, and the experience of both projects and increases has been very good. Cost-benefit analyses are carried out as projects progress through the planning stages so the impact of cost increases is taken into account. Several independent evaluations of the NRA have shown that it has got its act together in comparison with what happened before.In fairness to road-builders, they are now completing roads far more quickly. The Monasterevin bypass was a year ahead of schedule. The Sligo inner relief road will be several months ahead of schedule. The road project in Carrickmacross has been well ahead. The Glen of the Downs was not, but there were other problems in that case. We are getting far better estimates now, changes are being dealt with and planning is better. We have also built up a very good team, and that is why it is very important that we have a five- or ten-year programme. Many of the people now working for us, who come from South Africa and other parts of the world, will stay if guaranteed continuity of work. The transport budget alone for the next five years is €10 billion. That is a great deal of money and the work on estimates is very important, since the savings that one can make on that kind of money are very large.In my experience, as a country we were too slow in moving from someone identifying the route, with the initial costs, to drawing up a proper specification and deciding what kind of materials and standards we would have and whether it would be a dual carriageway or two-lane route. Everything changed because of the length of time, particularly in recent years.One of the points unfairly omitted from those programmes is why people change specifications. Consider the number of cars and the population. As far back as 1993, people were saying that by 2010 we would have 3.3 million or 3.4 million people. Now the same experts are saying we will have 4.5 million people. For a person trying to design a road, much will have changed over that period, with a million extra people and a multiple of the estimated number of cars. Those are the reasons. We now have experts that are monitoring the situation more closely. Time will show it to be more effective.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is hoping to bring forward a memo on the housing issues that were in the NESC report, the all-party committee report and the report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It will take the three reports together to develop a series of measures that deal with affordable and social housing.

This report has been available for a number of months, but it has not been published yet.Are there any proposals to amend the Education Act 1998? There is no general requirement on pupils, especially in second level schools, to abide by a set of rules and regulations. This means that in a small minority of cases where students disrupt class procedures, principal teachers and class teachers have no method of dealing with them. The Act needs to be examined as the situation is causing stress to teachers, pupils and parents.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I am glad the Minister of State has arrived for the debate. Significant bureaucracy is being built up around the Disability Bill and this amendment represents a way of reducing it. There is fear among those concerned that a disproportionate amount of resources will be devoted to administration. An example of this is the provision for the appointment of assessment officers and liaison officers. This amendment proposes that one person should perform both these roles rather than passing files back and forth between different people and so on. I raised this issue with the Minister on Committee Stage.Notwithstanding my proposal for a new joint role of needs officer, another issue is the question of how the liaison officer is to reconcile the needs of the person with the resource constraints that will arise. The Bill fails to spell out a method or criteria for doing this. Liaison officers will have real difficulty in performing this function because the budgets of the executives will fluctuate. How are they to know what limits should apply? This is an issue that must be considered.The structure of the legislation may indicate that inadequate weight is given to the constitutional rights of those with disabilities. The Minister of State fudged this point yesterday in his observation that there are people making money through a manipulation of constitutional rights. However, the Constitution is a vital document that outlines the fundamental rights of every citizen. Under the Constitution, the Supreme Court is the body charged with its interpretation. I respect the Constitution and the judgments that flow from the Supreme Court. I would not contend that many people are making money through a manipulation of the Constitution's provisions. We are all in trouble if the Constitution is thrown aside or fails. It is the basic safeguard for every citizen and that is its function.It might be argued that, by failing to spell out the principles and policies on which a liaison officer is supposed to exercise his or her discretion, these officers are delegated excessive powers. This arises from Article 15.2 of the Constitution. We must be careful about what is allowed, particularly in terms of the role of the liaison officer. These are serious matters concerning bureaucracy and assessment and liaison officers. The degree of bureaucracy might be reduced if one person did the job of both liaison and assessment officers. The question also arises under this legislation as to the method of operation of the liaison officer.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	217	This amendment seeks to make sense of the Bill. It is incredible that the officer who performs an assessment will take no account of the availability of resources. The assessment is then passed to another officer who must take this availability into account. The Minister accepts that this Bill will be dependent on capacity, which we all know is not sufficient. There is not a sufficient number of physiotherapists, speech therapists and psychologists to provide the service required under the service statement — we are all aware of that.The disability community, which held consultations with the Minister over two years, has also accepted that capacity will not be immediately available but it is prepared to allow it to be developed where shortages exist. I do not understand why, for example, the liaison officer cannot take that into account as part of an ongoing process as opposed to once off. Services which are unavailable will not be itemised, which would permit a return to the issue at a later date, at which time services might be available for one hour or three hours per week, or whatever. I do not understand why that provision cannot be included.The Opposition is making genuine efforts to prevent the bureaucratic mire, which will be introduced by this Bill, from bogging everyone down. It is incredible that layers of bureaucracy are being created, with no indication that services must be provided. That amazes me. The Minister of State will tell me about the €900 million in the roll-over programme for the next five years.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I will not.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Has the figure increased? I would accept that argument if the money which was supposed to be made available this year was allocated, but the Minister of State accepted that did not happen. Areas now experience cutbacks because money is not flowing as it should. I am not saying that the money is not available, but that it is not allocated as it should be. There is already a difficulty with funding. If, as a representative group, we were discussing rights for women, men or children, we would be jumping up and down and screaming that this is not good enough.The psychology of the consultation process was devised by an expert in managing people. The disability community has been extremely patient and respectful of this process. We need to recognise that this patience should not be taken as capitulation. We should take the steps necessary in terms of the bureaucracy represented by this Bill. People who, despite having a statement to hand, will be told services are not available. The liaison officer rather than the Government will take the blame for the unavailability of services because there is a natural tendency to blame the person standing in front of us. This structure needs to be addressed because, while the majority of disabilities are physical, a substantial number who suffer from intellectual disabilities will find the process confusing. Despite insisting in a civilised society that such people are treated as adults capable of making decisions, we put in place a system that is designed to delay and confuse people. I support Deputy Stanton in this matter.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I support amendment No. 40, which is an important one that deals with the question of needs and the reasons for needs officers. It also deals with the issue of bureaucracy, about which many of us are concerned. We are concerned about the way in which money has been spent on services over the past nine or ten years. People on the front line, particularly families of people with disabilities, have concerns about value for money and the level and efficiency of services.Debate on amendment No. 40 should focus on the needs of people with disabilities. The Taoiseach recently announced the spending of €3.7 million on the development of a swimming pool at St. Michael's House, and I wish him well in that, but 548 people remain on waiting lists for the services of that centre. Of these, 263 are categorised as priorities, which means they are urgently awaiting a place. When the broader figures on needs are examined, these account for 40% of the total number awaiting residential placement in the HSA eastern region.The provision of priority services for adults with intellectual disabilities whose parents are seriously ill or dead is a major issue. People in their 80s and 90s are trying to care for intellectually disabled adults in their 40s. It is sad that the resources and services are not available to guarantee that safe residential accommodation will be provided. Some parents are forced to accept a low level of services. I raise this issue in the context of the needs of people with disabilities. Amendment No. 40 is important because it addresses the issue of needs officers and I urge my colleagues to support it.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I support the provisions set out in amendments Nos. 38 and 40. I had intended in quite a number of amendments to promote the establishment of an independent disability support service as outlined in the document, Equal Citizens. The Ceann Comhairle has ruled all such amendments out of order. While this action may have been correct under Standing Orders as the amendments implied a charge on the Exchequer, I continue to believe that if the Minister of State had considered the proposal on Committee Stage or during drafting, he would have realised a support service would be more cost-effective and efficient and less bureaucratic than the approach in the legislation.Ruled out of order were amendments Nos. 30, 33, 40, 60, 69, 70, 72, 86, 89, 94, 97, 107, 123, 126, 127, 141, 146, 148, 150 and 155 to 158, inclusive. The number of amendments demonstrates that those who support me on this matter — and I — put time, effort and thought into the promotion of an independent disability support service. It is not something we dreamed up. The service was a key recommendation of the DLCG and should have been a crucial subject of debate on the Bill's provisions. As I have been prohibited from moving my amendments, I indicate my support for the amendments tabled by colleagues on Part 2 of the Bill. I will support amendments Nos. 38 and 40 up to and including amendment No. 154.We took a different approach by trying to gut the legislation wholesale and revise it to reflect our view that its provisions were irredeemable and that the rights-based model proposed by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and the DLCG in its document, Equal Citizens, should be implemented. I recognise, however, that the proposals of Opposition colleagues represent an improvement on the Government's fundamentally flawed formula as set out in the Bill.I will continue to fight to raise the issues I have addressed in amendments. It is ridiculous that Standing Orders allowed the majority of my amendments to be ruled out of order on the grounds of a cost to the Exchequer. While everything we debate involves a cost to the Exchequer, the Opposition is precluded from discussing provisions that could prove more beneficial in the long run than those the Government proposed. We should change the relevant Standing Order to facilitate proper debates on legislation and allow us to put forward constructive, far-reaching amendments to improve this legislation in particular and other legislation in future.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I support amendments Nos. 38 and 40 and use the example of a reply I received to a parliamentary question to demonstrate why. The area from which I come is a developing one like most of those on the east coast. I asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children a question which she forwarded to the Health Service Executive on the failure to fill approved posts in speech therapy, occupational therapy and other front line services in Kildare. Parents have been the advocates while needs officers have represented the points at which advocacy and the putting in place of services was to have happened.Due to the failure to fill approved posts, a child in my area who is in school in a neighbouring county could not access speech and language services in her home area while other children attending the school could access such services in theirs. In trying to unravel the problem, I asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children why staffing for front line therapy services in County Kildare delivered by the eastern regional area of the Health Service Executive has not increased since 1996 and whether an embargo is in place. An embargo would make a very direct difference to the ability of people to access services. The reply informed me that the public service had to be reduced by 5,000, which statement seems to be chapter and verse. I have read it several times elsewhere. According to the reply, the staff employment ceiling notified by the Department of Health and Children has lessened the numbers employed on 31 December 2002 and it has not been possible for the Health Service Executive to fill approved posts.As the approved posts in question are in speech and occupational therapy, it is difficult to understand how the Bill will make a difference when other Government decisions create an impediment to its implementation. While I have other examples of practical problems, that one is especially illuminating. As the child to whom I referred would do very well if she received speech therapy, I cannot understand why its provision is not seen as an investment with the potential to deliver a return. While we have no difficulty in seeing a return on assets, it does not appear that there is any expectation of a return on investment in the adoption of a rights-based approach. If an investment were made in her needs, the child in question would have the potential to live a much more independent life.While a needs officer is required to press for such services, it will be especially difficult to achieve in developing areas in which an embargo on recruiting obtains. Whereas in other areas populations are in decline, in Kildare needs are expanding but services are not. It is a crisis. While we do not have a problem adding another Deputy to the constituency, which is welcome, on foot of the increase of 50,000 in the population, we cannot add an extra speech therapist due to the embargo on public service recruitment. It is not the approach to take.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	224	The amendments seek to unite the functions of the assessment officer under section 8 and the liaison officer under section 11 under the title "needs officer". While I have certain sympathy with the thrust of the arguments put forward, the House will be aware that an assessment officer has statutory independence to identify the individual needs arising from an assessment without regard to resources. The DLCG argued forcibly that the person who carries out the assessment should be independent of the person who provides the service. If the same persons did the two jobs, there would be an inevitable tendency to match assessments to available resources. It was specifically at the demand of the DLCG that we made the assessment officer statutorily independent so that the assessment would not in any way be affected by or predicated on resources. The liaison officer on the other hand must take a range of practical considerations into account to determine how needs can best be met within the resources available. To do this the liaison officer would be operating as part of the HSE, taking into account the practical limitations that exist in providing services. The two roles are fundamentally different. I hold the view that it is in the best interests of people with disabilities that they remain separate.I take the point made by Deputy Stanton and other Deputies that to ensure we have a seamless system that is not overly bureaucratic both roles could be combined in the person of a needs officer. The whole thrust of the roll out of the regulations is such that every effort would be made to ensure a person-centred approach to the assessment, the liaison role and the creation of the service statement.In the roll out of the regulations the HSE is most anxious to ensure that the least possible bureaucracy is in place so as to ensure a seamless approach to those roles. It is important given the demand of the disability organisations that we do retain the statutory independence of the assessment officer from the more practical implementation role that the liaison officer will have. I have listened carefully to what was said. We are in discussion with the HSE on how this would happen. I did promise to keep the House informed of the progress that is being made and I hope to be in a position to refer to some of that at a later stage in the debate this afternoon or tomorrow.I congratulate Deputy Catherine Murphy on her election to the House. In one of her first contributions she has raised the important issue of the impact of the embargo on the appointment of staff in this area. I will ask the Department of Health and Children to give us specific advice on the issue raised. The embargo applies across the spectrum. However, due to the major reorganisation of the health service that is taking place under the HSE which will bring about a reduction in certain kinds of posts it will facilitate the creation of posts in the disability sector. I accept her point and will refer the issue to the Department of Health and Children. As the debate proceeds I will keep her informed as to how the embargo will impact on the appointment of staff to extra posts, which as she stated have been approved by the Department of Finance as a result of the investment package in this sector. All of us want to ensure that if posts are approved we can get around the embargo difficulties in some way. I will address the matter on foot of further advice from the Department of Health and Children.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I thank the Minister for his response. The issue is that two functions are involved. One function will be delegated to the assessment officer who shall be independent in his work. He or she will have to take an overall view of the needs of an individual with a disability. The Minister has not explained how the liaison officer will perform his or her functions. How is he or she to reconcile the needs of the person with the resource constraints? The proposed legislation does not spell out how that can be done and it is important that we would be informed as to how liaison officers would operate. Liaison officers are being given extensive powers under the Constitution which, in effect, are ministerial powers. Many different issues are involved in this regard. How will resource constraints be reconciled with the needs of the person? We are dealing with the budget of the Health Service Executive. Many people will be drawing on this budget at any one time and it will fluctuate. The Minister must provide clarity on this issue and tell us how it will be done.A professional person should not have difficulty in carrying out an independent, objective assessment. Neither should he or she have any difficulty in examining what services can realistically and practically be provided.

What will happen is that a family or a person with a disability will have to interact with two officials when one person could easily do the work. It would be preferable for one person to get to know the family and the needs involved rather than for a second person to have to go over the same ground. We should examine the possibility of having one person do the two jobs outlined in the Bill. According to the wording in the Bill the HSE could appoint one person to do both jobs. That is not prohibited in the Bill.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The amendment is sensible. A person with disabilities would meet an assessment officer who would draw up a service statement. A liaison officer would not be sitting outside the door of the assessment officer so that he or she could immediately act on the service statement. The proposed system would cause delays, additional journeys and confusion. In the first instance a person would be presented with a statement meeting all of their needs. He or she would then have to wait a month or two months to get an appointment with a liaison officer who would inform him or her that it is not possible to provide everything that is specified on the service statement. That does not make sense. I would prefer if we did not have to take account of what resources are available. However, people would manage to deal with that. It appears to be a waste of effort and money to do it in this manner when there would clearly be no benefit to the client.

What is being suggested is a compromise on what the DLCG sought which was a disability support service that would have the dual functions, which Deputy Stanton outlined, of advocacy and needs assessment and ensuring that the required services are delivered. It is a pity the Minister of State did not adopt that approach. Had he done so, a considerable cost would not be imposed on the Exchequer and there would not be such a considerable amount of bureaucracy, nor would there be such a delay between the making of an assessment and the delivery of service.If a single body were responsible, it could carry out both functions at once. It would be able to source the services required and indicate the nature of these to the individuals being assessed and their families. This would prevent the assessor from having to type up the assessment and consult somebody else thereon, after which, at some future stage, the services would be delivered. In some cases, they might never be delivered because they might not be available. It is a pity that the Minister of State did not accept the proposal for a disability support service. By way of compromise, I fully support amendments Nos. 38 and 40.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	230	On Deputy Stanton's question, which embraces the issues raised by the other speakers, the role of the assessment officer is to operate within the Health Service Executive system to identify the series of services that can be provided from within existing or planned resources. The HSE is working out the detailed arrangements for the practical implementation of the legislation. It is responsible for defining the relationship between the assessment officer and the liaison officer.Nothing in the Bill precludes the HSE from ensuring a relationship exists between the assessment officer and the liaison officer. The HSE has already pointed out that the assessment is the initial stage of intervention and that it is therefore important that the assessment and the intervention are not divorced from each other. It is also important that those carrying out assessments are aware of and involved in current practice. As I said on Committee Stage, it is emerging from the HSE — its discussions in this regard are at an early stage — that there will be a person-centred, seamless approach to the assessment, the liaison procedure and the preparation of the service statement.One of the difficulties is that the process of assessment is to be independent. The DLCG demanded this. Therefore, there must be a gap between the independent statutory officer making the assessment and the liaison officer who is rolling out the service. In response to a fair point made by Deputy Stanton, in the practical roll-out of services one can retain the statutory independence of assessors and, at the same time, ensure that a very good working relationship exits between them and the liaison officers. There is no doubt that, in some cases, assessment and intervention will be inseparable. We will discover this as we engage in the practical implementation of the legislation.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The Bill seems to demand that we have two separate people doing the two separate jobs. This means a person with a disability will have to interact with two separate people although one person could, quite reasonably, do both. Under the law, the assessment would be carried out impartially and objectively. The liaison work would also have to be carried out as laid out in the legislation.This Bill has been criticised for its cumbersome administrative framework. We are all concerned about this and Deputy Lynch expressed this concern extremely well. We all have experience of bureaucracy feeding on itself. I am not finding fault with the people involved but once one sets up a bureaucracy with different layers, one is invariably creating circumstances in which an increasing number of people will be writing and sending reports to each other and doing extra, unnecessary work although one person could do it all. One person could become familiar with the case of a disabled person rather than having a second person become involved also. We are creating a monster for which there is no need. I will be pressing my amendment. The amendments we have discussed are reasonable. We need only one needs officer to interact with the disabled person.I will ask the Minister of State once more a question that I have asked him three times but which he has not answered. How is the liaison officer supposed to reconcile the needs of the person with the resource constraints? The legislation spells out no criteria for doing so. Is there any answer to my question or is it just a sticky wicket which the Minister of State is glossing over? The issue is important. Much discretion and many powers of delegation are left to the liaison officer. The budget exists, it is a moveable feast and we do not know how the process will work. People are concerned about this. I intend to press my amendment.

That is the reality.Since we entered into discussion on amendments, the DLCG was quite adamant that it wanted an independent assessment of need. It is for this reason that the independent assessment of need must be governed by a statutory provision for such independence while the remaining parts of the process are not.I have no doubt that the HSE will address this issue during the practical implementation of the legislation. In principle, there is no reason the assessment officer, having his or her statutory responsibilities, could not perform part of the liaison officer work which is not statutory and which must accord——

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I move amendment No. 39:
In page 10, line 20, to delete "(including a personal social service)" and substitute the following:", including a personal social service, such as home care, respite care, personal care and social supports,".As the section is worded, it is unclear what constitutes a personal social service. We do not know what constitutes such a service and the Bill does not define it. Will such a service mean the full range of home care, personal care and social supports required to implement the objectives of services for older people and other people with disabilities? The objectives of services for older people aim to restore those people who become ill or dependent to independence at home, to encourage support in the care of the elderly and other people with disabilities in their own communities by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies in every way possible and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for elderly people and other people with disabilities when they can no longer be maintained with dignity and independence in their own homes.Older people constitute approximately 42% of people with disabilities in Ireland and they constitute an important proportion of people with disabilities and the disabled population. The National Council on Ageing and Older People is concerned that this service should be defined. We do not know what "including a personal social service" means, and it is not stated in the Bill. The phrase is broad and it is important that its definition is spelt out.The amendment attempts to spell out what constitutes a personal social service by specifying that it includes home care, respite care, personal care and social supports. Perhaps the Minister of State will advise us what he intends a personal service to mean. The Bill states, in page 10, line 20:"health service" means a service (including a personal social service) provided by or on behalf of the Executive.Many people are anxious to know what constitutes a personal social service. In this amendment I am trying to define it.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I strongly support the amendment because it is a significant one and its inclusion would add to the legislation. When we are talking about social services and basically services for people with disabilities — I am referring to all people with disabilities — we should reflect on what has been the reality for the past 20 years, namely, that this State has been a cold house for people with disabilities. There have been years of exclusion of this sector. It has been accepted by most politicians in this House and people outside it that for more than 20 years people with disabilities have been excluded. We need to do something to bring them in from the cold to the mainstream of Irish society. That requirement should always remain at the core of the legislation.When we discuss services and talk about assisting people, particularly people with disabilities, from a very young age, I urge the Minister of State to note that all good practice nationally and internationally has shown that early intervention is essential for people with disabilities, particularly speech and language and other such services.We must acknowledge that some amazing developments have occurred in terms of examples of good practice in Irish society. It has been proven that where services are delivered at an early stage to people with disabilities, major changes have occurred. I know from my experience in the case of Down's syndrome and from being a parent that if a child with Down's syndrome receives quality early intervention services, major progress can be made in the child's speech and language, reading ability and literacy level and in respect of other such issues. These are important aspects of the debate when discussing services. The recent Special Olympics proved that there are thousands of people here with disability who have had major personal achievements over the past ten or 15 years. If one compares the situation now with that ten, 20 or 30 years ago, when many people with disability were left out of mainstream society, it shows there has been major progress. There are examples in this Bill of good practices that should be developed.I draw attention to the reality for many people with disability and to the many barriers before them. We need to identify ways to overcome these barriers. We must change attitudes to disability and to people with disability because there is still much misinformation and prejudice. We must recognise and protect the rights of people with disability. We must also recognise the benefits of this legislation are not only for people with disability but for society as a whole. When we discuss services for people with disability, we must keep in mind these key important points.The services about which we talk in the context of this amendment, including home care, respite care, personal care and social supports, are very important for many people with disability. In the disability sector, approximately 861 people need day care service, approximately 1,014 need respite care and 462 are without any service. Approximately 300 people with intellectual disability are in psychiatric hospitals, which is totally inappropriate. These are not huge numbers. We can tackle the problems in the disability sector. It is not a huge issue.On the way funding is spent providing the services, it seems to be easier to get money for capital projects than to fund respite or day care services about which I am concerned. Is it a political issue? Building a building, an office or a swimming pool for people with disability is grand but there is always a big problem when it comes to the 462 people who are without any service or when it comes to the 861 people in need of respite and day care. I do not know whether the problem is the management or the way the money is spent within the services. However, these are the issues about which I constantly get complaints from people with disability and their families.This amendment specifically deals with home and respite care. I emphasise the importance of home care. It is better to have support services in a person's home, where possible, than to place him or her in a residential unit. It is also more economic to provide services in a person's home or locality than to send him or her 100 km or, in some cases, 180 km to get a service. That type of scenario, which was acceptable 20 or 30 years ago, is not on anymore. I do not accept families of children with disability should have to travel from Mayo to Dublin to get services or that visually impaired children should have to travel to the North to get services. How dare anybody say that to a family with a child with a disability. Would the family of a child without a disability ship their child out of their family home from Monday to Friday to get a service? That would not happen in a million years. It is, therefore, unacceptable for families of children with disability to accept this level of service. This amendment raises all these issues. I do not like to harp on the economic issue but one hears it regularly when one raises the cost of services and the question of finance. One then watches programmes on television and sees the squandering of public money.Elderly people, particularly those with physical disability, can be better cared for in their homes than in residential units, which should only be a last resort for the majority of them. We must put the supports into the community. There are examples of good practice whereby small houses were bought in communities, supports and services were provided and people were taken out of residential units. These moves have been progressive but we need to develop these services and stop whingeing about the cost because the majority of people with disability are sick to the teeth hearing about it each time the issue of finance and to where resources are appropriated comes up. One does not raise the issue of cost when demanding a primary school place on 1 September for one's four-year old child. I do not accept families of disability must put up with this type of nonsense.It has been a cold house for families with children with disability. As a parent of a daughter with a disability, I know how people had to fight, kick and scream for services ten or 15 years ago. Although I am critical of this legislation, I hope it ends those days once and for all, that is, that we end the cold house for children and adults with disability and their families. We should bring them in, turn on the heat and make them part of mainstream Irish society. Amendment No. 39 is part of that inclusion effort and I urge Members to support it.

I hope the Minister of State will take it on board and indicate some movement on the issues we have raised. An understanding of our point of view and sympathy from the Minister of State is not good enough in this case. We need action on these amendments for this legislation to reflect the hopes and desires of the many people who contributed.I indicated previously that my party objects to the circumscription of services which shall be the subject of an assessment of need under Part 2 to health and educational services only. The Ceann Comhairle has ruled out of order amendments tabled originally by Deputy Lynch on Committee Stage which would have corrected this problem and which I endorse. I refer to amendments Nos. 47, 74, 129 and 153. It is deemed that they would impose a burden on the Exchequer when, in fact, they are cost effective and should be regarded as an investment on which there would be a return. Since these amendments were ruled out of order, we must make do with the amendment tabled by Deputy Stanton and Deputy Murphy, which is not a bad one, although it does not go far enough. If the Minister of State were willing to take it on board, it would show some good faith. When we review this legislation in a number of years, what we have pointed out here will have been borne out and at least we will be able to say the Minister of State took it on board.I am opposed to the Government's patronising, medicalised approach in Part 2, which this amendment tries to change slightly. The Government's approach does not acknowledge nor reflect the reality that people with disability are routinely excluded by design from much more than health care and education-related services. They are excluded from the workplace, independent living, transport, communications, and from participation in many aspects of life which able people take for granted. These structural impediments or obstacles prevent full inclusion on an equal basis. Disability-specific services, which should be provided on the basis of need and as of right, constitute more than could be appropriately provided by the Minister of Health and Children.The formulation of Part 2, to which this amendment relates, reflects the Government's view that the Department of Health and Children will provide only those services which people with disabilities truly need and for which they should be assessed. I disagree with this. As the disability legislation consultation group pointed out, disability-specific services, to which those with disabilities should have a right, are those which enable them to participate fully as equals in society and maximise their ability to live their lives as independently as possible to their full potential and as equal citizens. They include housing, training, employment supports and transport and can also include access to communications technology and a range of facilities that have no connection with health and basic education. The amendment refers to "a personal social service, such as home care, respite care, personal care and social supports".The point of the recommendation that the legislation should assert the right of people with disabilities to an independent assessment of needs is that such an assessment must be made independently of the service provider, the Health Service Executive or the Department of Health and Children within the inevitable organisational and financial constraints, with some of which the preceding two amendments dealt. Otherwise, the assessment will not reflect the individual's true needs and will therefore become only a statement of what is available to the person, which is not good enough.My preferred formula, as reflected in my disqualified amendments, was to establish an unqualified right to assessment of need in regard both to disability-specific services and other supports necessary to maximise independent participation in and contribution to society. Some of the supports required in this amendment would help maximise the independence of people with disabilities.I would also prefer that what constitutes a disability-specific service would be defined by regulation on advice from the National Disability Authority in a published list, organised by category service and updated annually. It is disturbing that my amendment to require all such disability-specific services to be provided in a manner consistent with Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights has been disallowed. This amendment proposed a minimum standard for service provision. It has been ruled out of order on the basis that it would impose a charge on the Exchequer.Amendment No. 44, which we are not discussing, also relates to Part 2. Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights cover torture, inhumane and degrading treatment, the right to privacy and family life. That convention is part of the corpus of Irish law and I do not understand how the Government can refuse to accept an amendment based on the convention, much less rule it out of order.There are no justiciable rights in regard to minimum standards for service provision in this Bill. Without my amendment a person, by reason of cost, would not be able to challenge the Government on the basis of providing a service that violates standards under the European Convention on Human Rights. That is repugnant and morally wrong.I support amendment No. 39 because it attempts to improve this legislation. Any change is to be welcomed but I am not confident that the Minister of State will take it on board because he has dismissed virtually every amendment which would improve this Bill in any minor or major way.

Existing health legislation covers some personal social services such as residential care. Any expansion of the scope of such provision by way of defining personal social services would therefore be more appropriately dealt with in that legislation.Having listened to the arguments of the Opposition Deputies, I am puzzled as to the advantage of including a few areas such as those listed in the amendment. What is to be done about other areas not included in the amendment?

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	242	Part 2 deals with all health services as provided by the Health Service Executive. It would not be appropriate to define health services in this Bill. The same applies to personal social services. If Deputy Stanton would outline the advantage of including this limited number of areas in the Bill, I could perhaps refer that to the Department of Health and Children.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	243	That is useful. In the Bill health service "means a service (including a personal social service) provided by or on behalf of the Executive;" but the Bill does not define the personal social service. This amendment proposes that a personal social service will include "home care, respite care, personal care and social supports". These are examples only. Other services could be included.The Minister of State implies that it refers only to residential care. It would be important to ensure we know what this means because the phrase "including a personal social service" will be in the legislation. Who will define that, how will it be defined and how broad is that definition? The Minister of State implied it refers only to residential care but that is not enough. Does a health service provided by, or on behalf of, the Health Service Executive include home care, respite care, personal care and other social supports that people with disabilities might want?I wish to tease out this matter because it is unclear. I would like to hear the Minister of State's definition of this service. I have included examples of what it might be but the list is not exhaustive. The list is prefaced by the phrase "such as" and could include others. Some of my colleagues have mentioned transport and housing and so on. I do not know how broad or narrow this will be. It would be useful if the Minister of State could tell us what is a personal social service.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	244	The definition of health service in the Bill is "a service ... provided by or on behalf of the Executive". That means that all services provided by the Health Service Executive are included in this Bill, including those which the Deputy mentioned in his amendment. This includes personal social services, such as personal assistance and so on. I am prepared to return to the Department of Health and Children to clarify this issue. I am satisfied that the Deputy's requirements are included in the Bill. The Health Act 2004 defines health and personal social services to cover the services outlined in the Health Act, such as residential day care and respite care. I am satisfied that the Bill covers the areas the Deputy seeks to cover.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Farmers receiving direct aid are required under the single payment scheme to respect the various statutory management requirements set down in EU legislation on the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare, and plant health, and to maintain the farm in good agricultural and environmental condition. Member states are obliged to ensure that there is no significant reduction in the amount of land under permanent pasture by reference to the total area under permanent pasture in 2003. These requirements are termed "cross-compliance".In addition to cross-compliance checks, it is a requirement to carry out standard eligibility checks to verify that the actual area claimed in the single payment application form corresponds with the area held by the farmer and to ensure that there are no overlapping or duplication of parcels claimed.In general the rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance under the single payment scheme is 1% of those farmers to whom the relevant statutory management requirement or good agricultural and environmental conditions apply. However, at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the animal identification and registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant regulations.In October 2004 the Department prepared a consultative document on cross-compliance and invited views from interested organisations. Department officials met the main farming organisations in December to discuss their submissions and these discussions have continued more recently in the context of the review of the protocol on direct payments.An information booklet on cross-compliance has been issued to all farmers. It sets out the principal features of cross-compliance in terms of the standards that must be met by farmers and the control arrangements that will be necessary. To coincide with the issue of the booklet, a series of countrywide farmer information meetings organised by my Department in conjunction with Teagasc took place in early April. These meetings focused not only on cross-compliance but addressed the various other issues associated with the introduction of the single payment scheme.The EU directives and regulations referred to in cross-compliance have been in place for many years. Producers are generally familiar with them and are complying with the standards set in implementing them in Ireland.In implementing the single payment scheme, I am aiming to minimise the number of inspection visits and to move towards a position where, in most cases, all eligibility and cross-compliance checks will be carried out during a single farm visit. It is envisaged that the 22,000 or so inspections, which were carried out under the old regime, will be significantly reduced to 10,000 under the single payment scheme. This approach should minimise the level of inconvenience to farmers. However, in certain instances more than one inspection of a holding may be unavoidable.

Will the total number amount to 5% or 6%? Will farmers know in advance under which category the inspection is being carried out or, depending on what the officials find on the farm, will they be slotted into either the cross-compliance category or the animal identification and registration category? In her response last month, the Minister stated that in some circumstances more than one inspection may be unavoidable. Will the Minister give an example of what she has in mind?The information booklet published and circulated sets out the principal features of cross-compliance but the difficulty is in regard to the detail — many farmers are concerned that the devil is in the detail. In light of that and the suggested tolerance range in regard to tagging cattle, is it not discriminatory from the point of view that the less stock one has the higher the tolerance rate in respect of having stock not tagged? What are the implications for the sheep sector?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Under cross-compliance the rate of inspections is 1% but overall the inspection rate on animal identification and registration is 5%. We are trying to reduce the number of on-farm inspections to ensure there is only one farm visit and reduce the many difficulties that have arisen.With my officials I have had talks with the farming organisations for a considerable period on cross-compliance. Perhaps there is a little skulduggery taking place — I am not pointing to the Deputy this time——

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	249	——given the headlines people speak about in regard to dreaded inspections and so on. The bottom line is that the farming fraternity has been accustomed to inspections all its life and the majority of farmers have no problem with inspections. That will continue to be the case because they are working under the good farming practice which is almost equivalent to the new requirements.The tolerances were introduced on the basis of the penalties imposed at the time. Penalties have been reduced but the tolerances will remain. If one has a smaller herd it should be easier to look after the number of cattle and the number of tags. There has been much consultation on that issue and it has not been signed off completely. I hope to have it signed off in a final discussion with the farming organisations next week and a decision by me after that. What we are looking at is consultation, practical application and inspections. People forget that we are reducing the number of inspections considerably. Many of the reasons penalties were imposed on people were not related to inspections but the way in which they filled in their application form. There were minor errors, for example, with the wrong number on a tag.They do not have to do that now and retention periods are gone. I hope this will reduce the bureaucracy and some of the small things that happened.A great deal of work has been done on inspections. I have had discussions with the Department on training for the inspectors. I do not see the devil in the detail. We are aiming at single inspections per farm but more may be required if difficulties are apparent. There will not be a significant change in the methodology of inspection. People will be supported. I will review the matter on an ongoing basis.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The food labelling group, which was established in July 2002, presented its report in December 2002. Notwithstanding that food labelling is a particularly complicated and broadly based area, substantial progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations of the report. Nineteen of the 21 recommendations, many of which were beyond the remit of the Department and some of which were to be activated only after others had been completed, have been addressed. I hope the remaining two recommendations, which relate to aspects of origin labelling, can be implemented shortly.The two main issues that emerged from the recommendations of the labelling group related to the need to centralise enforcement in one agency and the definition of origin. In December 2002 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment had policy responsibility for the main legislation for the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, the Department of Health and Children was responsible for policy on other food labelling legislation, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was responsible for the policy on the labelling of fish and fish products, the Department of Agriculture and Food was responsible for policy on legislation covering the labelling of specific products ranging from beef, poultry and sugar to spirit drinks, coffee and fruit juices, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland was responsible for the enforcement of the beef labelling regulations and the health boards operated the controls on the other products under the general aegis of the Department.The position now, following implementation of the food labelling group recommendation, is that enforcement of all food labelling regulations has been centralised in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. This will not only streamline the enforcement measures but will also provide a one-stop-shop for any complaints on the mislabelling of food. As part of the centralisation of enforcement, the centralisation of food labelling policy, with the exception of fish, in both the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Agriculture and Food was undertaken in accordance with another recommendation of the food labelling group.There was full agreement within the food labelling group that consumers have a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat out. While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers' wishes in this area. The consumer liaison panel has carried out this research, the results of which were presented in December 2003.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.I am determined, in so far as it is within the powers available to me, to meet the wishes of consumers as identified in the research. Early in 2004, two regulations were introduced on the labelling of poultry meat. The first of these requires poultry meat, loose and prepackaged, originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises. The second requires information regarding class, price per unit weight, condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose poultry meat, non-prepackaged, to be provided to the consumer. In addition to the above-mentioned action, each sector is being reviewed on a commodity by commodity basis to identify any deficiencies from a consumer viewpoint in the labelling regulations for those commodities.In the beef sector, EU beef labelling regulations, which are extremely comprehensive, do not require beef sold in the food service outlets to have country of origin displayed. The European Commission published a review of these regulations at the end of April 2004. The report does not favour the extension of these regulations to the catering sector. However, I believe that consumers, whether they purchase beef in butchers' shops or supermarkets or opt for beef in restaurants and catering establishments, have the right to know the origin of the product and the labelling regulation should provide for this. It is my intention to proceed with a national legal requirement that country of origin must be displayed in respect of beef sold in such premises and outlets. The legal mechanisms to bring this into effect are under examination.On the food labelling issue in general, my primary aim is to protect consumer interests and to ensure that consumers are properly informed. Ireland is a major exporter of food and food products and there are also considerable imports, so it is imperative that the same standards are applied to the labelling of foods in every sector and that there is a level playing field for the food industry at all levels. In this context my Department has pursued assiduously the implementation in as full a manner as possible of the recommendations of the food labelling group. At a meeting of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 28 February this year the Minister indicated her views on labelling of foodstuffs and along with a number of member states, asked the Commission to examine how best food labelling should be handled at EU level to best protect the interests of the consumer.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I thank the Minister of State. I am not sure how many of these regulations have been implemented. The Minister of State said 19 had been addressed but that might be slightly different to implementing them.It is welcome that food labelling is broadly co-ordinated within one organisation because it was all over the shop prior to this. However, many issues remain outstanding such as a full listing of allergy-causing ingredients, foods purchased loose and misleading or ambiguous nutritional claims. What progress has been made on these issues?The issue of health claims attributed to foods must be dealt with. What is considered to be a healthy food? How does one interpret terms such as low fat, less than 1% fat and so on? What exactly do these terms mean and what progress has been made?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	252	Twelve of the recommendations have been implemented in full. Four are specific matters for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has raised the question of the origin and labelling of food, particularly in regard to food service outlets, with her colleagues at European level in the Council of Ministers. The Minister has consistently done this to best protect the interests of the consumer. Substantial work is ongoing in respect of the remaining recommendations. The Minister outlined yesterday the legal advice available to the Department on the further development of labelling of beef products. Legislation will be required, including an amendment to the Health Act 1970. Should there be any undue delay in bringing forward that proposed amendment, the Department of Agriculture and Food will consider if it is possible to bring forward primary legislation.This issue is the subject of ongoing discussions between the Tánaiste and the Minister and officials in both Departments. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has raised this issue in different fora available within the European Union. Our determination is to ensure the consumer has the widest available knowledge and information because we want to protect the consumer.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	253	The question of country of origin and origin of a product has been surrounded by fudge for a long time. It is important to remove the fudge factor so that the origin of products is clear and unambiguous. What is important for consumers is to be able to trace the origin of the food.I refer to a recent incident where an illegal dye was used in foodstuffs and which is virtually impossible to trace. The knowledge of the country of origin might not necessarily resolve that problem but if the origins of the foodstuff cannot be traced, this raises questions about the value of traceability.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	254	Another issue raised within the European Union is that of substantial transformation. This should be clearly defined and harmonised across all member states. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has raised this issue continually at meetings of the European Council of Ministers. It is an issue we are determined to address to ensure the widest possible information is available to the consumer in a simple manner, that labels are easy to identify and it is easy to interpret the relevant information.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I received the committee's report on 7 April and my officials are examining it. This report arises from an investigation by the committee of a complaint by a group representing retired farmers. My Department provided the committee with a comprehensive formal written response to the complaint and also attended a meeting of the committee in July 2003 to answer questions from members. The report covers a range of issues, including taxation issues, which are outside my remit. I will address the issues shortly in a formal response to the committee.I am naturally anxious that the early retirement scheme delivers maximum benefits to retired farmers. However this is an EU-funded scheme and I am constrained by the regulations under which it was introduced. The same group of retired farmers made an identical complaint to the European Commission which the Commission did not uphold. The Commission concluded, in other words, that the Department is administering the scheme correctly and in accordance with the governing EU regulations.The Department has recently conducted an expenditure review of the current early retirement scheme and copies were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 April. The expenditure review process was established by the Department of Finance in 1997 in the context of the strategic management initiative. The purpose of the review of the early retirement scheme is to analyse systematically whether the scheme is meeting its objectives and to inform future decisions regarding priorities on expenditure programmes. The Department's review includes a number of conclusions and recommendations that will help to inform my response to the report of the joint committee.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	256	Does the Minister of State agree the proposals of the joint committee are reasonable, if implemented would satisfy the issues raised by the people involved and that this could be done without going outside the relevant EU regulation? Does he agree those who entered the scheme did so in good faith and those who were not covered by the criteria governing the single farm payment should be given consideration for entitlements, either under force majeure or by some other means? Does he concur with the views expressed by the committee that it would be appropriate to address the fact that pensions awarded under the 2000 scheme are not index-linked and that this could be altered to ensure participants are given better security of income? Does the Minister of State intend to implement the proposal from the joint committee in full and, if not, does he concur with many of its recommendations?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	257	On the Deputy's last point, we could not concur with all the report's recommendations. However, the Department is formalising a response to the joint committee. A number of issues raised in the report simply cannot be addressed. The Deputy quite rightly raised the possibility of the indexation of payments which has been a source of concern to a large number of farmers. That issue has been raised repeatedly with the European Commission by the previous Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and myself. The European Commission has consistently rejected this approach on legal grounds.The Deputy mentioned force majeure and the national reserve. From an early stage in the negotiations leading up to introduction of the single payment scheme, the Department was conscious of the possible implication for retired farmers who had leased their holdings. The Department set out to ameliorate some of those difficulties. Participants in the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming who had retired before the reference period in 2000 are not in a position to claim entitlements under the single payment scheme. One concession that was negotiated by the Department with the European Commission will allow family members who take over a holding that was leased to third parties during the reference period to have access to entitlements from the national reserve. This will be of substantial benefit to family members of retired farmers who decide to take up farming.The Deputy also referred to the social welfare issues mentioned in the report. When the farm retirement scheme first became operative, the social welfare old age contributory and non-contributory pensions were not as attractive as they are today. That issue could not be addressed by the Department of Agriculture and Food. However, ongoing contact is taking place between officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food and officials from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. We are conscious of difficulties that have arisen for some people participating in the early retirement scheme. As the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, mentioned at yesterday's meeting of the Select Committee on Agriculture and Food, a broader analysis of the future of the early retirement scheme will be needed. She invited comments from committee members on the future operation of the scheme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	258	The Deputy will be aware that the consumer strategy group in its report, Make Consumers Count, which was published last week, has recommended that the groceries order be revoked in its entirety. Arguments for and against retaining the order are dealt with in detail in the report. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has announced a public consultation process and interested parties have been invited to make submissions on the future of the order over the next two months. My Department is giving careful consideration to the recommendation that the order be revoked in the light of any potential adverse impact on consumers or producers or suppliers of food and drinks products.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The Minister is saying that her Department has not carried out an assessment. Does the Minister not believe her Department should have carried out an assessment that could have formed part of the consideration of the group prior to publication of the report? Does the Minister not feel this has major implications for agriculture? Many farmers talk about the large discrepancies between farm-gate prices and what retailers charge. Significant margins are involved. Does the Minister not agree that the area needs to be reviewed and that the Department must take a decisive position on the matter and lead the debate rather than following the coat tails of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	260	Hear, hear.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I am glad to see the spirit on the other side of the House. The Department of Agriculture and Food is acutely aware of the issues surrounding the groceries order and, as I am sure the Deputy knows, many of the complaints of those involved in agriculture relate to products outside the ambit of the groceries order, fresh meat, fruit and vegetables in particular. Those involved in horticulture are anxious to see those form part of the groceries order. The order was introduced at the time the H Williams supermarket chain went into liquidation. The problem is that there is a significant diversity of views as to whether this order is doing what it should be doing.The Competition Authority maintains this is the only way to ensure competition. Given that the market share of many of the large retailers does not allow competition, we have a problem with the argument over the groceries order. The arrival of discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl provides competition and questions the necessity of the order. IBEC along with the IFA and other farming organisations have recommended to me that the groceries order should remain and have made good points in support of this. It is incumbent on us all to make a decision between the positions of the Competition Authority and the consumer strategy group as to whether there will be a change in consumer price and choice as well as in the existing farm gate prices. A complex and difficult decision must be made because of the diverse views on both sides.We have evaluated advertisements on a number of occasions within the Department on the basis of price structure, which is one of the major issues. I provided funding this year to the consumer group, which is part of the Department, to carry out a true, open and transparent assessment of costs of food in particular which is a major issue for people. We have evaluated it. IBEC, representatives of the agrifood industry and producers have concerns over the removal of the groceries order. In addition, others, most particularly those on the horticultural side, want their products within the scope of the order. Ultimately it will be a question of what is the right thing to do and we are asking people for their views as to which is the right way to go. Other issues outside the groceries order cause greater angst and concern, mostly regarding the market share of a number of very large supermarkets in the United Kingdom and here.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I accept the point the Minister made earlier on fresh fruit, vegetables and meat. However, is it not the case that more of our produce is going into processed food and novel foods, which the Minister is promoting, and the demand for convenience foods is growing? Many of these areas are included in the scope of the groceries order. Given that many of the farmers' margins on carcases are based on the sale of the more marginal or poorer quality cuts which go into many processed foods, is it not critical that the Department of Agriculture and Food should have a decisive position on the groceries order?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	263	In the main those associated with my Department are vehemently opposed to the removal of the groceries order. The farming organisations have not come to a particular decision on the issue and I will be interested to hear their opinions in due course in consultation with the Minister. The Deputy is right in saying that much food goes to the processing industry and many of our food companies have done well in the production of novel consumer and health foods. It is difficult to ascertain whether this warrants the removal of the groceries order based on the fact that many of those involved in food manufacturing, who are represented by IBEC, vehemently support the groceries order. Therein lies the problem. Ultimately it will be a political issue. People want to see reduced prices and farmers want a good return on their investment. Sometimes it is very difficult to balance the two.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	264	No prosecutions have taken place as a result of the feeding of meat and bonemeal to cattle since the introduction of the ban. No evidence has been uncovered which would support a prosecution in any case.I am satisfied, however, that the ban is being enforced, given that the incidence of the disease in the national herd is rapidly declining and that the vast majority of cases have occurred in animals born before the introduction of the enhanced feed controls in 1996 and 1997. In 2004, 126 cases of BSE were confirmed, compared with 182 in 2003 and 333 in 2002. There have been 27 cases to date in 2005, which represents a decrease of 57% on the number of cases discovered in the same period last year. The occurrence of some cases in animals born after 1997 does not detract from the overall positive trend and mirrors the position elsewhere.The introduction of the rapid testing programme for BSE in 2001 greatly improved the ability of countries to measure both the incidence of the disease in the national population and progress with regard to disease control. The results of that testing programme provide objective evidence that the enhanced feed controls introduced in Ireland in 1996 and 1997 have been very effective. Since 2001, well in excess of 1.5 million cattle born after 1997 have been tested for BSE, with just 12 cases of BSE identified in that category. The tiny fraction of positive tests which have occurred in animals born after 1997 shows that the risk for animals born after that time is very significantly reduced and that those cases are not associated with a systemic failure in the control programme.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The fact that there have been no prosecutions for breaking the law regarding animals born after 1996 that have been detected with BSE is of some concern. As recently as two weeks ago, the Minister will know, an animal born in 2001, five years after the ban was effectively meant to have been in place, was found to be infected — if we take 1997 as the relevant date, it is four years. That is a long time to allow people to become totally compliant. It is too much of a coincidence that we have even sporadic cases. I accept the positive trend in overall numbers, which is very welcome. However, there is a need for a very proactive stance regarding those people found to have animals in their herds with BSE born as recently as 2001.I would like to know what further positive actions might be taken to ensure that there are no further cases. I am aware that in the UK a special committee has been set up to look into the incidence of BSE in animals born after 1997. We may have to consider some positive and structured measure of that sort here to ensure that there are no more cases and that, if there are, we can find out why and be assured that the proper penalties are applied.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The question referred to the feeding of meat and bonemeal. There has been no evidence of that being an issue in any of the BSE cases. Prosecutions have taken place and are pending regarding other issues relating to BSE, but not for the feeding of meat and bonemeal, since that has not happened.Regarding the sporadic occurrences in animals born after the introduction of the ban, they are of concern to the Department. Extremely thorough investigations have taken place in the past few years. There have been eight cases of infected animals born after the 1997 ban. They have been thoroughly investigated and we have not been able to ascertain any definitive source of the disease in the individual cases. One or two issues were dealt with, but we prefer not to speak of them since court cases are pending in the near future. However, they were not connected with the use of meat and bonemeal.In the UK there have been approximately 100 cases; there have been eight here. There has been a massive reduction in the number of BSE-infected animals. I have been advised by the professionals that there will be sporadic occurrences. The Deputy can rest assured that if there is anything untoward or illegal, or which undermines the control systems, it will be dealt with as harshly as the laws allow. We conduct ongoing reviews regarding the investigations that have taken place in the past few years. If we were alarmed by a great increase in numbers, for example, it would be necessary to put a task force in place in the Department, but we do not believe that is the case at present.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Ireland was the first member state to opt for full decoupling of direct payments when, in October 2003, it was decided to introduce the single payment scheme with effect from 1 January 2005, the earliest date that the new regime could be implemented. The overshoot issue arises from transition from the animal-based to the decoupled system.Each member state has a regional beef ceiling for bulls and first-age premium animals, and Ireland's regional ceiling for the 2004 special beef premium scheme was 1,077,458 animals. It was expected that the numbers of animals submitted for premium in 2004 in Ireland under the special beef premium scheme would show an increase compared with previous years, as farmers would wish to benefit from the premium on their eligible animals before the scheme ended on 31 December 2004. However, the level of applications was such that the regional beef ceiling was exceeded by 18%.The decision to opt for full decoupling was arrived at following careful consideration of all options and a widespread public consultation process. A very persuasive factor in that process was the suggestion that farmers in those member states that decoupled fully would not be disadvantaged during the transitional period. The level of the overshoot of the regional ceiling is attributable to the ending of the special beef premium scheme in 2004, and application patterns, both in total numbers of animals applied for and the timing of lodging applications, strongly suggest that to be the case.I am seeking a solution to this issue and will continue to do so with the European Commissioner. I have already raised the issue with the Commissioner on a number of occasions. My Department has also forwarded a detailed submission to the European Commission dealing with the matter. I am urging that appropriate measures be put in place to alleviate the difficulties encountered by beef farmers in Ireland.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I thank the Minister for her response. Perhaps I might focus on the fact that the Minister claims to have raised this issue several times with the Commissioner. Why did she know nothing about it when the Commissioner was interviewed here? If the Minister had raised the matter on not only one but several occasions, surely, when the Commissioner arrived in Ireland, she would have been up to speed, but that does not seem to be the case from her interviews.The Minister stated that she is urging that appropriate measures be taken. Perhaps she will outline what she is talking about. When the Minister made the point to the Commissioner and explained to her the commitment given by her predecessor that Irish farmers would not lose out by opting for full decoupling, especially beef producers in this instance, what was her reaction? What is the Commission's position regarding that commitment?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The Deputy has described the issue regarding the Irish Farmers Journal incorrectly, since the Commissioner was asked about the question before I had approached her — interviews often take place before conversations. Second, she was not here, and that interview took place in Brussels. I have met the Commissioner three times on the issue and departmental officials have met at secretary general and director general levels, as well as within the Cabinet. I have met all the farming organisations on this issue, some of them twice, if not three times.The Deputy is right that something must be done, both for reasons of equity and because, as the former Commissioner said to the former Minister, there should be no disadvantageous decisions as a consequence of the transformation to a decoupled system. Those are the very strong points of view that I have put forward to the Commissioner and the Commission, and that has been followed through in several examples of its impact on farmers, many of whom, to be fair, have not changed much their production or methods. There are others who have done otherwise, as we all know.The Deputy will also know that the people on the second punch are being penalised because the scheme is an overall one between the first and second punches. In addition, many farmers did not castrate their animals this year because they were entitled to the bull premium. It is a very serious issue in my constituency and, I am sure, in County Roscommon, where there is a great deal of beef production. There is a 28% reduction on first-age premium animals and 23% on second-age animals. That is a very large differential. The Deputy is correct to point out that if decoupling did not occur, then we would not have this problem. On that basis, I have made strong representations to the Commission on this issue. This does not affect anyone under 25 and I have paid the money thus far to those over 25. The Deputy should check out a copy of the Irish Farmers’ Journal the following week where the Minister clarified this.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	270	The Minister met the Commissioner on three occasions. What did she say about the case the Minister put forward? Did she agree, disagree or did she express any opinion? By the time the Minister spoke to her on the third occasion, she surely must have checked out the situation.

Initially, the issue goes to the DG and its officials are also involved. I advised the Commissioner on the political ramifications of this issue. She has been in consultation with her own officials to look at this issue. I will speak to her again next Monday and I will impress upon her the necessity of a favourable decision on the basis of equity and due to decoupling.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The case the Deputy mentioned arose from a dispute between a company, the Department of Agriculture and Food and two codefendants. This related to the storage of tallow at its premises going back to 1997. A settlement was reached with the plaintiff on 6 December 2004. The settlement was agreed on the basis of legal advice from State counsel and with the sanction of the Office of the Attorney General. It was without admission of liability by the defendants. It was also agreed between the parties that the terms of the settlement would remain confidential except as required by law.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I thank the Minister of State for his response. How did the Department get it wrong? The Department defended this case but subsequently settled it out of court. Why did it proceed with the case if it got additional legal information from the State counsel? Did the sands shift during the case?What are the legal costs involved in proceeding as far as we did before a settlement was agreed? Why should this remain confidential when State funds are involved? It looks like the State and the Department of Agriculture and Food have been hung out to dry on this issue.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I do not accept that the Department got it wrong. A company initiated legal proceedings against the Department. I said at the outset that the terms of the settlement would remain confidential and that is how I intend to leave it. The taxing master has yet to determine the legal costs.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Is it not the case that the Department felt that it was on a strong footing when the initial challenge was taken? The Department was going to contest this vigorously right to the bitter end. On 6 December 2004, a settlement was suddenly reached. How did that come about? Why did the Department change its tack? The public needs to know the answer to that question, even if the Minister is not going to disclose the money that has been spent.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	276	The Department followed the legal advice available from the State counsel. That advice had the sanction of the office of the Attorney General.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I have some concerns about the confidentiality clause that seems to be built into this. The money spent is public money so it should not be confidential. The Department was willing to defend its position at the outset, yet suddenly an agreement was reached and the whole issue became confidential. Even though we do not know the amount involved, there is clearly a great amount of taxpayers' money involved.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The Department was not the only party to the proceedings. A company initiated the proceedings and another party was also involved along with the Department. The settlement occurred without admission of liability by the defendants, which were the Department and the company. The agreement reached included the stipulation that the terms of the settlement would remain confidential. That is how it will remain.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	284	The case had to take its course.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	285	There are insinuations from the other side of the House which are completely inappropriate, as well as scaremongering by members of the Fine Gael Party. I read an article written in a Drogheda based newspaper which was scurrilous and factually incorrect. Decisions must be made to proceed in some cases. As there was a third party involved in this case, it was not a direct case between my Department and another person. There should be finality to any case. Given the circumstances, the legal advice was that this was the best outcome for all. The decision was also taken in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. It is futile to spend time, energy, effort and money if we are not to bring a situation to an end. The decision made was the best one and I stand by it.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	286	Under the new single payment scheme farmers receiving direct aid are required to respect the various statutory management requirements set down in EU legislation on the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare, and plant health and to maintain the farm in good agricultural and environmental condition. There is also an obligation on the member state to ensure that there is no significant reduction in the amount of land under permanent pasture by reference to the total area under permanent pasture in 2003. These requirements are known as cross compliance.The EU directives and regulations referred to in cross compliance have been in place for many years. Producers are familiar with them and are complying with the standards set in implementing them in Ireland. The Department prepared a consultative document on cross compliance in October 2004 and invited views from interested organisations. Department officials met the main farming organisations in December to discuss their submissions and these discussions have continued more recently during the review of the protocol on direct payments.An information booklet on cross compliance has been issued to all farmers and it sets out the principle features of cross compliance such as the standards that must be met by farmers and the control arrangements that are necessary. To coincide with the issue of the booklet, a series of nationwide farmer information meetings took place in April and were organised by the Department in conjunction with Teagasc. These meetings focused not only on cross compliance but addressed the various other issues associated with the introduction of the single payment scheme. In implementing that scheme, I aim to minimise the number of inspection visits and to move towards a situation where eligibility and cross compliance checks will be carried out during a single farm visit. It is envisaged that the 22,000 inspections, which were carried under the old regime, will be significantly reduced to around 10,000 under the single payment scheme. This approach should minimise the level of inconvenience to farmers. However, in certain instances more than one inspection of a holding may be unavoidable.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I thank the Minister for her second reply on this issue. Will farmers be informed in advance of the category under which they will be inspected? Will they be inspected in regard to identification or under the single farm payment or will the category be decided by the inspectors when they arrive on site? We have been told that the majority of inspections in regard to cross-compliance, most of which will relate to the issues of permanent pasture and the areas claimed, can be done by satellite and will not require on-farm inspections. On this basis, why are we proceeding along these lines for on-farm inspections?The Minister raised the issue of tolerance. We have the indicators only in regard to cattle but what she has said is contrary to what has been indicated in the media in that tolerance levels are higher the smaller the number of animals. The more animals a farmer has, the lower the levels of tolerance. This seems to be contrary to what should be the case. The Minister spoke about clerical errors and so on. I understand that unless farmers have corrected any errors by 31 May, they will be in breach of the cross-compliance regulations. Does this mean, for example, that a person who omits his or her date of birth on the form will be in breach? How will an error such as this be treated?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	288	There has been no finality in our discussions on the protocol with the farm organisations but I hope they will conclude next week. As often happens, leaks from the committee appeared in newspapers. Although the substance of these leaks was incorrect, I could not do much about them once the newspapers had gone to print. I will make the paper publicly available once it has been agreed.Farmers will be notified but it will apply for 48 hours rather than the 14-day period which farmers had sought. The clerical errors to which I referred relate to the difficulties caused by the previous experience of the need to complete so many forms dealing with such issues as retention periods and so on. This caused significant anguish for many farmers and we are all acutely aware of this from our constituency work. The introduction of a single application form will greatly alleviate difficulties in this regard.I commend the farming organisations, farmers themselves, my Department and Teagasc on their tremendous efforts in support of the single farm payment scheme. Few mistakes were made and many people worked hard to get the system right and ensure applications were submitted on time. People have the opportunity to amend their applications up to the end of this month and anyone with concerns can contact the Department. I commend those involved on the forthrightness and exuberance they displayed in ensuring these forms were available and received on time by the Department.There has been much comment to the effect that these inspections will be different from what happened heretofore. They will be different to the extent that inspection was previously based on the number of stock but will now be based on one's land. Identification has not been a major issue. The cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, has worked well and people generally keep good records. I am introducing further technology to ensure people have access to their farm profiles, an issue previously raised by Deputy Naughten. This means farmers will be able to identify easily any mistakes that have been made in regard to their herds.All this will facilitate farmers in ensuring they get the payment to which they are entitled. I am not here to prevent people from getting their due but rather to ensure they do. There will sometimes be a personality clash at the gate. This is why I introduced training and is the reason the system will be kept under review. The first lot of inspections are taking place and that experience will be examined. The bottom line is that I must ensure people are paid in the first week of September and on the first day of December.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	294	Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including meat and meat extracts, as well as to imports of these products from third countries. Under harmonised legislation, a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the member states to ensure animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health. The application of these standards in the member states is monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU.It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in and trade between member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. To be approved as an exporter to the EU, a third country must appear on a list drawn up and updated on the basis of EU audits and guarantees given by the competent authority of the exporting country, have veterinary controls equivalent to those applicable in the EU, particularly in terms of legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, veterinary medicines controls, zoonoses controls and other food law, and have in place a residues programme approved by the European Commission.The animal products must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU-approved health mark. Exporting establishments must have standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments, effective control systems and supervision by the competent authorities, and traceability or labelling in accordance with the systems approved by the FVO and accepted and notified to the EU member states.The FVO carries out inspections to ensure only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country, approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country or the entire country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.Importers of animal products must be registered with the Department of Agriculture and Food. They are required to give advance notice of importation and, following import, are required to keep records of importation available for inspection by the Department for a period of three years.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Imported animal products must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing the country and approval number of the establishment of production and, in the case of meat and meat extracts imported from third countries, a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation.While there is free movement for trade within the EU, all consignments from third countries must first be landed at a border inspection post that has been approved by the FVO and must undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. These latter are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. In Ireland, BIPs approved for the processing of imports of animal products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport. The FVO carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state's BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into Europe provided under the harmonised legislation are correctly applied.Once it has been established that imported animal product has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the Community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established, they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.Where there are concerns with regard to the effectiveness of controls being operated in an approved third country, the Commission, in consultation with the Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain, may introduce specific controls by means of a safeguard measure to ensure the protection of human and animal health. Safeguard measures limiting or banning the export of animal products from EU countries or regions of countries may also be implemented where, for example, the conditions of an animal disease outbreak could seriously effect production and trade in animal products in the EU.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	295	What happens in reality if premises or countries do not come up to standards? In this context, will the Minister of State explain what has happened since last October in regard to Brazilian beef coming into the EU? Brazil abandoned its tagging and traceability scheme at that time. Does this mean Brazilian beef is no longer being imported into the EU?I have two difficult questions for the Minister of State in regard to the issue of substantial transformation and I hope he can provide the information I seek. This is an extremely difficult issue and it leaves Irish producers open to a challenge at some stage in the future in regard to products with an Irish label which may not have been sourced in this country and which do not meet the required standards. In this context, can the Minister of State outline the timetable for his proposed legislation on this matter? One must be aware that the Department of Health and Children may not be prepared to amend the Health Act 1970, given its reluctance to do so in the past in regard to other issues. How does the Department of Agriculture and Food propose to address the issue of substantial transformation within this State and subsequently to put those proposals forward at EU level?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	296	With the co-operation of the Department of Health and Children, it is hoped the necessary amendment to the Health Act 1970 can be progressed as quickly as possible. All Members know legislation does not come to the floor of the House as speedily as we would like. It is important that we get this legislation right. If there should be any delay in bringing forward the amendment to the 1970 Act, my Department will examine whether there is a quicker mechanism to bring the necessary primary legislation before the Oireachtas. Deputies Naughten and Upton spoke yesterday about the need to bring forward this legislation as quickly as possible. The Government is of the same view. We recognise the importance of adequate labelling for our industry and our citizens, and for consumers worldwide.Transformation was the final recommendation of the food labelling group. It was agreed that this should be clearly defined and harmonised across all European Union member states. No more than a month ago, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, raised this issue with her colleagues in the Council of Ministers and she has kept it on the EU agenda.I described the exacting standards of the export and import requirements as set out in EU legislation and regulations. The Food and Veterinary Office of the EU is responsible for ensuring that these standards are adhered to and implemented. If products are imported from areas which do not meet the relevant criteria, the right to import into the EU is removed and the products are banned.

Although detailed figures may not be available, I am interested to know whether sanctions are applied. Are spot checks conducted by the Food and Veterinary Office or is advance warning given? The inspector is similar to a teacher determining whether a student's homework is completed, and after he or she leaves upon being satisfied that matters are in order, the prevailing standard is restored until the next inspection two years later.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	303	As I outlined in my speech at the opening of the Teagasc biotechnology centre, my policy priority for the agrifood sector is to support the development of sustainable, competitive and multi-functional agricultural production and a food processing sector which is export oriented, innovative and consumer focused. To ensure this, agriculture and food research must provide a strong scientific foundation and capability to the farming and food sector. This requires a base of scientific excellence, knowledge and expertise all along the food chain. My Department is the primary funder for agrifood research encompassing primary production, food safety and new and innovative product and process development in the food industry. I am committed to building on the progress made to date in these areas and to strengthen agrifood research activity to meet the challenges that lie ahead.Opportunities exist for the food industry in the areas of consumer foods, functional foods and beverages, food ingredients and speciality foods. Health concerns are now a major influence on consumers, and functional foods, that is, food for health and pharma-foods, are forecast to become key drivers of growth within the sector. The well-being and vibrancy of our agrifood industry is heavily dependent on being continually and rapidly responsive to emerging consumer demand. Without investment in research and development, Ireland's food industry will be outstripped and outpaced by others who already possess the necessary research capability to meet these demands.The substantial state investment in internal company research and technology transfer has driven and supported the research and development agenda within food companies. These supports, together with tax incentives to encourage research and development, demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to the innovation agenda. Irish food companies, for their part, have encompassed the innovation challenge and are increasingly focused on accelerating their research and development activities to meet the growth opportunities. I welcome the fact that a number of leading food companies are engaging with Enterprise Ireland in advancing significant innovation and research and development projects which are market led.The investment made in public good food research since 1994 has created a critical mass of expertise and capacity which has equipped Irish researchers with internationally respected capability. This investment is continuing under the NDP food institutional research measure which to date has provided funding of over €50 million for food research by public research institutes to support the food industry and underpin food safety.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Such research programmes are essential to promote innovation, new product development and competitiveness in the agrifood industry and underpin the maintenance of the highest standards in food quality, safety and nutrition. A well resourced research infrastructure and good national competitive programmes also provide Irish researchers with the capacity to compete for funding in EU framework and other international programmes.Teagasc, the agriculture and food development authority, has responsibility for the provision of research training and advisory services for the agrifood sector. The Teagasc statement of strategy sets out a new vision for its research service, of which a major part is the expansion of research on food and health, as well as ensuring competitiveness of the agricultural sector through cost reduction technologies and sustainable production systems. Part of this expansion is the new alimentary pharmabiotic centre at Moorepark, which is a development between Teagasc, Moorepark, UCC and industry to conduct research at the interface of food, pharmacology and health. Funding by my Department has contributed significantly to this centre. The centre possesses international expertise in biotechnology and probiotic technology and addresses one of the key recommendations of the agrivision 2015 foresight exercise in developing a strategic alliance between the Irish food and bio-pharmacy industry. Furthermore, the Moorepark biotechnology centre, which represents an investment of approximately €6 million since 2000, offers enormous scope and potential to companies which wish to engage in the challenge of research and development and the substantial rewards it offers.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I thank the Minister for her reply, which contains all the appropriate buzzwords, such as innovation, nutritious foods and pharma-foods. However, the reality is that we lag slightly behind Europe and significantly behind the United States and Japan in terms of the percentage of GDP invested in research. In the future, these countries will be important competitors. What actions may be taken to ensure more investment in research and development, particularly in the food area?It is important that there is interest and investment by the food industry in food research, and that should be encouraged and promoted. I am concerned to ensure such valuable research becomes widely available and is not contained within the food company. A broad and widely available research base should exist for research programmes.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Deputy Upton tapped into the intellectual issue, which is of great concern and on which there has not been much agreement. Moorepark and the universities have conducted a lot of public good research, in particular under the FIRM programme, which will be available to all. I agree that driving research and development within the food industry is paramount if we are to compete. Large companies have been in a position to make investments. Moorepark provides access to its facilities, particularly to smaller companies. Perhaps we will all have an opportunity to visit the centre. Recently, I had the opportunity to open a new centre, which is second to none and is more than helpful in addressing the issue of supporting personal and public good research.Public good research under the FIRM and other programmes will be important from the broad intellectual perspective. Equally, however, it will be incumbent on companies to conduct research. Enterprise Ireland and my Department have supported investment in a number of companies. Deputy Upton is correct that we must increase our investments in research. The Government has brought a number of Departments together to ensure that we reach our capacity.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	306	On the rights issue raised by Deputy Upton, has the Minister investigated the strategies of the other big players in the United States and Japan? China's research and development budgets have gone through the roof, with significant implications. We are lagging behind not only the US and Japan but dramatically so in the case of China. Greater investment should be made at EU level. We need to examine the rights issue and events in other countries.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	307	Considerable investment has been made, through Teagasc, in research. For example, investment for non-capital purposes was €118.5 million and for capital purposes, €4.5 million. Much work has been done in food research. Teagasc employs 200 scientists in nine centres. I had the opportunity in the United States to discuss the issue of intellectual property. We are prepared to look as favourably as possible on the necessity of increasing our investments. However, we also need to drive that agenda within the food industry.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	308	Like Deputy Upton, I was impressed by the number of buzzwords used by the Minister. I did not, however, hear the term "import substitution", which one finds is often missing from Government policy statements. Will the research and development to which the Minister referred address the failure to exploit the full potential of the organic sector? In a €35 million sector, 70% of product consumed domestically is imported while the last five years have seen a fall in organic acreage. Is there a case for research and development to improve technology and organic methodology to increase production and advance import substitution to exploit potential of the type the Minister pointed to in other sectors?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	309	My Department does not usually talk about import substitution as Ireland is a significant exporter of its food and drinks products.

The price of organic produce, which we have all discussed, is high because a great deal of it is imported. We acknowledged at a committee meeting yesterday that there is nothing more organic than our grasslands and domestic methods of production. There has been significant investment in support of organic food through education and research through my Department, which provides substantial funds, and Leader companies. We have brought together quite a number of people and initiated a specific REPS programme for organic producers who are the only group in the scheme given special treatment.I am prepared to drive the organic agenda forward as quickly as possible as I agree that there is a need for greater urgency. We will take the opportunity presented by the steering group to make further progress as I am not happy with the return on the investment we have made to date.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 33 and 46 together.The House will be aware that it is an offence, punishable at the discretion of the courts by imprisonment for a term of six months or a fine not exceeding €3,000, or both, to import, place on the market or use a plant protection product which has not been registered. The regulatory system is designed to ensure a high level of protection for man, animals and the environment. While products included on the register are made available to end-users by a large number of distributors, distributors and farmers are free to source products from elsewhere provided they are registered in Ireland and subject to approval of their importation in each instance from my Department. The approval process for parallel imports involves simple checks to ensure the products to be imported are the same as those registered for use in Ireland and are appropriately labelled.The enforcement programme involves routine and targeted inspections at the premises of wholesale and retail distributors and end users. Recent reports of illegal importation of plant protection products are being investigated. Where illegal products are found on the market, they are seized and subject to destruction at the owner's expense. Operators may also be subject to prosecution and fines up to €3,000 or six months imprisonment.

Can the Minister of State provide the House with a little more information on the steps being taken to address the matter?There are indications that the pesticide control service does not have adequate powers to ensure thorough investigations can take place. It is claimed that the service does not have the power to enter a premises without the approval of the owner. Are there plans to amend legislation to provide ease of access to premises to carry out inspections?

I understand from the Department of Health and Children that some personal social services, such as residential care, are covered in existing health legislation. Any further expansion of the scope of such provisions by defining "personal social services" would be more appropriately dealt with in the existing legislation. It is not, therefore, proposed to accept the amendment.

In page 10, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:"‘needs officer' shall be construed in accordance with section 7 and section 10. Each subsequent reference to ‘assessment officer’ and ‘liaison officer’ in this Act shall be construed as references to ‘needs officer’;”.

In page 11, line 27, after "request" to insert "without undue delay".Amendment No. 46 is very important in the context of the significance of delays in the provision of services to people with disabilities. We cannot allow circumstances to continue to exist in which families must wait for services. People are directly affected. The whole ethos of the legislation must be looked at very seriously.On the broader issue of the Bill, I would like the Minister to take on board a number of points, especially in regard to the amendments. This will be our last opportunity to present changes to the legislation. I would like to see a clear and unequivocal right to an assessment of need that would not be resource dependent. I would also like the services identified in the assessment of needs for an individual to be provided within a reasonable and agreed time frame. In addition, I seek that the Bill would provide for the protection of disability specific resources and that the provisions regarding sectoral plans would take account of the wider needs of people with disabilities. Each Department concerned with relevant services should also provide a sectoral plan. The Bill should impose a statutory duty on all Departments and public bodies to include people with disabilities in their plans and services with appropriate monitoring and accountability. I wished to return briefly to those issues.Regarding amendment No. 46, if the Minister were to accept the amendment it would add teeth to the legislation and would give it strength.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I support the amendment. It is important to include a time scale as it would provide a sense of urgency. Adding a time scale to the subsection would strengthen it and it would not change things unduly.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I am unaccustomed to retorting to a Second Stage speech on Report Stage. I do not know how Deputy McGrath got away with that. The sectoral plans were a matter of discussion. A number of strategic Departments will be involved in sectoral plans. The Department of Education and Science will have a separate one. It would be ludicrous if my Department had a sectoral plan. It would not be particularly worthwhile in this context, except in regard to my employment sector, which comes under the remit of the Department of Finance.Section 9(5) requires the Health Service Executive to commence an assessment within three months of the date of application and to complete it without undue delay. If the National Council for Special Education is to comply with the request — section 8(3) obliges it to do so — the council must act within these time frames. I am concerned that if I were to accept amendment No. 46 which appears to give reasonable leeway to the council the time frame given to it might become a factor for delay. The section as published requires compliance without qualification and it is the preference of the Minister to maintain that situation. I see where the Deputy is coming from, but sometimes in legislation if we tie ourselves into a time frame it can cause a delay as opposed to where one does not have a specific instruction. The spirit of what the Deputy advocates in the context of the legislation is reflected in the sections to which I referred.

Amendment No. 52 is an alternative to amendment No. 51a. Amendment No. 56 is an alternative to No. 55. These amendments will be discussed together by agreement.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I move amendment No. 49:
In page 12, lines 3 to 8, to delete all words from and including "considered" in line 3 down to and including "provision" in line 8 and substitute the following:"listed in order of importance, which are considered appropriate by the person or persons referred to in subsection (2) to meet the needs of the applicant and the period of time required by the person or persons for the provision of each of those services and the order of such provision, giving preference to services which are most needed by the applicant”.Grouping the amendments in this way makes it easier for us to follow them and makes life much easier. There is a concern that when the service statement is drawn up, services are not compiled in order of priority of need. The liaison officer then has to find out what can be provided. The amendment is similar to the wording in the Bill except that it would provide for the services to be listed in order of importance. It is preferable that the service most urgently required would be granted as soon as possible. That makes sense and it does not affect the general thrust of the Bill. The service statement is important. I am asking that this statement would list the services required in order of importance. That is the only difference this amendment would make, which is reasonable. Otherwise a person might get a service they may not need as urgently. The Minister should consider this provision, which is important and will not make a major change to the legislation.Other Deputies who are well able to speak on them have tabled amendments Nos. 51 to 56, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 58 and 59. I will come in later on them.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The grouping includes amendments Nos. 51 to 56, inclusive. Amendment No. 51 is straightforward and offers a more concrete wording by the substitution of "shall" for "may". This will ensure that the matter is not open to discretion, and that it shall happen. The Minister will make provision for what is sought in amendment No. 51 and I shall withdraw amendment No. 52 on that basis. I wish to clarify whether it will apply to all other areas where that kind of terminology is used. I assume that if it is done in one section it will be done in all others.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	332	That is not clear.

It relates to the language and the attitude involved. I appreciate the Minister taking that on board and changing the terminology for how consultations would be notified rather than the present wording that virtually commands people to appear before an assessment officer.

I also wish to speak on the two amendments I have co-sponsored, Nos. 55 and 59. Deputy Stanton has already outlined the reason for the amendments. We are seeking to incorporate the principle of a continuous review and the prioritisation of service provision because that is what the various groups sought so that, at the very least, the services most urgently required would be first delivered as the Bill does not guarantee as of right that people's needs will be addressed. The amendments fall short of enshrining the principle of progression in regard to needs that are not met. In the confines of what is being presented to us, we are trying to put in place a mechanism that will allow for prioritisation. My preference is for an unqualified right to an assessment of need. This will not happen, as outlined by the Minister of State in his response to this subject on Second and Committee Stages.Amendments Nos. 55 and 59, which I have tabled, propose to delete the clauses in section 8(1)(b) and (c) which would permit an assessment officer not to inform a person with a disability of the purpose of an assessment interview and not to ensure that the person with a disability is given adequate information relating to the process and the results of the assessment. The rationale for this according to the Minister of State is that the provision of such information may, in some cases, be prejudicial to the applicant’s mental health, well-being or emotional condition or inappropriate having regard to the age of the applicant or the nature of his or her disability.The rationale behind the provisions is indicative of the Government's patronising medical approach to people with disability. This contrasts with the rights-based approach which the Opposition, the DLCG, the Human Rights Commission and many others who made submissions are advocating. The clauses we seek to delete are offensive and retrograde in the extreme. We cannot continue to regard people with disabilities as dependants to be protected and cared for. They are equal citizens; hence the selection of the title of the document, Equal Citizens, for which people had great hope. People with disabilities have the right to be informed of matters that concern them directly.I accept the way information on the assessment is imparted may need to be customised to make it accessible, but it is fundamentally wrong to argue that any Health Service Executive employee should have discretionary power to withhold information concerning a person with a disability from that person because the employee is of the opinion that the person cannot take it. These provisions are a throwback to the bad old times and run counter to the principle of informed consent. They should be removed.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	335	The Government's amendment No. 51a refers to procedures for interviews. Deputy Lynch has withdrawn her amendment, which reflects the language issue to which she adverted. The change in the language of the subsections is so the assessment officer will meet the applicant rather than ask the applicant to attend for interview. People would be happy with that.Amendment No. 53 proposes a further variation to the text by requiring that the assessment officer would attend before the applicant. It is considered that this proposal is primarily concerned with the location of the meeting and that details of this nature are not really appropriate to legislation. It would not be appropriate, therefore, to accept the amendment.Having listened with interest to the Deputies raising a number of points relating to the participation and involvement of the applicant in the assessment process, I noted that this is an important topic. We are all obliged to get the balance right. The detailed provisions in section 8(7) and (8) seek to do that and were prepared in light of proposals made in the consultation process and on the advice of the Department of Health and Children.Amendment No. 49 would require assessment reports to contain a prioritised list of services. The principle in the Bill is that the report would set out all required services and indicate in itself the order for their provision, together with the optimum timescale for their delivery. I do not know if the amendment would improve any arrangements for assessment and service delivery.Amendment No. 51 would require an assessment officer to carry out an interview in all cases. It is desirable that some discretion regarding procedures remain with the assessment officer so individual circumstances in each case can be considered. I am not disposed to accepting this amendment.Amendment No. 54 proposes to require the applicant to comply with any reasonable requirement of the assessment officer for information. This amendment is not necessary because, under section 8(8)(a), as it stands, the assessment officer is only empowered to seek information that he or she may reasonably request.Amendments Nos. 55 and 59 cover procedures for assessment interviews. The amendments would remove a provision designed to cater for the assessment of a small number of individuals. The provision allows the assessment officer discretion in deciding if the applicant should be told the purpose of the assessment interview or about other information related to the assessment. This takes account of circumstances where particular sensitivity may be required, for example, in the case of someone with a severe intellectual disability or the case of a child where potentially disturbing information or a potentially disturbing information prognosis falls to be given. It is inappropriate to state, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh does, that we are removing a right because there are particular circumstances in which certain information would not be in the best interest of the person being assessed. We could remove the discretion to exercise sensitivity but the Deputy will appreciate that it is often very important. The assessment is an individual matter and tying the assessment officer in knots would represent a retrograde step.Amendment No. 56 would require the assessment officer to form a reasonable opinion of whether the giving of any information to a person with a disability would be prejudicial to the individual's well-being. I am concerned that the interpretation of what is reasonable may vary widely. The Deputy has not provided a definition or otherwise provided a yardstick to measure what is reasonable. By contrast, the provision as it stands is grounded on a verifiable reality of opinion. In the circumstances, I am not disposed to accept the amendment.On Committee Stage, section 8(8)(c)(i) was amended to require that note be taken of the views of the applicant in the assessment process. Amendment No. 58 envisages an additional requirement that a written note be taken of these views. I am satisfied that the text of the provision as drafted envisages a written record of the views of the applicant on his or her needs and preferences regarding services. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	336	On amendment No. 49, there is no link between the assessment report prepared without regard to the cost of or the capacity to provide any service identified as being appropriate to meet the needs of the person and the subsequent service statement specifying the health services or education to be provided. As it stands people may never receive certain services outlined in their assessment report. The alternative would be for the assessment report to list services required in order of importance and timeframes for accommodating needs. It should be feasible to work out what would be possible over a period and make provision for an annual review. The Minister spoke about services being listed or provided in order of importance but there seems to be no reference to this in the Bill. I do not know what difference it would make except to give priority to certain services that would be required urgently.The Government objects to reasonable amendments by the Opposition. It seems to be engaged in negotiations. I wonder whether we should close the Oireachtas altogether and run the country by negotiation with social partners and other groups. Why are we here in the first place? Deputies seem to have no input into legislation such as this. They are the last people to be consulted and are treated with disdain by Ministers. Where is the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey? He is responsible for taking this Bill but he is not present. He was late this morning and late on the previous occasion on which we dealt with the Bill. What is going on? We have received no explanation as to where he is. Although my amendment is important, I wonder if we are wasting our time. The Minister just reads out a piece of paper and does not even consider the amendments.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	337	Having nearly 20 years of experience and having been involved in advocacy when this discussion was taking place, I am as competent as anybody else to deal with legislation in this House. I was very much involved in the Cabinet sub-committee review of disabilities. As a person, no more than Deputy Finian McGrath, who has a child with disability I have both a personal and political view in terms of ensuring this legislation is brought to fruition as quickly as possible. Equally, I want to ensure that the best possible job is done by Members of the House.Often the Government can empathise with the Opposition's concerns. With complicated legislation, often legitimate concerns, such as those contained in this amendment, are reflected within the legislation as it stands. Section 8(7)(b)(iii) has the timeframe for the delivery of the service and the order of such a provision. That is encompassed in the legislation per se. The liaison officer must take account of the Department in preparing service statements and their order of importance will be directed within the legislation as it stands. What is being sought is in the legislation under section 8(7)(b)(iii).

The provision requires the assessment officer to endeavour to ensure that such participation takes place. The proposed amendment would oblige the assessment officer to ensure this sort of involvement by the applicant and effectively leave the officer responsible for the communication of other people involved in the assessment process. I do not believe this is a reasonable approach. Section 10 provides for standards to apply to the assessment process and places the responsibility on the HSE to ensure that they are applied. I believe that the issues involved are adequately covered by standards to be made under section 10 and I do not propose to accept this amendment.

In page 13, line 2, after "person")" to insert "has or".This section deals with an application for assessment. It is just as well the House has been dealing with this Bill for a long time. Someone reading it for the first time would be completely confused. Certain sections of it do not gel. For example, section 9(1)(a) says:Where—(a) a person (“the person”) is of opinion that he or she may have a disability, or.My amendment inserts the words "has or" so that the wording says that a person has or is of the opinion that he or she has a disability. I do not believe having a disability is a matter of opinion. One either has a disability or one does not. I do not know anyone with a disability who would either like to have one or is of the opinion that they have one. I do not know where that language comes from. It is just like the language in the phrase "shall attend before the assessment officer for interview". I cannot understand it. It is to form an opinion whether one has a disability. Surely this cannot be right. Clearly, for the majority of people in that category the issue is not one of opinion but of fact.Previously we discussed the "trust me" element, so to speak, of this legislation. Either one is covered by the legislation or one is not. Legislation is about absolutes. Sometimes we get the absolutes wrong and we have to revisit them, but it should not be a matter of opinion, and that is what the amendment is about.Amendment No. 62 relates to section 9(1)(b) which states “a specified person (“the person”) is of that opinion in relation to another person and the person considers that by reason of the nature of that other person’s disability or age he or she or is likely to be unable to form such an opinion”. I know what that means but this is about the language used. The amendment proposes to delete the words “form such an opinion” and substitute the phrase “make application under this section”. The subsection would still have the same effect but there would be a better use of language. We are supposed to be drafting legislation that is understandable to everyone who might read it. Surely it makes sense for the Minister of State to accept these amendments. They will not impose a charge on the Exchequer or give rise to offence. Some of the language in the Bill is quite offensive.

It might be difficult at times to consider whether another person can form an opinion. Even if a person is unable to form an opinion, he or she may be unable to make an application due to physical impairment. If a person is unable to form an opinion, it is likely that he or she cannot make an application. A person may be unable to make an application because of a disability preventing him or her from physically doing so, even if that person can form an opinion.The two amendments put forward by Deputy Lynch are useful, valid and represent an improvement on the wording in the section. I urge the Minister of State to accept them.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	354	Section 8 deals with the parameters for applying for an assessment of need. Section 9(1)(a) provides that a person who is of opinion that he or she may have a disability may make an application for assessment. Amendments Nos. 61 and 114 seek to include a person who has a disability as well as a person who is of the opinion that they have a disability. The current text is inclusive of such persons as someone with a disability will also be of the opinion that they have a disability. I do not propose, therefore, to accept amendments Nos. 61 and 114.In regard to amendment No. 62, section 9(1) describes two circumstances where applications for assessments may arise. One is where a person considers that he or she has a disability and where he or she may make an application. The other is where the person is unlikely to be able to form the opinion that he or she has a disability and another person applies on his or her behalf. The provision, as drafted, means that the decision on applying for an assessment rests with the applicant unless the applicant is unlikely to appreciate the need for an assessment. This is consistent with the focus on the individual's needs that underlines the approach to assessment in the Bill. I am not sure that the proposed amendment would improve the approach being taken and for these reasons I do not propose to accept amendment No. 62.

I listened carefully to what he said and I believe he is of the same opinion as me, both of us being at liberty to form opinions. If I have a disability, it is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of fact. It should not be up to myself or someone else to form an opinion as to whether I have a disability. That is what I thought this legislation involved. The definition in this respect is restrictive but clear. Why the Minister of State is leaving this section so open in terms of this matter being down to another person's opinion is beyond me.I am not a great expert on legislation but I would have thought it is about absolutes. Why would the Minister of State leave this matter open to opinion? Does he consider it possible for a person who does not have a disability to suddenly decide that he or she may have one? Does he believe that is how people think?

The Minister of State is saying one does not know that one has a disability until someone tells one that one has a disability and yet one will have gone for an assessment. Why would one do that? Is the Minister of State indicating that a person who does not believe he or she has a disability would apply for an assessment and suddenly be informed that he or she has a disability because he or she applied for that assessment? Is he saying that it is during an assessment that such disability will come to light and that a person will suddenly discover, have had no notion beforehand, that he or she is blind, has a hearing impairment, cannot walk or is intellectually restricted?

In page 13, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:"(e) a carer or family carer.”.This is a simple amendment. It is also logical and I would not table it if it was not, although so far logic has defied the Minister of State. In this amendment, I propose that the words "a carer or family carer" be included in the descriptions of persons who may apply to the executive for an assessment or for an assessment in regard to a specific need or a particular service identified by him or her. I seek the inclusion of "a carer or family carer" as a category because the carer maybe a person other than a spouse, parent, relative, guardian, legal representative or personal advocate. While I accept that many of the 150,000 family carers who save the State an estimated €1.6 billion per year by providing over 3 million hours of work in the home each week may be covered by the provisions in section 9, there are some people who will not be covered by the four categories. If the Minister of State does not accept this amendment, section 9(1)(b) would, effectively, restrict the types of carers recognised for the purpose of this legislation. For example, people with disability who have same sex or even opposite sex long-term partners as their carers will be virtually excluded by virtue of the term “spouse” instead of “partner”. The Government will be discriminating against not only gay and lesbian people with disability but others in long-term cohabiting relationships.This provision also discriminates against people with disability who, for whatever reason, have no family member or legal guardian to care for them and who may be cared for by another person. That is wrong and the Government should take this amendment on board and recognise the case I make.Will the Government recognise the insult felt by carers due to the failure of the Bill to explicitly mention them, their role and contribution? The Carers Association has objected to the Bill as formulated since it gives no recognition to the role of carers as part of the service delivery change. Even at this stage, will the Minister of State consider including such a reference and giving recognition to different relationships?

It is an important amendment because it deals with the carer or the family carer. This is an opportunity to pay tribute to the many carers and commend and thank them for their fantastic work. It is essential that they are respected, that their voices are heard and that they are given the maximum financial support. This is an important part of the debate.Another important issue which has come up is children as carers in the family unit. There must be supports for children whose parents have a physical disability and who are directly involved in the day-to-day care of, and providing assistance to, their parents. There are many such children in this State who are doing an excellent job and it is up to us to ensure they are given the maximum support.At times it can be very difficult to care for an adult child with an intellectual disability. It ranges from extreme stress and hardship on some families to mild stress on others. Caring for a young adult with a severe intellectual disability can be very difficult and tiring at times. It is up to us, as legislators, and to the Government, the people in power, to ensure these carers and family carers are given the maximum support. I strongly support this important amendment tabled by Deputy Ó Snodaigh because it recognises and values the carer and the family carer.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The categories of persons identified in subsection (2) are readily identifiable and would generally be regarded as having a legal standing. To include a carer or family carer who is not also a relative, guardian, legal representative or personal advocate could be problematic. It would not be clear to the HSE what responsibilities such a person was willing or entitled to take in relation to an assessment or related services. The existing provision covers the circumstances where an applicant would require a representative.Furthermore, any consideration of including other people to act on behalf of the applicant might best be dealt with by regulation under section 21. The point made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh can be considered in that context. If a person wished to have his or her carer nominated as his or her personal advocate, it would be covered by the Bill.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	374	What the Minister of State said is all well and good. If he took on board the point I made and changed the word "spouse" to "partner", there might be some logic to what he said. I understand there might be problems in regard to carers in paid employment who would not necessarily have any long-term tie with the person for whom they care.The last point the Minister of State made was that the majority of people with disability would be capable of making the case that somebody should legally represent them. What happens if somebody in a long-term relationship is in a car crash which leaves him or her severely disabled and unable to communicate? Who would act as his or her legal guardian? He or she would not be able to say his or her long-term partner should make decisions for him or her. I was trying to cover such a situation in the amendment. Perhaps it might be achieved by changing the word "spouse" to "partner" in recognition of the fact that there are gay, lesbian and other couples as well as married couples who are in long-term cohabiting relationships. There are moves to give greater recognition to such relationships and this would be a step in that direction.Elderly people who have become disabled over time are often looked after by carers who make decisions for them, bring them their meals and ensure household bills are paid. These carers take over a role which in other relationships would be that of the wife, husband, mother, father or whatever. They do not have a legal standing under this legislation. The Minister of State is correct that they can apply to become the legal representative of the person for whom they care, but would it not be easier to accept the amendment?
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	375	In regard to carers, it is important to put on record that there have been advances. For example, the budget provided for improvements in social welfare payments to people with disability and their carers. A €14 increase was provided for those in receipt of the disability allowance, increasing the maximum weekly payment to €148.80. For those not in receipt of the disability allowance who are in full-time residential care, the Government has introduced a €35 per week personal payment which starts in June, next week. It is important to acknowledge that. The respite care grant which is paid annually in June has been extended to include carers who are not in receipt of carer's allowance, carer's benefit or the domiciliary care allowance. All full-time carers are now eligible to apply provided they do not work more than ten hours a week outside the home or are not in receipt of unemployment benefit. The person for whom they care must need full-time care.The grant is automatically paid to those in receipt of carer's allowance, carer's benefit, prescribed relative's allowance, domiciliary care allowance and constant care allowance. The application for the respite care grant should be made to the disability service manager in one's local health board area. This begins in June 2005 and the grant has been increased to €1,000.There have been steps in the right direction and part of the purpose of this debate is to move us forward. It is important to acknowledge that some major improvements have been made. The carers and families involved appreciate that and it is important that they know that their campaigning has had some effect. We have not won but they have made an impact. I urge the Carers Association and the disability groups to continue fighting hard.

In page 13, line 25, to delete "may" and substitute the following:"shall, unless an assessment has been or is being otherwise carried out,".This is a straightforward amendment which clarifies the position because it is possible that an assessment could be carried out somewhere else or be in process somewhere else, for example, under the Health Act 2004, or the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.

To paraphrase the saying that one has only one chance at life, a person with a disability must ensure that there are no delays or hiccups in life.I received a letter from 200 parents in Waterford which is relevant to this amendment. They informed me that 4,403 people in County Waterford have disabilities and the number in Waterford city is 3,836. A total of 222 persons aged between one and 14 in the county have disabilities, which 5% of the total population in that age group. At present 273 children are on waiting lists for speech and language therapy. These are the Health Service Executive figures for 2005.It is unacceptable that these children must wait for speech and therapy services. The longer they wait, the greater the damage to them. In my experience it is necessary to start early and sign up for services for children with disabilities. This is particularly so in the area of speech and language therapy where it is possible to work wonders. There have been major developments for children who have benefited from this early intervention. Some of those who have benefited came from well-off families who were able to pay for the services. We should not discriminate against children from disadvantaged families and ignore their plight.Although I represent Dublin North-Central, an urban area, I wish to raise an issue mentioned by these parents. They refer to the lack of services for children in rural areas as discrimination. There is less inclusion in rural than urban areas. The centralised urban services sometimes entail social exclusion of children with disabilities and their families in rural communities. I support these parents on this point. It is bad enough to have to fight for services for their children with disabilities without having to experience the added problem of discrimination in a rural area or away from the geographical centres of services.All Members should support these parents. Children with disabilities may not have a voice or a vote but their parents, particularly the 200 who have written to me, have a vote and a voice and that will be articulated in the Dáil where, I hope, the Minister of State and the Government will listen to it. I urge Members to support amendment No. 117.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I support these amendments which are important pressure points. As this is not a rights-based Bill, these amendments can give people some comfort. To understand what difference this Bill will make when it is passed, one must look at the individual services on which it will make an impact. I was pleased that the Minister of State accepted the point on developing areas and undertook to examine it more closely.There are other areas which serve to highlight the problem of delays and how they affect people. For example, an interdepartmental group in 1998 concluded its deliberations on the tax exemption for people with disabilities to have a car and thereby live fuller lives. The interdepartmental group recommended a change in the restrictive criteria for the primary medical certificate. There are approximately 600 people waiting to appeal a decision of rejection for this tax exemption. The average waiting time is three years. One would need to be an amputee to qualify for this exemption. People who have had a stroke or who have multiple sclerosis can do well and gain independence if they qualify for the exemption. This is an example of how the delay in making a decision affects a group of people whose level of dependency is increased by the failure to decide. When I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance specifically on the criteria asking when it might be relaxed and if he was considering it, the bottom line was that the Minister would consider the report on an ongoing basis in the overall budgetary context having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme. That is what concerns all of us because the difference lies in that being changed. There are 600 people waiting but not all will qualify. I am certain there are people who apply for this and do not get it for good reason but there are others who require it. The Minister informed me that 17% of those who appeal win their appeal. The problem is that the average wait is three years, which a stroke victim or an MS sufferer does not have. That underlines the importance of having something within a specified time frame. That may not be the absolute example but it gives an indication of the pressure point.How will the embargo work having regard to the administration that is to be set up under the Bill? If that is to be taken into consideration and there are approved additional people in administration, will that impact negatively on the front line therapy or other services that make a direct difference to people?

That will be done by those already involved in that activity but obviously there will be different roles so there should not be a problem in that respect.Amendment No. 64 seeks to compel employees of the Health Service Executive to apply for an assessment of a person who appears to have a disability. Section 9(4) allows officers of the Health Service Executive to seek an assessment on behalf of a person. This provision would cover a small number of cases where people did not have a relative or guardian to act for them and were not able to act for themselves. It is appropriate that the Health Service Executive is given the discretion to consider an individual's circumstances in each case. Perhaps the Deputy would explain further what she wants in addition because I did not quite understand the point she was making.Amendment No. 116 relates to the content of a report from a complaints officer. This would allow for an assessment to be found inadequate. However intended, the meaning of "inadequate" in the context of the Bill is not clear. The text of the Bill as published ensures that the adequacy of assessments are safeguarded by section 10 which allows for the preparation of standards to govern assessments and by the existing grounds for complaint in regard to non-conformity with such standards. This is a more suitable way to ensure assessments are adequate given the broad range of considerations that go to make up good assessment.Amendment No. 117 would specify that a time frame for carrying out a further assessment, following a successful complaint that the assessment was not carried out in accordance with standards. In the light of what Deputy McGrath has said I am prepared to review this matter and, most likely, will bring forward an amendment in the Seanad.Amendment No. 118 seeks to require the complaints officer to make a judgment about the adequacy of the service statement. The position is that section 15(8)(e) allows the complaints officer to rule on whether the service statement is incorrect or inaccurate based on the criteria set down in section 11(7) which relates to eligibility, practicability, available resources and other matters. These are the factors that may give rise to a discrepancy between the service statement and the independently assessed needs. Therefore, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 64, 116 or 118.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	386	That comes as a huge surprise and I am deeply disappointed. In regard to amendment No. 64 I do not want a person who happens to have a disability to be assessed at different stages. The Opposition wants to ensure this is smooth seamless legislation that is not too bureaucratic. That is what that amendment is about. I would hate to think a person would be assessed two and three times when clearly one proper assessment would have been enough.I agree with what the Minister of State had to say on amendments Nos. 116 and 118. This whole section is about the accuracy of assessments only. The section says nothing about adequacy. The difficulty at the end of the day is that whereas people may find the statement is perfectly accurate it may be completely inadequate. I did not expect the Minister of State would accept these amendments but I did expect they would be understood. It should be possible where a service statement is inadequate for the executive officer to say that area was not looked at properly and should be looked at again. I do not mean the entire statement but where elements of the statement are inadequate it should be possible to look at them. That is what these two amendments seek. I accept fully what the Minister of State has said in the case of an inaccuracy that the Bill deals with that issue perfectly. However, it does not deal with the fact that it may be inadequate. At the end of the day we will be looking at service statements that will be inadequate as opposed to inaccurate. There will be such a concentration on how these service statements are compiled that they will be perfectly accurate and that is why there will be no——

Did the Minister of State say he accepted the principle and the vision in the amendment and will bring it to the Seanad?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	393	Yes.

Even though there are times where we disagree in debates, it is important when people listen. I acknowledge that and thank the Minister of State.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I cannot accept Deputy Lynch's views in respect of amendments Nos. 118 and 116.It is quite clear the complaints officer can rule on the adequacy of the service statement. I do not think it is necessary therefore to rule on the inadequacy. Ruling on the adequacy of the service statement means that whatever inadequacies are there will be taken into account. I do not propose to accept that amendment. If I can understand exactly what benefit is in amendment No. 64, I would be prepared to reconsider it.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I will try to explain it again. Where it appears to an employee of the executive that a person may have a disability or where a person is in receipt of a health service provided by the executive, or both, my amendment proposes he or she shall, unless an assessment has been or is being otherwise carried out, arrange for an application. My amendment seeks to clarify the situation, nothing else. It is not earth shattering. There may be another assessment being carried out at the time.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	397	How?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	398	For instance, the case of a child and an assessment under the 2004 Act.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	399	It will take precedence over this so there will not be two assessments.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Not two assessments, but another assessment may be carried out. This is a proposal for clarification.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I do not think it necessary. As explained on Committee Stage, if an assessment is being carried out under the Education Act, then that assessment must take into account the health situation and will cover both, to ensure there is not duplication of assessments. I honestly believe that the position the Deputy is trying to achieve is adequately covered in the small number of cases where a person may not be in a position to look for an assessment. In the opinion of the HSE its officers may seek an assessment on behalf of that person and that adequately covers the Deputy's requirements.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	402	Amendments Nos. 65, 66 and 80 may be discussed together.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I move amendment No. 65:
In page 13, line 31, to delete "within 3 months of" and substitute "forthwith after".This amendment proposes a time frame to ensure speedy movement rather than waiting until the last minute for something to happen. The phrase "forthwith after" would give greater substance. I know the Minister of State does not agree but I think it should happen and I suppose that is my job.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	404	We realise that the commencement period is to be within three months but the concern is that it may go to the wire and not start until the three months is up. My amendment No. 66 puts the case that in urgent circumstances the assessment should commence immediately and should be completed without undue delay. The Bill does not give an end point. The amendment seeks to impose some pressure to ensure an immediate start. The practice might well be that if it must commence within three months it would not start until the last day, as is the case with planning permission——
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Two months and 28 days.

If a deadline is given, it will be kept and met in almost every eventuality. Some people have illnesses with a sudden onset and they may need help urgently.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I support Deputy Stanton's amendment No. 66 and will speak on my amendment No. 80.The important phrase is "in the case of urgent conditions, to commence immediately, which should be completed without undue delay, within a maximum period of 3 months from commencement". We all know from experience that crises arise within the disability sector. Families face difficulties due to lack of services for their family member with a disability.My amendment No. 80 emphasises the importance of timing in dealing with people with disabilities. I referred earlier to the delays. I hope this debate, whatever about the legislation, will end the delays and end the torment and trauma for families. We are moving in that direction. However, when one considers the figures I quoted of 273 children in Waterford waiting for speech and language therapy and 260 or 270 families in the St. Michael's House area in Dublin North, my own area, looking for priority residential care, we must ensure whatever happens as a result of legislation that the battle to combat the delay in providing the services for families of those with disabilities will be won. We are moving in that direction but I want to ensure it happens. We must concentrate on the priorities because these are serious conditions and there is undue delay.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	408	Amendments Nos. 65 and 66 seek to impose a time frame for commencement and completion of assessments and service statements including the arrangements to apply in urgent cases. Amendment No. 80 would apply to the services outlined in the service statement to require the services to be provided without undue delay. The question of establishing time limits for the assessment process is already covered in the legislation. Section 9(5) requires the assessment to commence within three months of the application and be completed without undue delay. As I stated on Committee Stage, this will be covered by regulation.It would be unreasonable to require that every assessment would commence forthwith, as envisaged by Deputy Lynch. Section 21 allows for the making of regulations to govern the procedures for assessment including different time frames within which assessments should be made. It is envisaged that the regulations would establish different intervals for assessments, depending on the category of disability and age of the person. Such regulations would also allow for prioritisation of the assessment of urgent cases where warranted. This is adequately covered under the provision in the regulations.Amendment No. 80 seems to be geared to require the services in the service statement to be provided without undue delay. The service statement is a document that will set out the services that can be delivered in any individual case and the timing of such provision. The content of the service statement will be dependent on available resources, eligibility and practicality, as well as the assessment report and standards to be put in place pursuant to section 10. Once prepared, every individual will have a right to the services outlined in the service statement. I believe this is a more rigorous way to provide for the services involved and in the circumstances I do not propose to accept these amendments.Urgent cases will be taken into account in the roll-out of the legislation, its implementation and the way in which the regulations are drafted. I am confident there will be no delay for urgent cases, in particular for young children where early intervention is vital. To simply allow for immediate requirement for assessments would be practically impossible. When one considers that in many cases a number of professional therapists must be involved in the assessment, a lead-in time before commencement is necessary.

In page 14, line 7, to delete "of circumstances" and substitute the following:"in the personal circumstances of the applicant or to the services available to meet the needs of the applicant".This amendment again addresses services and the needs of the applicant. In discussing services and the needs of people with disabilities these are key issues for the legislation. I ask all Members to support this important amendment.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I believe the section as constructed adequately covers a change in either personal circumstances or service availability. In the practical roll-out of the legislation this situation will be covered in more detail to ensure that a change in a person's personal circumstances or the provision of more resources will automatically mean a change in the assessment process.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	413	This amendment would create an obligation on the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to produce standards for the assessment of needs. It would give rise to a legal interpretation that HIQA would be obliged to develop standards to govern the assessment process in every detail. The intention of section 10 is that standards would be established for the main features of the assessment process. In the circumstances I do not intend to accept the amendment as it could give rise to excessive codification of the assessment process. I believe there is a clear intention to set standards for assessments. However, I do not believe the proposed amendment would add to that commitment and I do not propose to accept it.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Amendment No. 72 is out of order.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I move amendment No. 73:
In page 14, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:"(2) A liaison officer shall be independent in the performance of his or her functions.".This again relates to the role of the liaison officer. The functions of the liaison officer, which are outlined in the legislation, include taking account of the resources available to the executive, practicability etc. I would like the Minister of State to clarify how a liaison officer should go about his or her work while taking account of all these issues. There is no requirement for the liaison officer to carry out his or her functions in an independent manner as provided for in respect of assessment officers and clearly this is because of the constraints on the liaison officer. Even allowing for the constraints on the liaison officer as specified in the Bill, the liaison officer should be able to perform his or her functions without other pressure.While I may not agree, I accept that he or she must take into account the resources available and what is practicable, which is contained in the legislation. Having said that, the liaison officer should have a free hand and should be able to go about his or her functions in an independent manner without anybody in the Health Service Executive putting pressure on him or her to come up with a service statement that may not be the best that is possible for the person with the disability in the time allowed. We should give the liaison officer a certain amount of independence under the constraints of the legislation.The Minister of State may say this provision is not essential, and maybe that is correct, but it is important to clarify how liaison officers are to reconcile what is available to the Health Service Executive with the services required. Will they be given a budget at the start of the year outlining what is available and be required to work within that budget or will they need to fight for each case as it arises? I ask the Minister of State to share his thoughts on how this will work as it impacts on the independence or otherwise of the liaison officer.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I support the amendment and I hope the Minister of State accepts it. A major problem with the legislation is that it will be known as the resource-dependent Disability Act, because it is so dependent on resources. Regardless of who makes the assessment it should be independent and whatever appeals system or liaison exists should not only be independent but be seen to be so. A common perception among disability organisations, shared on this side of the House, is that it is far from independent but is totally dependent on resources being available. It would be wrong if an assessment officer, a liaison officer or whoever is responsible for deciding the needs of a person were not independent. The need to be seen to be independent goes across the board of those involved in the process. As the Bill is so resource dependent, it appears that any assessment would be made for the purposes of saving resources rather than looking after the real needs of disabled people.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The Bill provides that the assessment officer will be independent, with responsibility for delivering an independent assessment of need for individuals. In addition, the assessment will be undertaken without regard to the cost of the service envisaged or the capacity of the executive to provide those services. The independence of this officer is essential to the process and is a response to a key concern of the disability interest groups, as I said this morning. It is equally essential that a liaison officer should be part of the executive involved in managing the needs of people with disabilities within the practical constraints applying from time to time. This is in keeping with the role of the liaison officer, which is to prepare a deliverable service statement.The liaison officer will have a knowledge and understanding of service issues and the demands on them as well as of related resource implications and the capacity of the executive to respond in individual cases. In the light of the role envisaged for the officer in the Bill, it would be inappropriate to assign him or her the statutory independence proposed in this amendment. There will be no constraints on the liaison officer in doing his job within the HSE except the normal ones of resources, which I have outlined. He will be allowed, within the resource provisions, to make available the best service statement.Regarding what Deputy Cowley has described as a resource-dependent Bill, also the main point of his last contribution, I put it to him that he has been an Independent Deputy here for two years. I have never yet seen him stand up in this House and say, since he is prepared to provide all kinds of services to all kinds of people, how he proposes to raise the money to pay for them.

#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I do not know where to stop — the bypass. There are many different ways that the money could be raised without even having to increase anyone's taxes, since so much is wasted. The bottom line is that so much money is wasted in the system that those essential services for disabled people do not exist. It is extremely demoralising for disabled people or for anyone dealing with them in the services to have to beg for every penny or little service that they get, things to which they are absolutely entitled and that should be there to put disabled people on the same level as the able-bodied. That is what this Disability Bill is about. The Government went to great trouble to get a forum together of disabled people and those associated with them to propose what they thought the best way forward, but it turned its back on the forum completely by refusing to take on board its very valuable recommendations.This Bill is totally and utterly dependent on resources. If one had everything that this Government has wasted, one could certainly have a great many very important changes in society essential to disabled people. The Minister of State is disingenuous when he says the money is not available. I certainly know where it would come from, and I would start with the Government and what it has wasted.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	427	This amendment is focused on the practicality of the liaison officer working in the Health Service Executive. When a liaison officer is performing his or her functions, the person will have to find the services that are there. I am not sure how the liaison officer is to operate, and I asked the Minister on a few occasions yesterday evening and today how the person is to function within the Health Service Executive. Does he envisage the liaison officer being given a budget at the start of each year? Will money on which the liaison officer might draw be ring-fenced? Will the person have to fight in the executive for every crumb and service each time a service statement is being prepared?Perhaps the Minister of State might tell us how he envisages the liaison officer providing those services and what model will be in place. That would help us all greatly. We all know that resources are never unlimited, but we wonder how that is to be done. People are worried that needs are being defined with reference to resources rather than the other way around. Resources should really be defined with reference to needs. When the liaison officer goes to the Health Service Executive seeking services, what kind of authority will he or she have to get them? That is another issue, since we all know from people working in large hospitals that there are pressures from different sections for various services. People can hold services, and sometimes patients are kept in a bed a little longer so that it is not lost to a consultant when the next patient comes in. We all know that such things go on. The liaison officer should have some form of independence or authority. What is that, and how is the liaison officer to function in the Health Service Executive? That is clear to no one.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I strongly support amendment No. 73, whereby the liaison officer would be independent in the performance of his or her functions. It is a very important and strong amendment.On the broader question, families with members with disabilities are concerned that the resource issue arises constantly. The Minister always puts forward the Government viewpoint and especially that of the Department of Finance. However, this is a Disability Bill, and I would love to remove the fingerprints of the Minister for Finance from this legislation, allowing us to focus on people with disabilities and their rights to services. I strongly support Deputy Cowley regarding the points put forward. The funding of services is always an issue, and there always seems to be a problem. It is like those 273 young children in Waterford waiting for speech and language services. I am sure that the local whinge is that they do not have the resources, but I do not find that acceptable. That is my big problem with the resource issue. In my area, I do not find it acceptable that there are 250 in the St. Michael's House area on very serious priority waiting lists.Those are the issues, but there never seems to be any kind of whinge or moan when money is wasted. Deputy Cowley mentioned the €60 million spent on electronic voting, but there are many other projects. I live where the new Dublin Port tunnel is about to be constructed, and they have already gone €220 million over the projected costs. A great deal of money is being wasted. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell — Rambo himself — thinks that he is going to tackle all the gangland murders in Dublin. He is out in New York while the gangland killings are continuing. He bought a farm in north County Dublin worth about €3 million or €4 million for €30 million. I would have loved to see that extra €26 million going on services for all the people on the north side of Dublin on speech and language, residential or respite waiting lists, which could be wiped out tomorrow morning.The resource and financial issue should be tackled head on, and we should make no apologies for supporting such a rights-based approach. We are talking about 8% of the population. When families organise rallies for next Thursday, they are not acting lightly. Yesterday I received a telephone call from Galway. The Minister of State probably knows Ronnie Hanlon, who is organising a group from Galway which is coming up for the rally on Thursday on the Bill's conclusion. Families have genuine concerns, and I know from talking to a great many back bench Deputies that many share our views but are silent because they have been put under pressure by the Whip. If they were in Opposition, they would strongly support the points that we are making regarding this legislation. We have every democratic right to put that forward, despite those who reject our entitlement to challenge the resource and funding issue. Money is always a problem regarding people with disabilities and the poor or excluded. However, that is never the case with others in society. Denis O'Brien and those with large fortunes get away scot free. Had we a fair taxation system, they would have paid at least €50 million, which would be no big deal if they make €200 million. Imagine what services could be provided with that money.On amendment No. 73, it is important that those issues be raised. My bottom line is that I would like the liaison officer to be independent in the performance of his or her duty. The Minister of State will gather that there are several Independent Deputies in the House who are inclined to consider things objectively. For that reason, I say that a liaison officer should also be independent.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I would never question Deputy McGrath's objectivity, which is to be found in his contributions to this Bill. I agree that there are major gaps in the services provided for people with disabilities. There are waiting lists across the spectrum. Those gaps must be tackled and the resources must be found in order to provide those services. The entire thrust of the Government's policy is to provide those resources which will be underpinned by this legislation. However, there must be responsible public expenditure and good governance. We cannot have legislation that is not predicated on resources. Deputy Cowley comes into the House, utters a soundbite for publicity purposes and leaves. We hear this kind of thing week after week from the likes of Deputy Cowley. He was elected in a constituency where parish pump politics destroyed life for long enough in the past. We should be beyond that now. Deputies come in here, call for helicopters here and there and for radiotherapy services in Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Limerick. They make smart remarks about an item of legislation that is resource-dependent. That is not good enough.

Opposition Deputies asked me on Committee Stage to amend the legislation to ensure a timely response by the council to the liaison officer. I indicated that I would consider the matter and return to it on Report Stage, which I have done with this amendment.

However, I do not understand how this aspect is different to the other amendments which sought to include the phrase "without undue delay". The response of the Minister of State on those occasions was that it would all be done by regulation. In this instance, he is doing the exact opposite by providing for it in the legislation. Will the Minister take this on board for future amendments which contain this wording?

That amendment was in response to a proposal by the National Disability Authority.

I am pleased to table these amendments which respond to the concerns expressed by Deputies on Committee Stage.

However, the wording is confusing. The deletion of the phrase "without undue delay" after "the service statement shall be prepared" could mean there is no rush in preparing the statement but only in regard to its provision once it is complied. By removing the first instance of the phrase "without undue delay", these amendments serve to afford more time and less urgency for the preparation of the service statement. I stand to be corrected if I am reading this incorrectly. Perhaps the Minister of State will consider including both instances of the phrase "without undue delay".

We spent three hours in this House last Thursday dealing with urgent legislation. I assume the same people who advised the relevant Minister in regard to that matter, and whose advice was found to be incorrect, also advise the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. I do not accept that the Government has the best legal advice. It would be entirely wrong to remove the first instance of the phrase "without undue delay" after we have collectively fought in every relevant instance over the last month to have it included. I would like to see the legal advice the Minister of State has received. I am dubious about any legal advice the Government receives because it has proved to be incorrect on many occasions.

It is an important issue but not the most vital we have discussed in recent weeks. Nobody asked for the first instance of the phrase "without undue delay", after "a service statement should be prepared", to be deleted. We are all pleased with the Minister of State's proposal that the phrase "without undue delay" should be included after "service provider concerned". However, both instances of the phrase "without undue delay" should be retained so that the subsection reads as follows:A service statement shall be prepared without undue delay and a copy thereof shall be furnished to the applicant, the Executive, and, if appropriate, the chief executive officer of the Council and the head of the education service provider concerned without undue delay.Why does the Minister of State propose to delete the first instance of the phrase "without undue delay"? This deletion is not required because the second instance of that phrase does not qualify both elements of the subsection. There are two separate aspects to this provision, the preparation and furnishing of the service statement. The subsection should stipulate that both must be done without undue delay.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	461	That is exactly what these amendments provide.

This amendment will increase the degree of transparency for those with disabilities. It is a moderate and fair amendment and I see no reason that the Minister of State should not accept it. It serves to work with and make the best of the fundamentally flawed formula around the delivery of services as set out in the statement of need.My preference, which I have already stated, is for a significantly different approach in terms of the identification and progressive delivery of disability specific services based on a recognised right to independent assessment. I regret that my amendments Nos. 126, 127, 141, 146, 148 and 155, which set out my understanding of how disability specific services should be delivered, were ruled out of order because the Ceann Comhairle believes they involve a potential charge on the Exchequer. I reiterate my objections to this Standing Order. It serves to rule out constructive amendments that aim to ensure the legislation we pass in this House is as positive as possible and facilitates progressive provisions that address, in this instance, the needs of those with disabilities. The amendments I have tabled in respect of this matter, which have been rule out of order, proposed the establishment of an independent disability support service to conduct individual needs assessments and address related issues.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I wish to speak on amendment No. 93 in my name.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I assume that the Minister will not accept amendment No. 91. Amendment No. 92, which is straightforward and sensible, involves providing assessments to liaison officers as well as others. I do not understand why this should be done on an either-or basis. It would not be a major deal if a liaison officer received an assessment. As it stands, the relevant subsection states:Where a public body is furnished with a copy of an assessment report under subsection (1), a member of staff of the body shall communicate with the applicant concerned, or where appropriate, a person referred to in section 9(2) or the liaison officer . . .I do not understand why in the subsection the form "and the liaison officer" should not be used.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I support amendment No. 93 and I wish to provide some practical reasons regarding why it would be helpful. As a member of Kildare County Council, I was aware of frustration at the long waiting lists for disabled persons grants. People were often informed that they would require an architect to perform certain tasks which ended up costing a great deal of money. I am critical of the amount of money that is available but this is not an excuse to tell people that services would not be provided. This situation, which was expensive and frustrating, was not in the applicants' interests.Great disparities exist in terms of the money allocated for these grants. Kildare receives the smallest allocation of €5per capita, while the largest is over €110. This has a direct bearing on the ability of local authorities to deliver services. The manner by which matters are addressed is also important. Bad situations should not be made worse. Provision of certainty that a reply on entitlement will be delivered might form an important component of this legislation.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The provisions of section 12 look beyond the health and education sectors and provide a mechanism to allow the supply of relevant information in order to facilitate access to other services. The section is a significant and practical response to the concerns of the disability sector that the Bill should foster appropriate linkages to mainstream services.Amendments Nos. 90 to 93, inclusive, would impose more specific obligations on liaison officers and on mainstream public service providers which are contacted by a liaison officer regarding the possible provision of services to an applicant. Section 12(1) allows the liaison officer, with the consent of the person with the disability concerned, to provide information to a mainstream service provider in order to help the person receive necessary services from that body.Amendment No. 90 would oblige liaison officers to provide information after obtaining consent from applicants. It is my view that this amendment goes beyond offering the applicant support by placing an onus on the liaison officer and the applicant to comply with the subsection. As sensitive personal information is likely to form part of the assessment report, I would not like to see any change to the subsection which would put a degree of compulsion on the applicant. For these reasons, I do not intend to accept the amendment.Amendment No. 91 would oblige a public body to communicate immediately with an applicant. Such an obligation would be extremely onerous and unlikely to result in the worthwhile and considered response to which the applicant would be entitled. I do not, therefore, propose to accept this amendment.Amendment No. 92 would oblige a public body to communicate with a representative of the applicant and the liaison officer. This may not be the most appropriate way to proceed because it would not be conducive to clarity on whether primary responsibility to act on behalf of the person with the disability lay with the liaison officer or with the representative. As I said after extensive debate on Committee Stage, I do not propose to accept this amendment.Amendment No. 93 would require public bodies to communicate with the applicant or representative within a maximum of six weeks. I have sympathy with the intent of this amendment in trying to ensure prompt attention for applicants. However, as this provision applies to a range of bodies which provide a variety of services, it is not possible to be prescriptive as to the timing of the response. The response will, in general, be governed by the arrangements for service delivery pertaining to the particular service. I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 90 to 93, inclusive.

In page 16, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:"(b) The public body shall communicate with the persons in this subsection the information regarding services that may be provided by the public body that it considers that the applicant is entitled to, as soon as practicable after receiving the assessment report, but within a maximum period of 6 weeks after receipt of the assessment report.”.

It is welcome in that it will not create a charge on the Exchequer but will save money. Repeated examinations are among the many difficulties with which disabled people must contend. This amendment is straightforward. I hope the Minister of State will take it on board in order to provide some semblance of fair play to disabled people. It is important for them.The amendment will save money for the Exchequer by removing the need for repeated medical examinations. According to its provisions, a disabled person will be recognised as such and issued with a disability access card, which could be referred to as a "blue card", to ensure that he or she has automatic entitlement to available services. The services would be designated in the scheme. Disabled people would not, as happens at present, have to attend different Departments for different assessments. Repeated assessments to determine eligibility for different services can mean terrible hardship for disabled people, particularly children. If the services to be provided under the scheme can be determined, it would be a simple matter, entitlement having been established previously, to grant access on production of a blue card.I raised this matter previously and asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children if she would consider the introduction of a disability access card. She said she understood that I was referring to the need to minimise the degree to which people with disabilities are required to undergo repeated medical eligibility assessments. The Tánaiste indicated that she would support measures to address the matter. Given her support, she will have envisaged that the Disability Bill represents an appropriate context in which to introduce an access card. It is for this reason I have moved my amendment. As disabled children do not get better, unfortunately, and disability will not disappear, it is logical to make this amendment. It would have support across the disability spectrum and send a very positive message from Government to disabled people and representative organisations that it is interested in ensuring practically that disabled persons face less hassle.By making my amendment, the Government would acknowledge the hardship of repeated examinations and indicate its willingness to make things easier for disabled people at the stroke of a pen. Leaving the humanitarian aspect aside to consider the matter in cold, cash terms, the amendment, far from increasing costs to the Exchequer, would save money by obviating the need for repeated examinations. Those who perform assessments would no longer be required to carry out the work under the proposed scheme. The amendment would be particularly helpful to children with spina bifida and other diseases whose conditions will not improve. I hope the Minister of State will accept an amendment which has been moved in a positive spirit and which outlines provisions with which it is easy to concur. It is important for the Government to make the amendment to show that it cares.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I strongly support amendment No. 93a, which outlines important legislative provisions. I thank Deputy Cowley for moving what is, from the perspectives of the Administration and the families of people with disabilities, a sensible amendment. It is particularly important for children with disabilities and severely disabled adults. The amendment would have the effect of decreasing bureaucracy and easing the difficulties faced by families. It calls for the establishment of a disability access card scheme — to be called the “blue card scheme”— for the purpose of minimising the degree to which persons with disabilities are required to undergo repeated medical eligibility assessments.I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has already accepted that the proposal represents common sense. Many common sense proposals come forward during debates on all forms of legislation from my Independent colleagues which I wish Ministers would acknowledge instead of making smart alec comments about helicopters and Deputies flying in and out of the Chamber. It is sensible to allow the holder of a blue card to access cross-departmental services specified in the scheme to ensure cohesive and co-ordinated delivery to persons with disabilities.Deputy Cowley is trying to clean up bureaucracy to simplify matters for those providing services and, more importantly in light of today's debate on the Bill, to make things easier for families of people with disabilities. That is what the debate is about. I urge all Deputies to support Deputy Cowley's progressive amendment.

Ní fhaca mé gurbh fhéidir an rud seo a chur chun cinn cuíosach tapaidh agus nach gcosnódh sé an oiread sin airgid ar an Stát. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta nuair a deir sé go sabhálfadh sé roinnt airgid don Stát.Deputy Cowley has moved a useful amendment which will help ease the burden placed on people by the need to undergo repeated medical eligibility assessments. For the majority of Members, such a requirement would be an irritant or something of a hassle, but for those who have major disabilities and families caring for people with disabilities, it is a strain which is disruptive of their lives and routines which have been built up over time. Any measure which seeks to make life easier for those with disabilities and their families and provides for equality with those of us who do not have to undergo continuous assessment is to be welcomed. I hope the Minister of State will take this constructive and responsible amendment on board.As Deputy Cowley said, acceptance of amendment No. 93a would save the Exchequer money and provide for a more constructive scheme than many of those the Government has formulated which have increased rather than reduced inequality. Deputy Cowley is to be commended for moving his amendment. Rather than taking cheap shots at Deputies who are willing to formulate significant or minor measures, the Minister of State should accept the amendment. I do not see many Deputies on the Government benches contributing to the debate, nor have I seen the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has responsibility for this area, playing any part in deliberations on the Bill from Second Stage until now. It also says a great deal that no Member from his party has bothered to speak on any Stage of the legislation.Tacaím go hiomlán leis an Teachta Cowley, agus tá súil agam go bhfuil an tAire sásta glacadh leis seo, cuidiú leo siúd atá thíos mar gheall ar an míchumas atá orthu agus déanamh cinnte nach mbeidh orthu dul gach bliain, nó go rialta, chun measúnacht leighis nó measúnacht eile a fháil. Is leor ceann amháin dá lán acu siúd a bhfuil míchumas orthu. Is léir don tsúil ina lán cásanna go bhfuil míchumas orthu nach mbeidh inleigheasta. I gcásanna eile, is léir do dhochtúirí agus lucht leighis nach gá dóibh dul faoi mheasúnacht, mar ní bheidh an míchumas sin á leigheas. Ní bheidh aon fheabhas ag teacht air, agus beidh siad mar sin don chuid eile dá saoil. Ba chóir dúinn bheith ag déanamh cinnte go bhfuil siad compordach agus go gcuirfear lena saoil seachas bheith ag cur as don saol ar mhaith leo a chruthú dóibh féin.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	483	According to the Bill, people with disabilities must have a disability which is permanent or likely to be so and which must involve a substantial restriction and so on. People with disabilities who have medical cards must currently have regular assessments in order to have their cards renewed, even though we know they will not recover from their disability. The amendment provides for permanent cards for people with disabilities. The Government should examine this possibility as, apart from the bureaucracy involved, there is a certain amount of stress imposed on families and disabled people in attending repeated medical assessments. There is no need for this to happen as in most cases people will not recover from their disability as it is permanent. The Minister of State should push this matter at Government level.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I support the amendment. The Government has moved in a similar direction in the education sector where there are now special educational needs officers instead of people having to constantly repeat their case and obtain and send copies of various reports and assessments on particular children. One person has now assumed responsibility for that area. The Government has begun a trend in regard to how one aspect of persons with disabilities are treated. There is no good reason why that trend cannot be followed in regard to a much more invasive area, namely, physical assessments. The humanitarian aspect is just as important as the efficiency aspect. I believe efficiencies would be made if the amendment were accepted.

However, I agree that it is a good proposal and I assure the Deputy that the Bill would not prohibit the introduction of a card scheme such as that being suggested at some point in the future, should that become policy. I understand that an interdepartmental steering group is active in this area and that the Government would not intend to introduce additional public service cards until the group has identified a framework and standards to apply in this regard. The group will report to the Government in due course. I consider the amendment to be premature until such time as the group makes its proposals.

I had hoped he would accept something that could be done so simply. This could have been done at the stroke of a pen. The proposal would benefit people and ultimately save the State money. It is an important step that should be taken. We have the power to do that. The Minister of State has the power to do that. I ask him to reconsider his decision. He has the power to make life so much easier for disabled people by raising his hand. He could ensure that they would not have to undergo repeated examinations. Mothers look at their disabled children and know they will not get better, that they will never be the same as everybody else. Such people will be disabled for all their lives. Should they also have to undergo repeated medical examinations and fight tooth and nail for every single service they receive?The Government is sending out the wrong message. This should bring home to people what the Government is all about. It shows that it is not prepared to go very far for people with disabilities. That is the tragedy of the Government and that is why it will never come to anything. It does not have enough humanity. The Government could have made a difference for disabled people in this small way. I am most disappointed.When I left the Chamber for a few moments, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, made a statement on what I believe related to the fact that I have been campaigning for services — such as emergency medical helicopter services — that are not available here but that are available in every other country in Europe. I am also campaigning on other broad issues, not local, county or parish pump issues but on the national issue of cancer service provision. There is a need for radiotherapy services for people in the north west who currently must have radical mastectomies because Dublin is too far away for them to receive radiotherapy treatment. Although a unit is due to open in Galway that will not help people in parts of Donegal who are as far from Galway as they are from Dublin. While I welcome the opening of the unit in Galway, services should exist which provide equitable treatment for people. That is what I am about.I was elected as an Independent Deputy to represent issues the Government has not addressed. It is a sad situation which brings home to me, and I am sure to the public, exactly where the Government stands vis-à-vis disabled people. The Bill should be called the “Resource Dependent Disability Bill”. No matter what the Minister of State says, that cannot be denied. Even when no resources are required for this measure and when the Government would save money, the Minister of State is still not prepared to accept the amendment. He is letting himself down. He is also letting the Government down. He should reconsider.

The Minister of State previously accepted the principle of one of my amendments. This is a common sense amendment regarding a blue card system. It would make sense to accept the proposal. The present system affects people with disabilities and their families, especially children with disabilities. I am disappointed that the amendment was not accepted. It is not good enough to say such a scheme could be introduced without reference to it in this legislation. The proposed scheme makes sense and there is a broad base of support for it. It would reduce bureaucracy and save money. It would also show respect and dignity to the families of people with disabilities.

Is trua nach bhfuil an tAire sásta glacadh leis an leasú faoi láthair, in ainneoin go ndúirt sé go raibh sásamh éigin ann. Níl i gceist ach céim shimplí, ach tá an tAire á rá, toisc go bhfuil coiste idir-rannógach ann faoi láthair atá ag déileáil le cártaí, nach bhfuil sé sásta bogadh ar an gceist seo. Tá muid ag déileáil leis an reachtaíocht seo le tamall maith de bhlianta, agus b'fhéidir gur thrua é nár glacadh léi roimhe seo; bheimis chun tosaigh ar an áit a bhfuil muid faoi láthair. Measaim go bhfuil gá lena leithéid de rud ionas nach mbeidh daoine ag cur as dóibh siúd le míchumas.The Minister of State is not correct in saying that this is premature. It can be adopted. It should not be based on whether other cards are being considered by the Department or an interdepartmental group. It is a simple step which should be adopted. I do not agree with the Minister of State's logic. He accepted the logic of the proposal and agreed that it was worthwhile. Therefore, why not go the whole hog and accept the amendment?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	489	Having listened to the debate on this amendment, I accept the sincerity of Deputy Cowley. He is sincere about anything to which he puts his mind. However, although I accept the spirit of his amendment, I am not certain I agree with the introduction of a separate medical card for people with disabilities. I am concerned that it would be regarded as segregating the disabled even further. It is clear from the Bill that service provision will be predicated not just on resources but also on one's eligibility for services. One must ask whether one will be eligible for services, limited as they are under this Bill. This is a major problem and cannot be resolved by the introduction of separate medical cards for the disabled.I remember when there was a blue card system in place implemented by the doctor in the dispensary. It was very much about poverty and I do not want us to return to this system. We must keep the concept of the equal citizen in our minds. It represents the way forward if we are to ensure that people who happen to have a disability and who are eligible for services, limited as they are under this Bill, receive those services. We can do this by increasing the eligibility threshold for people with disabilities rather than by providing them with a separate medical card. The Minister of State should consider my suggestion seriously.I accept fully the sincerity of Deputy Cowley and acknowledge what he is trying to do. I support his aim but am not certain his approach is the correct one.

However, this Bill would not prohibit the introduction of a card scheme in the future. However, this is a matter for Government policy.

However, it is not appropriate to do so through this Bill.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	491	I thank Deputy Lynch for her sentiments and understand where she is coming from. Just because one has a sticker saying "Disabled" on one's car does not mean one is in a separate category. The system I propose works in the same way. It is a means of ensuring that people will not have to undergo repeated medical examinations.Since I started talking about this scheme, I spoke to a number of people, including paediatricians, who would greatly welcome it. They feel it would be very useful because they recognise the great difficulty and hardship involved for those disabled people who must undergo repeated medical eligibility assessments, particularly children with a disability such as Down's syndrome. These repeated examinations are carried out not only at a cost to the State but also at a cost to the children's parents in that they must pay for adequate public transport to travel to the place of assessment. They also incur the cost of having to take time off work. There is also a human cost associated with having to go through this rigmarole repeatedly. They go through it only for the authorities to decide yet again that their child is indeed disabled. It is a case of the doubting Thomases of Government refusing to believe that individuals have needs and putting them through the hoops repeatedly to discover whether they should be given taxpayers' money — it is not even the Government's money — to avail of services they require such that the very best can be done for them in this society through which we are all just passing. Why must it be proven time and again that they require the services identified for them?The Tánaiste has said my proposal is a good idea and that it would be fair. I have listened to what the Minister of State and others have said but I do not agree that my proposal could not be achieved at the stroke of a pen. It would make life so much easier for disabled people. I am sorry the Government is not taking this opportunity to establish the scheme I propose.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I move amendment No. 95:
In page 16, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following:"(e) identifying the services which are required but which are currently unavailable, resulting in unmet needs of the persons assessed, with a view to making those services available.”.This amendment relates to section 13 which deals with the maintenance of records by the executive and related matters. That section states that the executive shall keep and maintain records for a number of purposes, including identifying persons to whom assessments or services are being provided, identifying those services, specifying the aggregate needs identified in assessment reports which have not been included in the service statements and planning the provision of those assessments and services to people with disabilities. I propose to add another purpose, namely, to identify "the services which are required but which are currently unavailable, resulting in unmet needs of the persons assessed, with a view to making those services available".It is understood that the provision of the entire range of required services may be phased in to take account of available funding and professionals. Nobody would agree that this is ideal but that, as the Minister of State continues to remind us, is the reality. However, it is imperative that a record is kept of the needs that can be met immediately, those that can be met over time and those that cannot be met for the foreseeable future. The Bill should include a guarantee of increasing service provision over time to an individual and gradually reduce the gap between the assessment report and the service statement.This amendment charges the executive with ensuring that records be maintained to identify the services which are required but which are currently unavailable. In that way, the need for those services will not be forgotten or put on the long finger and the needs of the persons concerned will be met as soon as resources are available to provide those services.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I urge the House to support my amendment No. 96, which states:In page 17, line 3, after "provision" to insert the following:"and an indication of the resources required to meet unmet aggregate needs".I tabled this amendment to strengthen the section in terms of an indication of the resources required to meet the unmet needs of people with disabilities. We have had detailed discussions on the needs of people with disabilities. This amendment is progressive and sensible. Resources must be allocated to services in order to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are met.We can go all around the houses in debating this Bill but, ultimately, it is about providing services for people with disabilities. I stress that the services required to meet the differing needs of people with different disabilities. In the intellectual disability sector, respite, day care and residential services are needed. We mentioned the priority cases in earlier debates on the Bill. Different services are required for people with other disabilities. People with physical disabilities want to participate more in society, want accommodation that is appropriate for their needs and to be included in the mainstream of society.It is time to end this State being a cold house for people with disabilities. For too long these people have been excluded. This amendment presents an opportunity to do something about that. It is also about ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of services. This issue has arisen in the broader debate on the Bill. We need to ensure there is efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of services for all people with disabilities. I ask all Members to support my amendment.

That does not amount to ring-fencing resources for them but identifies the services required which are currently unavailable, resulting in unmet needs of the person assessed, with a view to making those services available.These amendments place a specific onus on the executive to ensure that when a service is not available that does not continue to be the position but that there is a planned approach to ensure the service will be provided in the near future. My preference would be for strong ring-fencing provisions, supported by statistical analysis of needs.I refer to the amendments I tabled, which would have the same effect as these amendments but which were ruled out of order because they were deemed to place a charge on the Exchequer. In my amendments I sought to ensure — which Deputy Stanton has also sought to ensure to a degree in the amendment he formulated — that the State would progressively take steps to bring about a full realisation of the right to services recommended to meet the needs of persons assessed. In respect of those services. the provision of which is not practicable at the time of writing of the service statements, I sought to ensure that a review of the service statement be carried out at regular intervals with a view to meeting the needs of the applicant over a reasonable period. We are reasonable in what we seek in these amendments but a restriction under Standing Orders prevents us from achieving what we seek in this regard.Amendment No. 94 in my name was also ruled out of order. It states "Where services that are the subject of a statement issued under section 12 have not been provided to the individual concerned within a calendar year, the service provider shall issue the individual a new statement providing an updated estimate of waiting time for the access to the service.”. That is a key requirement. It will ensure that those who have been assessed as having a need which is not met will have some inkling of when that service will be provided and their needs met, how long they will have to wait for that service and that the Health Service Executive, or whoever is the service provider, is taking their unmet need seriously. In that amendment, I went further by proposing that data on such unmet needs should be collected to establish the demand in terms of the unmet needs for each relevant service and a report should be compiled to ensure that not only the Health Service Executive, assessment officer or liaison officer notices that there is a service requirement but that statistical information and data is forwarded to the relevant Minister and Department.In the case of this Bill, the data should be forwarded to the Minister for Finance so that he will be aware of the need to provide extra money to ensure that services, where there is a lack of funds, will be resourced in order that the failure to provide the services required does not continue to be the position ad nauseam. As other Ministers have done, the Minister of State will probably say there is no such thing as ring-fencing and that it cannot be done. The Government, in particular, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has said there should be no ring-fencing and that it cannot be done. There are exceptions to that assertion by Ministers that the ring-fencing of funds is impossible and is not practical. Other examples have shown it is practical and possible. Funds should be ring-fenced to ensure this legislation has teeth. This amendment would ensure not only the services are identified but that they are made available thereafter.I will give examples of ring-fencing of funding to pre-empt what the Minister of State might say. Some 52% of the dormant accounts fund is ring-fenced for allocation to the RAPID areas and the drugs task forces. National lottery moneys are ring-fenced for specific purposes such as funding of sporting and health activities. Money from motor taxation is ring-fenced for local authorities to defray costs. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has admitted that he agrees with the ring-fencing of money put into the court poor box. Last year I think the Minister for Finance managed to ring-fence €300 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund for the next four years. Where there is a will, there is a way in terms of ring-fencing money. I call on the Minister of State to go to the Minister for Finance when this Bill is passed to ensure moneys are ring-fenced so that the services required are made available and to ensure equality in service delivery.While people with a disability and their families have welcomed funding commitments made in the national disability strategy and the budget for 2005, they are rightly suspicious that this is a political promise. They would prefer if the largesse were not discretionary and that it was ring-fenced to ensure the services are delivered at least at the current level but in the hope services required will continue to increase for those who have needs, are disabled, are looking to become full participants in society, have the right to independent living and wish to play an equal role to those of us who do not suffer a disability.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Section 13 obliges the Health Service Executive to maintain records on assessments and services provided under Part 2 to inform service planning. The HSE is also required to present an annual report outlining service needs, timeframes within which services will ideally be provided and the sequence of such provision.I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage which will ensure the collection of specific information to enable the quantification of needs which are not being met by service provision. This information will enable the HSE to review the way in which resources are allocated to ensure maximum beneficial output can be achieved. Accordingly, the Bill now requires that the report to the Minister will be provided within a timeframe of six months and will also include information on the likely cost of meeting service needs. This is a substantial development providing a transparent means of future planning for service development and delivery to facilitate a progressive response to real needs. It will enable greater efficiency and management of resources to be reflected in improved service levels over time. The amendment captures the principles sought in amendments Nos. 95 and 96. Therefore, those amendments are not necessary

I will not press the amendment but I ask the Minister of State to consider a mechanism to ensure the needs of each individual are also recorded and maintained by the executive when maintaining records. I am talking about unmet needs and services in each case. My amendment does not specify the individual records of each person. The Minister of State talked about the aggregated needs and aggregating the total cost at a regional and national levels, which we welcomed on Committee Stage. However, I wish to bring it down to the individual level. It is important that is done.

Greater efficiency is crucial. My political and broader disability agenda is resources for services for people with disability and the unmet aggregate needs. These issues are important. When we talk about the needs of people, we refer to the need for a level of services which will assist the families of people with disabilities or those with a disability.Amendment No. 96 is an important one which pushes to the boundaries to ensure the legislation has the maximum effect. We all agree we need the maximum beneficial output from the HSE. We acknowledge that is the ambition and the plan to deal with these services but the reality is we want to ensure people with disabilities get the maximum efficiency, the maximum level of service and are treated by the service providers with great respect and dignity at all times.

Various unjustifiable and cynical comments have been made about the background to the package, suggesting that it panders to certain elements at the airport. Instead, it was an excellent exercise in partnership, the result of which satisfied the majority.I am a Fingallian and proud of it. Both my parents were born and raised in Fingal, as I was. Throughout my life and most of the life of my parents, Dublin Airport was the major industrial institution in the area. I come from a typical Fingal family: I was reared next door to an Aer Lingus employee, my sister married an Aer Lingus employee, several good friends of mine are Aer Lingus employees and recently my constituency secretary's daughter became an Aer Lingus employee.Fianna Fáil in Dublin North held a meeting recently attended by 100 people, almost as many as at a Green Party national conference. Of those 100 people, 45 had direct links with Dublin Airport. That indicates how deeply Dublin Airport is rooted in the community and how important it is. I reject the suggestion that the aviation package is pandering to vested interests. It is a classic example of democracy and of listening to the voters. I have no hesitation in supporting this package on the basis that it is what the voters who elected me wanted.I will deal with the three individual components at the airport, although the motion relates specifically to Aer Lingus and I will not deviate too far from that. Aer Lingus is highly profitable as a result of the hard work and sacrifices of the staff of Aer Lingus.It is easy to forget that five years ago Aer Lingus was on the brink. That was before the attack on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001. Aviation changed after that event. A survival plan for Aer Lingus was executed and implemented through good management and the dedication of the workforce. As a result of the sacrifices made by the workforce, there are now more Aer Lingus pensioners than employees.

I am amused at Sinn Féin's new-found interest in Dublin Airport. The word "airport" is mentioned only once in the party's manifesto for the general election in 2002. There is no mention of Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta or SR Technics which employs 1,250 people at the airport. The only reference to the airport is:This State is suffering from decades of public transport infrastructure under-funding. Dublin remains one of the very few capital cities not to have a rail link to its airport.The party appears to have been more concerned about rail than aviation until its new-found interest.The same applies to the Green Party, although Dublin North is the constituency of that party's leader. Dublin Airport is the largest industrial institution in that constituency. There is not one mention in the Green Party manifesto of the airport or of aviation. That says a great deal.

While I wholeheartedly agree with the commendation of Aer Lingus in the original motion, the absence of detail in any action proposed by Sinn Féin is worrying, if not surprising.The Government considered the future of Aer Lingus for some time. Last summer, a special Cabinet sub-committee was established and a report on future options for the company was prepared by Goldman Sachs. The key concern has correctly been to provide Aer Lingus with the necessary sound footing for a successful future which entails access to capital. Despite the inaccurate and often vague assertions of the Opposition, the plan announced last week provides for the future growth and stability of Aer Lingus.Aer Lingus requires funds to support profitable growth and to ensure financial stability. We must all support the company in its pursuit of growth and to realise the significant potential it has identified on long haul routes. That was the immediate challenge facing Government and is addressed by the package announced last week.Aer Lingus needs an appropriate cost base and access to funds to finance aircraft acquisitions if it is to take advantage of the potential it has identified. Last week, a decision in principle was made to sell a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus to provide these funds. While some Opposition Members claim that this leaves the airline open to exploitation, the State will retain a significant stake to protect Ireland's key strategic interest. Appointed advisers will give direction on the size, type and timing of the Aer Lingus sale transaction and I believe the intention is to move quickly to engage these advisers and to consult Aer Lingus and staff on the investment needs.The most appropriate transaction mechanism to raise these funds will be selected, having due regard to a range of key issues, including the achievable price. The most important aspect of the process will be meeting the company's needs. In the timing of the proposed transaction account will be taken of that need as well as market conditions and the state of the aviation sector generally.Much of the debate that followed the announcement of the aviation package last week has been on strategic issues, specifically the slots at Heathrow. Every possible option within the regulatory framework will be examined to guarantee that Ireland's travelling public have ongoing access to Heathrow Airport. These options may well include specific shareholder agreement covenants or commercial arrangements between the State and Aer Lingus. The State will still maintain a significant minority stake in the company, and the best interests of Aer Lingus, its workers and customers will dictate action in this area. This is the correct and most suitable course of action.Sinn Féin, Labour and some others in this House may not share the confidence of Aer Lingus that there is massive growth potential for the airline. That is unfortunate. We, on the other hand, recognise and must facilitate that growth. One thing is certain, the Marxist policies proposed by Sinn Féin will not facilitate it. Fine Gael support the sale of a majority share but is not inclined to oppose moves to facilitate it. Labour proposes that the State get into the business of buying aeroplanes to facilitate it. Facilitating the growth of Aer Lingus should certainly not be placed in the hands of those on the benches opposite.Only by implementing in full the existing business plan will Aer Lingus receive the appropriate cost base to support a sustainable growth plan. That is the reality. The State is not acting in isolation or in a vacuum on this issue. The management and staff of Aer Lingus must work together to achieve the desired growth and stability. The State must, and does, support effort in this area.Aer Lingus must be able to compete properly and grow both on short-haul and long-haul routes. This can only happen with access to the required funds and continued progress towards greater productivity. The aviation package announced last week makes such progress possible and this can only be welcomed.

When we look at Aer Lingus we have to do so in the context of where it has come from. Aer Lingus has made enormous strides during the past four or five years from being debt-ridden and on the brink of going under to being a profitable airline. Without a major injection of capital it will not be able to advance further.The chairman of Aer Lingus came before the Joint Committee on Transport and informed us that Aer Lingus funding requirements over the next five years is approximately €1 billion. That is for the purpose of providing new long-haul aircraft and for an upgrading of the European fleet. If anybody can tell me how the State can get involved in providing that amount of funding he or she would have a better knowledge than I of the future of Aer Lingus.

#JohnEllis	unknown-#JohnEllis-party	unknown-#JohnEllis-dob	unknown-#JohnEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	518	As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, it is important from the point of view of Aer Lingus's future development that the necessary funding is provided. This is all about funding to allow Aer Lingus to progress as an airline. Many speak about the danger of losing a national airline. We will not lose a national airline but if allowed remain in its present state Aer Lingus will begin to go into reverse.Anybody who studies the last set of accounts from Aer Lingus will see that, were it not for cutbacks in salary expenses and reduced staffing levels, it would not have been able to produce a profit of €1 billion. How can anybody expect that airline to move on and make the €1 billion investment needed to make it into the international airline it will have to be? Its long-haul fleet needs to be replaced as soon as possible and its European fleet needs upgrading. If we are to have a national airline it is important that it is properly funded.People spoke inside and outside the House about the prospect of losing ownership of Aer Lingus, but that will not happen. The private sector is willing to come in and provide the necessary funding to move Aer Lingus to the next step. We all heard Members bleat when Willie Walsh announced that he was moving because no decisions had been taken. Now when decisions are being taken they are not right.A number of areas are protected up to a point. For example, the 14.9% stakeholding held by Aer Lingus workers will remain. A shareholding of more than 11% is required as a blocking majority in regard to doing anything to Aer Lingus. I am fully supportive of the moves to examine the possibility of selling off a portion of Aer Lingus. I have no doubt that if Aer Lingus is to prosper it needs capital, which cannot be provided from Government sources.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	519	The Government decision last Wednesday to sell the majority shareholding in Aer Lingus, while retaining a substantial minority shareholding in the company, is a good and positive move for the company, Ireland and Irish aviation interests. We acknowledge that we cannot continue to keep our heads in the sand. The international aviation industry is such that companies move into profit, make substantial losses and return to profit. We acknowledge the role played by management and workers in Aer Lingus in recent years, particularly in the past two years, where it has gone from a state of almost bankruptcy to a substantial profit last year and the prospects of it making a profit this year are good.I wish the company well in its new format. It is now able to attract substantial investment because of the fleet replacement it has to undertake. I am pleased Aer Lingus has adopted a policy of investing in Airbus aircraft. It is important that a small country such as Ireland flies the flag. As a good and loyal member of the European Union we should support Airbus because it is based in the European Union.We should not lose sight of the fact that while we have three major airports, in Dublin, Shannon and Cork, we have six provincial airports, three of which are located in Waterford, Sligo and Donegal. Waterford airport is located on the southern side of Waterford city. While we can continue to invest Exchequer funding in regional airports such as Waterford we should seriously consider the possibility of relocating that airport. If it were placed on the north side of Waterford city it could service Waterford and Kilkenny cities. International airports in Europe and England — for example, Leeds-Bradford International Airport — service two cities. Before committing further capital funding to that airport it should be located somewhere between Waterford and Kilkenny, possibly in south Kilkenny. That would be a more viable option and would attract many more passengers.People in the south east travel to Cork airport to avail of its facilities. If an airport were provided in a good location such as south Kilkenny it would be more profitable than in its present location.We have not given sufficient time and energy to look at the opening of Baldonnel as a commercial airport. On the Continent, military airfields are used as civilian airports. Baldonnel is close to a rail link and the Naas dual carriageway, one of the main routes into the city. It would be of benefit to passengers from the southern area.

The Government amendment appropriately notes the airline's contribution to the development of tourism and the wider economy and this has never been questioned. I join other Deputies to commend that contribution.My colleague, Deputy Grealish, has already spoken on the specifics of the aviation package announced last week. I wish to demonstrate how the development of policy on Aer Lingus shows to a great degree the wisdom of the policies pursued by the Government parties and in equal measure, the poverty and very serious incoherence of the policies devised by the parties opposite in all their diversity.The policy position set out for Aer Lingus by the proposers of this motion are reminiscent of those failed, statist policies of decades ago——

The motion before the House tabled by Sinn Féin calls for the status quo for Aer Lingus, State ownership, same conditions and practices. This will mean the same problems, unfortunately. It is remarkable that Sinn Féin, Labour and the Greens tried to pass off all their policies as if they are in the best interests of the company and to a lesser degree, the consumer.The truth is the Government parties are the ones listening to the concerns of Aer Lingus and the travelling public. They have invested a great deal of time and reflection before coming to the recent decision. Aer Lingus itself believes there is significant growth potential, particularly on long haul routes, provided it has the appropriate cost base and access to funds to finance aircraft acquisition.The question is how to best facilitate that growth, how realistically to provide the funds required. Apart from statements laden with rhetoric from Sinn Féin, how does it propose to raise the required capital? The Sinn Féin motion and the contributions of its Deputies last night do not answer this fundamental question.The Labour Party, predictably and understandably, supports continued State ownership of the airline. At least it is brave enough to set out its policy. We know Aer Lingus sees significant growth potential, particularly on long-haul routes. Its long-haul fleet consists of seven Airbus planes. It is believed Aer Lingus sees opportunities for expansion on the Atlantic routes and a need to replace and extend the fleet with up to a dozen new long-haul aircraft. Given that these reportedly cost more than €100 million each, I would be fascinated to hear how the Labour Party proposes to justify spending €1.2 billion of taxpayers' money on airplanes.Fine Gael, on the other hand, rejects Sinn Féin's motion and the Government amendment yet it stated last night it has no problem with the central point of the Government amendment. Policy on Aer Lingus can now be added to the list of disarray as between Fine Gael and Labour that includes the M3, the second terminal, stud fees, Aer Rianta, etc. The list goes on. Where would we be if the parties opposite were in charge? This is supposedly the alternative Government.The Government parties are now agreed on how——

It fails dismally to recognise the environment in which Aer Lingus and the aviation sector operates and where the only constant is constant change. Neither the motion nor any of the speakers referred to the fact it is the most cyclical of all international business. They do not refer to the ultra-competitive environment in which Aer Lingus operates. The motion does not appreciate the reality in which Aer Lingus operates. No modern country in Europe is investing money in airlines; practically all of them are divesting themselves. The motion does not seek to explore the reason, which is very simple. In the modern aviation environment, cut-throat competition means an airline requires flexible access to capital markets and cash. It is an industry that depends on sophisticated financial instruments and Government control is not in the best interests of the airline. I refer to Gerry Byrne, an aviation expert, who wrote in today's edition of The Irish Times that it is a quaint anachronism.The argument is put forward that there is no ban on Government investment in good times. I suggest it does not at all recognise the reality that money is certainly needed in the good times but more important, it is needed in the bad times. Governments cannot invest in airlines in the bad times. As sure as night follows day, there will be bad times. There have been bad times in the airline industry since its inception. Where would Aer Lingus be without access to capital, without access to flexible and immediate equity? It would be down the Swanee and we would be blaming the proposers of this motion. I support the Government's amendment.
#MartinBrady	unknown-#MartinBrady-party	unknown-#MartinBrady-dob	unknown-#MartinBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	533	In contrast to the intent of this motion and the political thinking of the party sponsoring it, this Government's aim is to ensure that the airline continues to make a significant and valuable contribution to the economic and tourism development of the country with the maximum number of sustainable jobs.Unlike the sponsoring party, the Government recognises it can only do this if Aer Lingus can compete successfully, operate profitably and have access to a variety of funding sources to facilitate growth and provide financial security.As part of its strategic vision, Aer Lingus believes there is a significant growth potential particularly on long haul routes provided it has the appropriate cost base and access to funds to finance aircraft acquisitions. As Deputy Peter Power said, this funding would not be made available from the Exchequer so private sector alternatives must be examined.The motion contains many alarmist references such as leaving the company and the workforce open to exploitation by private sectoral interests. This Government has already anticipated and met this concern by deciding that a significant stake of at least 25% should be retained, irrespective of chosen transaction mechanism. Concerns have been expressed about the disposal of a minority stake and the strategic issues including the slots at Heathrow Airport. All the options available within the regulatory framework will be examined to ensure ongoing access to Heathrow Airport for Irish consumers. Apart from maintaining a significant minority stake in the company, options could include specific shareholder agreement of commercial arrangements between the State and the company. Under company law the ownership of more than 20% of the issued share capital of a company enables a registered holder to deny the right of third parties to compulsorily acquire outstanding shares, which is a safeguard. The ownership of 25% of the issued share capital of a company enables the registered holder, in addition, to deny the remaining shareholders the ability to pass special and extraordinary resolutions, for example, such as making changes to memorandum on articles of association. It is not unusual for states to retain a shareholding in former flag-carriers. Given the uniqueness of the sector this is acceptable to markets as was the case with, for example, Air France. Once a minimum stake of 20% is held the Government cannot be forced to share its shares. This is clear legal evidence that the Government will not and cannot expose the company to negative interests as stated by the parties opposite.

In recent weeks and months, media attention on the Government's dithering on the second terminal at Dublin Airport has completely overshadowed the decision to proceed with one of the biggest privatisations in this country's history. The reason is obvious. The political dogfight in Cabinet over the second terminal, so loved by the media, did not just happen with respect to selling off Aer Lingus. It is not just that the Fianna Fáil backbenchers stood idly by while the Progressive Democrats got their way, they actually agreed with them. Privatisation really is the new religion.The media blindfold on Aer Lingus privatisation has meant little or no public scrutiny of the implications for all of us of the sale of the national airline. The Government's inaction on the second terminal has been repeated in its attitude to Aer Lingus. Since 2001, it has offered no direction to the company. It has been a decidedly disinterested shareholder and has failed to take key strategic decisions about the company. The only decision it did make was that it would never again invest in the airline. The Government's case for privatisation is based on the airline's potential future capital needs, on EU developments, on a distorted interpretation of EU law and in particular on the yellow pack ideology that runs through the Cabinet.No one can say for certain what Aer Lingus's future capital needs will be and we have never had an adequate explanation from Government on this point. Various figures up to €1 billion have been suggested for expanding the long-haul fleet. However, such an expansion is only feasible if a satisfactory conclusion is reached on US-EU negotiations on the open skies policy, a process like our own aviation matters that is taking much longer than it should. An open skies agreement could potentially open up new routes for Aer Lingus but the outcome of those negotiations is, as yet, difficult to predict. How can we base such a major privatisation on the outcome of negotiations that are not yet concluded? How can a Government that took three years to reach a fudge agreement on a second terminal have such supreme confidence in EU and US negotiators to reach a satisfactory conclusion to a much larger and more complex issue?Even if new routes are opened, as we all hope, Aer Lingus has a number of options in terms of expanding its fleet. It would have no difficulty in borrowing. It could enter into long-term leasing arrangements, which are standard practice for all airlines, or the State as shareholder could invest in the company's expansion. It can still do so. Why has the Government ruled out these options and put the long-term strategic interests of the country at risk? The reason is clearly ideological.Nothing displayed the Government's prejudiced attitude to Aer Lingus more clearly than the Goldman Sachs report. Last September it was announced that Goldman Sachs had been selected to provide advice and assistance to the Department of Transport on the future of Aer Lingus. At that time, it was stated that the advice would "primarily relate to the implications of maintaining the current ownership arrangement, strategic and public policy issues, as well as transaction issues." However, that assurance turned out to be a complete lie. The Goldman Sachs report makes it quite clear that the authors were asked to advise on the future of Aer Lingus subject to one overriding stipulation:The current policy of the State is to provide no further equity funding to the Company. The State will not provide further capital to the Company either to fund expansion or in the event of a financial crisis.In other words, the most obvious and basic choice available to any commercial operation — to secure investment for its expansion from the existing shareholders — was ruled out by the Government in advance of the advice being sought, which was an entirely ideologically motivated decision. This has nothing to do with European law. The European Commission and, more importantly, the European Court have made clear that nothing in EU law prevents a government from investing on a rational and arms-length basis in any of its commercial enterprises.The implications of this privatisation for Ireland are enormous and affect the key strategic interests of our country. As an island dependent on tourism and inward investment, we rely heavily on air travel. The high number of direct flights to and from various destinations, which Aer Lingus operates, has been critical to our tourism industry. These destinations have proved very attractive to Irish travellers for holidays and short breaks abroad. Central to our ease of travel also is Aer Lingus's access to more than 30 landing slots at Heathrow Airport, the fourth largest share of any airline. These slots greatly facilitate onward travel to other destinations as well as bringing more tourists here. In response to a parliamentary question a few weeks ago the Minister admitted that these slots were vital to the company and that he could not be certain that EU law would assist him in retaining control and yet he still reached a decision to sell off Aer Lingus.Privatisation puts such services and assets at long-term risk and we should not just abandon them at the ideological whim of the coalition partners. Aer Lingus has demonstrated that it is possible for a State-owned enterprise to operate successfully in a cutthroat commercial environment. Its future successful operation requires additional capital. The private sector is willing to invest because it sees the potential for profit. However, the Government rejects a sane and rational investment opportunity that would be embraced by any commercially minded business because of an obsession with private profit and a conviction that commerce is good but only in private hands.Claims by Government sources in recent days that despite its plan to sell off a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus, it would ensure the preservation of the company's name and crucial strategic assets, such as its landing slots at Heathrow, are absolute fantasy. The bottom line is that once a majority shareholding in the company is ceded to private interests the majority say in the decision-making process is handed over also. This is a basic law of business. Even if the Government were to extract some initial commitments from those who purchased the majority shareholding, nothing could be done to prevent those shares being sold on to others who would not be bound by such commitments.Fianna Fáil backbenchers appear to have clearly been sold a pup and have foolishly accepted assurances from Cabinet members that some sort of golden share could be retained by the Government in order to protect the national interest. The European Court of Justice has made it quite clear that the notion of holding golden shares is unacceptable and it has ruled them anti-competitive. This point was also made abundantly clear in the Goldman Sachs report commissioned by the Minister.I hope that some Fianna Fáil backbenchers will at least acknowledge the extent of the Government's betrayal of the national interest. They should wise up and be honest with their constituents. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have sold out on our national airline. The experience of the privatisation fiasco in Eircom should sound alarm bells for us all. We cannot prevent venture capitalists from repeating the devastation of Eircom by stripping Aer Lingus of its assets, reducing services, putting it into serious debt and walking off with the proceeds. We have to ask whether the Minister is incapable of learning from the mistakes of the past.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I am pleased to speak in support of the motion on Aer Lingus. However, the future ownership of the company has already been decided by the passing of the Aer Lingus Act 2004. The Government's decision to sanction a majority sale of Aer Lingus is a betrayal of the company and its workforce who have served this country so well over the years and, given their record in recent years, they could continue to do so successfully in a public enterprise. It is worth noting that the company's operating profits for 2004 were €107 million, an increase of nearly 29% on the previous year and a profit of €63.8 million in 2002. The decision to cede control of a majority shareholding could be a disaster for the country, air travellers, employees and the greater Dublin area.The Labour Party has long argued the importance of keeping Aer Lingus in public ownership. The logical conclusion of the Government decision, however, will in time probably see control of the airline passed to a major competitor such as British Airways. In such circumstances, it is ironic indeed that Mr. Willie Walsh, the former CEO of Aer Lingus, whose position in the company was made totally untenable by the Taoiseach, could well have the company back under his wing.Aer Lingus has a major strategic role in the economy of the country. We are an island economy and without a national airline Ireland could suffer dramatically from the fickle nature of the airline industry, should control of the company pass into the hands of people with no commitment to the country. Tourism is our second largest industry and it depends to a significant extent on the aviation industry. Given our peripheral location and relatively small population, it is vital that we have an airline prepared to balance the need for profit with the strategic interest of the country.The Government decision to send out Ministers and backbenchers to try to convince the public that the retention of the so-called golden shares — 25% of the company — can protect its strategic assets is open to serious question. My colleague Deputy Shortall has highlighted that in 2003 the European Court of Justice decided that it was illegal to hold a golden share that would protect such strategic interests. It is imperative that the Minister, in summing up, addresses the issue this evening. It is obvious that he is not interested.As an island nation, access to and from our shores is a key issue that cannot be left in the hands of private operators. That is the position that Fianna Fáil public representatives in north Dublin have warmly welcomed. These are changed times indeed, and I wonder how they can convince the electorate of the necessity of the change. There is a real alternative to the privatisation agenda being put forward by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil. There is no disagreement that Aer Lingus needs access to investment capital. The way forward is for the Government to accept the Labour Party's proposal from its last general election manifesto, which is now also the position of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to establish a public enterprise management company that would source the necessary capital in future. It should be noted that the national pensions reserve fund has invested €600 million in overseas companies, including airlines, in recent years. All that is stopping the Government from investing in the expansion of Aer Lingus, one of the most successful airlines in the world today, is ideology.In the context of a real debate on our future direction, we needed to get the media on board, but unfortunately they were not interested. Once again, the Government has set its eyes on privatisation, which will be a disaster.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I warmly support the motion set before the House by the Sinn Féin Party, whose sentiments I fully share. It is a timely motion.The debate on air transport of the past few weeks was completely phoney, as the Minister knows. We had a classic three-card trick from a pair of hucksters in the Government, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen. They stored up a long, pointless, nonsensical debate about the terminal, the most ludicrous aspect of which was of course the third terminal. Why not build five terminals while we are at it, like Arlanda Airport in Stockholm?The former Minister, Deputy Brennan, was shafted after he delivered the totally unnecessary and dangerous splitting of the three airports and the gross enfeeblement of Aer Rianta so that Michael O'Leary, his boss and the paid-for Progressive Democrats frontmen were able to put forward the ludicrous proposition of privatising the second terminal. That was not a runner and would not happen. All the media, with their usual modus operandi, chased after that chimera, although the real issue was the disgraceful decision to privatise our national airline. All the nonsense that we read about O’Leary, his Progressive Democrats minions, the McEvaddys and the other developers obscured the key decision, namely, the privatisation and, in time, almost certainly the foreign take-over of the national airline of this island nation.While that phoney debate has continued, the key intention of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, of selling off the jewel in the crown of our national state enterprise was allowed to go unchallenged. Tonight, the northside Fianna Fáil Deputies have the grave responsibility of voting for this motion and against the Government, as I did ten years ago, with the other northside Deputies, including Deputies Seán Ryan and Shortall. We had the guts to come in here and vote against the Government on an anti-national, anti-northside policy.I want to mention those Deputies in a roll-call of infamy. In my constituency, there are Deputies Woods and Brady, who came in here with some weasel words a few minutes ago to try to justify the outrageously unjustifiable, which will lead to the loss of jobs in the Dublin North-East constituency. Deputy Haughey and the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, represent Dublin North-Central; Deputies Glennon and Wright represent Dublin North; the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and Deputy Carey represent Dublin North-West and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, represents Dublin West. Adjoining those constituencies are Meath——

On a famous day, when we all went over to the old terminal to stand up for Aer Rianta, there were 13 vacant Fianna Fáil seats. These people did not even have the gumption or the courage to face the workforce of Aer Rianta or Aer Lingus. I want those nine northside Fianna Fáil Deputies to show some courage tonight by voting for the motion and against the sale of Aer Lingus. Unfortunately, I well know that I will be disappointed.Earlier today I was thinking back to the early days of Aer Lingus. Not only will a predecessor of the Taoiseach, the great Seán Lemass, be turning in his grave tonight, he is probably spinning in it when he thinks how this outrageous situation has come to pass. The decision was a grotesque betrayal of this country, the north side of Dublin and the workforce of Aer Lingus. It was a betrayal of a valiant workforce that had to endure wage cuts, job cutbacks and other desperate measures so that the company could be saved. They have 14.9% of the company but financial journalists tell us that they will have to raise at least €60 million if they want to hang on to that as the company is capitalised on the market. We believe that up to 40,000 jobs in our region are now in danger.Aer Lingus is a symbol of the Fingal area and the airport is the central economic driver of the area. The only people who can stop this tonight are the nine Fianna Fáil Deputies from Dublin's north side, as well as those from Meath and Kildare. I spoke today to someone who had been a senior accountant with Ryanair until he joined RTE a few years ago. He told me about the interesting prospects in long-haul flights for Aer Lingus as it is currently organised. Those prospects will start to disappear as soon as this decision takes effect.Last Wednesday was a day of infamy for the country, the Government and the Taoiseach. On the north side of Dublin, we will make certain that those who vote against this motion tonight will pay a horrific price in 2007.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	541	It was interesting to hear Deputy O'Donnell state that Aer Lingus had to be sold to raise the €1.2 billion needed to buy an additional 12 long-haul aircraft. Last week, the Minister for Transport asked us to see the bigger picture, to think outside the box and to imagine a glorious future for Aer Lingus and Dublin Airport. Looking into the future, I see a depletion of global oil reserves. Exxon Mobil predicts that once depletion starts, which is sooner rather than later, oil stocks will deplete by around 5% to 6% per annum. Goldman Sachs believes that and predicts oil prices in the not too distant future of over $100 per barrel. If we really think of the future, which we must do when debating this motion, the prospect of oil becoming incredibly expensive must be taken into account. The only thing that will get aircraft off the ground is oil. In such a volatile future, it is preferable for us to have control of the State airline rather than having it sold and losing any real control over the future of the company.Last week, I accused the Government of being idiots for not seeing the reality of an oil depleted future. Now I feel that the word "idiots" is too soft. Ignoring this policy is actually criminal neglect. Even the US president talks about this and every government of any stature has begun to recognise it. Our Government is too busy with its small squabbles about two or three terminals. That will not be the main issue in aviation policy. The issue will deal with how we adjust aviation policy to suit depleting oil reserves. The Minister should address that rather than flog the assets.I missed Deputy Glennon's speech but I was told that it was as entertaining as ever, with the usual lines of the Fianna Fáil press office attacking our own party and others. I look forward to reading his speech because the Deputy, in debates on the Bill in 2003, was resolutely opposed to the sale of Aer Lingus. I will also be interested the hear the views of other Fianna Fáil Deputies from the north side about the future of the company. However, I do not expect much because I do not see the sense behind this decision. If it was made to buy those long-haul aircraft, it was poorly explained in the Oireachtas committees which Deputy Shortall and I attended. It was never clear that such was the purpose of the sale.I believe the decision was ideological and that was given as the reason for the sale only recently. Ideologies come and go and the current ideology of privatisation, to which this Government is wedded, may be seen as one that has served us poorly. We should get the private sector involved where it is appropriate and benefits the development of our economy. However, Aer Lingus is an example of the public sector working very well. The Deputies opposite me do not believe in public enterprise, but people on this side of the House still do so.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I am in favour of this motion. Over the past few days, there have been many acknowledgements of the emotional attachment that Irish people have to Aer Lingus. We should not apologise for that. It is only right that we should feel a sense of pride in a company that in many ways has acted as an ambassador for Ireland. There is much to be said for spotting the distinctive shamrock in airports in any part of the world. As citizens, we are part of what that represents.Before the dawn of the Celtic tiger in Ireland, there were few companies that inspired a sense of pride on the international stage. I listened to some of the contributions from the Progressive Democrats Party when its Deputies spoke about Aer Lingus and failure. In fact, Aer Lingus has been a remarkably successful company. They may be confusing the story with the current failures of the terminal, but describing Aer Lingus as a failure is offensive. It is also important that we look at the fixation on things being cheap. I acknowledge that a cost-effective service provision is essential to the profitability of companies, but a balance is important to provide comfortable travel for passengers. We only need to look at the recent controversy involving Irish Ferries and the failure of the company to pay the statutory minimum wage. The reputation of the company has been tarnished by those events, as has the reputation of this country. It is difficult not to see that happening in Aer Lingus with the majority shareholding going out of public ownership. We will not retain the kind of control needed to prevent such an outcome.The simple fact is that Ireland is an island. If one is in Paris, Brussels or Berlin, it is difficult not to see the role that the railways and roads play in comparison with this country where we are very dependent on both air and sea travel. It is in our strategic interest that we retain this national carrier. I do not see the logic in hundreds of millions of euro being transferred to the State from the sale of this majority shareholding, when the State will then reinvest that same money in the company but will only own a fraction of it. We should not take advice from the people who gave us the same advice during the sale of Eircom.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I am totally opposed to any attempts by the Government to sell off the majority share of the national airline to private buyers. I reject this sale on a number of important points, namely, the betrayal of the loyalty of the Aer Lingus staff who turned the company around, the detrimental effect this sale will have on local rural economies, and the ever increasing evidence of this Government's attitude of putting short-term monetary gain above the rights and needs of our citizens.The staff of Aer Lingus have contributed enormously to the success of the company and through their dedication and suffering have turned the company from a loss-making entity to a profitable going concern since 2001. How does the Government propose to thank them? Privatisation of the national airline will result in job losses in all three main airports with Shannon Airport likely to be worst affected. As a reward for their hard work in making a success of the company, staff will lose their jobs. There is no justice in this.Many of the Aer Lingus staff at Shannon Airport have worked for the company all their lives. They have put down roots in the area and are dependent on Aer Lingus to secure an income with which to raise their families. Job losses affect not only the number of individuals shown on the company's annual accounts but their families and entire rural communities. It is not simply Aer Lingus workers who will lose out but also all those ancillary workers who depend on the success of the local economy for their living. Job losses at Shannon Airport affect not only the airline workers but everybody in the Clare-Limerick area.I call on the Government to retain the State's majority holding in Aer Lingus for the people and to protect the rights of workers in the company so their contribution to the economy and their patriotism can be properly recognised. If the Government continues with its foolish sale of our majority holding, it will betray those dependent on the airline. In this way, the Government will deal yet another severe blow to the local economy of rural communities and will create unnecessary hardship for many families.I call on all elected representatives in the Clare-Limerick and mid-west regions to reject the Government's proposed sale of one of our most valuable assets. I urge them to stand up and be counted and to represent the views and protect the rights of those people who elected them. We owe it to our constituents to stand up for their rights and to recognise the contribution they make to the lives of people in their own communities. It would be a betrayal of the loyalty of the Aer Lingus workers to allow this sale to go ahead.I put down a question to the Minister for Transport today on the bilateral agreement at Shannon Airport. He responded that it was a matter for Aer Lingus to honour that agreement and that the Government has no say in the matter. If the Minister were a surgeon he would spread no disease because he has washed his hands of this issue. Why did he not answer the question? Aer Lingus is in breach of the bilateral agreement but the Minister tells me he has no role.

Like most other airlines, Aer Lingus has not been exempt from the turbulence of speculation about its future. Last week the Government announced its intention to sell most of its majority 85% stake in the national airline while retaining 25% in State ownership. Four years ago, many predicted the imminent demise of the airline when it appeared to be in dire trouble. The driving force in cutting costs, jobs and fares, and restoring the airline's profitability was initiated by the Cahill plan and more latterly by Mr. Willie Walsh and his team. Mr. Walsh has departed for pastures new as he takes over the controls at British Airways. Only last week he decried the Government's retention of a minority stake in the airline as totally ineffectual.Credit for the transformation of the national asset is due in no minor way to the company's management and in particular to the staff and unions who made a major contribution to the airline's survival. Another national asset, the former Telecom Éireann and now Eircom, was privatised four years ago with disastrous consequences for shareholders. Since then, the privatised Eircom has behaved abominably in abusing its position by stalling on the unbundling of the local loop in order to prevent competition in the telecommunications sector. It has also systematically hindered, obstructed and generally endeavoured to sabotage broadband availability nationwide at a competitive and reasonable price.Aer Lingus is one of our major national public assets. In the strategic sale of such an asset, we yield the management of the company to the private sector. The Government clearly expects an alliance of some sort between international foreign investors and domestic private investors who together will control 60% of the company after privatisation. In such a tie-up, the foreign investor who will control the largest block of equity will be the determining influence on the operations of the privatised company. A shareholder agreement negotiated in the sale would have sensibly defined the relative roles of the strategic investors and the Government. However, the principal motivating factor for the sell-off seems to be the need for private investment to facilitate the upgrading of the fleet by the purchase of new aircraft.The EU Commissioner for Competition recently clarified the question of State investment in Aer Lingus when he said the Government could invest in the airline's expansion. The Government's decision is surprising for a number of reasons. Most nations have sought to create and still maintain a State-owned national airline flying domestic and international routes on strong economic and social grounds, namely the need to provide connections to major international airline hubs and different centres within the state, even if such connections may not turn out to be profitable.International connectivity and ease of access are crucial when a country seeks to engage in international markets and build commercial bridges with the rest of the world. Airline privatisation minimises State control and means that decisions regarding what points to connect and at what frequency are determined purely according to concerns of profit. Reference has been made to the future of the Aer Lingus slots at Heathrow Airport which are also an important national asset. They are owned by Aer Lingus and worth some €75 million, and were developed with taxpayers' money.

The proposal to privatise Aer Lingus, the national airline, arises for one reason only, from the right-wing, neo-liberal economic policy of this Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government. The Government is fully in tune in this sense with the EU Commission which would like to destroy every vestige of public ownership of services and industry within the European Union. There is no other economic reason for the proposed privatisation. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, speaking for the Government last night, made that clear indirectly when he tied himself up in contradictions:Over its history Aer Lingus has had its share of crises and has come close to failure. However, the Minister for Transport wants to end these crisis cycles where every few years a crisis is followed by survival followed by stagnation and back to crisis again.How does the Minister for Transport propose to prevent crises by abandoning Aer Lingus to sharks in the international aviation business? The opposite is the case because far more crises will be created for the national airline by doing this. In 2001, when the two unprecedented events of foot and mouth disease in this State and the twin towers atrocity in the United States occurred, it was inevitable there would be significant difficulties in international aviation. What would big business, as represented by the international sharks and the players of the casino economy, do if there was a more sustained period of crisis in international aviation arising from events such as these? They would shut down the airline, throw the workers to the wolves and move onto the next profit-making opportunity. The Minister for Finance makes no sense and should explain his reasoning.He went on to argue that Aer Lingus should have the same funding flexibility as its competitors. Why does it not have funding flexibility? The Minister gives one reason. In one particular instance the National Pensions Reserves Fund cannot invest in Aer Lingus. This is because the Government makes rules that stop it from doing so. The Government prohibits investment in an entity such as Aer Lingus——

Why should the State not protect a vital national strategic asset when international capitalism, for example, enters a global downturn? It is an inevitable part of the system that such downturns will occur. At present, unsustainable public and private borrowing supports the US economy. Its balance of trade is also unsustainable. Public ownership would protect our vital national airline, protect good jobs, provide the service we need and defend a strategic vital national interest.

In agreeing the aviation action plan, the Government has given a clear strategic direction and a mandate for growth to both Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority. Since becoming Minister for Transport, my focus has been on making the correct long-term decisions. What we need are expansion rather than crisis plans. The aviation action plan is the right strategy. It is not in the interests of the aviation sector, the economy or airline staff that we continue as we have in the past. We must be proactive rather than reactive.Aer Lingus is vitally important, given its history and the nature and volatility of the aviation sector. The recent decision on Aer Lingus will allow the airline to plan for the future in the knowledge that it will have the necessary funds available to purchase aircraft and to provide financial stability.

This must be accompanied by continued progress within the company towards a more competitive cost base. This is a matter the company and staff will have to address over the coming months and will be crucial to the preparation of the viable future growth plan they have been mandated to complete as part of the Government decision. The Minister for Finance and I will move quickly to appoint advisers to advise on the size, type and timing of the Aer Lingus sale transaction. We will work closely with the board and management on all the preparatory and other arrangements to give effect to this decision.I assure the House that in progressing the decision and charting the road map, I will continue to engage with the unions and the ESOT in a spirit of partnership. I have already written to ICTU and the ESOT and I expect that meetings will be arranged shortly to agree the consultation process.During the debate Deputies mentioned the status of the Heathrow slots. I make it absolutely clear that I accept that Heathrow is important for Ireland. Apart from retaining the 25% stake in Aer Lingus, we must within the regulatory framework, ensure adequate ongoing access to Heathrow for Irish consumers. As I have advised the House on previous occasions, Aer Lingus does not own these slots, they do not appear on the company balance sheet and an EU regulatory framework is currently under review. However, access to Heathrow is vital and I will keep this matter under careful review as we move forward on the decision.On the Government's decision on terminal capacity, I acknowledge the strategic importance of Dublin airport. It is and will remain pivotal to the continued success of the economy. New infrastructure capacity and facilities, both airside and landside, will be needed to cater for future growth, including further terminal and runway capacity. The Government's decision last week to approve the building of a second terminal by the Dublin Airport Authority will cater for expansion of the airport to handle up to 30 million passengers per annum. The Government agreed a triple safeguard process to ensure that terminal two, which will be operational in 2009, is delivered in an efficient and cost effective manner. These include consultations by the DAA with its airline customers to ensure the design of the new terminal takes account of their requirements, verification of the final specifications and costings by independent aviation experts and regulation by the Commission for Aviation Regulation. The DAA will also provide new pier capacity at Dublin airport by 2007. This will ensure the delivery of more contact stands for aircraft, which are especially important to the low cost carriers for whom fast turnaround times are an integral part of their business model. These decisions will ensure that essential capacity and facilities will be delivered on an efficient and cost effective basis at Dublin airport when we need to cater for forecast growth in passenger traffic.The importance of the other two State airports at Shannon and Cork and the contribution of the six smaller airports to regional development were also raised in the debate over the past two days. The airport authorities at Dublin, Shannon and Cork are currently preparing their business plans for submission to the Minister for Finance and me. The evaluation and outcome of this business planning process will provide greater clarity with regard to the most appropriate next steps to give effect to the restructuring and the establishment of Shannon and Cork as autonomous airport authorities. The Government fully recognises the important role of the smaller regional airports and we will soon announce the PSO air routes.The decision taken was the right decision that allows Aer Lingus to compete on an equal footing. At present, it has one arm tied behind its back.

Chuidigh sé le forbairt eacnamaíochta na tíre agus an oileáin seo, agus bhí sé riachtanach ag an am go raibh nasc idir muidne agus an domhan agus go raibh Aer Lingus i seilbh an Stáit. Tá sé fós lán chomh tábhachtach, ach anois tá sé fógraithe ag an Rialtas faoi dheireadh go bhfuil sé á phríobh-áidiú. Cuirimid in Sinn Féin i gcoinne an pholasaí sin, agus tacaímid go hiomlán le hoibrithe an chomhlachta agus le gluaiseacht na gceardchumann ina seasamh i gcoinne an mhargaidh atáá dhéanamh ag an Rialtas. The Government did not want to have this debate in the Dáil.The Aer Lingus Bill 2003 provided for the employee shared ownership scheme. Tagged on to that Bill were sections which enabled the Government to sell the national airline at a time of its choosing and without direct reference to the Oireachtas. The Cabinet has now taken the fateful decision to sell out our majority share in our airline. The decisions on Aer Lingus and the airports will have implications for the jobs of thousands of workers and the future of the economy.

Nuair a chuala mé cinneadh an Rialtais an tseachtain seo caite, ní raibh an dara rogha agam ach an dúshlán a thabhairt do gach Teachta seasamh go soiléir ar son nó in aghaidh Aer Lingus mar chomhlacht Stáit. Tá an rogha sin ag gach Teachta sa vótáil anocht.I thank all Deputies who have participated in the debate, especially those who will support the motion. Deputies are being given a very clear choice tonight to vote for or against the sell-off and sell-out of our national airline. There can be no fudging now. The difference between the Sinn Féin motion and the Government amendment is clear and stark.The privatisation of Aer Lingus is being carried out in the manner of a classic Fianna Fáil stroke. The final decision was a very long time in coming and there were many nods and winks to supporters and opponents of privatisation. While the Aer Lingus Act 2004 left the way open for the Government to make the decision, it held off and public opinion has been softened up over the period since. As the Taoiseach's party continued to vacillate over the options to develop Dublin Airport, it found a way to play down the momentous decision to privatise Aer Lingus. The Dublin Airport terminal saga was played out as a battle royal between the Progressive Democrats Party and Fianna Fáil in Cabinet. This allowed Fianna Fáil to give the impression that in last week's Cabinet decision it had won out over its Progressive Democrats Party partners by deciding the second terminal would be built and owned by the Dublin Airport Authority.The Progressive Democrats Party's daft and unworkable proposal was for a second terminal owned by private interests and competing with the neighbouring first terminal, which scenario aviation experts assure us is unknown anywhere in the world. We are expected to believe that because the Progressive Democrats Party did not get all it wanted at Dublin Airport, Fianna Fáil has won a great victory. In the minds of many, the Progressive Democrats Party has won because its privatisation ideology is now the ideology of Fianna Fáil. The Progressive Democrats Party has gained one of the prizes it has always wanted which is the privatisation of our national airline, Aer Lingus. Unfortunately, the sleight of hand of the Government parties has been facilitated by many in the media who have never questioned the economic dogma of the Progressive Democrats Party and Fianna Fáil.We should be very clear that this decision is based on dogma. While those of us on the left who oppose privatisation are always accused of purely ideological motives, in this case the ideology is all on the side of the privatisers. No commercial case has been presented for the sale of the State's majority shareholding in Aer Lingus. While Aer Lingus will need investment, we do not know what funding it will require to develop its business or how much the Government sell-out will yield. The Government's previous claim that it cannot invest in Aer Lingus owing to EU rules has been completely discredited. Last week's disastrous Cabinet decision closes completely the option of State investment.In his reply to the motion last night, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, failed to provide a convincing rebuttal of the argument that in the case of Aer Lingus "it ain't broken, so don't fix it". Aer Lingus is a State company which has been returned to record profitability since the crisis of 2001, largely owing to the sacrifices of the workforce, many members of which were laid off. The taxpayer has invested in the company over decades and the investment has been repaid handsomely. The benefits in tourism, business generally and the employment provided by Aer Lingus and the aviation industry are incalculable.The Minister for Finance tried to have it both ways in his contribution. He recognised Aer Lingus as a strategic national asset on the basis of which he promoted the Government's retention of a minority shareholding. He staunchly defended privatisation knowing that once the sell-off happens, all bets are off. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, knows that too. Our most vital transport link to the rest of the world is to go from public ownership to the open market. We are told the Government will retain strategic shares, which interest the Minister, Deputy Cullen, has restated. While we are told the name of the company will be retained, no guarantees have been offered. Nobody on the Government benches has shared such details with the House. There will be nothing to stop multinational interests buying up the company and disposing of it as they please.

That sums up the priorities of the party.Ultimately, nothing will prevent Aer Lingus from being forced along the Ryanair route whereby trade unions are banned and standards lowered. We can be sure potential buyers will challenge in Irish and European courts anything they consider to be a restriction or undue regulation. Potential buyers will demand changes before they put their money into the company. They will demand the removal of any conditions laid down by the Government. Pressure will mount and they will get their way because the Government recognises already that this is its intent. Certainly, we recognise it. All this has been dismissed by the Government as scaremongering, but it was noteworthy in the speech of the Minister for Finance last night that he made no reply to the points we and other Deputies made about the privatisation of Telecom Éireann. That was presented by the Government as a retention by the people of a strategic national asset through the public share offer. We warned at the time that privatisation would be against the public interest, but we were dismissed as scaremongers. The Minister should hold his head in shame. Even the most vehement opponents of privatisation at that time hardly predicted the debacle that took place. The only thing the Minister is interested in is putting more money in the pockets of Tony O'Reilly and the rest of——

My concern is that since that time little enough in practical terms has happened in various locations around the country, particularly in Clonakilty where I live and Cork South-West, which I represent.However, we have had a number of reports in the meantime. We had a report in March last year, a second report in July last year from the decentralisation implementation group and a further report in September last year which was an analysis of the application registered with the central applications facility. In addition, the decentralisation implementation group published a report on 24 November 2004 and I have been informed that the group will report again. We were to receive its report in spring this year but I understand it will be published shortly.The Office of Public Works was given primary responsibility for delivering the property aspects of the decentralisation programme. Approximately 200 public and civil servants volunteered under the CAF system to decentralise to Clonakilty in west Cork. They have contacted me and other public representatives to know when they will be facilitated with office accommodation. They and their families made a decision that they will decentralise in some cases from Dublin and in other cases from other locations to west Cork. Members of their families are signing on for primary and secondary schools and applying to third level institutes. Therefore, these want to know when the accommodation will be available.There is nobody twisting anybody's arm or pressurising or intimidating anybody. These are public and civil servants who have already volunteered to move to Clonakilty. When can we expect office accommodation will be available for civil and public servants who have volunteered to decentralise? When will work commence on the programme to provide those facilities in Clonakilty? I want to hear when that will happen.I look forward to the Minister of State hopefully giving me good news on this matter.

He would normally be in my position answering matters raised on the Adjournment. He selected a particular matter to raise and has been in touch with me a good deal about it.I am delighted to have this opportunity to discuss this matter in the House. As the Deputy said, Clonakilty, County Cork, was identified as the new location for BIM in the December 2003 announcement of the decentralisation programme. Subsequently, the Government decided that the marine division of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources would also be decentralised to Clonakilty. A total of 215 jobs are now earmarked for Clonakilty, 121 from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and 94 from BIM.The November 2004 report of the decentralisation implementation group identified Clonakilty as one of the first phase locations in the programme, with BIM being one of the seven State bodies included in this phase.The OPW, as the State's property agent, has been charged with the task of sourcing suitable accommodation for the decentralising Departments or agencies. Following an extensive search for a property solution in Clonakilty, the OPW identified several potential property options. These were subjected by the OPW to detailed technical and feasibility studies, involving architectural, valuation and engineering input. The clients, BIM and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, were also consulted as to their preferred options.The evaluation process terminated in a number of sites being shortlisted. Negotiations on terms and conditions were initiated with the owners of these sites. Negotiations recently concluded and have resulted in agreement to purchase a three acre site in the town. The contract for sale is currently with the Chief State Solicitor for approval and all going well the expectation is that the purchase will be completed very shortly.Expressions of interest have been received from developers interested in providing the new office accommodation in Clonakilty. These are being shortlisted and tender documents are in the process of being finalised. The aim is to have a contractor on site, hopefully by the end of this year.In order to maintain the distinctive identities of both decentralising bodies, a campus style development is envisaged comprising separate stand-alone office accommodation, shared canteen and conference facilities and separate laboratory-kitchen facilities for the BIM Seafood Development Centre.Therefore, there is good news for the Deputy and I look forward to all this happening. It is important the Deputy puts down an Adjournment matter to the Ministers in charge of the Department to ensure their personnel are ready.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	653	I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has good news for me too. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue. In the three years I have been a Member of the House, I have often raised issues relating to my constituency. I remind colleagues I represent Dublin South-West which embraces Brittas, Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills and, of course, Tallaght.Tallaght has become the third largest population centre in the country. We often talk about Tallaght and the fact it has the population of a city but the status of a village. Since the Square opened on 23 October 1990, the situation has changed dramatically in Tallaght. The Ceann Comhairle does not like me reminding him but he played a significant role in that regard when, as a former Minister for Health, he progressed Tallaght hospital which will celebrate its seventh birthday this year.I invite all colleagues to visit Tallaght, in particular the Minister of State. One can travel to Tallaght quite easily now on the good roads and on the excellent Luas. I have a problem with the bus service but that is an issue for another occasion. In Tallaght, one will see all the facilities one would expect in a major population centre. We have the council headquarters, the district library, the hospital, which I already mentioned, the Square with more than 128 shops, seven major stores and 12 cinemas and the institute of technology which provides great opportunities for people and works with local second level schools.It is important I am positive about Tallaght. Tallaght has a large and young population. We estimate there are approximately 25,000 young people in all the excellent schools in Tallaght. One must understand, therefore, that we are entitled to fight as hard as we must with all the other centres in respect of job creation.Unfortunately, in recent times, there have been job losses in Tallaght and this Adjournment debate highlights the fact that while we welcome the reorganisation of the Jacobs Fruitfield plant, it has led to the shedding of 40 jobs. That is something which concerns us. It is not just a numbers game. If one understands the point I made about the population and the age profile, Tallaght needs more jobs and not fewer. Each time we lose jobs, things become much more difficult.It is important the Minister, the Department and particularly the State agencies charged with the responsibility of bringing jobs to our country understand that Tallaght must fight its corner. It is important Tallaght gets more job announcements rather than job loss announcements. This Adjournment debate aims to highlight that.Will the Minister of State convey to his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin, the need to take a particular interest in Tallaght? I have no argument with any other part of the country but there is a case to be made for Tallaght. If one looks at the figures in respect of Tallaght, it is a well-worn path as far as the Department's considerations are concerned. It is very important something definite is done. I hope there are no more job losses in Tallaght and I applaud the various employers there and the chamber of commerce which does a tremendous job.Tallaght is a great and positive place and is a good location for employers. The Minister of State would be very welcome if he would like to take up my invitation to visit Tallaght. I would be happy to show him around and show him all the positive things, particularly the Garda station which needs redevelopment. The Taoiseach is visiting on Friday, so the Minister of State would be very welcome. I hope he takes account of what I have said. Tallaght needs jobs and not job losses.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	654	I thank Deputy O'Connor for raising this matter. He reminds me a little of the new sports advertisement for a particular drink whereby each time one takes a swig, one gets an extra €500. I think he used the word "Tallaght" about 35 times. We are in no doubt about where the Deputy comes from and where he stands on the issue.Between 35 and 40 redundancies are being sought by the Jacobs Fruitfield Food Group as part of a programme to secure its future. I understand the company hopes to achieve the redundancies on a voluntary basis. A restructuring process is being implemented as part of an overall programme to improve efficiencies and I understand it will involve significant changes in work practices which are necessary to help ensure the continuation of manufacturing at the group's Belgard Road biscuit plant. The consolidation of production is expected to result in a more efficient and competitive biscuit manufacturing operation which will secure the long-term future of the company. The overall group employs 550 people, including 394 at the biscuit plant.The industrial development agencies continue to market the Tallaght area for new jobs and investment. IDA Ireland's strategy for the Tallaght area is to attract and expand major foreign direct investment projects. Tallaght continues to be actively marketed by IDA Ireland to potential investors and is well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment. Tallaght benefits from having a third level institute, the Institute of Technology Tallaght, and excellent infrastructural facilities nearby at City West and Grange Castle in Clondalkin.Wyeth Biopharma employs approximately 700 people in Clondalkin and this figure is expected to rise to 1,300 by the end of the year. The Japanese pharmaceuticals company, Takeda Chemical Industries, which will employ 60 people, has also begun construction in Clondalkin. At City West, project developments by SAP Support Services, AOL Technologies Ireland Limited and Colgate-Palmolive Support Services employ 460, 204 and 80 people, respectively, and they provide locally accessible employment opportunities.Following agreement last year, Enterprise Ireland is supporting the development of business incubation space at the Institute of Technology Tallaght. This facility is expected to generate quality start-up enterprises emanating from college research. The development agencies continue to work with existing companies to assist them to move up the value chain and increase employment potential. IDA Ireland provides financial assistance to companies in this regard and companies like Colgate Palmolive and Xilinx in City West have availed of the incentives. The involvement of companies in research and development and assistance for research and development are vital for further growth.Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start up companies which possess the capability of rapid growth in employment and exports, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the capability of companies through its strong support of research both in the companies themselves and in third level institutions.To increase employment in Tallaght, Enterprise Ireland has worked closely with South Dublin County Council, South Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the local county enterprise board over recent years to plan, fund and construct four community enterprise centres in Tallaght. These centres provide incubation space for start-ups and micro-enterprises and also provide ancillary services such as training, mentoring and customised courses to address the needs of the local clients.In the case of job losses, the full services of FÁS, particularly in regard to retraining and upskilling, are made available to any workers who wish to avail of those services. In addition, FÁS provides a vocational guidance and referral service to all job seekers in the Tallaght area, In the particular case in question, arrangements have already been made by FÁS to contact the company.Job losses and job gains have always been, and will continue to be, part of the economic landscape. However, overall our unemployment rate is among the lowest in Europe. In that context, the latest Central Statistics Office live register analysis shows that those claiming unemployment benefit in Tallaght fell to 3,279 in April 2005 from 3,513 in April last year, a drop of 234 people.I assure the Deputy that the State development agencies under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will continue to work closely together and with local interests in promoting Tallaght for job creation and investment. I am satisfied the strong infrastructural supports already in place, including the opening of the Luas, will continue to attract investment and jobs to Tallaght and the surrounding areas.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	655	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. Kerry's economy has a strong traditional foundation built on tourism and agribusiness. Over the past 40 years, manufacturing companies have been attracted to the county with a particular focus on engineering, textiles and electronics. The profile of business is complemented by pharmaceutical and medical device companies and a growing technology sector fostered by the development Kerry technology park and the Institute of Technology Tralee.However, global competitiveness and the decline in national competitiveness have resulted in massive upheaval in the business sector in the county. More than 2,000 redundancies have been notified to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment since 2000. For example, since 2002 only 335 jobs have been created in IDA-supported companies but 1,275 jobs have been lost. These figures were supplied by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Between February 2001 and February 2005 the number of people on the live register has increased by almost 1,000. In February 2001 the number was 5,860 and in February 2005 it was 6,803.Furthermore, poor infrastructure provision accentuates the peripherality of Kerry, making it less attractive to potential sources of foreign direct investment. Kerry is not attracting foreign direct investment. Of greater concern is the absence of visits by potential investors. No targets for foreign direct investment appear to have been set for Kerry. Feedback from companies reveals that there is no apparent plan of action to attract investment to the county. IDA Ireland has organised few itineraries to County Kerry which is a cause of great concern.The lack of foreign direct investment in the county sets it apart from other areas which have benefited significantly from investment by multinationals. The provision of modern infrastructure is crucial to changing this situation. The attraction of foreign direct investment and the modernisation of the county's infrastructure will not only increase employment in Kerry but will also result in more balanced regional development.Industrial activity in County Kerry is far smaller in scale than that in Cork and in most other Munster counties. For example, in 2002, the most recent year for which relevant Central Statistics Office data are available, Kerry accounted for 1% of all industrial output in the State, compared with Cork's contribution of25%, Limerick's 10% and Tipperary's 6.7%. In 2003 and 2004 Kerry's unemployment figures did not reflect the national trend which registered a substantial reduction in the number of redundancies in 2004.The Forfás employment forecast suggests that the textiles, clothing and agricultural sectors would be most prone to employment losses in the future. This trend has been particularly damaging to County Kerry which has a disproportionate share of agency assisted employment in industrial sectors vulnerable to job losses. In comparison with Cork, County Kerry attracts a negligible share of high value added investment in sectors such as financial international services.I am pleased the Minister of State is here this evening and I hope he will pass this message to the senior Minister at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin. To reverse this trend all the State agencies should adopt a clear co-ordinated approach to promoting County Kerry as a location for sustainable value added businesses.IDA Ireland is responsible for attracting foreign direct investment projects to Kerry. This includes greenfield projects and expansion of existing operations. Enterprise Ireland is responsible for the promotion of indigenous enterprise in south Kerry, while Shannon Development has responsibility for this function in north Kerry. It is important that all these agencies come together in a co-ordinated way.Infrastructure is a critical issue in investment decision making. A region with deficits in any area of infrastructure is at a serious disadvantage in terms of attracting foreign direct investment and supporting indigenous industry and employment. Therefore, investment in the county's airport, rail and road network, telecommunications and waste management is critical to the economic growth of the region.The enterprise strategy group report, Ahead of the Curve, classified infrastructure as an essential condition. The Government must commit to a full range of infrastructural projects for County Kerry and accelerate the introduction of the critical national infrastructure Bill promised in 2004. The region can then work towards delivering the remaining elements of the competitiveness equation as outlined in Ahead of the Curve.I call on the Minister of State and the chief executive of IDA Ireland to visit Kerry immediately to meet a representative group, including the county manager, SIPTU, IBEC, the local chambers of commerce, SFADCo and any other relevant agency, to discuss a way forward and prioritise Kerry for foreign direct investment. I have requested the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, Deputy Cassidy, to bring that committee to Kerry, to do as it did in Wexford and will do in Cork in the coming weeks. It can discuss with local interests the challenge of bringing employment to the county.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	656	I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.IDA Ireland is the agency responsible for attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland. At the end of 2004 there were 2,022 people in permanent employment in 21 IDA Ireland supported companies in County Kerry. There is a diverse range of companies located in Kerry representing a variety of industry sectors such as pharmaceuticals, engineering and consumer products.IDA Ireland continues to promote Kerry actively to potential investors from across the sectors in either manufacturing or international services via its network of overseas offices and project divisions and makes every effort to secure new investments for the area.The investment projects that IDA Ireland seeks to win for Ireland as a whole are in more advanced, higher value activities in both manufacturing and services. Such projects are often related to research activities and require high level skills, infrastructure and business services, generating more high value products, services and jobs.IDA Ireland's strategy for Kerry has a sectoral focus and is concentrated on achieving developments in the international services, engineering and ICT sectors, focusing particularly on the national spatial strategy-designated linked hubs of Tralee and Killarney, which are the principal towns in north and south Kerry respectively. Other primary urban centres include Listowel, Kenmare, Killorglin and Cahirciveen.To continue to improve the attractiveness of south Kerry as a location for inward investment, IDA Ireland commenced site development works on its business and technology park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, County Kerry. The site area totals 4.66 hectares, approximately 12 acres. This site development work, which is now complete, involved significant landscaping, access development and site clearance work, all of which has resulted in the upgrading of the overall appeal of the location. The work undertaken has cost in the region of €1 million.In addition, a local group of business people, under the business expansion scheme, have completed a new building of 14,716 sq. ft. on a site acquired from IDA Ireland in the IDA Ireland business and technology park, Tiernaboul, Killarney. IDA Ireland is actively marketing this facility as an alternative property solution to present to potential investors, but to date no client interest has been expressed.Shannon Development is responsible for the provision of property solutions in north Kerry. IDA Ireland is actively marketing the Kerry technology park, adjacent to the institute of technology in Tralee, and the Listowel development centre as property solutions to potential overseas investors.Under the framework of the national spatial strategy, IDA Ireland is participating in the regional planning guidelines process, with the South Western Regional Authority, to help give focus and priority to investment and development in Kerry. This will help support the effective internal development of the hub towns of Killarney and Tralee and will create the environment demanded by overseas investors, particularly in the areas of critical mass, infrastructure and the provision of high quality competitive telecommunications services.Fundamental to regional success is the quality, calibre and drive of the third level education infrastructure in the region. Universities and institutes of technology are the foundations for development of more advanced economies. Kerry and the region are well served by the progressive and forward-thinking third level institutions such as the Tralee Institute of Technology, the universities of Limerick and Cork and the Cork Institute of Technology. IDA Ireland continues to work closely with these institutes in the development of new areas of opportunity through IDA Ireland's strategic business group and towards greater industry collaboration and research through its education skills and research group.All these investments and initiatives will put Kerry in a position to compete more strongly for inward investment in the ICT, engineering and international services sectors. However, it should be recalled that, ultimately, decisions regarding where to locate a project, including what areas to visit as potential locations, are taken by overseas investors, not by IDA Ireland.In addition to targeting potential new projects, IDA Ireland continues to work with the existing base of companies in the region with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and diversification of activities, which strengthen their presence in the region. This is as important as attracting new investment into a region.Three such new expansion projects were announced in Kerry in 2004. Dollinger (Ireland) Limited, which has been in Killarney for over 20 years, is to be the global centre for production for its compressed air products range. Dollinger Ireland will have global responsibility for the development of this product. This €1.1 million investment creates over 70 new jobs over the next four years and has resulted in Dollinger relocating to larger premises in the IDA Ireland business park in the town. Liebherr Container Cranes Limited, which has been in Killarney for 46 years and is one of the longest established lDA Ireland supported companies in Ireland, is to recruit six highly skilled research and development personnel for a new research and development specialised team. The team, which will be of strategic importance to the parent company and will enhance the facility's role as the centre of control for Liebherr's container crane products, will develop products from concept through to product launch. In addition, any intellectual property developed will be the property of the Irish company.In 2004, Fujisawa, one of the world's top 30 pharmaceutical companies, announced it had invested £17 million in the expansion of its Irish operation, Fujisawa Ireland Limited in Killorglin, County Kerry. The company has a total employment of 280 and has constructed a 27,000 sq. ft. extension to provide additional production space for the new operation. The Fujisawa plant in Killorglin is a pharmaceutical finishing plant and was established in 1991 with IDA Ireland support. Although initially proposed to employ only 27 employees it has grown significantly over the years to its current employment level of 280.As Ireland is no longer a low cost location, it has found itself less able to compete on an international basis for basic manufacturing investment as other low cost economies — for example, India, China and the eastern European locations are now winning these types of mobile investment. In tandem with this, the global economic slowdown has meant there are fewer companies actively seeking to invest and consequently fewer companies visiting Ireland.This means that the companies that decide to visit Ireland today have more sophisticated business requirements. Their key requirements in determining where they will visit, and consequently where they will potentially locate, tend to centre on the following: a high quality business environment with a large population base, ease of international access, proximity to other similar types of companies, adjacent to a third level college and often located on a business and technology park with high quality telecommunications infrastructure and top class buildings. As with other locations in Ireland, not all of these requirements can be met in Kerry and this is an inhibitor to attracting overseas investment.IDA Ireland, however, continues to actively promote Kerry to potential investors from across all sectors, with every effort being made to secure new investments for the area. I am confident its efforts will be rewarded and have every confidence in its ability to succeed.I will convey the Deputy's invitation to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin. I look forward, with my political responsibility, to my visit to Kerry next week.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	659	I am conscious of the need to manage in an orderly way the redeployment of the 400 staff being released between now and January 2006 and a number of steps have been taken in this regard. In early 2004, following discussions with the unions and staff associations, my Department adopted a policy of recruiting only temporary staff to fill vacancies, where possible and appropriate. As a result, my Department currently has close on 80 temporary staff whose contracts terminate before 2006. This will greatly facilitate the adjustments that must be made consequent on the introduction of the single payment scheme.In February of this year the Government decided to redeploy up to 300 staff to the Garda Síochána. Arising from that decision, it is proposed to redeploy staff from my offices in Castlebar and surrounding towns to the Garda national data quality assurance bureau, which it is intended will operate the PULSE system from Michael Davitt House in Castlebar. Detailed planning for the implementation of this proposal is ongoing and involves the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda. This will provide a welcome and opportune means of redeploying a large number of agriculture staff, up to 160, who will become free in Castlebar and surrounding offices towards the end of the year.My Department has also opened discussions with other Departments with substantial networks of local offices, particularly the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and will transfer staff to fill vacancies in those Departments as the opportunity arises. Discussions with staff associations and the Department of Finance on the issues that such transfers inevitably give rise to are ongoing.At an early stage in the process, a sub-committee of my Department's departmental council was established to assist in managing the change process in terms of the various work and staff changes that will occur and in defining the basic principles to apply in the context of the redeployment of staff. Assuming the continuing co-operation of unions and Departments, the approaches listed above should allow staff that are freed up to be redeployed to work in other Departments with the minimum of delay.However, it must be recognised that there continues to be exceptional work demands on the Department in 2005. The single payment scheme involves €1.3 billion to be paid to over 130,000 farmers in December. At the same time, some €400 million under the old coupled schemes has to be delivered, largely by 30 June, and €230 million is due to be paid to 100,000 farmers under the disadvantaged area scheme by late September. To deal with this exceptional work load many staff that are currently being freed up in local offices throughout the country are being transferred on a temporary basis to urgent work on the single payment scheme in Portlaoise.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	660	The report of the national task force on obesity is to be welcomed and I congratulate John Treacy and his team on their professional approach to their task.Obesity is an immensely important issue for the future health of our society. It demands a multi-faceted response, including a proactive approach by the food industry. As the report bears out, there is no single or simple solution to tackling the problem of obesity. This problem must be approached with the full participation of all players, Government, health authorities, educationalists, industry and, of course, the individual. The participation and co-operation of all these stakeholders is essential if we, as a nation, are to meet the challenge of obesity. For that reason, I share the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach when launching the report of the national task force on obesity that the IBEC initiative to establish the Nutrition and Health Foundation reflects the desire of the food industry to play a responsible role.The Nutrition and Health Foundation is an IBEC initiative involving industry, educators, scientists, various Government Departments and State bodies that seeks to inform the public on the variety of issues from healthy lifestyles to nutritional labelling. It has close links with the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance, IUNA, Trinity College, University College Cork and the University of Ulster at Coleraine and will disseminate its messages in a non-branded evidence based fashion. The question, therefore, of this foundation endorsing individual companies does not arise. In fact, this type of multi-stakeholder platform at national level is very much in line with the recently established EU platform for action on diet, physical activity and health.I will continue to support our valuable food industry in its efforts to secure markets at home and abroad for wholesome and quality food products. The overwhelming message from the report of the national task force on obesity is the desirability of a correct balance between healthy eating and appropriate physical activity. The food pyramid, which shows the optimum proportions of the various food groups, remains the yardstick and a variety of foods is important for healthy eating.Healthy eating coupled with appropriate physical activity is key to combating the obesity problem. Physical exercise is not, by and large, part of the modern lifestyle and we do need to be reminded every so often to get active. The prevalence of childhood obesity is a cause for concern and the recommended 60 minutes of moderate physical activity per day is an achievable goal. The scientific study on children's diet carried out by IUNA, under the sponsorship of my Department's FIRM programme and the FSAI, also bears out the rising prevalence of obesity among the younger population.This is the first comprehensive scientific evaluation of dietary intake in children in Ireland and provides direction for the dietary strategies that need to be established to prevent obesity in Irish children. Inadequate consumption of milk, fresh meat and fruit and vegetables were identified in the study. I believe that the Irish food industry is well positioned to supply and promote products to remedy this dietary deficiency. Ireland is at the cutting edge of food research and we can lead the food agenda to enhance the health and well being of our customers at home and abroad.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	661	The cost of fuel and energy, driven by international oil prices, is an issue for all parts of the economy, including the agriculture sector. The CSO wholesale price index fell by 2.3% in the 12 months to March 2005 but within this auto diesel costs increased by 18.6% and gas oil increased by 35.5%. These changes in fuel prices have contributed to recent increases in the consumer price index. Fuel and lubricants, which include petrol, diesel and motor oil, account for about 3% of the total basket of goods used in the compilation of the consumer price index. The increase in this for fuels and lubricants was 9.5% in the 12 months to April 2005.In the agriculture sector there was a similar pattern. The cost of all agricultural inputs, as measured by the agricultural inputs price index, increased by 3.5% in the 12 months to February 2005, the latest figure available. Over the same period the motor fuel costs item within the agricultural index increased by 15.1%. Silage contractors are likely to pass on these cost increases to their customers. It is important that farmers actively seek the best price available for these services.Rising input costs and fluctuations in international oil prices underline the importance of ensuring that all inputs are used efficiently. Research suggests that while many farms are operating at impressive levels of efficiency, there are others where there is considerable room for improvement. I am sure that the change to the single farm payment system and the consequentially increased focus on market returns will underline these facts and will increase the attention paid to the efficient use of inputs.

The industry's traditional reliance on commodity exports has reduced in the past decade as a prepared consumer foods industry has been developed with EU and national assistance.The National Development Plan 2000-2006 includes initiatives for marketing as well as both public good and commercial food research. These initiatives have facilitated the Irish food industry in developing new capabilities and improving access to new technologies. Progress under the national development plan is satisfactory, with commitments of €174 million undertaken between 2000 and 2004. Companies have invested in new products and new market outlets, for example, recent listings with continental buyers for high value meat products.The decoupling of direct payments from production will, I believe, further shift the emphasis away from quantity to quality production. The overriding principle in Irish food production must be that only food produced meeting consumer demands for the highest standards of food safety and quality is placed on the market. My Department works closely with other Government agencies to ensure that the highest possible national and EU standards of food safety and quality are in operation at the primary production and food processing stages. Both industry and public bodies have made a huge investment in these areas and our systems of traceability are very effective.Bord Bia, which has statutory responsibility for promotion of Irish food produce, currently operates quality assurance schemes in the beef, pigmeat, horticulture, poultry and egg sectors. These schemes complement other national initiatives and controls and demonstrate producer compliance with customer quality requirements and legislative safety provisions. They operate in an integrated fashion along the production chain, thereby providing controls from farm to table. Products produced under the higher standard requirements of these schemes can be marketed at home and abroad under the board's quality assurance mark.In co-operation with Bord Bia and the European Commission, my Department has also funded information and promotion campaigns in the milk, beef, eggs and mushrooms sectors to encourage consumption and to draw attention to the quality and nutritional value of these products. My Department will continue to play a lead role in assisting the food industry meet the challenges and increasingly exacting demands of consumer markets and so maximise returns to the industry and the economy in general.

Preliminary research completed to date indicates that the cultivation of certain crops with certain modifications may provide a financial incentive to the individual Irish farmer. While strands of this research parallel work completed in other countries it does not specifically address the costs associated with the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops.The general conclusion of Danish and UK research on the economic impact of co-existence on farm profitability is that the costs of complying with the required thresholds for crops of maize, potatoes, cereals, oil seed rape and sugar beet vary from zero to 9% above the costs of growing conventional crops. However, it should be noted that costs described were based on estimates.To establish greater clarity in the matter, as far as Irish conditions are concerned, I have asked Teagasc to explore the possibility of carrying out an evaluation of the possible national economic implications for the agri-food industry from the possible use of GMOs in crop and livestock production. Teagasc has now set up an internal working group of economists, agronomists and animal scientists to address this question in more detail and plans to publish the results of its analysis in due course.

That share has the same monetary value as any other share in the company but has conditions attached which prevent the company from engaging in a number of activities without the prior written consent of the Minister. In summary, the special share prevents the disposal of the controlling interest in Irish Sugar Ltd. or a certain percentage of the sugar assets and prevents a single shareholder or group of shareholders from gaining control of Greencore plc. I have not received any request from the company for consent to the sale of the Carlow site.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	665	In general, the rate of on-farm inspection required for cross compliance under the single payment scheme is 1% of those farmers to whom the relevant statutory management requirement or good agricultural and environmental conditions apply. However at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the animal identification and registration requirements, as this level is prescribed under the relevant regulations.In addition to cross compliance checks, it is a requirement to carry out standard eligibility checks to verify that the actual area claimed in the single payment application form corresponds with the area held by the farmer and to ensure that there are no overlapping or duplication of parcels claimed. The EU directives and regulations referred to in cross compliance are in place for many years now. Producers are generally familiar with them and are complying with the standards set in implementing them in Ireland.My Department prepared a consultative document on cross compliance in October 2004 and made it available on the Department's website for interested organisations in November 2004. Department officials met with the main farming organisations in December 2004 to discuss their submissions.An information booklet on cross compliance has been issued to all farmers and it sets out the principal features of cross compliance both in terms of the standards that must be met by farmers and the control arrangements that will be necessary. To coincide with the issue of the booklet, a series of countrywide farmer information meetings organised by my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, took place in early April. These meetings focused not only on cross compliance but also addressed the various other issues associated with the introduction of the single payment scheme.In implementing the single payment scheme, I am aiming to minimise the number of inspection visits and to move towards a situation where, in most cases, all eligibility and cross compliance checks will be carried out during a single farm visit. It is envisaged that the 22,000 or so inspections which were carried under the old regime will be significantly reduced to some 10,000 under the single payment scheme. This approach should minimise the level of inconvenience to farmers.The EU regulations governing the cross compliance sanctions system sets out a range of percentage reductions. For infringement of a legal standard a 3% reduction is proposed but this could be reduced to 1% or increased to 5% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the infringement. If the non-compliance were repeated a multiplier of three must be applied. In the case of intentional infringement, a 20% reduction is proposed but this could be reduced to 15% or increased to 100% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the infringement.My Department has recently been engaged in intensive negotiations with the farming bodies on the implementation of cross compliance under the single payment scheme in the context of drawing up a new protocol on the delivery of all of my Department's schemes and services to farmers. My Department regards the following principles as being central to the implementation of inspection arrangements under the single payment scheme: procedures that are fair, equitable, proportional and transparent; a system that is standardised to the maximum extent possible across all areas of the country; the client's rights are protected.To achieve these objectives it is necessary to put in place mechanisms that will take due account of whether any non-compliance found is on its own minor in nature, negligent or intentional. During the protocol negotiations my Department tabled a paper outlining its proposals, including a system of "weightings", to be applied for infringements of the statutory management requirements with due tolerances for minor infringements which, on their own, are regarded as inadvertent breaches capable of occurring in practical farm situations. The system became known as "the penalty points system". While there was initial reluctance to accept the Department's proposals it is premature to suggest that agreement cannot be reached. I do not intend to elaborate on the discussions which are now at a crucial stage.

The affected feed material and associated compound feed was subsequently impounded, recalled, where necessary, and detained by my Department.The first incident refers to two consignments of sugar beet pulp, totalling around 4,160 tonnes, which were imported into Dundalk port from Germany, via Holland, on 18 and 22 October 2004. Testing carried out by the competent authorities in other member states discovered similar problems with imports of this particular material. Officials in my Department examined and accepted a proposal submitted by the importer to dispose of the contaminated material and associated compound feed.In March of this year, the contaminated sugar beet pulp material was despatched under the supervision of Department officials to Holland for destruction by means of incineration at a power generation plant in that country. The dispatch of the associated compound feeding stuffs to Holland is scheduled to happen in the next few weeks and again it will be under the supervision of officials of my Department.The second incident refers to a consignment of maize gluten, totalling around 6,515 tonnes, imported from the USA and part discharged at Foynes on 9 November and part in Ringaskiddy on 11 November. The original feed material and the associated compound feed has been recalled and is currently held in a number of secure stores in the country. The importer in this case sought a judicial review in the High Court of the powers used to issue the instructions to impound and recall the affected material. The judge ruled in favour of the importer. However, on the advice of senior counsel and considering the implications of the ruling for the current EU controls on processed animal proteins, my Department has lodged an appeal of the judgment with the Supreme Court and will ask its counsel to prepare papers which will hopefully result in a reference being made to the European Court of Justice on the interpretation of EU legislation and its effect.Notwithstanding this, and without prejudice to liability, the importer has submitted a proposal to my Department for disposal of the contaminated material which involves the export of the material for incineration at a power generation plant. Officials of my Department have examined and accepted the proposal and it is anticipated that the export of the material will be carried out shortly under strict supervision.

It is also in place for beef up to the point of entry to the restaurant and catering sector. However, labelling is not obligatory at the point of consumption in the restaurant. With the joint aims of protecting consumer interests and to ensure that the consumer is properly informed as to the origin of beef served in this sector, it is my intention to proceed with a legal requirement that the country of origin must be displayed in respect of beef served on such premises once the legal options allowing for this development have been examined.The Attorney General advised that new or amending primary legislation would be required to implement such rules. As the primary responsibility for food labelling in general rests with the Department of Health and Children, I have initiated correspondence on the matter with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children. Discussions are currently ongoing between officials of both our Departments with a view to progressing the required legislation as soon as possible.

This agreement covers export refunds, export credits, the trade distorting practices of state trading enterprises and food aid not in conformity with disciplines to be introduced.I am satisfied that this approach should ensure equal competition on the world market for all exporters. The full detailed implementation of the framework agreement is the subject of ongoing negotiations. It is hoped to conclude the negotiations on a new agreement at the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005.

Those regulations were introduced following a review of the existing legislation and served to streamline arrangements for the authorisation of plant protection products for minor uses. I expect, on the basis of an ongoing review being carried out in my Department of arrangements for regulating the distribution and use of plant protection products, that additional amending legislation will be introduced before the end of 2005 to further strengthen the regulatory system.Officials of my Department take an active part in the ongoing review of EU legislation on the authorisation, distribution and use of plant protection products in the context of the updating of the existing regime and the development of the Commission's thematic strategy on sustainable use of plant protection products.

In October last, Ireland submitted an action programme to the European Commission for further implementation of the nitrates directive. In December, the Commission conveyed its view that the action programme was not complete and did not comply with the requirements of the directive or with the judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland, which had been delivered in March 2004.Subsequently, my Department worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the preparation of an initial response to the Commission. This response was sent on 20 April. A revised action programme, on which my Department has been consulted, is being finalised. Ireland has already submitted proposals for a derogation from the general limits laid down in the nitrates directive, designed to allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. They were developed by my Department and Teagasc in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The Commission has stated that it will not consider the application for a derogation until the action programme is agreed and in place but I am hopeful for a favourable outcome.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	671	The EU Commission outlined its initial ideas for reform of the EU sugar regime in a communication to the Council and the European Parliament last July. The communication was the subject of technical discussions at Council working group level in Brussels and there was a policy debate at the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in November.The European Commission's initial ideas for reform would, if adopted, have serious repercussions for sugar beet growing and processing in this country and I have made it clear in discussions in the Council of Ministers that they are unacceptable. Ireland is in a group of ten member states with shared concerns about the Commission's proposals in their current form and we made a joint ministerial submission to the Commission outlining these concerns.The next step will be the publication of formal legislative proposals by the Commission which are expected to be published on 22 June. The recent ruling by the WTO appellate body will certainly add to the pressure for reform and there have been suggestions that when the reform proposals emerge they may be even more severe than originally anticipated. Therefore, we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge facing us when the reform proposals come before the Council of Ministers in the autumn. In the forthcoming negotiations on the reform proposals, my overall objective will be to ensure that the future shape of the EU sugar regime is consistent with the continuation of an efficient sugar beet growing and processing industry in this country.

This premium was in addition to any premia received in respect of the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes. Producers who received the extensification premium during the reference years will continue to have this premium reflected in their single payment entitlements.Producers who participate in organic farming have access to additional payments through the rural environment protection scheme. The circumstances surrounding organic farming are not considered to satisfy the force majeure criteria under the single payment scheme regulations.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	673	MRSA, or methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, is an antibiotic resistant bacterium, the presence of which in humans was noted over 35 years ago and which has been a feature of antibiotic resistance in human therapy since. During the last two years, the presence of the bacterium has been noted in dogs and horses. It is thought that the route of infection has been from pet owners and veterinary practitioners.As I indicated in response to a Parliamentary Question on 5 May last, I am aware that Veterinary Ireland has earlier this year circulated its members advising them of the problem, of how to deal with cases and of procedures to be adopted to minimise risk of transmission in their practices. Veterinary Ireland has also asked practitioners to inform animal owners of the risks which can arise from contact with companion animals infected with the bacterium. I fully support this initiative.In terms of co-ordinating a response at national level to this problem, given that this is primarily a human health issue, actions are being co-ordinated by the national disease surveillance centre. My Department's laboratories carry out antimicrobial surveillance testing on food animals as part of ongoing monitoring of antibiotic resistance trends in zoonotic bacteria in food producing animals. To date, there is no evidence that MRSA is an issue of concern in food animals in Ireland or, indeed, elsewhere.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	674	The food labelling group, which was established in July 2002, presented its report in December 2002. Notwithstanding that food labelling is a particularly complicated and broad based area, substantial progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations of the report. Nineteen of the 21 recommendations, many of which were beyond the remit of my Department and some of which were to be activated only after others had been completed, have been addressed. I am hopeful that the remaining two recommendations, which relate to aspects of origin labelling, can be implemented shortly.The two main issues that emerged from the recommendations of the labelling group related to the need to centralise enforcement in one agency and the definition of origin. The position, in December 2002, regarding responsibility for food labelling was that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment had policy responsibility for the main legislation for the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, that is, the European Council Directive 2000/13/EC. The Director of Consumer Affairs was responsible for the enforcement of that directive.The Department of Health and Children was responsible for policy on other food labelling legislation, such as nutrition claims and novel foods, with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, having responsibility for enforcement of the legislation. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was responsible for the policy on labelling of fish and fish products, with the FSAI again responsible for enforcement. My Department was responsible for policy relating to legislation on the labelling of specific products ranging from beef, poultry and sugar to spirit drinks, coffee and fruit juices. The FSAI was responsible for the enforcement of the beef labelling regulations and the health boards operated the controls on the other products under the general aegis of my Department.The position now, following implementation of the food labelling group recommendation, is that enforcement of all food labelling regulations has been centralised in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. This will not only streamline the enforcement measures but will also provide a one-stop shop for any complaints on mislabelling of food. As part of the centralisation of enforcement, the centralisation of food labelling policy, with the exception of fish, in both the Department of Health and Children and my Department was undertaken in accordance with another recommendation of the food labelling group.There was full agreement within the food labelling group that consumers have a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat out. While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers' wishes in this area. The consumer liaison panel has carried out this research, the results of which were presented in December 2003.I am determined, in so far as it is within the powers available to me, to meet the wishes of consumers, as identified in the research. Early in 2004, two regulations were introduced on the labelling of poultry meat. The first of these regulations requires poultry meat, loose and pre-packaged, originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises. The second requires information regarding class, price per unit weight, condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose poultry meat, that is, non-prepackaged, to be provided to the consumer.In addition, each sector is being reviewed on a commodity by commodity basis to identify any deficiencies, from a consumer viewpoint, in the labelling regulations for those commodities.In the beef sector, EU beef labelling regulations, which are extremely comprehensive, do not currently require beef sold in the food service outlets to have country of origin displayed. The European Commission published a review of these regulations at the end of April 2004. The report does not favour the extension of these regulations to the catering sector. However, I believe that consumers, whether they are purchasing beef over the counter in butcher shops or supermarkets or opting for beef in restaurants and catering establishments, have the right to know the origin of the product and the labelling regulation should provide for this. It is my intention to proceed with a national legal requirement that country of origin must be displayed in respect of beef sold in such premises and outlets. The legal mechanisms to bring this into effect are under examination.On the food labelling issue in general, my primary aim is to protect consumer interest and to ensure that the consumer is properly informed. Ireland is a major exporter of food and food products and, indeed, there are also considerable imports, so it is imperative that the same standards are applied to the labelling of foods in every sector and that there is a level playing field for the food industry at all levels. In this context, my Department has pursued assiduously the implementation, in as full a manner as possible, of the recommendations of the food labelling group.At a meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 28 February this year I indicated my views on labelling of foodstuffs and I, along with a number of member states, asked the Commission to examine how best food labelling should be handled at EU level to best protect the interests of the consumer.

I have already raised the issue with the Commissioner on a number of occasions. My Department has also forwarded a detailed submission to the European Commission dealing with this matter. I am urging that appropriate measures be taken to alleviate the difficulties encountered by beef farmers in Ireland, directly as a result of the ending of the special beef premium scheme in 2004.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	676	Following the coming into force, on 21 April, of the EU Commission Decision 2005/317/EC on emergency measures regarding the non-authorised genetically modified organism "Bt10" in maize products, my Department has introduced a requirement that all imports of maize gluten feed and distillers dried grains originating from the USA be accompanied by an original analytical certificate to demonstrate that Bt10 maize is not present. My Department has also introduced a system whereby samples of these imports are randomly taken and sent to the State Laboratory for analysis to confirm the absence of Bt10.The European Food Safety Authority has concluded that this incident does not constitute an immediate public health risk, a position fully endorsed by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	677	The designation of land under the EU birds and habitats directives is a function of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The question of compensation for farmers in the Shannon callows area is a matter, in the first instance, for that Department and I understand that discussions on the matter with the farming bodies have been going on for some time and are not yet concluded.As far as REPS is concerned, I have already introduced arrangements designed specifically to address the situation of farmers in the Shannon callows. Farmers in this area who wish to join REPS but believe that the REPS payments do not fully offset any income loss arising from the restrictions placed on their farming activities because of designation under the directives, may now also apply to the national parks and wildlife service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for additional compensation.Before this arrangement was introduced in September 2004, they had to choose between REPS and the compensation arrangements operated by NPWS but could not benefit from both. Since farmers in the Shannon callows are thus provided with a means by which they are guaranteed full compensation, it is difficult to see how there could be justification for even more advantageous arrangements.This further concession was additional to the inclusion of a new supplementary measure in REPS when REPS 3 was introduced in June 2004. Designated areas are already eligible for payments under REPS measure A of €242 per hectare for the first 40 hectares and lesser amounts for areas over 40 hectares and the new supplementary measure provides for an additional payment of €100 per hectare on particular sites in the callows which are important corncrake habitats. Those sites are monitored by BirdWatch Ireland and REPS farmers can qualify for the additional payment by subscribing to BirdWatch Ireland management prescriptions for them.REPS is a highly successful agri-environment measure and is acknowledged as such by the European Commission. One of the features of REPS which the Commission has commended is the fact that the whole farm is subjected to the full range of basic undertakings. This model has served Irish farmers well since the introduction of REPS in 1994 and it is not my intention to depart from the whole farm approach to accommodate a situation which I believe I have already addressed adequately.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	678	I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 68 and 89 together.Under the EU sugar regime, each member state has a quota for manufactured sugar. There is no quota for sugar beet nor is there a quota at farm level. The EU regulations stipulate that the quota must be made available to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. Accordingly, in Ireland the entire sugar quota is processed by Irish Sugar Ltd., which is the only sugar manufacturer in this country. Irish Sugar Ltd. places annual contracts with farmers to grow a specified tonnage of sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota.The question of ownership of the sugar quota has never been an issue in the past because the EU regulations do not provide for the buying and selling of quota. However, the status of the quota has become the subject of debate since the Commission raised the possibility of cross-border quota mobility in the context of the proposed reform of the EU sugar regime. Several member states, including Ireland, are strongly opposed to the idea of quota mobility but if it is maintained in the Commission's legislative proposals, due to be published on 22 June, then the Commission will propose appropriate rules to deal with the new situation. I have sought the advice of the Attorney General in that context but my objective will be to ensure that the status quo is maintained and that cross border mobility of quota is not allowed.The decision by Greencore to close its plant in Carlow and to consolidate all its sugar manufacturing in Mallow was a commercial decision taken by the board on 12 January 2005. The company advised my Department two days in advance of the board meeting that a proposal concerning the future of its two processing plants and involving the likely closure of the Carlow plant would be put to the board for decision.

Trade in sheep between member states of the European Union is subject to the provisions of, inter alia, Council Directive 2003/50/EC which amends Council Directive 91/68/EEC, as regards reinforced controls on the movement of sheep and goats.The controls provide as a minimum requirement, that breeding and fattening sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding for at least 30 days prior to export and that no sheep or goats had been introduced on to the holding in the 21 days prior to export. Slaughter sheep must also be certified as having been continuously resident on the holding of origin for at least 21 days prior to export and are also subject to a "standstill" period of 21 days prior to dispatch during which no sheep or goats have been introduced on to the holding of origin.These controls were introduced in the aftermath of the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 and came into effect on 1 July 2004. It is not possible to unilaterally change these rules.

The authority has a proactive inspection and enforcement programme, Programme of Work 2005, which focuses on high risk sectors, including agriculture, and aims to achieve an improvement in farm safety and an increase in the percentage of farms with safety statements.I regard this issue as very important and I am committed to ensuring that the farming sector improves its safety record. During my term as Minister I intend to take a close interest in this area and give every encouragement to those who are committed to tackling what is a serious problem in Irish farming.

The costs of all agricultural inputs as measured by this index increased by 3.5% in the 12 months to February 2005, the latest figure available. Two of the major factors in the 3.5% increase to February 2005 were the rise of 15.1% in the cost of motor fuels and 10.2% in the cost of electricity. The comparable figure for 2004 was a fall of 8.3% in the cost of motor fuels, while electricity prices rose by 3.0%.There is no doubt that the rise in the cost of fuel and energy prices is an issue for all parts of the agri-food sector, as it is for all other sectors of the economy. It underlines the need to use inputs in an efficient manner and to maintain and, where possible, improve productivity.

The Bacon report reaffirmed the need for an approved planting target of 20,000 hectares per annum but commented that a lesser planting target could be a viable basis for support, providing the planting is undertaken in a manner that maximises the non-timber benefits.Given that EU funding of forestry currently accounts for up to 60% of public investment in the sector, proposals for the further development of the sector must await the final terms of the rural development regulation and consideration of the likely impact on Irish forestry. The current availability of grant aid at 100% for planting and the annual premiums, particularly the concession obtained in the stacking entitlements vis-à-vis the single payment scheme, make forestry a very attractive land use option for farmers.For 2005, I have made sufficient funds available to support an increased planting programme of some 15,000 hectares, which is the maximum the sector could deliver at present. However, this is a demand driven scheme and the level of planting ultimately achieved this year will depend entirely on take up from the sector, in particular from farmers.

Preliminary research completed to date indicates that the cultivation of certain crops with certain modifications may provide a financial incentive to the individual Irish farmer. While strands of this research parallel work completed in other countries it does not specifically address the costs associated with the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops.The general conclusion of Danish and UK research on the economic impact of co-existence on farm profitability is that the costs of complying with the required thresholds for crops of maize, potatoes, cereals, oil seed rape and sugar beet vary from zero to 9% above the costs of growing conventional crops. However, it should be noted that costs described were based on estimates.To establish greater clarity in the matter, as far as Irish conditions are concerned, I have asked Teagasc to explore the possibility of carrying out an evaluation of the likely national economic implications for the agri-food industry from the use of GMOs in crop and livestock production. Teagasc has now set up an internal working group of economists, agronomists and animal scientists to address this question in more detail and plans to publish the results of its analysis in due course.

The proposed redefinition responds to the European Court of Auditors' criticism, endorsed by the European Parliament, of the current system. The suggested new methodology would be based on natural conditions, notably soil and climatic factors. The socioeconomic criteria that were taken into account to designate the current eligible areas would no longer apply.The Commission has accepted that the suggested methodology presents difficulties for member states. However, a revised compromise text circulated by the Presidency on 27 April did not propose any changes to the original text in so far as the disadvantaged areas are concerned. At meetings of the Council of Ministers, I have emphasised that this is an extremely important and sensitive issue. Other member states have done likewise. I will continue to seek a solution that is equitable and in Ireland's interests.

It is, of course, subject to general and specific legislative requirements. At a general level, the welfare and protection of farmed animals is subject to the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations 2000. In addition, the Council of Europe has made recommendations regarding animals kept for fur farming. The 2000 regulations apply to many types of farming systems throughout the country, including cattle, sheep and pigs, as well as the animals kept on fur farms.As regards specific measures, we have legislation in place relating to the licensing of mink farms in the Musk Rats Act 1933 and the Musk Rats Act 1933 (Application to Mink) Order 1965. Under the latter, the keeping of mink is prohibited except under licence from my Department. Licences, which must be renewed annually, are issued under this legislation only if the applicant, following an inspection, is found to be fully compliant with a number of key conditions.The terms and conditions for obtaining a licence to operate a mink farm require that: mink shall be kept only at the premises specified in the licence; mink shall be kept in cages or other containers of such material and constructed in such a manner as to prevent their escape; buildings or parts of buildings used for the keeping of mink shall be constructed in such a manner or enclosed by such material as would, in the opinion of the authorised officer, prevent the escape of mink; the licence holder shall ensure that trees, shrubs and undergrowth are not growing or planted in such a position to the guard fence as would, in the opinion of the authorised officer, render the escape of mink possible; any drainage channels on such licensed premises shall be adequately guarded to prevent the escape of mink; licence holders must inform persons to whom they dispose of mink of the need for a licence to keep them; the Department must be informed if mink cease to be kept at any premises covered by this licence and of any change in ownership; authorised officers must be allowed to inspect the premises at all reasonable times; if any mink escape the Department must be informed at once; a licence is issued subject to compliance with all relevant legislation.Failure to comply with all relevant legislation and, or, any of the conditions of a licence may result in the licence being revoked. In addition, in common with all agricultural enterprises, licensed farms must comply with the animal health and welfare requirements pertaining to their particular sphere of activity.Licensed fur farms are inspected by the Department to assess compliance with the Council of Europe recommendations concerning fur animals and also Council Directive 98/58/EC on keeping of animals kept for farming purposes. These inspections have to date found that all the licensed fur farms in this country have been operating in compliance with current legislation. Inspections by the Department have also found that the slaughter methods employed by the licensed fur farms are permitted under the Sixth Schedule of the European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations, 1995.Environmental problems arising from wild mink or relating to escaped mink come within the remit of the national parks and wildlife service.

This brought the total number of staff in the office to over 200. Currently, work for another 60 staff is being transferred to Portlaoise and is being undertaken in the main by staff in that office who are being freed up as a result of the rationalisation of income support schemes. My Department aims to transfer work and a further 50 staff to Portlaoise by early 2006 in ongoing implementation of the Government decision on decentralisation.

I have already raised the issue with the Commissioner on a number of occasions. My Department has also forwarded a detailed submission to the European Commission dealing with this matter. I am urging that appropriate measures be taken to alleviate the difficulties encountered by beef farmers in Ireland, directly as a result of the ending of the special beef premium scheme in 2004. I will continue to press the EU Commission for an acceptable solution to this issue.Each member state has a regional beef ceiling for bull/1st age premium animals and Ireland's regional ceiling for the 2004 special beef premium scheme was 1,077,458 animals. Under the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, where the quota is breached in respect of the bull/1st age category, the overshoot reduction must also be applied to the 2nd age category animals.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	690	European Council Regulation 1782/2003 governing the single payment scheme provides that each member state must set up a national reserve using between 1% and 3% of every individual farmer's entitlements. A single payment advisory group comprising representatives from the farming organisations, Teagasc and officials from my Department was set up to advise on the national reserve. Based on that group's recommendations a 3% provisional reduction for the national reserve is reflected in the certificates of provisional entitlements that have issued to some 140,000 farmers. My expectation is that any linear percentage reduction could be accommodated within the 3% provisional reduction.The Council regulation also provides for a reduction for modulation of 3% in 2005 rising by a further 1% in each of the years 2006 and 2007. The 3% deduction for modulation has also been reflected in the provisional statements of entitlements. However, a refund of this money will be made in respect of the first €5,000 of the single payment in each case. It is estimated that 46% of Irish farmers will, in effect, not be subject to modulation at all.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	691	The rate of pension payable under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming is the maximum amount provided for by the EU Council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments.My Department's proposals for the current early retirement scheme, which commenced on 27 November 2000 and is one of the measures in the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-06, included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The European Commission rejected this proposal and insisted on legal grounds that a fixed rate be set instead.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	692	My Department has been aware, from an early stage in the negotiations leading to the introduction of the single payment scheme, of the possible implications for retired farmers who had leased their holdings. In so far as it has proved possible in the context of the EU regulations governing the single payment scheme and following lengthy discussions with the European Commission, provision has been made under the rules of the single payment scheme to address some of the concerns of retired farmers.As participants in the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming had retired before the start of the reference period in 2000, they are not in a position to claim entitlements under the single payment scheme. However, a concession agreed with the European Commission will allow family members who take over a holding that was leased to third parties during the reference period to have access to entitlements from the national reserve. This will benefit the family members of retired farmers who decide to take up farming.Participants in the current early retirement scheme who would have farmed during part or all of the reference period can activate entitlements and lease them to their existing transferee. If the transferee does not want the entitlements, the transferor or retired farmer has until 2007 within which to lease or transfer the entitlements, with land, to another farmer.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	693	I will decide shortly on the use of modulated funds and will then seek the necessary EU approval. In 2006, the use of such funds is confined to the measures in the CAP rural development plan — agri-environment, early retirement, compensatory allowances and forestry — and the new initiatives introduced as part of the CAP mid-term review — food quality, animal welfare, farm advisory services and meeting standards. From 2007, the eligible measures will be those contained in the new rural development regulation which is currently under negotiation in the Council of Ministers.My decision, which will aim to make the best possible use of the funds available, will be informed by the terms and conditions of the eligible measures and widespread consultation with stakeholders on this issue.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I discussed the WTO agriculture negotiations and Irish concerns relating thereto at a bilateral meeting with the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development on 20 December 2004. The Council of Agriculture Ministers, which reviews the situation on a regular basis, discussed the developments in the negotiations at its meetings on 14 March and 26 April 2005, both of which I attended.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	695	The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In October last, Ireland submitted an action programme to the European Commission for further implementation of the nitrates directive. In December, the Commission conveyed its view that the action programme was not complete and did not comply with the requirements of the directive or with the judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland, which had been delivered in March 2004.Subsequently, my Department worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the preparation of an initial response to the Commission. This response was sent on 20 April. A revised action programme, on which my Department has been consulted, is being finalised. Ireland has already submitted proposals for a derogation from the general limits laid down in the nitrates directive, designed to allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. They were developed by my Department and Teagasc in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The Commission has stated that it will not consider the application for a derogation until the action programme is agreed and in place but I am hopeful for a favourable outcome.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	696	Teagasc, the Agriculture and Food Development Authority, was established under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988. Its function under the Act is to provide research, training and advisory services for the agri-food sector. Teagasc is governed by an 11 member authority. The chairman and five ordinary members are appointed by the Minister and the remaining five members are appointed by the Minister following nominations from designated organisations — IFA, ICMSA, ICOS, Macra na Feirme and Teagasc unions.Teagasc has approximately 1,300 permanent staff, comprising advisers, teachers and research scientists, with appropriate supporting services. These are complemented by 250 contract staff, as well as teaching staff in the private agricultural and horticultural colleges. Teagasc staff carry out their functions from more than 90 locations.Teagasc's operating budget for 2005 amounts to over €155 million. Advisory services make up the biggest budget item, 35% of expenditure, followed by production research, 32%, training programmes, 19%, and food research, 13%. My Department's provision to Teagasc for capital and non-capital purposes in 2005 amounts to €123 million. The amount for non-capital purposes is €118.5 million and for capital development purposes the allocation is €4.5 million. By any standards these are substantial resources and are a clear indication of the Government's continuing commitment to supporting Teagasc activities.It is the responsibility of the Teagasc authority to prioritise activities and to allocate its funding accordingly. This it has done over the years in accordance with the needs of clients, EU and Government policy and industry needs. I am satisfied that in doing so it has provided a first class service to Irish farmers.In the short term, Teagasc will have to reconfigure its programmes in response to the fundamental changes in agriculture arising out of the new CAP support framework. The authority is, however, already well accustomed to tailoring its programmes to meet the changing requirements of the agri-food sector. Its annual programme of activities is developed in consultation with the key stakeholders in the sector, many of whom are represented on the authority. Recently it has undertaken more strategic planning initiatives, the Teagasc 2000 review and the three year strategy required under the strategic management initiative. A new review of its training and education programmes is under way.I am satisfied that Teagasc is well placed to face the future and to continue to provide the innovation and technology transfer for the sustainable development of agriculture, the food industry and rural communities in the years ahead.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	697	The agreement on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 reached at the Council of Agricultural Ministers on 26 June 2003 provided a financial envelope to each member state. The envelope of money granted to each member state under the EU regulations represents the average number of animals paid under the livestock premia schemes and the area paid under the arable aid scheme during the three year reference period 2000 to 2002 calculated at the 2002 rates of payment.The outcome of the agreement, which will reshape the Common Agriculture Policy and secure its future in making it more relevant to modern society and more defensible in a WTO context, was a balanced one which addressed Ireland's principal objectives. Among these objectives was the preservation of the financial benefits achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement and the establishment of a policy framework that will allow farmers and the agri-sector the flexibility to adapt to evolving consumer and market demands and international circumstances.Index linking of the single payment scheme was not an element of the Commission's proposals. There was, however, a proposal to provide for a reduction of up to 13% in the single payment, known as digression, to meet future financing needs. I believe one of the major achievements in the negotiations was the removal of this proposal. The removal of this provision meant a saving of some €420 million for Ireland over the lifetime of the agreement. The compromise agreed was to allow the Council to review, from 2007 onwards, the financial situation annually if budget deficits arise.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	698	The report of the national task force on obesity directs two specific recommendations to my Department. These are: the Department of Agriculture and Food should review policies in partnership with other Government Departments to promote access to healthy food — such policies should encompass positive discrimination in the provision of grants and funding to local industry in favour of healthy products; the Department, together with the Department of Health and Children, should promote the implementation of evidence based healthy eating interventions.Obesity is, I believe, an immensely important issue for the future health of our society. It demands a multi-faceted response, including a proactive approach by the food industry. In regard to the first recommendation, as I have indicated previously in response to parliamentary questions, subsidising prices is a form of state aid that is not permissible under EU state aid rules. Positive discrimination between products could also result in a challenge on competition grounds at national or EU level. I will, however, examine all the possibilities open to me in this area within legal constraints, including state aid rules.As regards the second recommendation, the recently publicised scientific study on children's diet, carried out by Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance under the sponsorship of my Department's FIRM programme and the FSAI, also bears out the rising prevalence of obesity among the younger population. This is the first comprehensive scientific evaluation of dietary intake in children in Ireland and provides direction for the dietary strategies that need to be established to prevent obesity in Irish children. Inadequate consumption of milk, fresh meat and fruit and vegetables were identified in the study. I believe the Irish food industry is well positioned to supply and promote products to remedy this dietary deficiency. Bord Bia, through my Department, has already sought European Commission approval for co-funding the promotion of fruit and vegetables and I will continue to be supportive of initiatives of this kind.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	699	I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 91 together.Promotion and development of renewable energy in Ireland are matters in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. My Department is represented on the bioenergy strategy group established by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural resources to consider policy options and support mechanisms available to Government to stimulate increased use of biomass for energy conversion and to make specific recommendations for action to increase the proportion of energy from biomass in Ireland.In addition, an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is considering policy options for the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland. My Department is represented on that group. As part of the group's work, a liquid biofuels strategy study was published by Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, in December 2004. This report provides comprehensive details on the potential for the development of a biofuels market in Ireland and options to stimulate the market.The possibility of producing bioethanol from sugar beet was mooted recently in the context of the closure of the Carlow sugar factory but Irish Sugar Ltd. has indicated that it intends to process the full Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant, which will be upgraded. Arrangements are being made to transport the sugar beet from the Carlow catchment area to Mallow.Under the single payment scheme operated by my Department aid is available at a rate of €45 per hectare per year for areas sown with energy crops. The aid is granted in respect of areas where production is covered by a contract between the farmer and a processor, except in the case of processing undertaken by the farmer on his holding. Agricultural raw materials, with the exception of sugar beet, may be grown under the energy crops scheme provided the crops are intended primarily for use in the production of products considered to be biofuels and for electric and thermal energy produced from biomass.A maximum guaranteed area of 1.5 million hectares for which aid for energy crops can be granted has been established in the European Union. According to figures provided by the EU Commission, in excess of 303,000 hectares were sown with energy crops in 2004, of which 439 hectares were Irish. From 1 January 2005, farmers may claim the energy crop payment in addition to their entitlement under the single farm payment. In addition to this scheme, set aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses, including growing of crops for energy purposes, and will, therefore, qualify to activate set aside entitlements under the single payment scheme.The energy crops scheme and a number of other areas such as wood biomass are being considered by my Department to determine how their bioenergy potential can be promoted.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	700	The level of funding available to each member state under the single payment scheme has already been agreed under European Council Regulation 1782/2003. The amount available to Ireland in 2005, including the dairy premium, is €1.260 billion and this will increase to €1.322 billion as and from 2006 onwards. The envelope of money granted to each member state under the EU regulations represents the average number of animals paid under the livestock premia schemes and the area paid under the arable aid scheme during the three year reference period 2000 to 2002 calculated at the 2002 rates of payment.Increasing or index linking the level of aid available to each member state was not an element of the European Commission's proposals for the mid-term review of Agenda 2000.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	701	As part of the agri-vision 2015 committee's report, an analysis of current and future farm viability levels was undertaken by FAPRI-Ireland. It defined viability using two criteria — where a farm has the capacity to remunerate family labour at the average agricultural wage and the capacity to provide an additional 5% return on non-land assets. Using these criteria, 28% of the 136,000 farms in 2002 were classified as economically viable. FAPRI-Ireland said that if past trends and policy prior to decoupling were continued to 2015, the number of viable farms would fall to 30,000 out of a total of 105,000 farms.However, when changes such as decoupling, improved demography and a favourable macro-economic environment are taken into consideration, the composition of the 105,000 farms projected for 2015 alters, with a greater number of viable farms being projected for the future. FAPRI's projections indicated an increase to 40,000 viable farms or 38% of farms in 2015. It largely attributed this improvement to the greater economic choices provided to farmers by decoupling. This greater range of choice, FAPRI-Ireland predicts, should lead to an improvement in farm incomes and also allow more farmers the option of supplementing their income from off-farm employment.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 86 and 98 together.My Department is currently engaged in drafting legislation to transpose EU Directive 2004/28, which is the new framework legislation governing the veterinary medicines regime across Europe. The deadline for transposition is 30 October 2005.The EU legislation includes a general provision that all veterinary medicines for food producing animals should be brought under veterinary prescription control. Arising from difficulties expressed during the negotiations of the EU measure by Ireland and a small number of other member states, an exemption clause was included in the directive which provides a mechanism for specific categories of medicines to be excluded from the mandatory prescription requirement. Decisions at EU level on exemptions are required to be taken by 1 January 2007, pending which existing national distribution arrangements may remain in place.I am aware of the concerns which have been expressed here in Ireland about the potential cost implications for farmers of restricting all medicines to veterinary prescription control. However, final decisions have yet to be taken and Ireland's approach to the exemption mechanism is to try to keep certain medicines, including certain vaccines, available off prescription. In the interim, farmers will continue to be able to get these products without having to obtain a prescription and, given this situation, the need to extend the range of prescribers to include, for example, pharmacists does not arise.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I am aware that the Irish draught is an endangered breed of horse. My Department, in the context of co-ordinating and promoting the conservation and utilisation of genetic resources for food and agriculture, has funded four projects on the Irish Draught horse in recent years.In 2000, the department of animal science in UCD was funded to carry out a project, entitled The characterisation of the Irish Draught Horse population in Ireland, which involved a description of the breed demographically and genetically. The results from the project provided much beneficial information regarding the Irish draught horse population, which is essential in trying to develop a conservation strategy for the breed.In 2003, UCD was funded to carry out further analyses on the Irish draught horse population, which involved characterisation at a molecular level. The results of this analysis will be available in mid-2005.In 2004, funding was provided to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, for a project which involved the identification of least related stallions in the population to provide mating advice to breeders to help increase genetic diversity within the breed. The results of this project will be available to breeders in October 2005.This year, funding has been provided to the Royal Dublin Society, in co-operation with ICBF, to collect semen from rare lines of Irish draught horses and to carry out an education and awareness campaign on the results from the mating advice project carried out by ICBF.My Department also provides funding to the Irish Horse Board, which operates a scheme to encourage the pure breeding of Irish draught horses. In 2004, a grant of €250 was paid to breeders who registered purebred progeny of Irish draught mares. In addition, the board assists the draught horse society with administrative and promotional costs. I understand that the board is currently in discussions with the Irish Draught Horse Society with a view to further increasing financial support for the breed in the future.Finally, under the REPS programme operated by my Department there is a supplementary measure for the conservation of rare farm animal breeds. Supplementary measure 3 recognises that local animal breeds play a significant role in maintaining the rural environment and represent a significant element of the cultural heritage of farming in Ireland. The objective of this supplementary measure is to encourage farmers to rear animals of specific breeds traditional to Ireland, that are in danger of being lost to farming. An annual payment of €200 per livestock unit is payable, subject to certain conditions. The Irish draught horse is supported under this measure.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	705	In 2004, 126 cases of BSE were confirmed compared with 182 in 2003 and 333 in 2002. There have been 27 cases to date in 2005, which represents a decrease of 57% on the number of cases, 63, discovered in the same period in 2004. The vast majority of these cases were in animals born prior to the introduction here of the additional controls in 1996 and 1997. The age profile of BSE cases as well as the reduction in case numbers indicates that the additional controls have been effective in significantly reducing the exposure of animals born after 1997 to the infectious agent. It is expected that the incidence of disease will continue to decline as cows born prior to 1998 leave the system.Investigations are carried out into the feeding regimes of all herds in which BSE is identified and, in particular, in herds in which cases born after the feed controls were re-enforced are confirmed.In the context of the overall picture, the diagnosis of BSE in a small number of animals born after 1997 was not unexpected and reflects what has happened elsewhere. To date, 12 animals born after 1997 — four 1998 born animals, seven 1999 born animals and one 2001 born animal — have been diagnosed with BSE. In addition, ten cases were confirmed in 1997 born animals but some of these were born before all the re-enforced measures were fully in place.My Department had foreseen the likelihood that individual cases would from time to time arise which may relate to circumstances specific to the farms in question and which do not conform with the general trend as the incidence of the disease in the national herd recedes. There is, however, no basis for suspecting that these cases are indicative of either a systemic failure in controls or of a reversal of or deviation from the overall positive trend with BSE in Ireland.

In total, some 100 flocks were depopulated under this phase and restocking was not permitted for a period of two years. Flockowners received compensation for the capital value of the sheep and for income loss for that period. In addition, those who restocked in the third year also received compensation for income loss for that year.The terms of the agreement and amounts of compensation and income loss involved were clearly understood and accepted by all concerned at the time of depopulation. This agreement did not contain any commitment to pay further compensation in respect of later years. While my Department did agree to the setting up of a technical group to examine the costs arising following restocking, it did not give any undertaking regarding the findings of the group.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	707	Following intensive negotiations, agreement was reached in Geneva in August 2004 on a framework setting out the general outline and content of the new World Trade Organisation, WTO, agreement. The detailed implementation of this framework is the subject of ongoing negotiation at technical and political level, with the aim of concluding at the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005.I am satisfied that the framework agreement secured the benefits to Irish farmers of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy and represents a satisfactory outcome from Ireland's point of view. My priorities for the further negotiations are to ensure that: the phasing out of all forms of export subsidies will be applied in parallel, as provided for under the framework agreement, and that the phasing out period will be as long as possible; Ireland's agricultural exports will remain competitive in the EU market as a result of the level of tariff protection that will apply on imports from third countries. My over-riding objective will be to ensure that the terms of a new agreement can be accommodated without the need for further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	708	By the deadline for the receipt of single payment application forms on 16 May my Department estimates that applicants under this scheme had submitted some 142,000 applications. I initiated a major publicity campaign at national and local level to make farmers aware of the deadline for the receipt of applications. In addition, to facilitate farmers in the completion and submission of their application forms, I established a dedicated helpline and arranged to have the Department's offices around the country open during both weekends prior to the deadline and up to midnight on Monday 16 May. In view of the number of applications received, I am satisfied that the vast majority of farmers submitted their single payment application forms prior to the deadline.However, farmers who did not submit an application by the deadline, may continue to lodge application forms, subject to a 4% per working day late application penalty, at any office of my Department or use the swift-post envelope to forward it to the single payment unit in Portlaoise by 10 June. I urge farmers who have not yet lodged their application forms to do so immediately at any office of the Department as any farmer who does not submit an application by 10 June will lose their single payment entitlements forever.If farmers have a query about the application form or any aspect of the single payment scheme, assistance continues to be available from the Department on Lo-call number 1890 200 566.

On these forestry aspects I have pointed to the negative impacts that the proposals would have on the sector, particularly those relating to reduced establishment grants, premia and associated premium payments periods. Negotiations on the Commission proposals are continuing within the Agriculture Council and, as they progress, I will press for the best possible outcome for Ireland on the package as a whole, including a satisfactory outcome on forestry issues.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	710	The Food Agency Co-operation Council was established in 2000 under the aegis of my Department to promote the fullest practical co-operation between the State agencies involved in the food industry, in the interests of the optimum development of the industry. The council has an independent chairman, Mr. Padraic White. The inaugural meeting of the council took place in March 2000 and it has met on 20 occasions since its inception. The council did not meet in 2004 as a number of factors contributed to the difficulties in re-scheduling meetings that year.The council has played a significant role in increasing co-operation, at formal and informal level, between the State agencies involved in the food industry and has led to a number of memorandums of understanding being agreed between agencies. The council has also produced a number of publications, which have been well received by the industry. In 2001, the council was instrumental in drawing up an agreed human resource development programme for the food processing industry and also produced the publication "Market Trends — Implications for Suppliers and State Agency Initiatives".In December 2002, the council's publication "A National Food Incident Management Plan" was launched. The "Market Led New Product Development Guide", launched in April 2003, provides guidance to food and drink companies on new product development best practice and this has since been promulgated to county enterprise boards.During 2004 the food development agencies directly concerned with the food programme components of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 met twice with my Department to assess progress on the plan in preparation for meetings of the monitoring committee for the programmes concerned. My Department is currently considering the future work of the council, having regard inter alia to the recommendations of the enterprise strategy report, the 2015 agri-vision report and work on the national strategic implementation plan to achieve the goals set out in the Government’s research and development action plan, Building Ireland’s Knowledge Economy.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	712	The Deputy will be aware that it is an offence, punishable at the discretion of the courts by imprisonment for a term of six months, or a fine not exceeding €3,000 or both, to import, place on the market or use a plant protection product that has not been registered. The regulatory system is designed to ensure a high level of protection for man, animals and the environment.Products included on the register are made available to end users by a large number of distributors. Nevertheless distributors and farmers are free to source products from elsewhere provided that the products are registered in Ireland and subject to obtaining approval in each instance from my Department for their importation. The approval process for parallel imports involves simple checks to ensure that products to be imported are the same as those registered for use in Ireland and are appropriately labelled.The enforcement programme undertaken involves routine and targeted inspections at the premises of wholesale and retail distributors and end users. Recent reports of illegal importation of plant protection products are being investigated. Illegal products found are seized and subject to destruction at owners expense. There were two instances last year.I expect, on the basis of an ongoing review being carried out in my Department of arrangements for regulating the distribution and use of plant protection products, that additional amending legislation will be introduced before the end of 2005 to further strengthen the regulatory system.

Bord Bia is widely acknowledged as an effective market development and promotion agency for the Irish food industry. It is close to the market as initiatives such as Marketplace Ireland 2004 demonstrate. I believe the review is timely in view of the rapid pace of change in consumer requirements, the highly competitive international trading environment and retail consolidation. It will facilitate Bord Bia in continuing to deliver effective and innovative marketing and promotion services for Irish food and horticulture produce.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	714	The most recent figures available from the CSO show that there were 77,900 full-time farmers — as defined by the CSO — in 2003, a drop of 20,400 since 1997. Over the same period the number of part-time farmers increased by 7,900 to 57,200. The agri vision 2015 committee indicated in its report that the trend to part-time farming — using a somewhat different definition than the CSO — will continue.The ongoing trend towards part-time farming reflects a combination of factors including the increased availability of off-farm employment. Many smaller farmers are finding that combining farming with off-farm employment is an effective way to ensure their viability on the land. At the same time, full-time farmers are looking to the new flexibility offered to them under decoupling to develop and intensify their commercial farm enterprises.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	715	I have made the EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development fully aware of the impact that changes in market management supports and export refunds play in the overall development of the EU dairy industry and, in particular, their impact on the Irish dairy industry.Milk price is determined by a number of factors including the international market for dairy products, the type of products being produced, their market destinations, the efficiency of production and processing and the overall operation of the EU support mechanisms.On the particular issue of milk prices, this is in the first instance a business matter between milk producers and purchasers. Producer prices for milk in Ireland have remained stable for the past number of years despite reductions in intervention prices for butter and skim milk powder. These reductions in institutional support prices have resulted in farmers being compensated in 2004 to an amount of €60 million. Further compensation amounting to €120 million will be paid this year as part of the single farm payment introduced as a result of the Luxembourg agreement on the reform of the CAP.On market supports generally I have been opposed to the general trend towards reduced support for market aids, including casein aid and export refunds. I have consistently argued in favour of operating market support policy at Community level with the aim of ensuring stability across the milk sector so that EU exports remain competitive on international markets. I will maintain pressure on the Commission at every level to ensure that the situation is kept under close review, that the market requirements are accurately assessed and that the policy response is dictated by the needs of the market situation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	716	Avian influenza is a serious, highly contagious viral disease of poultry, which can also spread to other animals and occasionally to human beings.EU legislation to control avian influenza is laid down in Directive 92/40/EEC. In brief, this directive requires that all suspected cases of avian influenza must be investigated and appropriate measures taken in case of confirmation of highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI. To limit the spread, infected poultry must be killed in a humane way and disposed of safely. Feeding stuffs, contaminated equipment and manure must be destroyed or treated to inactivate the virus.The EU has enacted legislation placing an embargo on imports of poultry and certain poultry products from the affected Asian countries — Commission Decision 2004/122/EC — and also suspended the import of pet birds from South East Asia — Commission Decision 2004/93/EC. Further bans are in place for Canada and the United States.Under Article 17 of Council Directive 92/40/EEC, each member state must have a contingency plan "specifying the national measures to be implemented in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza". Among other things, the plan must provide for access to facilities, equipment, personnel and all other appropriate materials necessary for the rapid and efficient eradication of the outbreak. Ireland's plan also gives details on movement controls and procedures to be followed in the investigation of a suspect premises. Ireland's contingency plan is currently being updated in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. In addition, operational and other aspects are being reviewed and various elements are being updated.The European Commission has recently tabled proposals on updating the current Community measures on avian influenza with a view to improving prevention and control, reducing the health risks, the costs and losses and the negative impact to the whole of society of this disease. These proposals are currently under detailed technical discussion at Council working group in Brussels.

In addition, such imports are subject to checks laid down in the harmonised rules prescribed at European level, and must be accompanied by the prescribed veterinary health certification from the competent authorities in the country of export.The beef labelling requirements, which are compulsory in all member states, apply to beef sold at retail level within the Community, regardless of whether that beef was produced within the EU or in a third country. Where beef is imported into the Community from a third country it must, at a minimum, be labelled as "Origin: non-EC" along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place.The EU requirements in respect of labelling of beef do not apply at restaurant and catering sector level and Ireland has raised this with the Commission. It is my intention to proceed with a national legal requirement that country of origin must be displayed in respect of beef served on such premises. Discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Health and Children with a view to progressing the required legislation as soon as possible.

This means that the value of any such national retirement pension, which includes contributory pensions, must be deducted from the early retirement pension.On entering the schemes, participants signed an undertaking to comply with the requirements, among which it is stated that the pension can only be paid as a supplement to a national retirement pension. The onus remains primarily on the scheme participant to inform my Department of his or her entitlement to a national retirement pension. As a further safeguard against unintentional overpayments, however, my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs co-operate in the routine exchange of information and are currently in discussion about ways in which this can be improved further.

The regulations only apply to the private nursing home sector and do not cover public long-stay facilities for older people.In general, where problems occur, the inspection team that inspects the private nursing home will discuss its findings in detail with the owner-operators and this will generally ensure that the matters raised will be addressed. The HSE may remove a nursing home from its register or refuse to register a nursing home if it is of the opinion that, inter alia, the premises to which the application or, as the case may be, the registration relates do not comply with the regulations; or the continuance of services in the home will not be or is not in compliance with the regulations.There is a commitment to provide a statutory basis for the social services inspectorate and to extend its remit to include services for older people including long-stay facilities for older people, both public and private. In the interim, work has been carried out in a number of Health Service Executive areas on developing standards for residential care for older people. At the same time the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board has commenced work on examining the development of accreditation standards for residential care for older people, both public and private. In this regard it is developing a pilot programme which includes both public long-stay units and private nursing homes.With regard to inspectors' reports on nursing homes to be put into the public domain, while the reports are not published or put on the Internet, they may be made available by the HSE upon request. There are no plans to introduce legislation in this regard at present.

However, while the practice of conventional medicine and health care in this country is controlled and regulated, complementary health care has not been subject to the same level of oversight. Standards of education, professional qualifications and experience required are not as well established and the level of qualification and length of training among complementary therapists can vary. Moreover, the practice of some complementary therapies has sometimes been carried out on an informal basis.Focus in regard to complementary therapy has therefore been on how the regulatory environment for complementary therapists can be strengthened. I see this as essential and, as I have explained to the House on previous occasions, a national working group was established by my predecessor in May 2003 to advise on future measures in this regard. The Deputy will be aware of recent tragic events which have shown that greater controls in the complementary therapy area are in the interest of the public and indeed all reputable practising therapists. I have therefore asked that the report of this group be expedited.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	737	There is already in place a generous package of reliefs that continue to be available exclusively to the farming sector. These include: income averaging; stock relief; accelerated capital allowances for expenditure incurred on farm buildings; accelerated capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on certain pollution control measures; capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on the purchase of milk quota; an exemption from income tax in respect of certain income from certain leased farmland and special tax treatment in respect of profits accruing as a result of the disposal of stock under statutory disease eradication measures. In addition, certain young trained farmers can also qualify for full relief from stamp duty on the transfer of land and can also avail of enhanced stock relief of 100%.The 2005 budget also announced a special stamp duty relief relating to an exchange of farm land between two farmers for the purposes of consolidating each farmer's holding. The new relief will mean that no stamp duty will be charged on an exchange of such lands where the lands are of equal value. In a case where the lands exchanged are not of equal value, stamp duty will be charged on the amount of the difference in the value of the lands concerned.The Deputy is effectively suggesting the reintroduction of roll-over relief on capital gains tax for farmers. It was announced in the 2003 budget that no roll-over relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when capital gains tax rates were much higher than current levels. In effect, it was a deferral of tax to be paid, where the proceeds of disposal were re-invested into replacement assets. The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low. A 20% rate of capital gains tax now applies on gains arising on the disposal of assets, including land. This is the lowest rate of capital gains tax in recent history. Taxing capital gains when they are realised is the most logical time to do so and this change brought capital gains tax into line with other areas.Stamp duty and capital gains tax are significant contributors to the Exchequer, yielding approximately €2 billion and €1.5 million respectively in 2004. Stamp duty and capital gains tax receipts allow for a broader tax base than would otherwise be possible and form an important element of State revenues. The introduction of a general exemption from capital gains tax and stamp duty for all farmers selling and repurchasing farmland for any reason would narrow the tax base considerably and would have an adverse effect on the stamp duty and capital gains tax yields. Also, such a move would lead to calls from other sectors to be given the same treatment, which would have major Exchequer implications.Figures are not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling estimates of cost to the Exchequer from introducing the scheme mentioned or the numbers who might be affected. Accordingly, the specific information is not readily available and either could not be obtained or could not be obtained without conducting a protracted investigation of the Revenue Commissioners' records.I have no plans to introduce tax exemptions for farmers along the lines suggested by the Deputy.

The levy is based on the costs incurred by the ESB in meeting its obligations to produce, or buy, electricity that is generated from peat and other environmentally sustainable forms of energy. It was previously included as part of the "standing charges" shown on ESB bills and, as such, was chargeable to VAT. With effect from March 2003, the levy has been shown separately from the other standing charges.The levy is part of the price which customers pay the ESB and is directly linked to the price of the electricity supplied. In these circumstances, the ESB is obliged to charge VAT on the levy. The rate at which VAT must be charged is 13.5%, which is the rate that applies to the supply of electricity.

Full details of these can be found on my Department's website www.broadband.gov.ie including contact details, service levels on offer and costs. DSL broadband is always marketed subject to line survey and availability and, where a telephone line cannot carry the service, other technologies must be considered, such as wireless, satellite or cable modem. A full list of service providers is available from the website www.comreg.ie .My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building metropolitan area networks in all the regional towns of 1,500 population and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband service, including Muine Bheag and Tullow in County Carlow. For rural communities and smaller towns, such as Hacketstown, my Department offers funding under the county and group broadband scheme to enable these communities to become self sufficient in broadband, in association with the service providers, using the most suitable technology for the area.Full details of the scheme, including application procedures, are on the website www.gbs.gov.ie , and although the most recent call for proposals has closed, applications are still being accepted by my Department.

The construction work will contribute to Exchequer income from corporation, payroll and indirect taxation in so far as it relies on sourcing of Irish skills, staff and material. Operations will similarly contribute to the Exchequer and will also yield lease rental income.In addition to sharing in general prosperity, communities in Mayo will benefit where there is local sourcing of workers, services and goods. Direct construction employment will be of the order of 100, will rise to 500 and then fall back to 200 over the project period. It is anticipated that 50 to 60 staff in three shifts will be employed to operate the terminal. It is the stated policy of the operating company to recruit and train local staff to work the terminal and I understand that main and subcontractors on the project have recruited some of their labour requirements locally.

This is particularly important with respect to small arms and light weapons which are responsible for widespread death and injury. Ireland is committed to working with others to ensure that the international community deals with the illicit trafficking of such weapons effectively. In this context, Ireland is actively participating in current negotiations in the United Nations on an international instrument to regulate the marking and tracing of small arms and light weapons.A welcome aspect of the proposed international arms trade treaty, which has been put forward by a number of non-governmental organisations, including Amnesty International and Oxfam, is that the treaty has the objective of setting out states' existing international legal obligations in the area of international transfers of arms. In addition, once ratified, the proposed treaty would enable the international community to move forward incrementally, by means of subsequent more specific instruments, to strengthen international controls on arms transfers.The text of the draft treaty is being re-examined from a legal perspective by those NGOs involved in the arms control campaign and revisions to the text may be made. While work on the drafting of the text of the proposed treaty is still ongoing, it is a promising initiative and I commend the NGOs concerned for their efforts.Ireland has participated in several international meetings in which the proposed international arms trade treaty has been discussed. This included attendance at a conference held in November 2003 at Cambridge University in England, the purpose of which was to examine the text of the proposed treaty. An official from my Department also attended an international workshop on enhancing the international export control of small arms and light weapons, the case for an international arms trade treaty, which took place in Helsinki last June. Ireland was also represented at an international workshop on global principles for arms transfers, which took place in Tanzania last February. The Government will ensure that Ireland continues to be associated with the process and will closely monitor developments.

However, the EU enlargement process provided the impetus for the most recent efforts towards a settlement, which were undertaken by the UN Secretary General in the first half of 2004, during Ireland's EU Presidency.As a result of the referendums in Cyprus on 24 April 2004, the accession to the EU of a united Cyprus on 1 May 2004 was not possible. On 28 May, the UN Secretary General submitted a comprehensive report to the Security Council on his mission of good offices. He noted that the unsuccessful outcome represented another missed opportunity to resolve the Cyprus problem and concluded that there was no apparent basis for resuming the good offices effort while the stalemate continued. The process has remained under consideration in the UN Security Council since then.However, following discussions with Secretary General Kofi Annan in Moscow earlier this month, the President of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, sent an envoy to New York last week for preliminary, informal talks with senior officials in the UN Secretariat. As a result of these discussions, the Secretary General has asked Kieran Prendergast, the Under Secretary General for Political Affairs, to travel to Cyprus, Athens and Ankara next week to listen to the views of all parties on the future of the mission of good offices on Cyprus. It will be for the Secretary General to decide, on the basis of these consultations, whether a further effort will be possible in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.The Government has strongly supported Secretary General Annan in his mission of good offices. The EU remains ready to accommodate a settlement of the Cyprus problem based on the Secretary General's proposals and in line with the principles on which the Union is founded. The objective we all share is an agreed comprehensive settlement, which will enable the people of Cyprus to live together as citizens of a united Cyprus in the European Union. I hope that in the coming weeks all parties will engage constructively with the United Nations to create the conditions in which real progress can be made towards the achievement of that objective.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	745	The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, DPRK, announced in February 2005 that it has produced and now possesses nuclear weapons and that it is to suspend its participation in the six party talks for an indefinite period. In May 2005, the DPRK further announced that it has finished extracting 8,000 fuel rods from its reactor at Yongbyon, which it had reportedly shut down a month ago.Given the nature of the regime in the DPRK and its strict control of information, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of such announcements. Normally, the International Atomic Energy Agency can offer reliable information on a country's nuclear programme. However, the IAEA has not been permitted to inspect the DPRK's nuclear facilities since its inspectors were expelled from the DPRK in 2002. The agency is, therefore, not in a position to ascertain the validity of the recent statements from the DPRK.The DPRK's regional neighbours, and parties involved in the six party talks, SPT, process, are continuing their efforts to encourage the DPRK to return to the stalled talks on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Most recently, the DPRK and the Republic of Korea concluded four days of negotiations on 20 May. US and DPRK officials are reported to have had working level contacts on the issue at the UN on 13 May.The SPT process involves the DPRK, the Republic of Korea, China, Japan, the Russian Federation and the United States. Three rounds of talks have taken place since the process was initiated in 2003. While not directly involved in these talks, the EU has availed of every opportunity to confirm the Union's willingness to contribute to the international efforts to move matters forward. The Union has also indicated its readiness to consider enhanced co-operation with the DPRK if the present difficult situation can be resolved in a satisfactory manner.The issue of the nuclear programme of the DPRK is kept under close and regular scrutiny by the European Union. The EU issued a statement on 11 February expressing concern at the position adopted by the DPRK. It urged the DPRK to revoke, as soon as possible, its decision to withdraw from the six party talks and to allow the resumption of negotiations in order to find a negotiated and peaceful solution to the crisis in the Korean peninsula. The EU also reaffirmed its strong support for the six party talks process and renewed its appeal to the DPRK to comply with the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The EU and Asian partners reiterated this concern at the Asia Europe Foreign Ministers Meeting which took place in Kyoto, Japan, on 6-7 May 2005.At the 7th review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is currently underway in New York, the EU also called on the DPRK to respect fully its international obligations in the non-proliferation field, in accordance with its safeguards agreement with the IAEA. The EU further reaffirmed that it is firmly committed to contributing to a peaceful and negotiated solution to the DPRK's nuclear programme.

There is also a requirement for a late filing penalty to be paid where returns are filed late. It is the practice of the Registrar of Companies to waive late filing penalties in certain exceptional circumstances, for particular categories of company, such as charities, and on a once-off basis only. I understand that in no case have late filing penalties been waived by the registrar on a second occasion for any company.The company in question met the criteria governing waiver and it was granted a once-off waiver of late filing fees in respect of its failure to file on time its annual return for 2002. That return should have been filed by 5 September 2002 but was not filed until 15 August 2003. The applicable late filing fee of over €1,000 was waived in line with the waiver criteria.The company has since failed to file its returns for the years 2003 and 2004, despite having been written to as regards its filing obligations by the CRO in July 2002 and January 2003 and despite already having had the benefit of a waiver of late filing fees. It did not attempt to rectify its filing default until a strike-off warning issued to it last February.The late filing fees accrued in respect of the returns for the years 2003 and 2004 as at the date of the CRO letter, of 11 May 2005, amounted to €2,014. That letter was a letter from CRO to the company returning its 2003 and 2004 returns because the full fees had not been attached. The late fees increase at the rate of €3 per day until a ceiling of €1,200 is reached in respect of any particular return.The general policy on penalties for late filing of returns and accounts is working well as evidenced by the improved rate of submission of returns and accounts generally. I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to intervene in individual decisions of the Registrar of Companies on filing penalties and I do not propose to do so in this case.

She was informed by the PAS that she was placed first on a panel for Mullingar.The centrally agreed arrangements for the direct recruitment of clerical staff to some provincial locations provide that 50% of clerical vacancies in a number of named provincial locations are to be filled by direct recruitment while the other 50% are to be filled from the central transfer list for the particular location. For those provincial locations not included in the agreement, the previous arrangements remained in place whereby all vacancies are filled by the lateral transfer of a permanent clerical officer, in accordance with the central transfer list.Mullingar is not one of the provincial locations for which direct recruitment was agreed and, accordingly, the Department does not have the discretion to recruit directly from the Public Appointments Service panel for vacancies in this office. In accordance with the agreed arrangements, all vacancies at clerical level must be filled by the lateral transfer of a permanent clerical officer from the central transfer list.

The number of FIS claims in payment at week ending 20 May 2005 is 15,422. This represents an increase of 28% since December 2002 when 12,043 claims were in payment.FIS income limits were increased by €39 per week in budget 2005. This represents a net increase of €23.40 per week for most recipients. Weekly FIS income limits have risen by €84 since 2002. This represents a net increase of €50.40. The guaranteed minimum weekly rate of payment for anyone who qualifies for FIS increased to €20 from January 2004.My Department undertakes a number of proactive measures to ensure that people are aware of possible entitlement to family income supplement. In the past, this has included extensive advertising on local and national press and radio and in poster campaigns and targeted mailshots. Information on FIS is also provided on an ongoing basis in various ways, which include advising all newly awarded one-parent family payment recipients, advising all employers annually in PRSI mailshots and examining entitlement for all recipients of the back to work scheme.

This is generally considered to provide good coverage across the country and represents a reasonable balance between convenience to test applicants and the need for economy in delivering the driver testing service. I have no proposals to provide a test centre in Drogheda as the existing centres in Dundalk, Navan and Finglas provide adequately for the demand in Drogheda and the general area.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	764	In reply to a similar question on 4 May I indicated that the proposed redefinition of disadvantaged areas is one element of an EU Commission proposal on support for rural development in the 2007 to 2013 period. The proposed redefinition responds to the European Court of Auditors' criticism, endorsed by the European Parliament, about the current system. The suggested new methodology would be based on natural conditions, notably soil and climatic factors. The socioeconomic criteria that were taken into account to designate the current eligible areas would no longer apply.The Commission has accepted that the suggested methodology presents difficulties for member states. However, a revised compromise text circulated by the Presidency on 27 April did not propose any changes to the original text in so far as the disadvantaged areas are concerned. At meetings of the Council of Ministers, I have emphasised that this is an extremely important and sensitive issue. Other member states have done likewise. I will continue to seek a solution that is equitable and in Ireland's interests.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	765	I received the committee's report formally on 7 April and my officials are currently examining it. This report arises from an investigation by the committee of a complaint by a group representing retired farmers. My Department provided the committee with a comprehensive formal written response to the complaint and also attended a meeting of the committee in July 2003 to answer questions from members. The report covers a range of issues, including taxation issues, which are outside my remit. I will address the issues shortly in a formal response to the committee.I am naturally anxious that the early retirement scheme delivers maximum benefits to retired farmers. However, this is an EU funded scheme and I am constrained by the regulations under which it was introduced. The same group of retired farmers made an identical complaint to the European Commission but the Commission did not uphold it. In other words, the Commission concluded that my Department is administering the scheme correctly and in accordance with the governing EU regulations.My Department has recently conducted an expenditure review of the current early retirement scheme and copies were laid before the House on 13 April. The expenditure review process was established by the Department of Finance in 1997 in the context of the strategic management initiative. The purpose of the review of the early retirement scheme is to analyse systematically whether the scheme is meeting its objectives and to inform future decisions regarding priorities on expenditure programmes. My Department's review includes a number of conclusions and recommendations that will help to inform my response to the report of the joint committee.

The first application in respect of ten animals was received on 30 April 2004; the second application in respect of 74 animals was received on 16 December 2004; and the third application in respect of 95 animals was received on 31 December 2004. The 60% advance payments in respect of the first and second applications issued on 18 October 2004 and 16 March 2005 respectively.Following computer validation of the third application, one of the tags was revealed as invalid. This matter has now been satisfactorily resolved and payment of the 60% advance and the interim balance will issue shortly. Interim balancing payments in respect of the first and second applications will also issue at that stage.Under the 2004 slaughter premium scheme, 19 eligible animals were slaughtered under the herd number of the person named.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	767	My Department is currently engaged in drafting legislation to transpose EU Directive 2004/28 which is the new framework legislation governing the veterinary medicines regime across Europe. The deadline for transposition is 30 October 2005. The EU legislation includes a general provision that all veterinary medicines for food producing animals should be brought under veterinary prescription control.Arising from difficulties expressed during the negotiations of the EU measure by Ireland and a small number of other member states, an exemption clause was included in the directive, which provides a mechanism for specific categories of medicines to be excluded from the mandatory prescription requirement. Decisions at EU level on exemptions are required to be taken by 1 January 2007, pending which existing national distribution arrangements may remain in place.I am aware of the concerns which have been expressed here in Ireland about the potential cost implications for farmers of restricting all medicines to veterinary prescription control. However, as I have indicated, final decisions have yet to be taken and Ireland's approach to the exemption mechanism is to try to keep certain medicines, including certain vaccines, available without prescription. It should be noted that in the interim farmers will continue to be able to get these products without having to obtain a prescription and therefore the need to extend the range of those allowed to prescribe to include, for example, pharmacists does not arise.

The findings of the appeals committee were that the original decision taken by my Department should be upheld.However, my Department has now obtained additional information regarding the circumstances of this case and is satisfied that force majeure should be applied. As a result, the years 2000 and 2001 will be excluded and the single payment entitlement will be based on the year 2002 only, as this is the most financially beneficial position. The person named was notified of this decision on 23 May 2005. An updated statement of provisional entitlements reflecting this position also issued to the person named on 23 May 2005.The person named also submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payment scheme national reserve under categories B and C. Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. Category C caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, sold their milk quota into the milk quota restructuring scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.The rules governing the single payment scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him or her. In excess of 17,200 applications have been received under the national reserve at the Department's office in Castlebar and are being processed at present. In view of the number of applications received and the documentation submitted, it will be some time before a decision is reached on whether the person named is entitled to an allocation from the reserve. He will, of course, be notified of his eligibility or otherwise as soon as all applications are processed.

I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that figures are not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling estimates of the number of farmers who sold land to facilitate the purchase of other land.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	774	A planting target of 20,000 hectares per annum was established in the 1996 strategy document, Growing for the Future. The review of that strategy, produced by Peter Bacon and Associates and published in September 2004, reaffirmed the need for an approved planting target of 20,000 hectares per annum but commented that a lesser planting target could be a viable basis for support, providing the planting were undertaken in a manner that maximised the non-timber benefits.I believe that the current availability of grant aid at 100% for planting and the annual premia, particularly the concession obtained regarding the stacking entitlements vis-à-vis the single payment scheme, make forestry a very attractive land use option for farmers. For 2005, I have made sufficient funds available to support an increased planting programme of some 15,000 hectares, which is the maximum the sector could deliver at present. However, that is a demand driven scheme and the level of planting ultimately achieved this year will depend entirely on take-up from the sector, in particular from farmers.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	775	The farmed deer population in Ireland stands at nearly 50,000 animals on some 300 units, producing almost 800 tonnes of venison annually. Deer numbers have increased by 10% since 1994. About 70% of production is exported to markets in Denmark, the UK and the US. Fallow deer are exported to Denmark, while red deer are supplied to the supermarket chains in Ireland and the UK and also to restaurants at home and in the US. There is severe competition from larger, lower cost producers abroad, especially Scotland and New Zealand, which influences price.Irish venison is a specialised high quality product that has established good quality markets at home and abroad. The structure of deer farming has altered over the last ten years. The average deer enterprise has increased in scale from six to ten hectares, while the average breeding herd has risen almost twofold, from 48 to 88. While there may be fewer enterprises today, they are larger, more specialised and moving towards quality assured high value product outlets.The development of a quality assured venison scheme has improved the marketing potential of Irish venison, especially in supermarkets, and it is expected that the trend will continue. Approximately 100 deer farms are now quality assured.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	778	According to the CSO, the number of full-time farmers, that is, farmers whose sole occupation is farming, declined from 106,000 in 1993 to 76,200 in 2003. In the same period, the number of part-time farmers or farmers who have another either major or subsidiary occupation increased from 52,900 to 58,900.The agri-vision 2015 committee indicated in its report that it believed the trend to part-time farming, using a somewhat different definition from the CSO, will continue. The ongoing trend towards part-time farming reflects a combination of factors, including the increased availability of off-farm employment. Many smaller farmers are finding that combining farming with off-farm employment is an effective way to ensure their viability on the land. At the same time, full-time farmers are looking to the new flexibility offered to them under decoupling to develop and intensify their commercial farm enterprises.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	779	The framework agreement for the next WTO round, which was concluded in Geneva in August 2004, commits member countries to agree detailed rules, including an end date, for the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsides and for the introduction of disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect. That agreement covers export refunds, export credits, the trade distorting practices of state trading enterprises, and food aid not in conformity with disciplines to be introduced.The detailed implementation of that framework is the subject of ongoing negotiation at technical and political level and is likely to conclude at the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005. My objective in the negotiations is to ensure that Ireland remains competitive on world markets, and I am satisfied that the framework agreement represents satisfactory progress from our point of view. My aim is to ensure the parallel phasing out of all forms of export subsidies, as provided for in the framework agreement, and that the phasing out period be as long as possible.

Effective promotion and marketing of beef by Bord Bia and the industry has ensured a presence for top quality Irish beef in all the key European markets. This includes supply arrangements with multiples and the main retailers in the UK, France, Italy and the Netherlands.Table 1 shows Irish beef exports to markets in thousands of tonnes for the last five years.20002001200220032004France4013162024Italy3011223540Netherlands3026303941UK110220245251264Other EU3522426869Total EU245292355413438Russia743837647Egypt1500011Other non-EU935757Total 3rd Countries25048908255Overall Total495340445495493The traditional export market for Irish lamb is France, which accounts for the majority of sheepmeat exports.

In certain cases the record of import may include the re-import of Irish products that were originally the subject of an export from this country.

Imports form part and parcel of international trade in which Ireland has a very substantial positive balance. With regard to the sheepmeat sector, imports are small in comparison with exports of 54,000 tonnes in 2004, amounting to 4% overall. Ireland is a net exporter of pigmeat to the tune of around 60,000 tonnes. We are also a net exporter of poultry when processed poultry products are taken into account, for example, in 2004, 93,000 tonnes of poultry and poultry products were exported whereas 56,000 tonnes were imported.Imported meat and meat products must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. Exporting establishments must have standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments; effective control systems and supervision by the competent authorities; traceability and labelling in accordance with the systems approved by the EU Food and Veterinary Office and accepted and notified to the EU member states. The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved.Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.Importers of meat and meat products must be registered with my Department. They are required to give advance notice of importation and, following import, are required to keep records of importation available for inspection by the Department for a period of three years. Imported meat and meat products must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of production and a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation.While there is free movement for trade within the EU, all consignments from third countries must first be landed at a border inspection post, or BIP, that has been approved by the FVO and must undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. These latter tasks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. In Ireland, BIPs approved for the processing of imports of meat and meat products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport.The FVO carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state's BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under the harmonised legislation, are being correctly applied. Once it has been established that imported meat and meat product has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the Community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.Where there are concerns with regard to the effectiveness of controls being operated in an approved third country the Commission, in consultation with the standing committee on animal health and the food chain, may introduce specific controls by means of a safeguard measure to ensure the protection of human and animal health. Safeguard measures limiting or banning the export of animal products from EU countries or regions of countries may also be implemented where, for example, the conditions of an animal disease outbreak could seriously effect production and trade in animal products in the EU.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	782	I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 171 together.Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including fish, as well as to imports of these products from third countries. Under harmonised legislation a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the member states to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health. The application of these standards in the member states is monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU.It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. To be an approved third country it must appear on a list drawn up and updated on the basis of EU audits and guarantees given by the competent authority of the exporting country; have veterinary controls equivalent to those applicable in the EU, particularly in terms of legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, veterinary medicines controls, zoonoses controls and other food law; have in place a residues programme approved by the European Commission.The animal products must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. Exporting establishments must have standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments, effective control systems and supervision by the competent authorities; traceability and labelling in accordance with the systems approved by the FVO and accepted and notified to the EU member states.The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved.

They are required to give advance notice of importation and, following import, are required to keep records of importation available for inspection by the Department for a period of three years. Imported animal products must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of production and, in the case of meat and meat extracts imported from third countries, a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation.While there is free movement for trade within the EU all consignments from third countries must first be landed at a border inspection post, or BIP, that has been approved by the FVO and must undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. These latter checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. In Ireland, BIPs approved for the processing imports of animal products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport. The FVO carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state's BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under the harmonised legislation, are being correctly applied.While responsibility for general controls in the area of marketing of fish and fish products lies with the Department of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, under a special arrangement with that Department and in accordance with authorisations issued by the Minister, officers of my Department, with the co-operation of the sea fishery control officers, administer the BIP controls on third country imports. Once it has been established that an imported animal product has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination.

The requirements are as follows. In the case of fresh meat, carcasses, half carcasses or half carcasses cut into no more than three wholesale cuts and quarters intended to be placed on the market for human consumption must bear the EC health mark, including the name of the country of origin. In the case of packaged cut meat, the health mark must be applied to a label fixed to the packaging or printed on the packaging in such a way that it is destroyed when the packaging is opened. The EC health mark allows meat produced in export approved premises to be traced back to the plant of origin.Raw milk, heat treated milk and milk based products must be labelled, without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 79/112/EEC, in accordance with the conditions governing labelling contained in Council Directive 92/46/EEC which includes the necessity to apply an EC health mark containing the name of the country of origin.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	785	The Deputy refers to two visa applications in his question but he has only supplied a single reference number. Based on the name and date of birth of the applicant my officials were able to locate the previous application. A previous application, No. 1353245, was refused by my Department on 11 June 2003. The applicant had applied for a visa for her elderly father to join her in the State as a dependent but there is no provision under Irish law for the granting of visas under these circumstances to the relatives of non-EEA nationals resident in the State. Consequently, my Department was required to refuse the application.The most recent application, No. 1357878, for a limited term visa, was refused by my Department on 4 November 2004. The visa officer examining the application noted that the reference's permission to remain in the State had expired on 24 October 2004. Consequently, it would not have been appropriate to issue a visa to the applicant. The visa officer was unable to conclude, based on the evidence supplied, that the applicant would necessarily observe the conditions of the visa applied for, such as the condition that he would not seek to overstay illegally in the State. Neither was the visa officer able to establish that the applicant had sufficient economic, social or professional ties in his country of origin to guarantee his return.An appeal was subsequently received in respect of this application. The accompanying documentation included evidence that the reference's permission to remain in the State had been extended for a further two years. However, the appeal failed to address the concerns raised with regard to observing the conditions of the visa and obligations to return. In fact, a letter from the reference that was included with the appeal states: "I declare that my father or myself do not have any economic, social or professional ties or other obligations in our country or origin".Consequently the visa application was refused on appeal on 21 January 2005. As each application is entitled to only one appeal, no further action on this application can be facilitated.

Balbriggan5738,448I am pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the agreed programme for Government. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of each Garda district in Dublin city and county will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. The additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high visibility policing and they will have a real impact.

I understand he refers to application number 1800190 which was refused by my Department on 13 May 2005. The applicant was issued with written notification of the reasons for refusal by my Department on 19 May 2005.When assessing any visa application, the visa officer must consider various matters including, for example, whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that the applicant's stated purpose of visit to the State is the true purpose of the visit, that he or she will comply with the terms of a visa and that he or she is unlikely to breach the common travel area by using Ireland as a means of gaining entry to the UK.In assessing these issues, the visa officer will have regard to such factors as the applicant's ties and general circumstances in the country of origin and to his or her immigration history. In this regard, it was noted that the person in question had been refused a visa for the UK. The visa officer was unable to conclude, based on the person's immigration history and a lack of evidence to demonstrate that he would observe the conditions of an Irish visa, that it was reasonable to grant a visa in the circumstances.

The application of the person concerned was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and he was notified of this recommendation by letter dated 4 March 2005. His subsequent appeal was refused by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and he was notified of this recommendation by letter dated 7 April 2005.He was notified of the decision to refuse him refugee status by letter dated 8 April 2005 in which he was informed of the three options open to him at that point. These were to leave the State before his case was considered for deportation, consent to the making of a deportation order in respect of him or make written representations, within 15 working days, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out the reasons he should not be deported, that is, why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.His case was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement, including consideration of representations received on his behalf from the refugee legal service for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 13 May 2005, a deportation order was made in respect of him. Notice of the order was served on him by a member of the Garda national immigration bureau on 18 May 2005. One of the requirements of the notice was that he must co-operate fully with the Garda in facilitating his removal from the State. He informed the attending gardaí that he would not co-operate with them in returning him to Nigeria. A decision was then made to arrest and detain him pursuant to section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended by the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that when gardaí went to arrest the person concerned, he attempted to throw himself head first out of a first floor window and had to be physically restrained to prevent him from so doing. During the course of the incident he received a superficial abrasion to his scalp which did not require medical attention. He was conveyed to Cloverhill Prison, where he was detained overnight pending his removal from the State. He was deported to Lagos on a scheduled flight, via Schipol Airport, Amsterdam, on Thursday, 19 May 2005.Throughout this person's asylum process, his legal representatives were kept informed of its progress. There was no appeal pending at the time of his deportation. There is no basis for stating that due process was set aside in this instance and the question of revoking the deportation order in this case does not arise. I emphasise that this application was processed in accordance with arrangements for the speedier processing of asylum applications for applicants from certain prioritised countries, including Bulgaria, Croatia, Nigeria, Romania and South Africa. These arrangements took effect from 25 January 2005 and I expect many other cases to be dealt with as expeditiously as this one in the coming months.

I am further informed that this investigation has, to date, led to a number of arrests and that it is anticipated that more arrests will follow as further progress is made. The Garda investigation team is aware that, as reported in the national press, the family of the victim has made certain approaches to prominent individuals in regard to the alleged involvement of unlawful organisations in this incident. Garda inquiries are continuing in this regard.In regard to reassuring residents of the Dublin 15 area, I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the level of both Garda foot and mobile patrols has been increased and that the area is also the subject of intensive policing activity, in accordance with the operational goals of both Operation Crossover and Operation Anvil. Moreover, local gardaí will continue to liaise with residents and residents groups and associations in the area to ensure their concerns are met.

The average time for processing applications for naturalisation is 24 months. However, as the processing of applications made on behalf of minors is less complex than those made by adults, the processing time for such applications can be significantly shorter. I will inform the Deputy and the applicant of my decision on this application as soon as the process has been completed.

Garda authorities have also informed me that two of these gardaí are deployed on a full-time basis to the Navan Road area, encompassing Ashington, Kinvara, Ashtown, Darling, Kempton and their environs. Local Garda management reviews the deployment of personnel on an ongoing basis and is satisfied with the current deployment of community gardaí in the area.

They are assisted by mobile uniform and plain clothes patrols. There is no green space near the area referred to.

The premises have been subject to Garda surveillance on a number of occasions and no evidence was found of the supply of alcohol to under age youths. I am assured by the Garda authorities that the area concerned is subject to ongoing foot and mobile patrols by uniform and plain clothes gardaí.

Licensees were invited to take an active role in ensuring that no drinking took place on the unlicensed areas outside their premises. Furthermore, gardaí on duty at events are directed to pay attention to such activity and bring the matter to the immediate attention of the licensee or person in charge. I understand that regular foot and mobile patrols give the matter appropriate attention during their tour of duty. I am assured by the Garda authorities that gardaí will continue to give the matter their ongoing attention.

I understand that in addition to the issuing of fines on the spot to illegally parked vehicles, vehicle clamping and the towing away of such vehicles by Dublin street parking services, a Garda tow truck is employed on match days to tow away illegally parked vehicles in the area. The Garda authorities are not considering an extension of the Garda cordon to the area on major match days.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	803	The regulations governing the operation of horse drawn carriages are contained in the Dublin Carriages Acts 1853-55. I am informed by the Garda authorities that they issue licences to the proprietors of horse drawn vehicles each year. All carriages and horses are brought to the Carriage Office by their owners for inspection before such a licence is issued. While there is no legal obligation to have insurance on these vehicles, nor is it mandatory, I would consider it prudent for any business concern to have appropriate insurance cover. The decision is, ultimately, a matter for the individuals concerned. The question of recovering compensation in respect of damage to property or injury to persons would, of course, be a matter for parties concerned and open to civil suit.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	804	I am satisfied that the film censor is fulfilling his responsibilities. The film censor has in place a range of mechanisms which enable parents and others to express their views on film classification and certification. These include the holding of regular focus group consultations comprising parents, educators, students, psychologists, psychiatrists, other experts and representative organisations such as the National Parents Council; the establishment of a website, www.ifco.ie, which I launched on 3 September 2004 and which provides consumer advice to parents on the content of every film; a major national survey of parents carried out by Lansdowne Market Research and a survey on adolescent attitudes to film classification.The Deputy may be interested in the results of the survey of parents, in which two out of three parents said they regularly agreed with the film censor's classification. Of the one in three who said they sometimes disagreed with the classifications, a majority felt such classifications were too strict.On the film "9 Songs", the Deputy should note that there is no ministerial power of direction or overriding authority to vary a decision made by the film censor. I have, however, drawn the censor's attention to the complaints I have received concerning the film and I have done the same with this parliamentary question.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	806	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.The selection of investigators was a matter for the tribunal. The practical arrangements necessary for their appointment were carried out by my Department. The Garda Commissioner had no involvement in the process.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	807	When the father and mother of a child cannot agree on custody issues, it becomes a matter for the court to decide. Married parents living together are joint guardians and custodians of their child. If they separate, custody is normally with the parent with whom the child primarily resides but the other parent still remains a guardian.Under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987, an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian.Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including the question of custody. In making such orders and in determining, for example, whether an unmarried father should be appointed guardian, the court must consider the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. Where appropriate and practicable, the court in making any order takes into account the child's wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child. In considering whether to make an order under section 6A or 11, the court is directed — under provision in the Act of 1997 — to have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.The Act of 1964, by way of amendment in the Act of 1997, encourages parties to a dispute relating to a child to agree on the custody or guardianship of or access to a child. Prior to institution of proceedings the legal representatives of the parties must discuss with them the possibility of agreement. The court may adjourn any proceedings to assist agreement between the parties. The legislative provisions are extensive and permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's care and upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.I am aware of the concerns of fathers about custody rights and the operation of the law in this area is being kept under review in my Department.

If the Deputy has a query about a particular school for 2003-04, I will be happy to answer it.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	809	All applications for temporary accommodation for the next school year have been considered in the school planning section of my Department. The application for a resource room for the school in question was not successful on this occasion. The school authority has been advised accordingly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	810	The report of the action group on access to third level education, which was launched in July 2001, made detailed recommendations concerning the target group of "those most in need" which has been defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.The action group recommended the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants, and advised that an income limit should be fixed at a level which would, at a minimum, include persons on unemployment assistance, long-term, with a qualified adult allowance, full rate. The special rate of maintenance grant was introduced for the 2000-01 academic year.Following a review in early 2002, the income thresholds for the award of the special rate of grant were increased. In addition, the criteria were broadened significantly and a number of additional social welfare payments were included as eligible payments for the purpose of the scheme. Since 2002-03, the total reckonable income limit has been based on the maximum point of the old age contributory pension plus the maximum qualified adult allowance for a person over 66 years. This yielded an annual income threshold of €14,693 for the 2004 scheme.To qualify for the top-up grant in the academic year 2004-05 all candidates must satisfy the following conditions: qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant in respect of the academic year 2004-05; total reckonable income limit in the tax year to 31 December 2003 must not exceed €14,693, net of standard exclusions, as set out in the 2004 maintenance grants schemes and net of CDA payments, where applicable; as at 31 December 2003, the reckonable income of parent(s) or guardian(s), the candidate himself/herself or the income of the spouse/partner, as the case may be, must include one of the eligible social welfare payments prescribed under the scheme.Where the reckonable income exceeds the top-up income limit of €14,693 the candidate is ineligible for top-up grant assistance.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	811	I have included the building project for the school in question in my recently announced list of school projects to be progressed through architectural planning in 2005. The extension refurbishment project at the school includes the provision of a language disorder unit. My Department has been in contact with the school recently to progress the design process and is now awaiting a revised preliminary submission from the school authorities.A decision on which school building projects will advance to tender and construction as part of the 2006 schools building and modernisation programme will be taken later in the year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	812	I can confirm that the special educational needs organiser, SENO, received an application for special needs assistant, SNA, support for the pupil in question. The SENO's decision was that this pupil's needs could be catered for from within existing provision within the school.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	813	An application for financial assistance towards the purchase of additional land has recently been received from the school in question and is being considered by my officials. The school has also applied for funding towards an extension and refurbishment at the school. As the existing school site is not owned by my Department, there are legal complexities to be considered before a decision is taken on how best to meet the school's accommodation needs for the future. My officials will be in contact with the school authorities in this regard in due course.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	814	The application for a major capital project from the school in question is currently being examined in the school planning section of my Department. The position in regard to the school's application for funding of the smaller project already undertaken is that the works concerned were progressed by the school without the prior agreement of my Department. It is not my Department's policy to sanction retrospective funding for any project progressed by a school authority without my Department's prior approval.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	815	My Department is committed to funding the provision of PE, general purpose and outdoor play areas in schools as part of the schools' capital investment programme. Providing recreation areas such as hard core ball courts, general purpose rooms at primary level and PE halls at post-primary level are considered an integral part of the design stage for any major refurbishment programme of existing school buildings — providing always that the site is of sufficient size — or where a new school on a greenfield site is being built.Applications for the provision of enhanced PE or sports facilities in schools are considered in the context of all other applications on hand for capital investment, for example, applications for new schools, refurbishment projects, extensions, new sites, remediation programmes and so on.As part of the 2004 school building programme and, in recognition of the fact that 2004 was the European Year of Education through Sport, 14 stand alone PE halls in post-primary schools were sanctioned to go to tender and construction — eight of these through a drugs task force initiative. In an effort to reduce the time taken to deliver PE halls, as well as reduce the amount spent on design team fees, the Department has developed a generic design for PE halls for post-primary schools. Two of these generic halls have already been completed, two more will be completed by the end of June 2005, with the remaining two expected to go on site during by the end of the year. It is intended that the generic design will speed up the delivery of PE halls and significantly reduce design costs for the delivery of such halls in the future.All eight of the drugs task force initiative PE halls went on site during 2004 and it is envisaged they will all be completed by August 2005. In addition to these halls, the Department is co-funding the development of a €17 million sports and leisure centre at Le Fanu Park, Ballyfermot, a project headed up by Dublin City Council. In total, €4.25 million will be committed to this project over the next two years. All local schools will be afforded priority access to the facility during school hours. The project is expected to be completed in 2006.With regard to specific applications for capital grant aid from the schools in question, the progress of these projects will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2005 onwards.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	816	The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule is outlined in primary circular 15/05 which issued to all primary schools recently. This is in line with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises a principal and one mainstream class teaching post. This is based on an enrolment of 12 pupils at 30 September 2003. The school also has the services of a learning support teacher. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will consist of a principal teacher. This is based on an enrolment of 11 pupils at 30 September 2004.To ensure openness and transparency in the system, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02 which is also available on my Department's website. The appeals board will meet in June, July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year.The closing dates for appeals are 3 June, 24 June and 7 October. Appeals must be submitted to the primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. It would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the amended prioritisation criteria for large scale projects which were revised following consultation with the education partners last year. Progress on the application is being considered in the context of the school building programme from 2005 onwards.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	818	For a number of years the Department has approved the secondment of teachers to area based partnerships operating under the aegis of Area Development Management, ADM. The purpose of this support is to promote co-ordination and coherence regarding the education related actions of partnerships at the level of local communities. However, in June 2004 the Department approved the continued secondment of education co-ordinators for one further academic year, that is, up to the end of June 2005. The question of extending approval for these posts is under consideration in the Department at present.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	819	A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy schoolbags, including the possible implications for the health of pupils.The group's report, which was presented in July 1998, acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level and one of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags. In this regard, the Department initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.Arrangements are currently being made by the Department to issue a further circular on the weight of schoolbags to all schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	820	My Department does not have statistical details of the type requested by the Deputy. In general, many schools at primary level have a general purposes room for play and PE facilities during inclement weather. In addition, practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are utilised for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. Similar circumstances obtain regarding sports halls and outdoor facilities at second level. Many schools also have the use of adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.The provision of multi-purpose space for primary schools will continue to be considered within the design brief for new schools and/or renovation and extension of school buildings. This will also be the case for PE facilities at second level. This will be done in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising schools building projects.The use of PE halls or multi-purpose rooms as classrooms is only as a last resort when it is not possible to provide schools with the extra accommodation that they need to cater for increased enrolments or extra staffing straight away. The need for additional accommodation at any given school is considered in the context of the Schools Building and Modernisation Programme 2005-2009.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The steering board of the European Defence Agency held its third meeting in Brussels on 2 March 2005. The steering board is the principal decision making body of the agency, on which the 24 participating member states are represented. Denmark is not a member. The meeting, in the formation of national armaments directors, NADs, was chaired on behalf of Javier Solana by Eero Lavonen, the Finnish NAD. The Irish delegation comprised relevant officials of the Department led at assistant secretary level.The steering board approved the EDA input to the European Commission's consultation process on its Green Paper on defence procurement and instructed the agency to continue to support the Commission's work. It also agreed a programme of work for the EDA on the European defence equipment market.The chief executive of the agency, Mr. Nick Witney, made a brief presentation in which he took stock of the establishment of the EDA, with special focus on recruiting and ongoing work and external relations. The deputy chief executive of the agency, Mr. Linnenkamp, made a presentation on the transfer of functions from the Western European Armaments Group, WEAG, to the EDA. WEAG will be closed once its functions are transferred to the EDA. WEAG is an agency comprising Government representatives within the framework of the WEU and has had a role in co-ordinating research and development activities, opening up cross-border defence markets and so forth. The WEU comprises 28 delegations with differing membership status. Ireland has observer status at the WEU.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-25 00:00:00	Prelude	824	Creggs sewerage scheme was fourth on the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Galway County Council in response to the Department's request to local authorities in 2003 to produce updated assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The assessments were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2004-2006, published in May 2004. Given the rating afforded to the scheme by the council, it was not possible to include it in the current programme. Further consideration will be given to the proposal in the next phase of the programme in light of the council's prevailing priorities at that stage.
