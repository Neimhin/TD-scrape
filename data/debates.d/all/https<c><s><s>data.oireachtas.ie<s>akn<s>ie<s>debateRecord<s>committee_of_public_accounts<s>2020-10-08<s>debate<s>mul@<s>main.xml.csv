#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-08 00:00:00	Special Report 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: National Asset Management Agency	1	This morning we are engaging with witnesses from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA. I welcome our witnesses to today’s meeting and thank them for the briefing they have provided to the committee. The focus of today’s meeting is NAMA’s financial statements for 2019, and the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report 109 on NAMA’s management and disposal of the Project Nantes loans, a matter that was raised with the last Committee of Public Accounts. With regard to public health guidelines, we are joined in person by Mr. Aidan Williams, chairman, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, chief executive officer, and Mr. Jamie Bourke, head of strategy and communications. We are also joined remotely by Ms Noelle Condon, chief financial officer with the NTMA.  I remind all those in attendance that all mobile phones must be switched off. I also ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking as the masks interfere with the quality of the sound. When members are leaving and taking their seats, I also ask that they sanitise their area.  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence with regard to a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, witnesses should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol. I invite Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-08 00:00:00	Special Report 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: National Asset Management Agency	2	As members are aware, the National Asset Management Agency was established in December 2009. At the outset, it was envisaged that NAMA would have a life of around ten years, and would therefore be winding up in 2020. However, a Department of Finance review published in July 2019 recommended that NAMA continue to work out its residual loans for a limited period beyond 2021. It further recommended that, before the end of 2021, NAMA would submit to the Minister proposals and a plan for the dissolution of the agency. Because NAMA’s primary purpose is to dispose of the loans it acquired on the best achievable terms, it is more meaningful to consider its cumulative performance, rather than make year-to-year comparisons.  Members have been provided with a graph that shows how NAMA’s profit level has been tailing off. It had accumulated reserves totalling €4.5 billion by end 2019. At that date, it was projecting delivery of a final surplus of €4 billion when it winds up.  The other key aspect of NAMA’s financial performance is the ongoing reduction in its holdings of loan assets, and associated borrowing. At the outset, NAMA acquired property-related loans with a par value of €74.4 billion for an outlay of €31.8 billion. This was funded through the creation of €31.8 billion in debt. Both the level of loans outstanding, and the outstanding borrowing, had reduced considerably by the end of 2019, as reflected in the agency’s statement of financial position. I will now turn to the special report on NAMA's management and disposal of the Project Nantes loans. In autumn 2018, concerns were raised with the previous committee and directly with my office about the sale by NAMA in 2012 of a portfolio of loans to a Luxembourg-based company. The disposal, referred to by NAMA under the code name Project Nantes, was one of its first loan portfolio sales. The loans included in the sale were mainly of two types. There was a large number of high-risk equity-backed loans, which had no property collateral, and which NAMA acquired from the participating banks for a nominal payment of €1 per loan. Most of the other loans were property-backed, related to properties predominantly located in other European states or the US, with only about a quarter related to properties in Ireland.  The concerns raised about the Project Nantes loan sale included questions around the adequacy of the sales process, the price achieved for the portfolio, and the legality of aspects of the sale. There was an exchange of correspondence between the committee and NAMA, which we have reproduced in an appendix to the report. Despite the explanations provided by NAMA, I felt that the matter required further inquiry, and my office therefore undertook a value for money examination of the sale.  NAMA’s general strategy to manage its loans was to organise them by reference to debtor connections, that is, grouping of loans connected through a common debtor, or common group of debtors. What became the Project Nantes portfolio was part of the larger Avestus portfolio, which in turn was part of the Quinlan and Quinlan Partnership debtor connection.  In its response to the committee’s inquiries, NAMA emphasised the out-turn it had achieved on the Avestus portfolio. NAMA’s total outlay on the Avestus portfolio was €136.3 million. Between 2011 and 2013, it realised a total of €204.1 million from the loans, thus yielding an overall cash surplus of €67.8 million on the portfolio. NAMA has stated that it is strongly of the view that this surplus was the best commercial outcome achievable for the Avestus portfolio at that time.  In fact, the Avestus portfolio of loans was disposed of in eight transactions, rather than in one single portfolio sale, so it is relevant to consider also the outcome on each transaction. As figure 3 in the report summary indicates, two of the transactions, related to large office developments in London, resulted in very substantial gains for NAMA, while five resulted in modest gains. In contrast, Project Nantes resulted in a sizeable loss for NAMA. Contrary to a code of practice for NAMA’s disposal of bank assets approved by the Minister for Finance in 2010, NAMA did not seek current independent valuations of the Project Nantes loans or of underlying property collateral. Furthermore, NAMA did not pursue a competitive sales process. Instead, it negotiated exclusively with one potential purchaser of the loans called Clairvue, which was introduced to the process by Avestus.

I apologise. Before we get to questions I call on Mr. McDonagh to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-08 00:00:00	Special Report 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: National Asset Management Agency	4	The committee has invited us to discuss NAMA's 2019 financial statements and the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on Project Nantes. I am joined by Mr. Aidan Williams, the NAMA chairman, Mr. Jamie Bourke, our head of strategy and communications, and Ms Noelle Condon, our chief financial officer. Last year, 2019, was another successful year for NAMA. We reported a profit of €265 million and continued to make material progress on all of our objectives. Coupled with our 2018 results, in the past two years alone NAMA has generated profits in excess of €1 billion. We generated more than €1.3 billion in cash during the year, exceeding our deleveraging targets. This and further cash generation during 2020 brings cumulative cash generated by NAMA since inception to €45.7 billion.  As a result of a programme of efficient and focused deleveraging over the past ten years, our loan portfolio is now 97% reduced from its €32 billion acquisition cost. Our deleveraged position means that NAMA is far less vulnerable to potential falls in asset values than it would have been just a few short years ago. However, NAMA is not immune to the effects of the economic crisis created by Covid-19. The impact of Covid-19 can already be seen in our financials for the first quarter of 2020, where we reported a loss of €49 million. The widespread and unexpected market disruption caused the NAMA board to make a management judgment on the possible reduction in value of our residual assets. Thankfully, some parts of our portfolio have performed better than expected since the end of the first quarter and we are reporting improved results for the second quarter. The disruption continues to impede the completion of some of our activities and delay planned debtor exits and asset sales. Accordingly, it is increasingly likely that NAMA may be left with a larger residual portfolio by the end of 2021 than the €300 million previously envisaged. I now turn to the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on Project Nantes. I would like to make the committee aware of our statutory confidentiality obligations under sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act, as well as the confidentiality clause in the loan sale. These clauses effectively preclude us from discussing or disclosing specific information regarding debtors, their loans or transactions. However, in this context, and in consideration of the published report which does contain a great deal of information, I will endeavour to be as comprehensive as possible in my remarks. Following our last appearance before the committee, we engaged in extensive correspondence with it regarding the Project Nantes loan sale. The queries originated in part because of an allegation that the loan sale was not compliant with section 172 of the NAMA Act. This allegation has been found to be incorrect. As regards the other findings in the report, from our perspective there are a number of fundamental points to be made. The Nantes loan sale cannot be viewed in isolation. It must be viewed in the context of the global connection exit strategy. We achieved profits of €78 million on six out of the seven connection loan bundles, as evidenced by the graph on page 12 of the special report, but made a €10 million loss on Nantes, resulting in an overall profit for the taxpayer of €68 million. A consensual loan sale ensured the achievement of the global exit target in the most efficient manner. It is NAMA's experience that in certain circumstances higher returns can be achieved from the targeted sale of assets to credible specialist buyers. That is to say, open marketing does not always result in the best possible outcome. As regards NAMA not seeking up to date valuations, the loans were independently valued in 2009 prior to acquisition by NAMA and reassessed in an independent business review, IBR, by a large accounting firm in 2011. These earlier valuations were arguably overstatements by the time the loan sale was completed in January 2012 as Irish asset values continued to decline by approximately 30% from late 2009. We did, however, have up-to-date appraisals of valuation on the assets. We fully accept and regret that there was a miscalculation on the part of NAMA in setting the €125.5 million target, as certain loans were inadvertently misclassified in the IBR report. This transaction occurred early in NAMA's life cycle when we had no central IT systems and relied on multiple spreadsheets with volumes of data. Since then, our internal controls and IT systems have evolved and improved and are significantly more robust as well as being subject to rigorous control testing by our auditors. Nonetheless, we are of the strong view that the miscalculation of the target did not affect the outcome from the portfolio. The gross proceeds achieved of €210 million exceeded the restated target of €151.8 million by €58 million. This was a notable return in a very depressed market. Irish Government bond yields were close to 18% and Ireland was in the middle of a Troika bailout. Equally, it is acknowledged in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that had NAMA set a higher repayment target for the Project Nantes loans there was no guarantee that a sale could have been concluded at that higher price. All commercial transactions carry risk. If NAMA withheld the sale of every asset because it may subsequently increase in value, we would never have disposed of a single asset. We make considered decisions based on our section 10 mandate, the information available at the time and the expertise and experience of our staff. We still have much work to do in order to maximise the value of our residual portfolio. However, in a very real sense, we have already achieved the primary statutory mandate set out for NAMA when it was established. We have fully repaid the €32 billion in debt issued to acquire loans. Importantly, we repaid the Government guaranteed portion three years ahead of schedule in 2017. This not only removed a contingent liability for the State but significantly aided Irish banks in returning to the financial markets. We have deleveraged 97% of our acquired portfolio and made a substantial and tangible economic and social contribution through our residential funding programme, which has delivered more than 17,000 units to date, our docklands strategic development zone programme, which is 75% complete, and our social housing programme, which has provided more than 2,600 homes to date. Most remarkably, in my opinion, this year we accomplished a goal that was simply not considered possible when NAMA was first established. We delivered a sizeable surplus payment of €2 billion to the Exchequer in June of this year. Our surplus will provide the Exchequer with valuable resources that the Government may use to alleviate some of the immense pressures currently being experienced throughout our society and the economy. Further transfers totalling €2 billion are anticipated over the next two years. Our progress in the achievement of our objectives demonstrates that our decisions have overwhelmingly been the correct ones. We all can see the effects of Covid-19 in causing lower valuations of assets and we are fortunate most of the portfolio was disposed by the end of 2019. We have the capability to effectively address any challenges that may arise from dealing with our residual portfolio and we remain reasonably confident we can preserve the €4 billion surplus.

I was involved in the NAMA debates when the legislation was before the Seanad. As I have said, I envisaged that there would probably be a second or third NAMA Bill and, with the benefit of hindsight, there probably should have been. On a macro level, Mr. McDonagh and the former chairman, Mr. Daly, deserve great credit for achieving what they set out to do. The failing was in the legislation and in the fact that there was not a second or third NAMA Bill as matters became clearer. The failings we see are probably on the ethical rather than the statutory side at this stage, such as the lack of a social dividend and, arguably, the focus on supporting the construction industry to the extent it did. No doubt, books will be written on all these matters in the future but, on a macro level, our guests deserve great credit. I am sure it was an extremely busy but fast decade for them. I hope Mr. Daly is doing well and wish Mr. Williams well in his role. Would our guests accept, looking back, that mistakes were made with regard to Project Nantes?

There were two loans we had acquired from the banks for €18 million. When that information was relayed to the independent business reviewer, it was not stated that we had paid €18 million for them. The independent business reviewer assumed they had been acquired for zero, because it thought they were equity loans as opposed to first charge loans. It put them in at a value of €2 million rather than €18 million, so that was a difference of €16 million. As for the personal loans of €9.7 million, we always knew we had acquired them for €9.7 million. If €16 million is added to €9.7 million, it is close to the €26 million adjustment before the 15%.

We relied, therefore, on a 2009 valuation as opposed to current ones. Can Mr. McDonagh recall why that was done?

Under the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, code, valuations have to be performed by qualified valuers. The code of practice required an appraisal, and appraisals can be done by people who are not qualified valuers. That is a distinction under the SCSI code. We believed that although the November 2009 valuations were dated 30 November 2009, they were effectively done in late 2010 because there were references back to 30 November 2009 . They were provided to the independent business reviewer, which did an assessment of those cash flows as part of its work. We relied on those as meeting the criteria for being appraisals as opposed to valuations. We all knew that because of the stress that was on the markets globally at that stage, asset values were effectively falling. The Deputy will recall that in 2011, very much like today, the whole eurozone was crisis-----

The SCSI is very perfectionist about its profession and says valuations have to be done by qualified valuers. The code of practice, however, states that appraisals can be done by people other than qualified property valuers. They can be people who have knowledge of the situation. We believed that the independent business reviewer had knowledge of the assets he was reviewing as part of the property plan. We also had people internally who were very seasoned property professions, who had the view that the information going forward was representative of what the assets were worth.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-08 00:00:00	Special Report 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: National Asset Management Agency	21	I turn to the converse of that, which is where I gained the experience to which Mr. McDonagh referred. This was declared in the previous term of the Committee of Public Accounts, that I had worked as an auctioneer and, on one occasion, had been handling a receivership file for individual private homes. If someone was selling a three-bedroom semi-detached property at that stage, by NAMA's insistence there would have to be an up-to-date valuation. It might have been less than €100,000 at the time for certain properties, particularly in rural Ireland, yet when the properties were in the tens of millions of euro, the desktop appraisal was acceptable. Does Mr. McDonagh accept that there was a very thorough and robust micromanagement of individual property sales of relatively low value, but that when it came to the big stuff, we were not applying the same level of oversight?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-08 00:00:00	Special Report 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: National Asset Management Agency	22	I would not accept that. In fairness, one tries, at the time, to take a decision. We had business plans from 800 debtors. We had to review those business plans and make an assessment of what we thought the assets were worth when we were putting it forward to, in this instance, the credit committee of the board. If a property was being prepared for sale, we would accept that whoever was selling the property would give us an assessment of value for the asset. If it then went on the market, the market would determine what it was worth.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-08 00:00:00	Special Report 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: National Asset Management Agency	23	I am bound to suggest that perhaps we did not focus as much on the larger valuations as we did on the lesser ones, and that might have been a lesson, although it is ten years ago now. When we got to the sale of Project Nantes, the Avestus portfolio had already performed well because there had been two large and very profitable disposals and others that broke even. Then we came to Project Nantes, where we were sort of in clover, for want of a better expression, compared with the recovery targets that were set. Is there any sense of complacency here, where due process was overlooked because, to get out alive, it was decided just to take the first person who came and to waive the need for competitive tension and the normal processes that would apply, on the basis that the overall target for Avestus and the recovery would be met and, therefore, anything would do?

I am saying that, in the context of this and, similarly, of Project Eagle, it is a matter of fact that valuations were not done, that competitive tension was not sought in the normal way and that mistakes were made in aspects of the valuation. My question, in effect, is whether this was looked at in isolation and decided that, as one of the 800 business plans that would perform, there was no need to worry about the kind of detail that would be applied to others.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-08 00:00:00	Special Report 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: National Asset Management Agency	26	No, because we always had the same concerns about this debtor connection and the significant exposure to other third-party banks. It was highlighted in the business plan, which was reviewed and sent to the board by the independent business reviewer and to my internal team at the time, that there was a real risk that if the third-party creditors moved against these people, the whole business would collapse and go into liquidation, and we would have lost the asset-management platform of Avestus to manage these assets, which were in multiple jurisdictions and were quite complex in their financial structuring, which they fully understood. Their help was needed to unwind - let us put it that way. We always share that concern. To be clear with the committee, all the debtors in NAMA have made efforts to get out of it. That is just the nature of the business and it is very understandable. Avestus was trying to find people to back it and to get its loans out of NAMA. Another major US real estate fund had expressed interest before Clairevue and backed out, and then Clairevue came along and made an offer.It also wanted to make an offer wherein we would give it indemnities and underwrite its due diligence costs, both of which we refused to do. Even in January 2012, when we decided to proceed with the offer to Clairevue, we knew these concerns were still there and that these debtors were very vulnerable to third-party actions. At the same time, in January 2012, we decided that we would not sell the discrete asset in Paddington as we would be better off continuing to fund it and finishing it. As a result of that decision, we turned it from a €75 million valuation to €104 million. We were constantly evolving our strategy to make sure we could get the maximum out of the connection but at the same time the vulnerabilities attached to these debtors always existed and it was a real risk to us in terms of management.

The Committee of Public Accounts took advice from its own parliamentary counsel and the Comptroller and Auditor General has looked at it as well. There was nothing illegal with the section 172 declaration. The man was not, nor had he ever been, a NAMA debtor and Avestus was never a NAMA debtor. There was nothing legally we could have done to stop it. The only failing was a moral failing on the part of Avestus because it should have been upfront with us and said that one of its colleagues had been asked to be a director of this entity by Clairevue but that he was not a NAMA debtor. If it has told us that upfront it would have been better for everyone.

It was quite a thorough report which made for a shocking read. I refer to the litany of mistakes, the oversights, the lack of transparency around record-keeping and the lack of adherence to guidelines and best practice. This morning's statement from NAMA disputes much of what was identified in the report as poor practice. That is quite astonishing. Is Mr. McDonagh seriously suggesting that because a profit was made overall on the Avestus loan bundles that the glaring errors made in Project Nantes are therefore irrelevant? Making a mess of one thing is not cancelled out because NAMA did not make a mess of everything. Does Mr. McDonagh accept that?

If the Avestus connection was able to write the cheque and give us €125 million, that would have been a complete loss to the taxpayer but the important thing to remember here is that we did not achieve €125 million or €152 million, but €210 million overall. I cannot say that I or anyone else in NAMA is infallible, that we do not make mistakes or that we are not humans. We did not want to make the mistake. The mistake was made, we apologised for it, we regret it and I wish it did not happen but it did. What more can I say other than that I wish it did not happen?

I think NAMA has done a very good job in recent years in difficult circumstances. Its return to the Exchequer of the sums that are there is very welcome, particularly now. I recognise it is a commercial enterprise operating in a commercial environment, which is extremely difficult. It needs to make commercial judgment calls, not always with the benefit of perfect information that we all might like. I also recognise that NAMA has a significant level of oversight with the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee in public forum. That is a pressure on a commercial enterprise that other commercial enterprises do not have. I recognise and acknowledge all that. It is clear that Mr. McDonagh is here to talk about a mistake that has been made. He has acknowledged that, and I accept that. On the other hand, I have some detailed questions on it. I am concerned about the part of the report dealing with the level if disagreement with and contesting of the Comptroller and Auditor General's findings and the engagement on that. I note that over the last two years NAMA has derogations for legal services of over €11 million. It is important that NAMA is equipped with appropriate legal commercial expertise given the commercial entities it is engaging with. However, I have a concern where that expertise is being used against other entities of the State. How much of those fees are being used to fight any findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General?

At one stage we had 380 people. I think it was in 2014. We were down to 211 at the end of 2019. We have just run a redundancy programme again and our target is to get to 143 by the middle of next year and by the middle of 2022, we will be down to about 80 people. Our people are leaving and being made redundant. Like everybody, they have commitments, mortgages and families. They are moving.

Clearly, NAMA has become one of the biggest residential delivery providers. One figure on page 9 jumped out at me. The number of units for which NAMA or its entities have planning permission but are not yet under construction is 6,200. The graphic beside it shows units under construction or with funding approved but 1,100 of those with funding approved but not yet under construction, leading me to see 7,300 with planning permission but not yet under construction. What is going on there? How is it that when we are crying out so badly for houses they are not yet under construction?

The infrastructure cost alone before one can build a house is something between €25 million and €30 million. One has to put that in before one can actually build anything on it. Given our timeframe, it is probably not going to be viable for us to put that level of money in before we can start construction. Over time, while that might be built out - that might be an excellent site in an excellent location - it will be long past NAMA's lifespan. These are sometimes the difficult decisions that we have to make. Another site has an issue where effectively the National Roads Authority has to put in a spine road before that. It does not have the funding to do it. We have another site in Wicklow where one of our clients has built a lot of houses and wants to continue building houses, but unfortunately Irish Water needs to improve the whole water infrastructure. The cost of that infrastructure is, I believe, between €50 million and €60 million because it is going to serve the whole area and Irish Water does not have the funding to do it. The client wants to build 200 houses extra. Irish Water says it does not have capacity for it. The client has got permission to build 25 more houses because that is the maximum Irish Water can connect to the network. The site has planning permission but third parties outside our control, like the National Roads Authority and Irish Water, have other issues which are preventing that. We are funding any site which is commercially viable because it makes sense for us to do that; we make money. It also provides housing. No matter what NAMA can do, we cannot do Irish Water's job and we cannot do the National Roads Authority's job.

They also had to tell us what borrowings they had with third-party banks.In fairness to the debtors, with regard to any cash resources they had when they came under NAMA, we said they would have to pay the interest on NAMA's loans. The third-party banks were not happy about this and were asking why their loans were not being serviced. This still goes on today but it was particularly prevalent in 2010 and 2011 when all banks were distressed and everybody was trying to grab whatever assets they could. They were threatening to appoint receivers, liquidate assets or take judgment actions.

The way these connections were set up structurally involved companies in Ireland, Luxembourg, Holland and Delaware. The financial structures were very intricate, although they were completely within the law. To unwind these connections was going to be very difficult.

The public believe this to be the case and that, therefore, something wrong was going on. Does Mr. McDonagh accept that impression has been given and that we have failed to dispel that impression today?

I noticed something in Mr. McDonagh's statement that always grates with me, as I have said on several occasions. I refer to the word "profit". I appreciate that NAMA ended up with portfolios on which there had been great discounts. I believe the Comptroller and Auditor General said the outlay was €74.4 billion and that NAMA received the assets for €31.8 billion. I would say we are talking about a "surplus" rather than a "profit" given that the public took a hit of €40 billion. That is important to note. The par value for the assets relating to Project Nantes was somewhere in the region of €306 million. Is that correct?

NAMA hoped to get €46.2 million. We have heard that there were errors and Mr. McDonagh has accepted this. The public took a great hit and NAMA was set up and given a job to do, which was to get as much as it possibly could for the assets. Its terms of reference stated that it was to achieve the best possible amount. Why then would it not have insisted on a competitive process in every instance?

It does not say that we have to openly market such sales. We set a target for the connection but this target was not achieved. The portfolio was sold off in parts and this was the residual connection. As I told Deputy MacSharry, Clareview was one of the first funds to come and look at this portfolio. Another US fund looked at the portfolio and declined to buy it. Clareview made an offer and we had to decide whether to accept that offer or to negotiate with Clareview. We negotiated a sale of the portfolio with it. There was nothing inconsistent with the code in doing so.

If they had done so, it would have made it very difficult for us to unwind the complexity of the connections and the assets involved. We needed their co-operation to unwind the assets.

There may well have been a desktop exercise carried out after that. Mr. McDonagh might confirm whether there was. There was no competitive process and Clareview knew that there was no other bidder. Did NAMA not just throw in the towel in attesting that there was no more to be achieved from this?

We still had the same issue, which was that, in buying this loan portfolio from NAMA, Clareview had the same issue as NAMA had. It had to take the view that it could manage this connection even if those involved were enforced against by third parties and made bankrupt. These specialist funds probably have more specialist expertise in managing complex infrastructures in multiple jurisdictions. We had to make an assessment. This was a business assessment based on the best information we had at the time and it suggested that this was a good offer.

The Deputy must recognise something. She talked about November 2009 but the valuations were actually done in 2010 by reference to 30 November 2009 because that was the set valuation date. The difference is that between November 2009 and 2011 and the start of 2012 the Irish market was falling dramatically. Commercial property prices had fallen by 30%. We looked at this by getting a valuation in 2019 - for somebody to go back to value them at the time we sold them and they said the €10 million would only have been a €3.5 million loss because there would have been a €6.5 million reduction in the Irish assets between November 2009 and the time we sold them. With assets we sold, I wish I could say we made a profit on every asset in our portfolio but we did not. One must make a decision at the time and one must live with it, in terms of making sure one did what one thought was the best outcome at the time.

We did not achieve €152 million or €125 million. Therefore, we do not think that looking at Nantes in isolation, when one has a debtor with multiple assets, is a fair reflection.

The previous three years we did 2,500 units. What is happening is that a number of our debtors, because of the improvement in the market in the past number of years, have been able to pay off their debts and leave NAMA. Some of these are big house builders and, fair dues to them, they have paid off all their debts to the taxpayer and then moved on. That, therefore, reduces our capacity in terms of the number of builders we have in NAMA and building units. We have tried to deliver the maximum we can. This year we would definitely have delivered 1,500 units. However, because of the lockdown and Covid and the restrictions in terms of people working internally, before one could have a plumber, an electrician and a tiler working in a house at the same time, but they must now work discretely because of the necessary Covid restrictions. Hence the 750. As such we have had to push the target out to 2021 and we will get to the 20,000.

Then we have a situation where, on the valuation NAMA had placed on the file and very conveniently with the Project Nantes portfolio, Clairvue offers, through a non-competitive process, essentially the gap NAMA needed to fill. A gap that Avestus was aware of and that this director, who happened to also be a director of the company that made the bid, was aware of. Is that correct?

Thus there was a situation where a company that had an interest in purchasing this portfolio had, as a director, someone who was aware that NAMA had a target price to achieve and that company, very conveniently, valued that portfolio at almost the exact amount NAMA needed to secure.

When they are given a target to meet they know exactly what is needed to meet the debtors. Again, just to be fair to Avestus, as it is a requirement, that person became a director of Clairvue in, I think, December 2011. Clairvue made the first offers to us in October 2011, before that person was a director.

The Comptroller and Auditor General has suggested that the overall portfolio was undervalued to the tune of €29 million. There has been a suggestion that on the Nantes project a loss was incurred by the taxpayers in Ireland of €10 million. Mr. McDonagh is suggesting that it has only been €3.5 million. All of these things are possible but what I do not understand is the answer to his first question which is that he accepts and contends that this was actually a success for the agencies and for the Irish taxpayer. Whatever about laws being broken, bad practices were clearly employed. My fear is that NAMA is not as angry as hell about the fact that it has been played. A guy who was operating for a company that it employed was also a director of a company for somebody who is purchasing the portfolio that was for sale through a non-competitive process. At the end of the day the people who lost were the Irish taxpayers. I do not understand why Mr. McDonagh is not as angry as hell with this individual and the companies involved because they played NAMA.

I am angry and I was very unhappy at the fact that they were not upfront with us and told us that one of their colleagues was not a NAMA debtor, and to pick up this point, was being asked by Clairvue to become a director of this Luxembourg entity which bought the portfolio. It would, as I said before to one of Deputy Carthy’s colleagues, be morally better to me if they had been upfront with us. There was nothing we could have done about it.

On non-competitive procurement, in the statement of internal control for 2019, approved derogations were to the tune of €5.1 million. In 2018 it was €8.6 million. The derogations for legal services were €3.9 million and in 2018 it was €7.4 million. For the benefit of the committee, can Mr. McDonagh outline the steps involved in the derogation process and what the values for thresholds are for derogations that require to be approved by the NAMA board? Can he also explain the reason why a service provider had prior and existing knowledge of the debtor and outline what this refers to, please?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-08 00:00:00	Special Report 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: National Asset Management Agency	198	Yes I will Deputy, I may need a moment to just find it within the documentation here. In overall terms, every procurement policy is in complete compliance with the code of practice issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. We allow derogations but these derogations are provided in the context that they do not break European laws, which is a golden rule. The board must approve any derogations which are above €200,000, which is the EU threshold. Most of our derogations arise in two particular areas. One is on legal services, primarily litigation, where such litigation is taken against us and we have no choice but to defend it. If we have a firm working on a case for a number of years, sometimes in foreign jurisdictions, and there is then suddenly another strand of litigation, it does not make sense to use another firm and we would continue to use that firm. The foreign litigation that we have been involved in has been very expensive.  The other area in which many derogations arise concerns mainly information technology systems where we had spent a great amount of money building a specific IT system for NAMA to suit our business because when we started this agency in 2010 there was no business like NAMA. Sometimes, if we wish to try to do something else and add additional controls, we have to pay for those additional services to enhance systems and controls.

Thankfully, some of those properties had income in rents coming from them. Non-disposable income is made up mainly of rents or debt settlements with people where additional unencumbered assets and things like that are being handed over. The majority of this money relates to rents which we received from assets we collected over the years before we sold them.

I am a bit like Deputy Carthy and am trying to get to grips with all of this. I have a question but I will check that I have it right before I ask it.

Clairvue offered almost exactly that, which we now know was probably less than it was worth. In some of the submissions today I am reading that Clairvue paid Avestus a fee in performance-related compensation. What does that relate to?

As I said at the start, these assets were involved in very complex financial structures in the way they were set up. Clairvue took the view that it needed people in Avestus to help it to unwind the assets as they were sold over time and it paid Avestus an asset management fee to help it to realise these assets over time. Avestus was not going to benefit from any profit but it is going to get an asset management fee on the back of managing the assets.

They have been approaching banks, private equity funds and wealthy investors to tell them that their loans are in NAMA and asking them to refinance those loans out of NAMA, at which point they would help the bank, private equity fund or investor to manage those loans afterwards. That is the real world and that is what happens. The reality is that whoever puts their money up, these guys are tough as nails and they will not give any of their profits away to the former debtors. They might pay them a fee to help manage the asset, depending on the complexity of the situation and if they needed them. In most cases, they do not pay a fee. They just throw the debtor aside and manage the asset themselves.

Given that our bondholders are repaid and considering NAMA's projections of a €49 million financial loss in 2020, is it still the plan to wind down and dispose of assets on the existing timeline? If so, why? Would it be more prudent for the State to hold on to some of these assets and realise the more annualised yield?

We believe some of this land will become quite valuable before 2025 because of planned infrastructural works by the State. To give the Deputy an example, we have a lot of land banks in north Dublin.

Pre-Covid-19, there were plans for work to start on MetroLink and once we start opening up and approving access to lands, as everybody would know, it effectively becomes more valuable in terms of people getting planning permission for housing, commercial buildings or whatever the case is. This turns the land from having agricultural value into having commercial value. For argument's sake-----

It analysed NAMA versus the Sociedad de Gestión de Activos Procedentes de la Reestructuración Bancaria, SAREB, in Spain and the German bad bank. Moody's said that NAMA has been by far the biggest success of those three comparable bodies that were set up in the same time. Even the troubled asset relief programme, TARP, in the US, which was set up in late 2008, has had a performance of somewhere around 1%, although it has been a few years since I have seen its figures. Even on the measures that were set up by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the section 226 report, our performance has been up around 7%. We are farther ahead and our costs are a lot less than the comparable bodies in Germany and Spain.

I will primarily focus on the organisation and staff of NAMA. I see from the report that NAMA has had year-on-year growth in staff numbers from 2010 to 2014, resulting in 369 employees at the end of 2014. What are the current numbers of staff in contracted employment with NAMA? What is the gender balance of that? What percentage of senior managers are female in the organisation?

In 2019, we had 211 staff, we currently have around 180 and we plan to get to 143 by the middle of next year. Our overall gender balance is 52% male and 48% female.

Some 19 of these were made redundant, sharing €1.01 million in redundancy payments. In light of NAMA's wind-down, how many redundancies is it expecting in 2020 and what strategies is it using to retain staff?

In fact, our voluntary redundancy programme just closed this week. We offered 33 redundancies and we only had 20 who applied for and accepted them. We have a number of people on contract, so that will hopefully make up a lot of difference. That is not surprising in the Covid-19 environment. This time last year, people wanted to leave because there were plenty of jobs in the economy but it has become different in the last six months, which is understandable. To answer the Deputy's question, everybody in NAMA will be made redundant by 2025. That is the trajectory we are on, while at the same time we hope to return at least €4 billion to the Exchequer. That is what it is about. It was never an organisation for the long term.

Will these 33 redundancies also remunerate garden leave? Can Mr. McDonagh let members know what garden leave is and the reason why those staff were on garden leave?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-08 00:00:00	Special Report 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: National Asset Management Agency	235	The reason we have garden leave is because of an issue that was raised by the Committee of Public Accounts in 2012 and 2013. The committee said that people were leaving NAMA and jumping straight into the private sector and that it was not good that they were bringing their knowledge from NAMA straight over to the other side of the table. The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, is the employer, not NAMA. It introduced garden leave provisions so that when anybody leaves NAMA, they have cold storage periods before they can start working anywhere else. Garden leave provisions are typically three months' contractual leave but if somebody says they have been offered a job somewhere that is unrelated to NAMA, we might reduce that to two months. That is just a way of ensuring somebody does not leave NAMA and go straight into somebody across the table.

Does Mr. McDonagh feel that was appropriate and will we see that happening in the future? I see that NAMA has reduced the outstanding loans to €1.8 billion and the number of debtors to more than 200. Mr. McDonagh said that NAMA should be wound down by 2025 so will there be a year-by-year reduction in redundancies?

However, everybody knew when they came into NAMA that it had a limited lifespan and once the assets are gone that is it. We cannot employ people unless we have work for them.

This relates to Project Nantes, which NAMA acquired from participating banks for a nominal amount of €1 per loan. Most other loans were property-backed and related to properties in the US and across Europe. With regard to that portfolio, I understand Project Nantes was one of the first portfolios the witness dealt with under NAMA. From his earlier comments and the question regarding an individual who was involved both on the negotiating side and ultimately in one of the purchasing entities, I believe he said that the amount was mooted around October 2011 but he did not start until, perhaps, November or the like.

According to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the negotiations were continuing. It states that it went on to agree adjustments. Basically, it was not finalised and was continuing. How long did that process continue?

In fact, in January 2012 there was one equity loan which was attached to the Paddington asset, that was including Clairvue, and we took it out. There was an adjustment in the price to reflect that. It was the best outcome for NAMA because we made €1.1 million more than what Clairvue was prepared to pay for it by holding onto it.

It made a conditional offer to us of around €29 million on the basis that we would indemnify it against anything that would be wrong with the assets, which we could not do, and that we would pay its due diligence costs of €250,000. We said we were not doing that and we would not do a deal with it on that basis. We negotiated those two things away, the indemnity and the €250,000. In January 2012, we became aware that there were developments in the Paddington asset which were going to increase its value and we decided to retain the Paddington asset. We had the loan over the asset itself, a 50% loan, but we also had the equity piece which the debtors had borrowed to put the equity into the Paddington asset. We took that loan out of Clairvue and there was an adjustment to the price from around €29 million down to €26.7 million. With that adjustment of €2.5 million or €2.6 million we ended up getting €1.1 million more subsequently on the back of taking it out of the loan.

We want to see the full value realised on behalf of the taxpayer. I have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General. His report states that "without the assurance of a contemporaneous asset valuation and a competitive sales process, there is no basis to conclude that NAMA achieved the best possible financial outturn from the Project Nantes loan sale". What was missing in his investigations that means he cannot make a full definitive evaluation in terms of any impropriety, if one can call it that? His report also states that since Project Nantes involved a loan sale, "there is no reason to believe that there was any infringement of section 172 of the NAMA Act". How did he come to that conclusion?

My sense is that there could have more available, but I could not put a figure on it.

Regarding section 172, the legislation is very tightly drafted. It was originally envisaged that NAMA would be disposing mainly of property. It did not envisage, and put the same restriction in respect of, the disposal of a portfolio of loans. I do not see a basis for concluding there was illegality here.

NAMA informed Avestus of the €125.5 million repayment target it aimed to achieve, and Avestus was given six months to meet that target. Despite the importance of that exchange, NAMA, as far as we can ascertain, did not document that communication process or put the proposal in writing to Avestus. As the chairman of the board, did you find it unusual that the offer made to Avestus was not properly documented or put in writing? Was that common practice within the organisation, particularly with a multimillion deal such as this? It was not documented and there were no minutes or any documents relating to that, as far as we can ascertain.

This is something that when it arises in practice always raises questions not just in respect of NAMA but also other bodies. If one is bringing a car for which one paid €4,000 to a car auction, and the first person one meets inside the gate offers €4,000 and one decides to take it and go home, it would not be good practice, particularly if there were potentially other buyers. Has the board ever discussed loans being offered exclusively to one body such as this? Why were the loans not advertised in the normal fashion? I heard the CEO's answer on that, but would it not have been better that they were advertised, at least? There were a number of months involved. There was no independent valuation. Would it not have been advisable to seek a valuation?

A lot of the overseas loans had property which was going up in value, as was proven by the case of the two London properties, where they multiplied quickly and became very profitable. One part of the portfolio was in Ireland. Should a question not have arisen at the board where there was no independent valuation and where one outfit, Clairvue, was given exclusive rights to buy this?

The proof of that is in the Paddington asset that was removed from the portfolio when information was received that the asset was potentially more valuable. The exclusivity is given when NAMA is at the stage where it has done diligence and thinks it appropriate at that time to enter into an exclusivity agreement.

The valuation used by NAMA was a 2009 valuation. Part of the portfolio related to Irish properties which we would all accept would have dropped from 2009 to 2011. Those of us who were around at the time would have seen that happen. The other part of the portfolio which was overseas, not in this State, increased in value, for example, the Paddington and Kensington properties. Moving into 2012, those were exchanged for that 2009 valuation. Why was no revaluation of the assets carried out prior to the sale in accordance with NAMA's loan sale policy? I might put that to the CEO.

There was talk at the time about the euro imploding. Financial markets everywhere were dislocated and in distress. That is why we did not believe there was any increase in value in those eastern European assets.

At the time, NAMA was under immense pressure from the troika to generate cash to pay off €7.5 billion of debt in order that Ireland could get out of the troika bailout. We knew that it was highly likely that these debtors would be enforced against by third-party banks and creditors. We had to make the decision at the time because we knew that we had to get money in and that these guys could fall over at any moment. If they fell over, we would find it very difficult to realise value on those assets.

Tomorrow is the first day of the future. Can Mr. McDonagh assure the committee and public here today that, when disposing and making use of those assets, the taxpayer and the State will receive the maximum benefit?

If I might give a practical example, an off-market offer for two houses in a good suburb in Dublin was recently made to us. We were offered €1.8 million to sell them off-market. We said we would not sell them off-market, we put them on to the market, and we only realised €1.5 million when we put them onto the market. If we had accepted the off-market offer, we would have got €1.8 million. We said we could not because we live in a new world and we had to put them on to the market, and we got an offer of €300,000 less in the final outcome. That is why I said in my statement that putting properties on the market is not always the best outcome, but in the world we live in today, everything goes onto the market and has a valuation. It is completely different from 2011.

That gap arose in the Committee of Public Accounts during the last Dáil. In hindsight, are there things that Mr. McDonagh thinks we should do regarding section 172? I know there is one case outstanding with the Garda, from the last parliamentary question I asked. Is that the only one at present?

That is why the board said it would extend farther than the legislation allowed and that we would seek the section 172 for sales by debtors or receivers or in respect of loan sales. The board extended it even though it had no statutory basis. Therefore, we started seeking the section 172 declarations anyway even though it was not particularly a legal requirement under the Act to deal with that. The board recognised this in 2012.

There are two subsections to my question. The reason we know or became aware of this was that a former Deputy, Mr. Mick Wallace, informed the House of that information. Was NAMA aware of that before it was conveyed to the House or was that the first time Mr. McDonagh heard of it? I hear what Mr. McDonagh is saying with regard to changed procedures over the past number of years and we welcome that. I hear what Mr. McDonagh is saying when he says he hopes it will not happen again. However, have NAMA's procedures and processes changed to a degree that at least there is an effort or a mechanism in place by which there is an attempt to identify whether people are working for, advising or facilitating purchasers of portfolios who might have some form of insider information?

The Deputy can say that. I will not say that. In terms of procedures and as a result of our previous appearance in front of the committee we have put a chief legal officer in place in NAMA. We have started a process of going back through transactions to look at documentation around them and have done quite an involved exercise on the biggest asset sales that happened in NAMA, which is still ongoing. There are check processes around this, going back and looking at things like this. We are at the later stages of that and have not uncovered anything unusual or something like this. I wish to give the committee that assurance. It shows again that when the committee makes a suggestion to us we take it on board. We try to do supplemental checks we are legally entitled to do. That is the important thing. We cannot do something or make allegations against people but we try to re-establish the facts and make sure they were what we were told at the time.

In terms of the lands and sites NAMA currently has to dispose of before 2025 or thereabouts and previous land it has sold, has NAMA kept the full planning permissions attached to those sites active or did it let them lapse? If so, roughly how many are we talking about? I would have hoped and expected that extensions to planning permissions would have been applied for to keep the value on the sites. Finally, if we find there are breaches of section 172, will enforcement action and pursuit of those issues be taken?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-10-08 00:00:00	Special Report 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General: National Asset Management Agency	311	With regard to planning, we always seek to extend the planning permission because if we let it expire then, effectively, the value of that asset goes back to agricultural value as opposed to the value of planning. Sometimes the issue has been that the planning granted is not commercially viable but that is another story. If it does not cost much to extend the planning we will do it and we will work with the local authority on that basis. In terms of section 172, if we find that anybody associated with NAMA did something we were not aware of at the time and people tell us or we find out ourselves and believe there is a breach of the law, we are absolutely obliged under the Criminal Justice Act to report it and we do report it.

Where is NAMA with regard to both of those commercial strategies?

We got the SDZ status and, effectively, 75% of that has gone through. We have remaining interest in six sites. Two of the sites are being built at present or are resold. When they are complete they will be handed over to the new purchasers who bought them on a completed basis. They are two high-profile sites, namely, the Exo Building near the Point Village and Boland's Quay which has been pre-sold to Google. We have minority interests in four other sites where we are in joint ventures with Oaktree and Kennedy Wilson. This is public information. We have a common interest with Waterways Ireland on one other site. We are trying to work with Waterways Ireland to sell our joint interest in that site together to maximise the value as all that money will come back to the taxpayer because Waterways Ireland and NAMA are State entities. That is what we have left in the docklands. Poolbeg SDZ was granted planning in April 2009. We launched a competitive process in July 2019 and that process is still continuing. We hope to conclude that as soon as possible.
