#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I repeat my previous calls to the Leader and Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on Northern Ireland between now and the Christmas recess. An urgent debate is needed, particularly on the extremely contentious issue of individuals who are on-the-run, who are at large and have never faced charges for serious criminal offences they committed over the past 40 years.The Government's approach to this matter is constitutionally questionable. The argument that presidential pardons should be granted to individuals who have never been convicted of a crime is dubious. Under Article 13.6 of the Constitution, presidential pardons aim to deal with miscarriages of justice. Can we say that miscarriages of justice have occurred in any of these cases, which mainly involve IRA terrorists?This is an example of politicians meddling with the judicial process because the Government wishes to establish an eligibility body. This House should be aware of the recent comments made by the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Mr. Mark Durkan, MP. Mr. Durkan clearly demonstrated that these proposals would constitute an effective amnesty for IRA terrorists and members of the RUC and the British Army who committed crimes over the past 35 years. Government Senators must be aware of the very serious implications of these proposals. I ask the Leader to arrange this necessary debate over the next two weeks.There is some good news with regard to decentralisation. There appears to be a major exodus from the office of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely. Everyone wants to leave his office and decentralise to other parts of the country.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Senator Brian Hayes raised an extremely important point, although I do not fully agree with him. I have grave reservations about the proposals to deal with individuals on-the-run who are wanted on criminal charges. I instinctively dislike the notion that individuals wanted on criminal charges might not be brought to justice in a democracy. How we deal with them afterwards is another issue but I find it impossible to cope with it in terms of how we structure our democracy and the need to have a judicial system in place.I also recognise we have had to accept much in the cause of peace. Last weekend I met Michael Finucane whose father was assassinated by loyalists, perhaps in collusion with the authorities. I asked him how he felt about this. It was the most humbling experience to hear his reply. He said it was terrible but if that was the price we had to pay to get the prize of peace, he and his family were prepared to accept it. At that stage I felt whatever reservations I had should be buried immediately. We must take this step to move the process forward and I will support the proposal when it comes before the House.However, it would make a bad situation worse if the issues raised by Senator Brian Hayes were not properly investigated and disposed of. If it turns out afterwards that we have done something which is unconstitutional, our last position will be worse than our first. I do not understand how we can do this constitutionally. The method being used in the UK might be more interesting and easier for parliamentarians to deal with. I do not understand the technicalities but we must move on this issue. However, I accept we must take seriously the points made by Fine Gael and by the Labour Party in the other House. This must be an all-party issue. These issues have never divided us on a party political basis and I do not believe the points raised by Fine Gael and the Labour Party have been raised on that basis but rather on the basis of a real concern about how we deal with this issue. I would like to be reassured, as I am sure we all would, that whatever way it is done is workable.It is worth noting something which, in previous times, we might have discussed at great length and which, in some way, relates to the points made yesterday by Senator Ormonde and others on the need for a debate on the development of the economy, jobs, etc. Some 100,000 additional jobs have been created in the economy in the past year. That is hugely important and is worth protecting. It is something from which we all gain to some extent and is another reason we do not want to move into a period of industrial chaos which would put all that at risk.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	9	On Senator O'Toole's last point, Members will be glad to know Bank of Ireland spent most of yesterday apologising for its chief economist's aberrations on "Questions and Answers" on Monday night. A representative telephoned my party colleague to apologise to him and made it quite clear its chief economist was acting in a personal capacity and was not speaking on behalf of the bank. That was because of the public outrage at the tone and content of his remarks.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	11	There is something very sinister going on.On the issue raised by Senator O'Toole, there is another issue, namely, the real fear among people on lower incomes that the high level of immigration, which is very welcome in principle, is resulting in some downward pressure on what are already low wages. Even though there are 100,000 extra people at work, we will find the Government's income tax revenue will not go up by too much and will not reflect that growth in employment. Although we have not studied it and we do not really know, there is a strong feeling that many of these jobs are being filled by people earning wages which are below what most Irish people would accept. I am not saying all these people are being paid below the minimum wage, although I think many of them are. We need to study this issue and to ensure that immigrants, who are welcome here, are not being used to force people to work for wages which are below those we would regard as acceptable.We have always wanted to turn this House into one which discusses European matters. The latest proposal from the United Kingdom Government on the EU is essentially what the President of the Commission said, that is, a proposal to rob the poor to help the rich. That budgetary issues would be sorted out to the satisfaction of the rich countries by reducing the support given to the new member states is about as insidious a proposal as the European Union has made in terms of what it is supposed to be about. Coupled with the apparent fact that our membership of the EU is making the Government impotent on the Irish Ferries issue and the increasing activism of the Commission in dealing with Irish grant aid to foreign direct investment, there is a succession of issues arising which mean we should have a reasonably frank discussion on Ireland and the European Union and the future progress of the Union.We discussed the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill yesterday. It is a mongrel of a Bill in the sense that it is connected to approximately four or five different issues. It was a most unsatisfactory debate because major amendments were introduced by the Department of Health and Children — for example, the basic idea of allowing nurses to prescribe medicine. The amendments were introduced without any documentary assistance for this House. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who is a man of considerable charm and with whom I get on very well, read out a four or five page explanation for approximately eight amendments. That is not the way to do business.When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, tabled major amendments to the Garda Síochána Bill, he produced a volume of documentation. I never thought I would stand up and sing the praises of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but in comparison with the Department of Health and Children's performance yesterday, it is a model of organisation, openness and accountability.The Department of Health and Children should rewrite this Bill and reintroduce it with all the new amendments at which point we can have a proper Committee Stage debate. Yesterday was a farce in which Senator Browne and I endeavoured to deal with issues for which we were not properly prepared, although that was through no fault of the Minister of State because he was landed here.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I join with previous speakers in calling for a debate on Northern Ireland and, in particular, those on the run. I share the concerns of previous speakers in this regard. Whatever system we put in place in the Republic, it should be mutually transferable between both jurisdictions. I am fearful of having a different system here and in Northern Ireland. I am also conscious there could be legal difficulties from a constitutional perspective. However, clarity must be brought to bear on this issue and serious questions must be asked. What is proposed in the United Kingdom might not be what will emerge by the time it goes through the House of Lords. We need to debate this issue and set out our views clearly. I ask the Leader to facilitate such a debate before Christmas.I wish to comment on the two recent drugs seizures. We are quick to condemn and criticise the Garda Síochána and minority elements within it for actions but we must compliment it on two major seizures which, in no small way, will play a major part in helping to eradicate the terrible drugs culture in this country.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I support Senator Brian Hayes's call for a debate on Northern Ireland and I agree with many of the points he, Senator O'Toole and Senator Minihan made. I referred briefly to this issue yesterday. There will be a difficulty if Britain opts for a licensing system and we opt for a pardoning procedure. This has been greatly expanded with the inclusion, as Senator Brian Hayes said, of the RUC and the British army. The Leader said yesterday the Government has taken the advice of the Attorney General. Of course, Governments should listen to the advice of the Attorney General but when the Leader was Minister, she, almost Albert Reynolds-like, did not always accept the advice offered to her. We may have to look further into this matter. In any event, as has been said, a debate is urgently required on the matter.

We need to do something. The Minister must make an announcement next week to incentivise the placing of SSIA moneys in pensions. There is a serious national shortfall in pensions and there is a crisis on our hands in regard to this important issue. The ball is at the Minister's feet and I urge him, as I am sure would the great majority, to put this right in his Budget Statement next week.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	16	In regard to Senator Ryan's comments, it would be a very bad day for free speech and democracy in this country if people were prevented from expressing their views on issues because of the fear of being carpeted by their employers, or party leaders for that matter. We should bear this in mind. People are perfectly entitled to express their personal views about issues. Whether we like those views or not is another matter.Representations have been made to me by small businesses in the construction industry in regard to the terms of a new fixed contract that is currently being negotiated by officials in the Department of Finance and employers' groups. It could have serious detrimental effects, especially on small construction businesses which employ 30,000 people in the mid-west region. The effect could be delays in small public contracts, litigation and very serious problems for some smaller companies that will not be able to compete in this market in the future under the proposed new conditions.We need clarification from the Department of Finance as to how this fixed lump sum contract arrangement will work. We may be able to get some indication as to whether it would be possible to amend it to ensure that small companies, which employ 30,000 people in my area of the mid-west, will not be put out of business.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	17	For once the Leader will be pleased to know I am not seeking an urgent debate. That said, we should consider debating two reports. One report was issued during the week by the European Environment Agency which stated we had the second worst record for pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in the European Community. That should be debated reasonably soon.I read this morning of a report from the British Oceanographic Data Centre. The report states that the Gulf Stream, which has benefitted the islands of Great Britain and Ireland for millennia, is in danger of weakening. It also states that while Ireland and Great Britain are on the same latitude as Newfoundland, we have been aided by the Gulf Stream, but within 20 years we too could be in need of ice breakers. I do not know if today's weather is a sign of things to come.It is interesting that these two reports have come out this week, one of them identifying Ireland and the other identifying the global climate change that is taking place. It is in our hands to do something about it and perhaps we should put it on our agenda for a debate in the near future.

As any law enforcement agency will confirm, drug seizures only represent a very small proportion of the drugs that come into a country. I call for a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to discuss why the ten-year mandatory sentence for possession with intent to supply of over €10,000 worth of cannabis is not being enforced. It is on the Statute Book but to the best of my knowledge, very few, if any, drug dealers have fallen foul of this law. It is time we discussed it because the longer we wait the worse the problem will get.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on issues relating to the labour force, particularly migrant workers, because of the anecdotal evidence about their treatment and the wage rates paid to them. We need to know if there is evidence of exploitation or if migrant workers are being used to push down average wage rates in this country and to displace Irish workers. If that is the case, it is a very serious matter. This issue is regularly raised with me and I am concerned about it. We need to pay urgent attention to this matter because of the implications not only for migrant workers and Irish workers, but also for its potential to create a degree of social unrest. I ask the Leader to give this urgent attention.We are coming up to the budget and many in this House, myself included, have worked to ensure that the issue of child care was brought to the top of the Government's agenda. We await with great anticipation announcements next week in regard to this issue. It is important that we debate the budget. However, considering the work we have already done, including the Leader, to put child care on the agenda, we should have a separate debate following the budget on where we are now and where we are going in the future as regards child care.

I learned last week that the NRA is only undertaking a survey about the need for such a road. I would have thought the need was proven beyond doubt. My party and I have put forward a revenue neutral proposal that could bring the long suffering to an end immediately. The proposal is that tolling would only apply to vehicles travelling in one direction while those travelling on the other side of the road would not be charged.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	62	It is an unnecessary distinction.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I also request a debate on Iraq. The city centre of Ramadi was taken over by 400 armed men who claim to be members of al-Qaeda, on the day after President Bush again told a military audience he is winning his war. On top of that we are made complicit in the crime of torture because a Gulfstream V jet, which is an international pariah, is still allowed to conduct its torture missions through our airports.I notice two articles beside each other on the front page of The Irish Times today, one indicating that less than 10% of people have applied for decentralisation, and the other indicating that the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, is on his sixth secretary in three years and is also seeking a new constituency secretary. Will the Government consider giving him responsibility for decentralisation?

I can already see a move in beginning to admit the war of deceit has failed and has been a total disaster.I also support Senator Norris's calls for an immediate debate on homelessness in this city and throughout the country. Every morning when walking on Molesworth Street, one can see people who have been lying on the street during the night. A lady protesting on a different issue is also sleeping on Kildare Street.I left no stone unturned to put child care on the Fianna Fáil agenda. If the party does not have the political will to act in the way it should it is not my fault. I have done my best.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I support the calls made by my colleague Senator Brian Hayes for a full debate on the issue of on-the-runs. It is an issue not only of an important political dimension, it is also one of those rare issues where morality and politics come together. We must give it serious attention and take time to debate the Government's proposals.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	79	On any occasion when we debate the peace process we all ensure we see the bigger picture. We must recognise that at times people must compromise their views, bite their tongues and stay silent on issues on which they wish to speak. This is a fundamental issue on how action should be taken. From time to time political sources mention the success of the South African peace process and how we should try to do the same. Of course, in South Africa all of the issues were brought to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Nothing was hidden under the cover of darkness. That is the route we should pursue if we want to bring finality to the problems of Northern Ireland.The people who speak from the political wing for the people out of the country known as on-the-runs claim they did not commit crimes, and acted in the name of Ireland and Irish freedom. Heroes should not seek to return under cover of darkness and should not skulk home. I will not state they are proud of what they did, but if they feel what they did in the cause of Irish freedom as they would see it was so laudable they should not be afraid of coming forward. They should not seek a secret deal to return under cover of darkness.

I congratulate the newly formed crime squad on the joint operations which have found more than €25 million worth of drugs in three shipments. It is only the tip of the iceberg and it is coming down the tracks extremely quickly. We must wake up. In the north of this city an extremely violent and well-organised non-national crime organisation brings in cocaine. We have seen nothing like what will happen if crack cocaine takes hold in this country. In the United States serious violence and deaths occurred in the early 1990s which only dissipated when drug users found a drug other than crack cocaine. I ask that the Minister come before this House to discuss this issue and I call for cross-party support for the Minister and the Garda in ensuring such a drug culture does not take hold.

I also agree with calls for a debate on Northern Ireland and the on-the-runs. I agree fully with Senator Bradford on the calls he made today and on other occasions on the need for a truth and reconciliation system such as that in South Africa. I find it amazing that people can be pardoned without making any admission of liability. That will not bring closure to the victims' families. It is time we had an admission of liability. I am also concerned that we are setting a bad precedent in glorifying acts of terrorism of the past.We should learn from the drugs trade. After the shooting of Veronica Guerin a lull and decrease in violence occurred. Unfortunately, a new generation has come up along the ranks of the drugs industry and the number of shootings has increased dramatically, as has the level of violence. Unfortunately, they do not remember the bad days. We should have a full admission of liability and by all means then move on. We should not have secret deals.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I was greatly taken by the Leas-Chathaoirleach's sense of humour but we will come to that later.Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, seeks a debate on Northern Ireland, individuals on-the-run and other sensitive issues. To him, the question of on-the-runs smacks of politicians meddling in legal matters. I answered Senator Coghlan's question on the Attorney General's advice but I understand the matter is being discussed by the two governments and the position is relatively fluid. I did not know that yesterday and it would be beneficial if we could have a debate to tease out such matters. This depends on the Taoiseach being available to attend the debate.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could attend.

We will endeavour to arrange the debate. Senator O'Toole referred to the same issue and to his discussion with Michael Finucane, who stated that if the prize of peace came at this price, he was willing to pay the price. This was remarkably humble of him in the circumstances. Senator O'Toole also referred to issue of new jobs, the consequences and the need to discuss it.Senator Ryan stated that I was not aware of Bank of Ireland's apology for the remarks made by its chief economist. I accept Senator Daly's point that people have the right to express views but they should not be headlined if they do so. The name of the person in question was under the article.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	85	He was referred to as the Bank of Ireland chief economist.

I imagine the bank received a wave of calls.Senator Ryan referred to the need to debate Ireland's future within the EU. The Senator also referred to the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. This morning I met the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, and he is aware that Senator Ryan and others feel disquiet on the pace of the Bill and the lack of accompanying documentation that should accompany such comprehensive amendments. I stated we could not debate the Bill next week if the main speakers did not receive these documents. He agreed to communicate this to the Department of Health and Children. I pointed out that these necessary documents had been provided with Bills from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.I felt very strongly about this when the case was brought to my attention, having listened to the debate intermittently. The Minister of State is thorough and painstaking and does not want this Chamber to rush amendments. This House is a legislative chamber and I try not to have Committee and Report Stages together. However, when the Stages are taken separately there may only be 20 minutes' debate on the Bill. One must make a judgment on the depth of the Bill and how to divide the Stages but we will dedicate plenty time to it next week. The accompanying documents, backing up Government amendments, will be provided and we will not rush Report Stage.In these situations panic grips Departments, as if the Bills had to be ready before Christmas to go into someone's Christmas stocking. This is not necessary and thorough scrutiny is more important.

It seems we rush to bring in stringent directives when other countries, such as Spain and Greece, cock a hoop at this. In some instances Ireland is too particular and seeks to be the good boys in class. This is not entirely necessary. Senator Quinn also referred to the British Oceanographic Data Centre and the report it issued. This is very interesting for our future and a debate on this would be beneficial.Senator Brady referred to drug hauls the Garda Síochána has made and questioned why the ten year mandatory sentence for being a purveyor of drugs is not being enforced. Senator O'Meara referred to migrant workers and suggested we have a special debate after the budget on its child care provisions.Senator Morrissey stated the outer ring of the M50 is only being surveyed now. His party has a proposal that is revenue neutral and we would all be keen to have this implemented. His hand is on the lever of power so he can put forward the proposal.

The Leas-Chathaoirleach's humour came into play, telling her she should not launch her policy in the Chamber. Senator Bradford called for a full debate on individuals on-the-run and the effect of people being glorified as heroes but returning in darkness to take their place in society.Senator Feighan referred to crack cocaine and paid tribute to the Garda Síochána. While the force is not on top of the problem, it has a good policy on drugs. Senator Browne called for a debate next week on what is left of the sugar beet industry.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The matter before this House today deals essentially with technical and procedural issues which are a necessary prerequisite for the establishment of a commission of investigation.Beneath this procedural veneer lies a tragic case to which I must refer at the outset. Most, if not all, Senators will be aware of the fact that two innocent women, Ms Sylvia Shiels, then aged 59 and Ms Mary Callinan, then aged 61, were brutally murdered in their home on the night of 6 and 7 March 1997 at Orchard View, Grangegorman in Dublin. By any standards it was a particularly heinous crime which shocked the nation and set in train a Garda manhunt with a view to bringing the perpetrator to justice.The aftermath of those tragic events gave rise to further tragic events. An innocent man, Mr. Dean Lyons, who is now deceased, confessed to the crime. Following consultation between the Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, he was charged with one of the murders. The Garda Síochána now accepts that Dean Lyons had no participation in the murders and that his confessions were false. On 29 April 1998, the Director of Public Prosecutions, having received a further report from the Garda Síochána, directed that the charges against him be withdrawn.There is no doubt that those events have had a profound effect on the everyday lives of the families of the women victims and on the family of the late Dean Lyons. I am sure we are all at one in expressing our deepest sympathy for the enormous suffering caused to those families.Under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 a commission of investigation may be established by the Government, based on a proposal by a Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, to investigate any matter considered by the Government to be of significant public concern. There are questions arising from Dean Lyons's false admissions and from the investigating team's conclusion that there was a prima facie case against him.In making these points I am simply identifying them as matters which need to be addressed. I am not, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, expressing any definitive conclusion on them. I am convinced, however, that unless we do our utmost to get to the bottom of this controversy it will simply continue to fester as an indictment of our criminal justice system.The Government is of the view that the establishment of a commission of investigation is appropriate. The motion before the House is a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of that commission. It seeks to have a draft order providing for the establishment of a commission of investigation into the Dean Lyons case approved by this House. The draft order is accompanied by a statement of reasons for establishing the commission, as required by the Commissions of Investigation Act. A similar motion was passed by Dáil Eireann yesterday without opposition.Under the provisions of the Act, the order establishing the commission must specify the matter to be investigated. The draft order — the Commission of Investigation (Dean Lyons Case) Revised Order 2005 — which was laid before the Dáil yesterday describes the matter to be investigated in the following terms, "matters relating to and surrounding the making of a confession by Dean Lyons (deceased) about the deaths of Mary Callinan and Sylvia Shiels in March 1997 in Grangegorman, Dublin 7."The draft order is a revised order because yesterday in the Dáil I proposed an amendment to the draft order which had originally been laid before the Houses. In effect, I substituted the phrase "surrounding" in the aforementioned provision for the phrase "arising from". I did this to ensure, lest there be any doubt, that the terms of reference which I propose to set were properly comprehended by the draft order. All sides in Dáil Éireann approved the inclusion of the revised order in the motion and passed it without opposition.The draft order authorises me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to set the commission's terms of reference. If such provision were not made that task would be a matter for the Government under section 4(2) of the Act. The terms of reference which I propose to set are as follows: to ask the commission to examine and report on the circumstances surrounding the making of a confession by Dean Lyons (deceased) about the deaths of Ms Mary Callinan and Ms Sylvia Shiels in March 1997 in Grangegorman, Dublin 7; the adequacy of the Garda assessment of the reliability of Mr. Lyons's confession, both before and after he was charged with murder; and the adequacy of information provided by the Garda Síochána on the morning of 27 July 1997 to the Director of Public Prosecutions and, in particular, whether any additional information should have been provided at that time.These terms of reference concentrate on the three issues which need to be resolved. In this regard, the Act requires that the terms of reference set out as clearly and as accurately as possible the events, circumstances, systems, practices or procedures to be investigated, together with the relevant dates, locations and individuals involved.I am obliged, as soon as possible after the terms of reference are set formally, to prepare an accompanying statement containing an estimate of the costs of the commission and the length of time it will take. This will be published in Iris Oifigiúil and such other publications, as I consider appropriate, as soon as possible after the terms of reference are set.I do not want to be too definitive about the length of time the commission will take at this stage, although I will have to do so when the terms of reference are set formally. I will take the opportunity to discuss the matter with the commission first. In that regard, I am mindful of the fact that the obligation on the commission under section 32(4) of the Act is to "endeavour" to submit its report within the specified time period. Other technical issues must also be clarified, including how the report will be published and the opportunities given to people to ensure the report is fair.I envisage that the legal fees, salaries and other administrative costs for the commission will come to about €510,000 for its first four months of operation. This does not include any third party costs that may be awarded by the commission itself.The draft order also authorises me to appoint the member or members of the commission. I place a high importance on the independence and required expertise of a member of the commission. The powers and duties vested in a commission include the duty to caution witnesses, to compel witnesses to answer questions, to establish rules and procedures regarding evidence and submissions, to adjudicate on matters of privilege and to conduct the investigation. For this reason, I was advised by Mr. Shane Murphy to appoint a senior counsel to carry out the function. I am pleased to inform this House that Mr. George Birmingham, SC, who is a former member of Dáil Éireann, has indicated he is willing to accept the appointment.The draft order also specifies that I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, am responsible for overseeing the administrative matters relating to the establishment of the commission, for receiving its reports and performing any other functions accorded to the Minister by the Act.One such function is the obligation to prepare general guidelines. Once the commission has been formally established I am required, in consultation with the Minister for Finance and the commission itself, to prepare general guidelines concerning the payment by my Department of legal costs necessarily incurred by witnesses in connection with the investigation. The commission in turn is obliged to ensure that any direction it makes concerning the payment of legal costs by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform fall within these guidelines. The guidelines will also make provision for payment to witnesses of non-legal costs.Each witness will be furnished with a copy of the guidelines in advance of his or her giving evidence. This ensures that witnesses who wish to do so can arrange legal representation with full knowledge of the regime under which they may have their costs recouped.The commission itself is charged with the onerous task of establishing facts relating to a situation which is laden with complexity. The situation is compounded by the fact that Mr. Dean Lyons is now sadly deceased and no longer available as a witness. As I indicated earlier, he was charged with one of the murders in July 1997, three months after the women met their deaths. In August 1997, another person who had been arrested and detained during the investigation of another double murder, made a confession concerning the Grangegorman murders. As a result of the admissions made by the second person, admissions which have since been withdrawn, the Garda Commissioner appointed an assistant commissioner to review all available evidence concerning these murders.That second Garda investigation concluded that Mr. Lyons did not commit the murders in question. Following completion of the review, a report was submitted by the assistant commissioner to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In April 1998, after consideration of the report, the Director of Public Prosecutions decided that criminal proceedings against Mr. Lyons be discontinued. In July 1999, Mr. Lyons presented a signed and witnessed statement denying any involvement in the murders. Unfortunately, on 12 September 2000, Mr. Lyons died in a friend's flat in the United Kingdom.As the House is aware, when the DPP decides not to prosecute in a particular case, the reasons for the decision are given to the State solicitor and the investigating gardaí. The director has stated that it is his policy not to disclose this information otherwise or to make it public. Under our legal system, the function concerning the prosecution of alleged offences is the responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The director is independent in the exercise of his functions and it would not be appropriate to bring any aspect of his determinative process within the ambit of the commission's terms of reference. However, as Senators can see, the question of the adequacy of the information provided by the Garda Síochána to the DPP prior to his decision that Mr. Lyons should be charged with murder is contained within the terms of reference. It is also important to state that the criminal investigation into these two murders remains open and, in particular, a forensic cold case review is being conducted on exhibits and samples of material taken from the scene with a view to establishing whether they might identify the perpetrator and make a prosecution possible.On 24 February 2005 the Garda Síochána published a notice in a number of newspapers in which it stated it was satisfied that Dean Lyons had no participation in the Grangegorman murders. The notice also stated that the Garda appreciated the embarrassment suffered by his family as a result of criminal charges preferred against him and subsequently withdrawn. The notice expressed regret and contained an apology to the family of Mr. Lyons for any embarrassment caused. On 6 April 2005, at the request of the Secretary General of my Department, the Garda Commissioner submitted a detailed up-to-date report on the arrest, charging and subsequent withdrawal of charges against Dean Lyons.In response to public concern about these matters I appointed senior Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, on 27 June 2005 to complete an independent review of Garda papers and actions taken regarding these matters. For the purpose of that investigation he reviewed documents presented to him by the original murder investigation team, including statements, copy statements, job book reports, exhibits and appendices. He also reviewed documentation relating to subsequent reviews of the original criminal investigation file which were made by the assistant commissioner and his team. He also visited the Bridewell Garda station in Dublin for the purpose of examining the interview rooms and the medical room and the overall layout of those areas of the station where the interviews of Dean Lyons took place.I am not in a position to publish the report because it was not written with a view to publication. It contains some matters which may cause distress and others which would be regarded as confidential and not suitable for publication. Mr. Murphy acknowledges, however, that he received full co-operation from both my own Department and the Garda Síochána.While Mr. Murphy's report makes a significant contribution to progressing the matter, he did not have the power to examine persons under oath or determine matters of fact. He recommended that the best method to resolve the issues was to establish a full commission of investigation. In July 2004 the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which I had put through the Houses, was signed into law by the President and took effect thereafter. This mechanism has only been available since late 2004 to deal with this issue.One aspect of Mr. Murphy's recommendations has not been included in the commission's terms of reference. Mr. Murphy recommended that the adequacy of Garda protocols and procedures regarding the assessment of the fitness of witnesses to be interviewed should be examined and should form part of the commission's terms of reference. However, I intend to pursue an alternative course with regard to that aspect. With Government approval I have decided to establish an expert group to examine these more general matters and intend to publish its report.The reason for the difference in my approach is as follows. It has come to be recognised that having clear and well-defined terms of reference which are tightly drawn is often the key to a successful investigation. Second, I am anxious to ensure that this particular commission of investigation will complete its work as quickly as possible. Hence I want it to concentrate on those aspects which are peculiar to the Dean Lyons case itself and in respect of which the inquisitorial powers of the commission will be of particular value.The commission of investigation is vested with considerable powers. These considerable powers will be best utilised in investigating the specific circumstances of the Dean Lyons case. My intention is that this will facilitate a more focused approach for the commission. The more general aspects are well capable of being addressed by an expert group who will not need to have recourse to these investigative powers when conducting their work. The success of that group will depend not so much on an ability to compel evidence but on its own membership which is capable of bringing a multidisciplinary approach to the issue. For example, I intend to appoint a person with a professional expertise in the area of human behaviour, perhaps a psychologist or psychiatrist, accompanied perhaps by a person with expertise in the area of criminal investigations and a person with an expertise in the area of criminal law.It is not my intention to appoint a serving officer of the Garda Síochána or a serving official of my Department even though they would have something to contribute. The work of objectively analysing the practices and policies of public bodies goes on every day without the need to establish formal inquiries which operate in a quasi-judicial fashion. Consequently, these more general aspects will be assigned to an expert group to allow the commission to concentrate on the core issues which are central to the case of Dean Lyons himself.I will now revert to the proposed commission of investigation which is the subject of the motion before the House. The commission will be under a statutory duty to conduct its proceedings in private except in very exceptional circumstances, which are set out in section 11. In effect it will be for the sole member to determine whether or not these circumstances arise. As I said earlier, there is no doubt that because Dean Lyons is now sadly deceased the task of the commission will be more difficult than it might otherwise be. Of course, I intend to give a copy of the report by Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, to the commission to facilitate its work. At the conclusion of its work the commission will prepare for me a written report based on the evidence received and setting out the facts it has established on the matter referred to it.It is not the function of a commission to speculate or to make findings or to reach judgments based on the balance of the evidence. However, Senators should note that if the commission concludes that the facts relating to a particular aspect of its terms of reference have not been established the commission is obliged to identify that particular aspect. Furthermore, in any such case the commission is empowered to indicate its opinion as to the quality and weight of evidence relating to any area where the evidence is incomplete, insufficient, inconsistent or disputed.There is no general restriction in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 on the identification of persons in reports of a commission. However, section 32(3) sets out considerations that may lead to the omission of certain details from a report identifying persons who gave evidence or any other person. The grounds include where the context in which the person was identified has not been clearly established or where disclosure might prejudice any criminal proceedings pending or in progress or where it would not be in the person's interest and the omission would not be contrary to the interests of the investigation or any subsequent inquiry.In accordance with the provisions of section 38 of the Act, it is my firm intention to publish the report of the commission. I point out, however, for the information of Senators that the Act empowers me to seek directions from the High Court where there is a risk that anything in the report or interim report could prejudice any pending or ongoing criminal proceedings. I make this point simply for the purposes of clarity. There are no criminal proceedings pending at present but as I stated earlier the case remains open.It is important to state that there are two pieces of legislation now on the Statute Book which would make dealing with this situation a different proposition were it to occur in the future. The first is the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which provides for the establishment of an ombudsman commission. The ombudsman commission will be empowered to directly and independently investigate complaints against members of the Garda Síochána.The ombudsman commission will also be empowered to investigate any matter, even where no complaint has been made, where it appears that a garda may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings. It will also be empowered to investigate any practice, policy or procedure of the Garda Síochána with a view to reducing the incidence of related complaints. I am conscious of the need to have the ombudsman commission established as soon as possible and an implementation review group is currently working under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes. It is in the process of drafting a report for which I am grateful. Substantial progress has been made and I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for the nomination of the members of the commission at an early date.Had the ombudsman commission existed in 1998 things would have been radically different. However, cases such as this serve to illustrate the importance of the provisions which were made for its establishment in the Garda Síochána Act 2005. The Commissions of Investigation Act mechanism, which is the subject of today's debate, is another new inquisitorial tool which was not available in 1998, only becoming available in the latter half of 2004. In that sense I respectfully submit that things have progressed considerably since 1998. I regret the delay in this matter but if any attempt had been made to establish an inquiry prior to the second half of 2004 it would either have to have been a full-blown tribunal of inquiry with all its attendant difficulties or an inquiry under the Dublin Police Act 1924, which is a narrow statutory provision.The matter has been carefully investigated and the Commissioner reviewed the case again in April 2005. I appointed Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, in June 2005 and he reported to me during the parliamentary recess. I am acting on his report, therefore, in the first parliamentary term after it was produced. While one might be critical of the time that has elapsed since these events first came into the public domain it should be borne in mind that as Minister my field of options has been narrow and has opened greatly since the passing of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which made it possible to have an inquiry of this kind.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I welcome the Minister to the House on this important day on two fronts. I understand this is the first commission of investigation to be established since the legislation went through this and the other House. When the Minister put forward his proposals in this whole area, he gave a firm commitment that there would be an investigation into clerical sex abuse in the Dublin area. It is significant that the matter concerning the entire episode around the late Mr. Dean Lyons will be the first issue to be tested. We are, in effect, going into uncharted waters in respect of the commission of investigation which was the Minister's proposal. It will be a good way of investigation in the future, primarily because much of the work will be carried out in private, thereby reducing costs and not requiring a whole battery of lawyers arguing over every scintilla, comma and statement. I wish the commission well. It is a very important day for the family of the late Dean Lyons who come from my part of Dublin, an area I represented in the other House for five years. They have been looking forward to this day for some time. As the Minister said at the outset, it has taken eight years to get to this point.The point should also be made that we are not talking here about events in the 1960s, 1970s or the 1980s. We are talking about recent events. This entire saga began as recently as 1997. That is why it is so important for the commission — the sole member of which will be Mr. George Birmingham, SC, whom I wish well as I am sure all Members do — to get to the truth as soon as possible. The Minister said that, when published, he hopes the report he envisaged will come to some clear conclusions and findings.While we are not talking about a case equivalent to the Birmingham six or the Guildford four, because in both cases there was a conviction, and this case never reached a conviction stage, there is a similarity between the cases because Dean Lyons was stitched up. He was a homeless young man who was caught up in the whole drugs scene. His life was ruined as a result of drugs. He just happened to be homeless, living in and around the Grangegorman area, close to the time of the savage murder of Sylvia Shiels and Mary Callinan. As the Minister rightly said, we are talking about two tragedies, the tragedy of the stitch-up of Mr. Lyons and what happened thereafter and the appalling murders of Sylvia Shiels and Mary Callinan.Major issues must be dealt with by Mr. Birmingham and the commission concerning Garda discipline and the methodology of investigation by the gardaí at the time. These questions remain unanswered in the public domain as a result of the treatment meted out to the late Dean Lyons in 1997. Dean Lyons was an easy target. He was homeless and had an addiction problem. He was someone who had a chaotic lifestyle, yet he was easy prey for people who wanted to charge him for a crime he did not commit.It is important to state that the double murder of Sylvia Shiels and Mary Callinan happened in March 1997, but by July of that year, through routes yet to be determined, Dean Lyons signed a confession. A number of questions flow from this. The forensic psychiatrists at the time had warned the gardaí that the Grangegorman killer would strike again. We know that in August 1997, the tragic case of the murder of Carl and Catherine Doyle was brought to public attention. That led to the arrest and conviction of Mr. Mark Nash who then signed voluntary admissions to the Grangegorman killings. As the Minister said, he has since withdrawn these statements. It is important to state that the evidence to the gardaí at the time, through their own professional services, was that the Grangegorman killer would strike again. We still do not know the full identity of the Grangegorman killer. As the Minister said, the case remains concerning both named individuals who were brutally murdered in 1997. I presume someone is at large for that particular crime. All of these matters must be determined ultimately if there is a court case and an active investigation remains.A number of questions must be put on the record arising from this case. Why did Dean Lyons remain in prison until April 1998 when it was clear charges would have to be dropped? He spent a total of eight months in Mountjoy Prison from the time of his alleged confession to these crimes to April 1998. He remained in prison for that eight month period and we still have not received any explanation either from the Chief State Solicitor or the gardaí as to why this was allowed to happen when it was clear to the gardaí at the time that he had no involvement in the crime. Second, the internal Garda investigation that followed all of these matters coming to public attention has never been published. The question must be asked, why was it not clear from the circumstances that prevailed in 1997-98 that something had gone badly wrong and action had to be taken? Why did it take four years for a full apology to be given to the Lyons family? In 2004, the Garda took out newspaper advertisements apologising for the suffering caused to the Lyons family as a result of the whole case. Why did it take so long for the apology to be issued when it was clear in 1998 that something had gone so seriously wrong? The question must also be asked — I am sure it will be set out clearly in the course of the commission's work — why did the details of the Grangegorman killing end up in Dean Lyons' statement to which he put his name in 1997? There were considerable and detailed issues in his false statement that only someone who had prior knowledge of the case could include, because clearly Mr. Lyons did not have the information when he signed the statement.Many other questions must ultimately be asked by the commission. However, the fact of the matter is that Dean Lyons died at 27 years of age in a friend's flat in England after an appalling miscarriage of justice. The State and this House have an obligation to get to the truth of the matter. Today's proceedings are the first step along that road.Yesterday, the Minister changed his terms of reference to include the word "supportive", which we welcome. If it is the case that the commission needs an alteration to the terms of reference, can it make this fact known to the Minister, who may then have to change the terms of reference in both Houses?

I hope it will happen sooner rather than later so such matters can go before it in future.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to speak about the establishment of the commission of inquiry into the Dean Lyons affair. It is not the first commission to be established, a commission under the stewardship of Mr. Patrick MacEntee, SC, into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings was set up only a couple of months ago.The murders of Sylvia Shields and Mary Callanan are among the most callous and brutal ever carried out in this State. They shocked the country and caused concern and anxiety in the area where they happened, off the North Circular Road in Grangegorman, an area I represented for many years. The occupants of these houses would have been known to me and I would have knocked on the door of this house on many occasions while campaigning.It would be difficult to imagine two more vulnerable people to have been subjected to such an assault, living as they were in sheltered accommodation under the guidance of the health authority. I commend the Minister for establishing a commission to investigate the whole scenario and everything that befell these poor innocent people. I am also heartened to know that the inquiry will have full statutory powers to investigate all matters and it will be able to take sworn evidence as well. This is important because we have seen situations in the past where investigations did not have the necessary powers to come up with the goods. I am also encouraged that an expert group is being set up to examine and report on general Garda training and procedures for dealing with vulnerable witnesses.Three families have been deeply scarred by the events surrounding these murders, those of the murdered women and that of the late Dean Lyons. After seven years the families of the two victims still do not know who murdered them while the Lyons family is no nearer knowing how a young man in Garda custody could end up signing a statement confessing to a murder he did not commit. Justice for these families should begin and end as swiftly as possible but not so quickly that we do not get the full facts. We must bring about closure.The episode began for poor Dean Lyons on the morning of 25 July when he was arrested in his bed in the Salvation Army hostel for homeless men in the inner city. Many of them, like Dean Lyons, would have been heroin addicts. He was taken from there to the Bridewell Garda station where he was put into a cell for eight hours. Unfortunately, to add to his situation, he was barely literate and given to be fanciful with his imagination. Bearing that in mind, and the fact that he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms, having taken heroin in Benburb Street that day with a friend, he was probably not in the mental or physical condition to be involved in a prolonged interrogation.We are told his answers during interrogation were confused and rambling and, in some instances, nonsensical. Under pressure and perhaps to escape the situation, he may have confessed the killings. In fairness, he also confessed to those killings to his mother at a later stage. At this point the gardaí were within their rights to do what they did. Dean Lyons had been placed in the frame by a low level informant, who was also a heroin addict, who had said Dean was making these statements about the murders to him. He probably, however, embellished the story to make himself look good in the eyes of the gardaí. Irrespective of that, the gardaí were within their rights in eliminating Dean Lyons from their investigations because he had been put in the frame in the first instance.What happened thereafter is where the Garda investigation could be questioned. It appears that the confession was taken without the benefit of audio or video taping. That is why we are still talking about the case after seven years. The statement taken from Dean Lyons appears accurate when compared to the events of the day. It is critical that a statement could be so accurate in details about the murder scene and weapon and other aspects. The fact that it was taken from an individual later shown to be innocent raises serious questions. It suggests that it either came from someone who was at the murder scene or from the interrogators. Hopefully the inquiry will bring those answers to us. It is in everyone's interests that these matters are brought to a close. As long as they remain unresolved, a shadow will hang over the Garda in terms of this investigation.There are many people affected by this, including the family and friends of Dean Lyons, those of the murder victims and, indeed, the families of Carl and Catherine Doyle who were killed in Roscommon. These people were murdered in a brutal manner similar to the murders in Grangegorman. The man who was arrested for those murders, three weeks after Dean Lyons had been charged, gave evidence to the effect that he murdered the two victims in Grangegorman. If the gardaí had not lost their focus after Dean Lyons confessing, could the incident in Roscommon have been avoided? They lost their focus for three weeks because they thought they had the killer of the two women in Grangegorman.The Garda Síochána now found itself in the situation where it had two confessions to one murder and, consequently, were unable to bring charges against the individual who confessed to the Roscommon murders. As the Minister said, this situation is still live and we hope that the person who murdered the two ladies will eventually be held accountable and that the commission will help to achieve that outcome. In general, the Garda has had a bad few years given what happened in Donegal and in this case. That is unfortunate but the Garda has only a little work to do to bring about a scenario where members are completely and absolutely trusted by the public. There are question marks over the force. I speak to young children regularly and they do not hold the Garda in the esteem I held the force when I was growing up. They say the Garda takes the soft option at times when that should not be the case.The Garda Síochána Bill 2004 includes many fine provisions, which will bring the force's operation into the 21st century when it is enacted. I have observed the Minister's work over the past number of years and a number of fine Bills have been passed by the House, which, in the fullness of time, will bring about a much better situation for all of us living on this island.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I welcome the Minister to the House. I have but a few remarks, as many of the salient points have been made by my colleagues. The Minister's contribution dealt with the technical parameters of the Act and I cannot think of a better person to deal with these issues. However, I refer to the terms and references of the draft order, which states, "matters relating to and surrounding the making of a confession by Dean Lyons (deceased) . . .". How far could the term "surrounding" lead us? I am concerned not only with the matter of the confession of Dean Lyons but also about the plight of the family. A niece was in touch with me and I raised the issue in the House a little time ago. Family members feel there will be no closure for them and they are interested in the possibility of a further prosecution.Senator Kett mentioned that a man in custody made a confession that appears to be more consistent with the facts. If there is evidence, I hope there will be a prosecution because the human impact on the bereaved in these circumstances must be recognised. I believe I am correct but I am sure I will be corrected if I am wrong. This has happened in other cases — for example, the same phenomenon emerged in the case ofMalcolm MacArthur where, because a conviction was secured on one count, other counts were not pursued. That leaves the families of the victims in limbo. They feel there is no closure and they feel the dignity of the lives of their murdered relatives have not been addressed by the State.The expense of running a trial is an issue but, in this case, €510,000 has been made available for the investigation. I would like the Minister to come up with a solution. There may be an ingenious solution whereby charges can be added. I do not know because I do not have the necessary background or expertise but surely it is wrong that people should be murdered and their fate left in a legal limbo when it is relatively clear who perpetrated the act, nobody is convicted and there is no closure for the relatives. This needs to be addressed.The sum provided for the inquiry is modest in comparison with sums provided for other commissions and tribunals of inquiry. Will further funding be needed? Can the inquiry be completed in four months? If not, why not? The Minister has cracked the whip a little over his erstwhile colleagues in the legal profession. I am glad about this, although I do not mean he is doing it a nasty way. He is suggesting that, as an elected politician, he has a duty to ensure value for money for the taxpayer. There is variety in the performance of these various inquiries, some of which are extraordinarily efficient, achieve results and come to conclusions while others dither and dally and wander all around the place. I hope the Minister will confirm this will be an efficient inquiry. It will deal with a targeted case and it should not be allowed to become diffuse. It should, however, consider the terms outlined by the Minister.Such a case is potentially damaging to the perception of the police. Ironically, approximately seven years ago, I was asked to speak at an international police convention in Dublin Castle. I was invited because the organisers wanted to spice up the event. I certainly obliged and I recall being virulently attacked by an Irish-American police chief. However, recommendations had been made at that time that Garda interviews and interrogations should not only be subject to an audio recording but should also be videotaped. I pointed out that this would protect not only the suspect but, importantly from the point of view of the State, it would protect the integrity of the police. A number of interrogations have been conducted in an improper manner and the Minister is aware of this. It happens in every jurisdiction but videotaping will help to get around that.However, false accusations are sometimes made by the accused against the police. The Minister has spoken on the wireless about difficulties in this regard. For example, where video recordings are made, the defence counsel may apply for them and they may find their way to the associates of the accused and be used for nefarious purposes. Somebody of the Minister's intellectual ability and ingenuity will find a way around that problem. It is regrettable that a vulnerable homeless person should have found himself in this situation. One can understand the alacrity with which the police received a confession because it made their job so much easier. However, in this case, the shortest way home was the longest way around. I could use many clichés including a number in Latin such as  festina lente but, sometimes, a bit of a rush mucks things up. Will the Minister outline whether it will be possible to provide closure for the family of the two women, Mary Callinan and Sylvia Shiels, because they feel it keenly? I doubt if I am only person who was written to in this House about this. It hit home to me that these people were essentially forgotten. They feel very keenly seven years later that their two vulnerable elderly relatives were butchered but there has been no trial or conviction and there can be no closure for them until somebody is made to accept responsibility for the crime.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I welcome the Minister to the House. Over the past few months, I have participated in debates in this House on the Ferns Report, the tragedy of juvenile crime and the distressing events in Iraq. We again find ourselves discussing disturbing circumstances. The awful events, which have led to this debate, began more than eight years ago on the 6 March 1997. As Senator Norris stated, it is important to briefly outline the circumstances of the case again because the families of the victims should not be viewed as a statistic. The events began with the brutal murders of Ms Sylvia Shiels and Ms Mary Callinan in Grangegorman, Dublin. Four months later, the late Mr. Dean Lyons made a questionable confession to investigating Garda officers of his alleged guilt in the double murder.After consultation between the Garda and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Lyons was charged with one of the murders. One month later, another person, who had been arrested and detained during the investigation of another murder, made a confession regarding the Grangegorman murders. In April 1998 the DPP decided to discontinue criminal proceedings against Mr. Lyons. In July 1999 Mr. Lyons presented a signed and witnessed statement denying any involvement in the murders.Mr. Lyons unfortunately passed away some four years ago. On 24 February last the Garda issued a statement that it is satisfied that Dean Lyons had no participation in the murders. There was also an appreciation of the embarrassment suffered by his family as a result of criminal charges preferred against him and subsequently withdrawn. Significantly, there was also an expression of regret and an apology to the family of Mr. Lyons for any embarrassment caused.It is difficult to know where to start given this awful sequence of events. As the Minister said yesterday in the Dáil, it is crucial that we refer at the outset to the tragic human circumstances that gave rise to this motion. Ms Callinan and Ms Shiels were victims of a heinous crime. Notwithstanding the subsequent events, we must not minimise or forget that tragedy. Their families suffered at the time of their loss and at several points as the terrible events I outlined earlier unfolded over subsequent months and years. All members of this House will share my feelings of deepest sympathy for the Callinan and Shiels families. They will again be reminded of their loss as the investigation is debated, and we should be mindful of that.On the investigation, I share the view of the Minster that this case is of significant public concern and therefore warrants the establishment of a commission of investigation under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. I welcome this investigation and commend the Minister and the Government on the steps recently taken. Other Ministers might have acted differently given the unfortunate passing of Mr. Lyons and the incarceration of the person who subsequently admitted to the crimes, although that statement was subsequently retracted. The Minister is to be congratulated for acting on this issue.Many questions emerge from the events of this case. The closure of the Grangegorman murder cases remains outstanding. On the specific issue before us now, five obvious questions emerge. What were the circumstances surrounding the confession by Dean Lyons? How did the Garda assess the reliability of that confession? What lessons can we learn from that process? How was adequacy of information provided by the Garda Síochána to the DPP assessed? Could and should additional information have been provided?Under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, an investigation may be established to investigate any matter considered by the Government to be of what is termed "significant public concern". While the five questions I set out refer to this specific case, the significant public concern arises because the events pose fundamental questions about how our policing and justice system operates. I welcome the fact that the draft terms of reference proposed by the Minister ask the commission to examine and report on the five issues related to the Lyons case. I also welcome the appointment of Mr. George Birmingham, SC, to the commission, and specifically that he is happy to accept the position on the basis of the proposed terms of reference.Regarding the wider questions posed about how our policing and justice system operates, I commend the Minister for his decision to establish a separate expert group to examine these issues. This approach is wisely chosen to ensure that the commission of investigation has well defined, clear and precise terms of reference and that the investigation can be completed as quickly as possible. The wider issues must be examined, and the establishment of the expert group is the proper way to proceed.As a society we need to be sure that Garda training, protocols, regulations and procedures are adequate. We need to be confident that the fitness of persons to be interviewed is properly assessed. Leading questions should be avoided with vulnerable suspects. The capacity of a person in custody to be interviewed should not be affected by administration or non-administration of drugs. We need to be confident that the reservations of gardaí as to the truthfulness or accuracy of self-incriminating statements made by a suspect can be recorded and communicated.This terrible case forces us to consider arrangements to allow the Garda Síochána to have suspects professionally assessed as to their fitness to be interviewed. I wish the proposed expert group every success in its important work, the result of which will, I hope, lead to measures to prevent many of the aforementioned events from ever happening again. We must recognise the series of tragedies that emerged over the eight years since that horrific March night in Grangegorman. As legislators we must put in place the mechanisms to investigate how these tragedies came to be and to prevent them ever recurring. I commend and support the Government in its efforts.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I thank the Members for their contributions to this relatively short debate and for their constructive and warm remarks on the proposal before the House. This case poses serious issues. As a number of the Senators said, we must learn from this. While listening to Senator Minihan I was reminded of a thought I had in yesterday's Dáil debate, which is that while such cases may be embarrassing and difficult for the Garda Síochána to come to terms with, this could be used as a test case and a template for training detectives. Some good may come from much bad. This should be studied by trainee detectives and interrogators to illustrate how things can go wrong.As Senator Kett said, this person was not chosen at random. Low level intelligence pointed in one direction. The accused did not deny involvement but was a suggestible young man who volunteered to gardaí and to his mother that he was involved. Crucially the early statements in his detention were not reliable. At a late stage in his detention an apparently reliable statement came forth. As Senator Minihan said, that was the crucial point. People should have doubted the man's confession given that his statements did not add up. However, when he confessed to the crime he was considered reliable. Alarm bells should have been ringing.Professional gardaí will say that some suspects fence around the issue at the start and then become truthful, but bearing in mind the man's drug addiction and the fact that he made statements that they knew could not have been true at the beginning, the question arises what happened thereafter. That is for Mr. Birmingham to consider, not for me to prejudge. As Senator Brian Hayes and others have stressed, this is a very important issue.Many members of the Garda Síochána are as disturbed as we are about these events. I thank them for the work they do day in and out and empathise with them that the force of which they are members comes under the spotlight again. We should reflect on the fact that, by and large, the majority of gardaí do their job conscientiously and professionally and command the support of the majority of the public. They must have been pleasantly surprised by the results of a recent Garda satisfaction survey which showed they were still well thought of despite recent events.Senator Norris raised the matter of a competing confession. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I cannot say much in that regard. If there was a competing confession one need not be Einstein to work out that the Director of Public Prosecutions was thrown into a terrible dilemma because he had two confessions with two sets of gardaí contending for their validity. To put one man on trial while gardaí in another part of the country have an apparently reliable confession from an accused person is a difficult situation to deal with. Whereas he does not give his reasons in public, it is not difficult to see the problem with which the DPP was confronted in these circumstances.Senator Norris asked whether there was hope of closure in this matter. It may well be that the cold case re-evaluation of all the exhibits could be capable of yielding DNA and forensic indicators that would move the case on and make it possible for a prosecution to be brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions. This is being examined and I must be careful that nothing I say prejudices it.The terms of reference of the commission of investigation will be set by me after the Houses pass the draft orders. While I must remain within the ambit of the orders they pass, the exact terms are for me to decide. I will ensure that what is put in place will be adequate to enable the nub of the issues, which we all understand, to be fully and properly investigated by Mr. Birmingham.Senator Norris asked the cost of this investigation. The cost of a criminal trial is of no concern whatsoever. If the Director of Public Prosecutions becomes satisfied that there is reliable evidence on which he can run a viable trial, no doubt he will proceed, regardless of the issue of cost. A budget of €510,000 is set aside for the first four months of the commission of investigation. It is important that this money is spent and that we have a proper inquiry now. If we leave the issue unaddressed, there will be problems downstream.Senator Norris asked whether the investigation would go on and on. I am grateful to Mr. Birmingham for accepting this commission and have full confidence in his desire and capacity to bring the matter to a timely and appropriate conclusion. He is in a position to seek extra time if necessary. Likewise, if the terms of reference unduly constrain him, he is in a position to ask me to alter them, and I am free to do so without coming back to the House on it. Nothing should stand in the way of a proper investigation.Senator Norris suggested that I am sometimes critical of the legal profession. I have absolute confidence that Mr. Birmingham will do the job appropriately and effectively. From what I know of him and of the terms on which he will be appointed, this is not something he will prolong unnecessarily. The new rates of remuneration provided by the Government decision are not such as to encourage investigators to drag out investigations, despite the suspicion of cynics. In the case of Mr. Birmingham, no such notion enters my mind.The starting point for the commission of investigation will be decided when we have all our ducks in a row, in terms of accommodation, terms of reference and when Mr. Birmingham is ready to proceed. The four-month period is indicative and, if it is inadequate, I will extend it. The enterprise should not take substantially longer than that. It will soon be 2006 and these events took place in 1997. Now is the time to bring closure to the issue and to learn what lessons there are from it.I earnestly hope this is an event from which we will learn. Some 98% of Garda interviews are now the subject of audiovisual recording. Unfortunately, there are some occasions where people want to talk to gardaí, but not on tape, because they can be pressurised by their colleagues to ask their lawyers, as part of the defence process, to get the tape and show them to their colleagues in crime. There will always be some occasions where people, for some reason or another such as fright or fear, are unwilling to commit to a permanent record of a kind they cannot later deny. However, the majority of interviews are recorded on audiovisual tapes.The courts have now begun to require a convincing explanation for an unrecorded interview being used as evidence. It is not that it cannot be admitted, but we have reached a point where it is not just a matter of accepting a signed written record under old rules. The Judiciary now suggests that unless there is a good reason a formal interview was not recorded, it will take a jaundiced view of any effort to introduce it. The 98% recording rate now achieved and the attitude of the Judiciary address the issues about which Senator Norris was concerned. I thank the House for its attention and support.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	118	This is the first substantive debate by either House concerning Transport 21 and it is entirely appropriate that it should take place in Seanad Éireann, many of whose Members have taken an active interest in national transport issues during the past decade in particular. No one will know that better than the distinguished Leader of the House and former Minister with responsibility in this area.I will begin by recalling that the decision taken in last year's budget to implement an extended ten-year capital envelope for transport investment was the starting point for the preparation of Transport 21. That important decision was a recognition of the reality of the long timeframes involved in planning, designing and completing large transport infrastructure programmes. The period between budget 2005 and the announcement of Transport 21 in Dublin Castle on 1 November was used by my Department to develop what is without doubt the most detailed and comprehensive transport plan ever devised here. However, the reality is that the roots of Transport 21 extend back to June 2002 and the far-sighted decision by this Government to establish, for the first time in the history of the State, a single Department with responsibility for national roads, aviation and public transport. The clear, and clearly stated, reason for doing so at that time was to further the development of an integrated transport system nationally.The specific mandate given to the Department of Transport by Government was to implement an integrated transport policy designed as far as possible to overcome existing delays, bottlenecks and congestion and to provide the consumer with greater choice by offering alternative modes of transport. In addition, through the integrated approach the Department was expected to develop and implement policies designed to improve regional balance and reduce rural isolation and social exclusion. Since 2002 the Department has undertaken substantial work on integration in consultation with other Departments and State agencies. This work takes account of Government policy documents, particularly the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines. The result is a set of guiding principles for integrated transport policy which is published in the Department of Transport's current statement of strategy. These principles provided an important policy backdrop for the preparation of the integrated investment strategy contained in Transport 21.In addition, in preparing Transport 21 my Department took account of the work already done on investment priorities under the existing capital envelope to the end of 2009 and of the various strategic studies already completed by my Department and its agencies, including A Platform for Change, the strategic rail review and the national road needs study. The Department also engaged with Córas Iompair Éireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority, the Dublin Transportation Office, relevant Departments and local authorities in order to identify the broad direction and priorities of the investment framework. The result of all this detailed and painstaking work is a transport investment strategy that for the first time allocates funding for a ten-year period to develop an integrated transport network that substantially enhances connectivity and provides for the development of an integrated transport network in the greater Dublin area.All Members will be familiar with the details of the projects at this stage and, therefore, I will not waste their time by restating them. However, the main elements of Transport 21 can be summarised as follows: completion of the major interurban motorways by 2010 and the commencement of the substantial development of the remainder of the national primary road network; transformation of the transport system in the greater Dublin area, with a particular focus of the public transport network; completion of the renewal of the national rail network, with a major focus on the provision of enhanced services; and upgrading of the public transport provincial cities and in the regions.While some of the reaction to Transport 21 has naturally and understandably focused on whether enough is being done for particular counties or towns, it is important that everyone considers not only the individual elements of Transport 21 but the manner in which those individual elements are integrated in order to provide a highly efficient national transport network that maximises the benefit of the investment for the population at large. This bigger picture is a key aspect of Transport 21 that should not be overlooked.At this point it is relevant to point out that Transport 21 has been specifically developed with a view to supporting the Government's National Spatial Strategy 2002-2020, which seeks to promote more balanced regional development. This was an important issue for me in the preparation of Transport 21 as I was also responsible for bringing the national spatial strategy to fruition during my time as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I am satisfied that, when taken together, Transport 21 and the national spatial strategy clearly demonstrate the joined-up thinking of the Government in the areas of transportation and spatial planning. These Government initiatives will contribute to sustainable development in all its dimensions — economic, social and environmental.I now turn to the important issues of costs and value for money. The first point that needs to be made is that Transport 21 is a fully costed programme. The €34.4 billion cost is based on the aggregate costs of the constituent projects and these are in turn primarily based on costs provided by the transport agencies. The agencies have confirmed that the costs and underlying assumptions are as rigorous as possible taking account of the various stages of development, design and implementation of the projects. A greater degree of certainty can be attached to those projects that are already at an advanced stage of development. The difficulty in making accurate assumptions on final outtum costs for later projects has been addressed by providing contingency within individual projects where appropriate.On this basis I am satisfied that the total funding of €34.4 billion is sufficient for the full implementation of Transport 21. There has been some criticism on the basis that the costs of the individual projects in Transport 21 are not known. However, I have indicated that I do not consider it prudent to release this commercially sensitive information until the public procurement processes for the individual projects are completed. In addition, some elements of Transport 21, such as traffic management, have global financial provisions rather than individual project allocations.In recent times the majority of transport projects have been coming in on budget, with many ahead of schedule. For example, 20 of the 23 national road projects currently in construction are within budget. This augurs well for the successful implementation of Transport 21. Nevertheless, significant safeguards will be implemented to ensure that Transport 21 is delivered within budget. In the first instance projects within Transport 21 will be subject to normal statutory procedures, where required; capital appraisal in line with the Department of Finance guidelines; and the value for money initiatives recently announced by the Minister for Finance.My Department will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of Transport 21 by the various transport agencies and local authorities. A monitoring group is being established which will be chaired by my Department. The group will include representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and other relevant Departments and State agencies. It will be responsible for the high-level monitoring of Transport 21 and reporting annually to Government on issues such as financial and physical progress.Transport 21 addresses the important issue of the capital investment framework for transport for the next ten years. However, capital investment is only one element, albeit a critical one, in the delivery of an integrated transport system. At the launch of Transport 21 I said I was convinced, and still am, that we also need a new approach to transport in the greater Dublin area, delivered through a single authority, with real powers to ensure joined up thinking and delivery across all the transport modes.A high-level four-member team, chaired by Professor Margaret O'Mahony and reporting directly to me, has since been appointed and charged with finalising a structure for the new transport authority, detailing its remit and responsibilities as well as identifying the human resources which are critical to the success of the body taking into account best practice and best experience internationally. The new authority will have responsibility for transport in the greater Dublin area. I have not set any restrictions or limitations on the team in relation to any considerations it may have regarding the role of the new authority vis-à-vis the future role of other transport bodies in the greater Dublin area.The team has already commenced its work and I look forward to receiving its report at an early stage. I intend to bring proposals to the Government for decision as soon as I have considered the report of the team. The establishment of the Dublin transport authority will be another crucial step in ensuring the full and timely delivery of Transport 21.Delivery is a critical aspect of Transport 21. In this regard we have set out clearly the completion dates of key projects and my primary focus is on ensuring that those completion deadlines are fully met. On the basis of the preparatory work that has been undertaken, I am satisfied that the completion dates are both realistic and achievable. It is the responsibility of the relevant implementing agencies to identify the project milestones necessary to achieve these completion deadlines. The structures that I am putting in place — the new transport authority for Dublin and the high-level monitoring group — will assist in ensuring that projects are delivered in the published timeframes.During recent times we have seen the beginning of a new transport dawn with high quality roads being opened and enhanced public transport services, such as Luas, coming on stream providing more comfortable, efficient and safer services.Before coming to the House today, I looked at my diary entries for the past few months and they made interesting reading. Last month, a new bypass was opened around Loughrea, a consultation was launched on route options for the Luas cross-city link, the business case for increasing the capacity of the Tallaght Luas line by 40% was approved, a fully accessible bus service was launched on the 20B route in Dublin, the statutory process for the extension of the Sandyford Luas line to Cherrywood was commenced and the Kinsalebeg road project on the Cork-Waterford border was commenced.New rail services are also being introduced by Irish Rail. From 11 December next, new and increased commuter rail services will be introduced on the Maynooth and Drogheda lines, Cork-Cobh and Cork-Mallow lines and the Athlone-Dublin commuter route. Mainline rail services are also being upgraded with additional services on the Sligo-Dublin, Cork-Dublin and Tralee-Dublin lines. Improved Sunday services are also being introduced on a number of lines, including the Galway-Dublin and Limerick-Dublin lines. Fleets will also be modernised on a number of services and 30 and 40 year old carriages will be replaced with modern railcars. In the weeks leading up to the launch of Transport 21, the Dundalk western bypass and theWaterford outer ring road were opened, new eight-car DART services were launched and the Arklow to Gorey bypass was commenced.This is an amazing amount of progress in a few short weeks and does not include the many other road and public transport projects that are also in construction across the country. Transport 21 will not only maintain this level of activity but accelerate the pace of commencements and the pace of delivery.There has been no shortage of public debate over the past few months and years about the future direction of transport investment policy. This debate has been informed by numerous studies, including the strategic studies mentioned earlier and other studies, such as the one on the western rail corridor. Much informed debate has also taken place in this House and the Dáil. I have listened carefully and with interest to the views of Senators and Deputies in these debates.I took account of all these inputs in developing Transport 21. The Government has now decided the future direction of transport investment for the next ten years. My focus and that of the Government is on implementation and delivery, rather than on further debate. I took the proposal for the railway order for the extension of the Luas from Connolly Station to the Point Theatre this morning. This project is a very important aspect of the development of the Luas, given the number of people who work and live in this area, and will be another significant addition. There has been good progress on the western rail corridor and we hope to make further progress in 2006. It is important that all parts of the country believe that the provision of major projects is an inclusive process and I am committed to delivering this on behalf of the Government.The implementation of Transport 21 will give Ireland a first-class transport system that will connect all regions to each other and to our main seaports and airports, and will provide greatly enhanced public transport alternatives to the private car in cities. From 1 January 2006, major commercial ports and related safety issues will come under the aegis of the Department of Transport as a result of negotiations between myself, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resource, the Taoiseach and the Government. This area had previously been a missing link with regard to the cohesiveness of the overall delivery of transport services, given that road, rail and air transport are the responsibility of the Department of Transport and the key role played by our major ports in economic competitiveness and growth and job creation. This move demonstrates that the Government can think on cross-departmental lines and make significant decisions to ensure its policies deliver. Fianna Fáil Governments have always attempted to do this in a cohesive way that delivers for the Irish people.We aim to improve the quality of life of people in Ireland and create economic regions throughout the country to allow people to live and work in different regions rather than being forced to come to Dublin. This will improve considerably the quality of life of both adults and children and the ability of people to progress smoothly and easily through the education system and own houses. It is about looking into the regions, rather than Dublin, for solutions, which is very significant.The considerable investment in Dublin is not simply for the benefit of the people living there. Every country must have a thriving capital city which leads economic activity and remains competitive. If Dublin does not maintain this focus and position, the rest of the country will suffer. The investment in Dublin benefits everyone in the country, not merely in transport terms, and we must focus on maintaining the city's position as the country's key successful economic driver, as all capital cities are in successful countries. I am delighted that the Seanad organised this debate, in which I was pleased to participate.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I welcome the Minister to the House. I was unaware that the other House had not debated Transport 21 in full so it is important that we have a worthwhile and informed debate on the matter. I take on board the Minister's comments about the breadth and aims of this plan. In his concluding remarks, the Minister stated that a new transport dawn has recently come about with the opening of high-quality roads and the introduction of enhanced public transport services, such as Luas. This is true but, simultaneously, we have never before experienced so many problems with transport as more motorists face queues and more of our constituents complain about road problems. We are a long way from having the road, rail and general transport infrastructure that we need.It is fair to say, whether one is a Government or an Opposition Senator, that the State did not require considerable transport planning up to 1980 because its level of economic growth was so slow. The country has experienced record economic growth over the past 15 to 20 years and while it is good news for every Irish citizen, it is accompanied by problems, one of the most visible of which concerns transport. We are now playing catch-up with regard to developing a transport infrastructure.The only transport policy decision ever taken in this State until recently was the decision to shut down the railway system. This decision affected places like west Clare, about which the Minister and the Leas-Chathaoirleach are aware, and west Cork. Substitute services were to have been put in place following this decision. It is ironic that shutting down rail services to rural Ireland was probably the only major transport decision made in the past 50 years.Letters praising and criticising Transport 21 were written to newspapers in the aftermath of the publication of the plan a few weeks ago. A short letter from an individual who is now based in Dublin told of how, as a young man living in west Cork, he could travel to Skibbereen at10 a.m., get the train to Cork and another train to Dublin, take a tram to the desired address in Dublin and eat his tea there at 4 p.m. It would be impossible for him to do so today due to transport problems.If this plan was implemented, it would be welcomed and worthwhile. We could have a debate about the philosophy behind investing in roads rather than rail. I am happy to see proposals for the investment of significant moneys in our road network but insufficient attention is being paid to the rail network. Even if the proposals contained in Transport 21 are implemented, the rail system must be returned to the core of public transport. Córas Iompair Éireann recently decided to practically exit the freight section of the haulage business, a disappointing decision which has increased pressure on our road network. The Minister should insist on increased funding for the rail network.Transport 21 is a shiny new plan which is possibly a breath of fresh air but the Government is tarnished, rather than bright and shiny, after almost a decade in office. The public is concerned this plan will not be implemented. When plans are brought forward, every party and politician has credibility problems in that the public does not believe they will be implemented. When the Minister and his colleagues state what will happen in regard to Transport 21, the fact there was a health strategy to wipe out waiting lists which did not happen, a spatial strategy, to which the Minister referred earlier, and which is not being implemented, a decentralisation plan which is not being implemented and numerous other plans, all of which were laudable, well put together and welcome, will be thrown back at them not only by us but by the people. It is an issue we must address politically, namely, how we fail so miserably to act on policies produced.If, as the Minister said, this plan is implemented on time, it would be a major step forward for the further economic and social growth of this country. Our fear must be that it will not be implemented. I am sure when this plan was launched my colleagues opposite expected the public not only to respond warmly and to welcome it but to give them a political clap on the back. However, that did not happen. The reason the media, commentators and the public were so cynical is that, unfortunately, over the past five or six years, there have been many Government plans which have not worked out as envisaged. The challenge facing those opposite in the remaining 12 or 18 months of this Government, and all of us politically, is to ensure that when we put such plans on paper, we implement them. It is a significant task and I wish the Minister well in that regard. However, the Government's promises to date in regard to health, education and the 2,000 extra gardaí, which were much less expensive and less complicated than this plan, have not been kept.The Minister is putting in place a monitoring group and an authority for Dublin appears to be up and running. I wish it well. However, I have the gravest doubts about this plan sticking to the timetable and being implemented as stated by the Minister because the record to date would suggest it is a little like pie in the sky.Much of what is contained in the plan, including the maps, graphs and charts, and much of what the Minister said has been announced previously. The metro to Dublin Airport was announced in the programme for Government. The Luas extensions were apparently unveiled in 2001. According to the national development plan, the interurban motorways were to be completed by 2006. The rail interconnector was included in the 2001 Platform for Change. The suburban rail proposals, which were debated today, were announced as part of the Irish Rail programme of capital investment and funding for 2003 to 2008. This plan is not as shiny and new as would appear. Unfortunately, those proposals which have been included in it, and which were announced previously, are not up and running, as planned.We must accept there will be little stumbling blocks along the way but the planning and infrastructural systems need to be upgraded and re-examined. Even accounting for those delays, the political will does not appear to have existed over the past five or six years. Money has not been the cause of the problem since it has been available. It appears we are not able to sort out the timeframe.At the launch of Transport 21, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, also spoke. The media reported that he took charge of the presentation and made it abundantly clear that as far as he was concerned, the plan was very much in his hands and that he would look extremely closely at the value for money issue, which is important. We have seen the waste of public money, which has been debated in this House and elsewhere in recent months. This plan will cost over €30 billion, so we must ensure the various parts are implemented at the suggested costs because it is not the Government's money but that of taxpayers. The Minister for Finance said the principle of value for money for every euro of taxpayers' money spent is paramount, with which I agree. It is important taxpayers get value for money.For the first time in the history of the State, a Government has had considerable resources to spend, yet the record of spending shows there has been much waste. We cannot afford to waste anymore money and we must ensure this plan is implemented at the suggested costs.I would like to see all of this plan implemented. What is proposed in respect of the Atlantic corridor from Letterkenny to Limerick to Cork to Waterford is a laudable project but no start-up date has been provided. There are no indications as to how much of that network will be motorway or the new two-by-one system being developed in parts of the country and on which I would like some information.I would like to be slightly parochial for a moment. Although over €30 billion is being made available for this plan, I was very disappointed that two of the very important trunk roads in the north Cork area — the Mallow to Mitchelstown road, which is in appalling condition for a national secondary road and which carries thousands of vehicles each day, and the Mallow to Fermoy road, which is a very important tourist route from Rosslare to Killarney — were not earmarked for particular attention. The Atlantic corridor and other key national primary routes were included but it was disappointing those two roads were not included. I am sure other roads throughout the country were not included but I know those two roads well and was disappointed specific investment was not set aside for them. They are important from a tourism perspective not only for the north Cork region but also for County Kerry, the Blackwater Valley and further westwards. Perhaps that issue might be brought to the Minister's attention.The extra money being allocated is impressive, as is the figure of 175 million extra public transport users, including the additional bus and Luas passengers, and the extra trains on the Cork to Dublin, Dublin to Galway and Dublin to Limerick routes, etc., which we must welcome. However, I go back to my central point of the ability of the Government to deliver on these proposals. That is what the debate must be about. Nobody could object to implementing any of the proposals. We need them all and perhaps more, particularly from the perspective of railway investment. The political challenge the Government faces will be to get the work done on time. That will become an issue on which the Government's lack of credibility over the past two or three years will cause difficulty. It is the reason the launch of the plan was not met with a fanfare of trumpets by the public. It does not believe the Government's promises that the work will be done on time. I stress there must be detailed planning and regular debates at Oireachtas level to assess progress and identify what delays have occurred and what must be dealt with. There must also be dialogue between all the partners.In two to four years' time, we do not want a new Minister in a new Government re-announcing the plan. We want to see it implemented, or at least for a start to be made. That is a big challenge for everybody because in this new Ireland with its strong economy, we need road, rail and other infrastructural improvements which this plan suggests will be implemented. We must ensure they are implemented but I have the most profound doubts about the ability of the Government to deliver its plan because sadly, its record to date on major projects across a broad spectrum is one of delay, waste of money and failure. I hope this plan will not join that unenviable list.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House to listen to this important debate. Based on her experience of politics in County Clare she will not hear anything new about the transport issues there. I recognise the tremendous work of the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, and the Acting Chairman, Senator Daly, in terms of the many major infrastructural projects they have been successful in achieving for County Clare.This is a welcome opportunity to discuss the Government's transport initiative. It is a very imaginative plan. As Senator Bradford said, it is not surprising that some people may not yet have recognised its potential benefits because the plan is spread over ten years. Everybody is looking for where his or her piece of infrastructure fits in within that ten-year timeframe. As a nation, we are very good at demanding things but when we have got them we forget about them. We are also very slow to accept that things take time. It can take a year or two years for projects to even get off the ground.The Ennis bypass was on the agenda for a particular date but there was an expectation in some quarters that it would be brought forward by a year because an election was due. The Government stood by its original commitment and did not bring the project forward. The original timeframe was followed by the Government which did not try to buy the election yet people tried to make political capital out of it. I am delighted the approach of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government has been to map out a future for the infrastructural development of the country rather than decide, as was the practice of all Governments in the past, to hold back on projects, announce them in advance of a local or general election and buy favour with voters. I am glad that day is gone. I hope the Opposition recognises this too. I am sure Senator Bradford does so.By mapping out a ten-year plan the Government did not set out to bring the electorate onside. The Government has made a clear statement about infrastructure so as to ensure the continuation of economic development and growth. Identifying individual projects is not what it is about. For instance, a plan to extend the Luas line to Sandyford is no guarantee that the people of the area would necessarily vote for the Government at the next election. What is important is to ensure that at the next election, and in successive elections, people in Sandyford and beyond have jobs that require them to use the Luas or other public transport and that there is a need for infrastructure such as an interurban route between Dublin and Waterford, Limerick, Galway or wherever else. Infrastructure must be in place to deal with the transport of goods and passengers. We must create an environment in which there is job creation and an infrastructure that allows people to go about their business.We must move away from the approach of putting a road through somebody's back yard just to keep him or her happy. The Government has moved away from this approach and I hope the Opposition will follow in this regard. It really is about taking a strategic approach. We have heard all the buzz words. The approach must be connected and co-ordinated to produce a strategic plan that involves all the different elements of transport. I am delighted to hear the Minister has announced the Department of Transport will take responsibility for ports because they are an integral part of the transport infrastructure for the movement of goods in and out of the country. We export the vast majority of what we produce. The shipping industry is in difficulty at the moment and that will impact on the economy. For some time the Government strategy has been about joining up all the disparate elements under the remit of the Department of Transport.The Government has come forward with a carefully thought out plan that has the capacity to continue the current level of economic growth. This plan will create a comprehensive transport infrastructure that will facilitate the continued economic growth that is necessary to sustain our present strength. The vast majority of people in this country want to work but we must also recognise there are people caught in the middle. We are now at a point where we are dependent on migrant workers — which is also the subject of debate — to help us in the growth of our economy and we must continue with that approach. It is vital that this policy works.In developing a strong economy and infrastructure we must address the deficiencies in that regard. In many respects we have outgrown our infrastructure. Those of us who travel on the N7 on a weekly basis see the difficulties between Naas and Dublin. We regularly have discussions in the Seanad about the West Link toll bridge. These problems have come about because there was no strategic plan setting out a ten-year framework based on the best statistics available in terms of projected growth, etc. We now find ourselves playing catch-up. The approach in the past was piecemeal. Things were done on a project-by-project basis.Senator Bradford appears to think we are an exceptionally wealthy nation. People think there is money for just about everything. We cannot be critical of the approach taken in the past because if we go back to 1997 or further there was not enough money to be able to make commitments on a ten-year basis. A peak and trough approach was evident in the growth of the economy. No Minister for Finance could be certain that the necessary resources would be there or that one could commit to such resources to develop a ten-year envelope. The approach was to take things on a project-by-project, year-on-year basis. The squeaky wheel was the first to get the oil. The result was a situation where one did not have a controlled approach to development. We can now see difficulties with that approach. This plan must work and any difficulties that may arise must be addressed.Senator Bradford referred to some of the other policy platforms proposed by the Government. I am not sure they have failed to the extent he suggested. A strategic approach has been taken to the resolution of difficulties within the health service. Most people would accept there have been significant improvements in the health service in the past ten years. I accept there are difficulties in accident and emergency services and elderly care units but some fantastic facilities have been put in place and a greater number of procedures are being carried out on a daily basis. More people are now having a positive experience in a hospital environment. The Acting Chairman and the Minister of State will be aware of that fact. We must give credit where it is due.I accept problems will be encountered. If the publication of a ten-year strategy could resolve issues in every Department, there would not be a need for Government because one could set out the strategy and hope that it would work. That is not the way things work. It is important to set out this strategy but it is also important to recognise there will be difficulties along the way. We must grapple with the strategic infrastructure Bill that has been talked about in terms of ownership of land and rights to object, especially in regard to tunnelling for a future metro project. We must come to terms with that in the same way as the Spanish authorities have done. Senator Norris has extensive experience of the metro project in Madrid. He visited Madrid and had discussions with Dr. Melis on how that city handled ownership rights to land underneath people's properties. If we do not address this matter it could impact on the delivery of projects like the metro. We must grapple with the issue of people who object to infrastructural projects. We have seen the delays experienced in Carrickmines in regard to the completion of the M50.The difficulties we encounter along the way may result in a change to the schedule but that should not represent failure. It is a recognition that in moving to the kind of infrastructure we need, we are prepared to tackle problems as they arise, as any good Government would do. I accept we have experienced difficulties with the toll bridge. I welcome the upgrading of the M50 as part of the Transport 21 plan. I am pleased that work is well advanced in introducing three lanes in both directions between Naas and Dublin which has become a bugbear for anybody that travels on that road. Delivery of this plan is vital for economic growth through commercial activity and guaranteeing the transportation and movement of goods. The commuter belt is moving outside of Dublin. The Minister mentioned the importance of a vibrant capital city and he is correct to state that free movement of traffic and commuters through the capital city is of immense benefit to all of us, regardless of where we live. It acts as the economic engine.The Government has not only taken that as a stated position, it has developed policies within this plan to create a counterbalance for those who want to live and work in the west of Ireland. I am happy to see the Atlantic corridor connecting Donegal and Waterford, taking in places such as Galway, Clare and Limerick where many of us spend our time, and creating economic activity. I would like to see a timetable for that. Hopefully, it can be expedited without delay. I know some sections of that road are already well under way. The Minister of State is familiar with the Ennis bypass and championed the case to ensure it was put in place. That will form part of the link as will the fourth river crossing in Limerick.Also included in the plan is the western rail corridor, which will of immense benefit to the entire country, particularly the west. As Senator Bradford stated, it is recognition that the policy of closing down railroads many years ago was not good and we need to address it. The Leader of this House was instrumental in achieving investment at a time when money was not as available to ensure we are now in a position to upgrade the western rail corridor on a phased basis. That has been discussed previously in this and the other House.It would have been nice if this could have been done all in one strip but that was not to be. The timetable has been set out and it is welcome. The first section links Limerick to Ennis and onwards to Galway and will show that strong demand exists. The traffic between Limerick and Ennis is phenomenal. I have no doubt including a population centre such as Galway will mean a considerable number of extra passengers.As part of that I would like to see the rail spur to Shannon developed. It is not in the plan but I know it is part of an economic impact assessment done by Iarnród Éireann. It would be helpful. As an interim measure, the Government and the Department of Transport might give consideration to opening the station at Sixmilebridge. The Minister of State well knows it is a short distance from Shannon Airport. A short taxi ride from the airport would allow people to access the rail network and facilitate their onward journey. It would also be of benefit to the growing population along the rail line at Sixmilebridge. Perhaps an opportunity to open the station at Newmarket-on-Fergus is also provided. People who live in these areas are more likely to use the rail line if they do not have to take their cars to either end in order to use it. The Minister of State has supported that in the past and I hope the Government will address the issue.The critical important element is that a demand and need for these rail services exists. Objections have been raised from some quarters on the metro and why the airport should only have a metro link. Some airline operators indicated there is no need for it and it is a phenomenal waste of money. I do not agree. It provides a rail link between the airport and our capital city. It will also provide direct access to the city for people living in Swords and beyond. We must encourage people to use public transport, considering such a good level of public transport exists by rail and bus.Similarly to what was stated yesterday on road safety, this is a cultural and educational issue. It is a chicken and egg situation. The only way to get people to think about using public transport is if they know a quality regular service exists with capacity and gets them from A to B in a safe and efficient manner. It must also be value for money. It provides a viable alternative to the use of cars considering the increasing oil prices and the increasing cost of cars and insurance.The amount of street and road space available is a limited resource. Our population is growing and this is the only way to progress. I commend the Government, the Minister for Transport and also all of the people involved within the Government and those who identified projects for inclusion. I compliment them on a job well done.

I am rather sorry she indicated she will not continue in public life after the next election. Her absence will be a great loss to Irish public life. I have happy memories of serving with her, going back to my first term on the Oireachtas joint committee dealing with women's rights. I am sure she will find many other ways of contributing to Irish public life but she certainly will be a loss to political life in the general sense.I welcomed the Transport 21 initiative. I almost fully welcomed it and I still welcome it in outline but I was disappointed with the Minister's speech because it was so generalised. It contained no particular detail. Reference was made to the €34.4 billion cost. It contains evasions and excuses. Some of them are credible enough, such as not wanting to give away commercially sensitive information. It also contains generalised comments on the need to update urban transport.One aspect I find extremely sinister is the lack of any mention of the metro from beginning to end. I campaigned on this for 20 years. I amended a bill concerning Dublin transport seven or eight years ago when, through an accident of politics, this side of the House was in the majority. The Independents held the balance of power. It was discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport. I will return to that point because it seems the recommendations of that committee are being subverted in some way by what one could describe as the permanent Government which has always been against the metro.I must pay tribute to the Leader of this House, Senator O'Rourke, because she had the backbone and gumption to run with the metro proposal where her two male predecessors were frightened off by the gurus. I am not a partisan person. I am genuinely independent. I praise the Government when I believe it is right and I look to the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport because it is non-partisan and we all unite. I am concerned that some of our recommendations are being ignored. People on the Government side pointed out the lack of a timetable. Let us not be sold a pup. I did not join in the chorus of condemnation from this side of the House. I welcomed it but we need specifics. Budget figures have been revealed and now is the time to come clean and make it clear and targeted.This morning I received an e-mail from the Meath on Track campaign as I am sure did many other people. Its members seek support in calling for funding to be made available for the complete outline design scheme for the 26 miles to Navan next year. That seems to be an ideal project. Navan is one of our growing dormitory towns with a large and increasing number of people who need to get in and out of the greater Dublin area using public transport. The e-mail states that once the design scheme is completed it will be possible to ascertain the costs involved in reinstating the Navan line and the issues of levies, funding and delivery timescales can be addressed based on factual information. Without this information, the proposal for Navan contained in Transport 21 will leave the people of Meath no closer to the reintroduction of rail services than prior to the announcement. There is no provision for a detailed examination of the situation, which must be done prior to the commencement of the project, and this concerns me.Senator Dooley referred to Professor Melis but unfortunately I was unable to visit Madrid. I have met Professor Melis and I was responsible for bringing him here through the agency of Cormac Rabbitt and Rudi Monaghan, transport engineers who have been very helpful to the Joint Committee on Transport. Rumours were spread around the committee that Professor Melis had been unhelpful in some way and had not maintained contact. That is not true and the reverse is the case. Professor Melis offered to train Irish personnel in Madrid and he has yet to receive an acknowledgement of the offer. I ask if we are serious and suggest we examine this situation.We were told building costs in Ireland were 2.4 times the costs in Madrid but this is not correct. I have been provided with factual information that suggests costs are directly comparable to the point of being almost in line. We can scotch that excuse. Disadvantageous comparisons were made between tunnelling schemes such as the Dublin Port tunnel and the Madrid technology. The machines used in Madrid were of a substantially different design. The boring machines used in the port tunnel had to be stopped for 20 minutes at 45 minute intervals to replace side panels. Machines used by Professor Melis in Madrid go straight through, non-stop, and this represents a saving.The Minister was somewhat coy about costs in his speech and perhaps there is a reason for this. The figure of €34.4 billion over ten years announced in Transport 21 must be considered in light of recently published pre-budget Estimates. These figures add another piece to the puzzle. The Department of Transport has €2.28 billion, of which €1.6 billion appears to be for capital expenditure. On this basis even someone as innumerate as myself, who failed arithmetic in the leaving certificate, can calculate that it will take 21.5 years to complete the project, finishing in 2027. In these Estimates, the total spending for the whole country, €48.5 billion, of which €34.4 billion is capital expenditure, means that Government spending on transport over the next ten years must be 10% of total Government spending, a considerable sum of money.External agencies have commented on this and I refer to one A&L Goodbody report which suggests there is a missing figure of €1.5 billion for the aviation sector. Where is this in the Government's calculations? Examining the situation further, the 39 selected projects include six Luas, comprising five Luas extensions and one new Luas line to Lucan and two metro lines, one running north to Swords via the airport and one running west to Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan, Blanchardstown and Ballymun. There was a lovely map at Dublin Castle showing the routing of the Luas and one aspect is curious and troubling to me. The deficiency that is the absence of a link between the two metro lines will be supplied twice. A Luas line will run on the surface, which will be problematical in terms of street arrangements and building structures, as well as a metro line.This is the most expensive section for either rail system and raises the question of why the Government is duplicating it. One is driven to the conclusion that the Government will build the Luas and hump the metro. This concerns me and if this is the position of the Government let us be open about it. Let us not pretend we are going to build a metro if it is not going to happen. Those of us in all parties and members of the transport committee who believe a metro is essential can then make the argument. At present we are firing into cotton wool. We need a clear commitment from the Government.There is also a curious reversal of priorities, with the completion of certain projects now deemed essential before work commences on the metro. These include the three extensions to the Luas and the metro between Tallaght, Clondalkin and Lucan. The Joint Committee on Transport unanimously adopted a report prepared by O'Reilly Consultants that contains nothing partisan. That report indicated the metro was advantageous to the citizens of Dublin and Ireland but also that there would be a substantial cost, albeit partially concealed, in not building the metro. This does not seem to have been taken on board.What is the standing of the Joint Committee on Transport in the eyes of the Minister and his advisors? Do they take the extensive work done on the metro seriously or is the committee a decoration while decisions are made behind the scenes by people not accountable to citizens? I do not mean any disrespect to our Civil Service, for which I have high respect. It is not the fault of civil servants if they get their way, we need politicians who will stand up to them and continue to tell the truth.Yesterday, an important meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport coincided with the Order of Business in this House. That shows complete contempt for Seanad Éireann as meetings never coincide with the Order of Business in the Dáil. I have drawn this to the attention of the Chairman, the staff and leaders of different parties. I have asked them not to allow Senators attend such meetings just once, so that there will be an insufficient number for a quorum. If we do this once we will put manners on those arranging the meetings. There is always someone who slithers in at the last minute and saves the bacon. This House should agree not to attend the next meeting that clashes with the Order of Business.I have been advised over a number of years by two remarkable people, one of whom, Rudi Monaghan, is dead. The other, Cormac Rabbitt, is a significant traffic engineer. He made connections with Professor Melis, spoke to the committee on transport and has the necessary facts and figures. His Dargan proposal, named in memory of William Dargan who built so many railways, concerns a circle line.Dublin, as a city with a bay, is ideally constituted for this suggestion. There would be a 12.2 km circle line, the loop line would be upgraded and extended by the construction of a 5.9 km tunnel, located mostly south of the Liffey, with interchange stations to the existing six rail and nine road spokes. It is planned to locate stations approximately 0.8 km to 1.2 km apart. The tunnel could be built on wayleave land, 80% of which is publicly owned. We will not have problems with land if we follow this plan. The wayleave allows tunnel construction and maintenance and does not imply land purchase. The circle line profitably provides a rail hub by its utilisation of existing infrastructure. Simply said, it benefits from extensive working infrastructure to maximise the number of fares. In addition, the project capitalises on currently available low interest finance. The foregoing helps to contribute to a minimum investment return in year one of 5.2%.

I have detailed figures here and have requested that Mr. Rabbitt be allowed to make a submission to the Joint Committee on Transport. A colleague from one of the Opposition parties poured scorn on this and spoke about self-appointed experts but Mr. Rabbitt is an internationally acclaimed expert, while my colleague is a self-appointed expert herself. When we have talent in this country, recognised by the O'Reilly report, we should call it in. We do not have to take the advice given, but we should add it to the mix.This project is based on public private partnerships and is an innovative plan. It is based on the type of model that gave us the International Financial Services Centre, which, I admit, I mocked in the beginning. That is the kind of entrepreneurship we need.Are we serious about the metro or is Transport 21 just a lot of camouflage? I suggest it is the latter, based on the Minister's speech and the lack of figures, timetabling and public commitment.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I welcome the Minister and am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this discussion on the historic transformation of transport in this country.Much time was invested in this plan. The consultation process began in 2000. It involved consideration of the reports, A Platform for Change and the strategic rail review, as well as consultation with the National Roads Authority, the Railway Procurement Agency, the Dublin Transport Office, Córas Iompair Éireann and Bus Éireann. While I compliment those organisations, I am not sure that we need their input now. Great work has gone into this plan over the last few years and the various interest groups had to be involved in the process, in order to bring about this new transport initiative, Transport 21.The main issue of concern now is accountability. I wonder about the future role of all of the parties that were involved. We need one umbrella organisation or agency to implement and oversee Transport 21. Otherwise, we could get bogged down on the question of who is responsible for various aspects of the plan. Now that the plan has been launched, the Minister and one agency should take control. It might then be possible to set up links with the various bodies dealing with roads, rail and transport in the greater Dublin area.The Minister stated earlier that prior to the publication of Transport 21, the Dundalk western bypass and the Waterford outer ring road were opened and the new eight-car DART service was launched. In that context, let us not be too cynical. Work is being done and Senators should acknowledge that, rather than always concentrating on the negative — asserting that the plan is nothing but promises and that nothing will happen. I believe it will happen because it must.We must have an integrated transport solution. We cannot take a piecemeal approach any longer. I am delighted to see that Dublin will be linked, via motorways, with all of the main cities in the country. I regularly travel on the Naas dual carriageway and I welcome the infrastructural developments that have taken place along that road. The movement of traffic is excellent on the route.I am pleased that we are going to revitalise the railways by upgrading stations and funding the urban and regional fleets. It is estimated that over 20 million passengers will travel on the Luas this year. Since its introduction, more people are choosing public transport, as is evident in Tallaght, Sandyford and other areas. Crowds of people use the Luas every day, including at weekends. It is a great achievement and I compliment the Government on executing the plan for Luas in good time, despite various obstacles. We must now undertake more developments of a similar kind.In this Celtic tiger era there is not one family in the country that does not have two or three cars. Therefore, the road infrastructure must be improved. People's lifestyles are changing, as are their careers. Nowadays, it is not an issue for people to commute every day from Kildare, Portlaoise or Waterford to work in Dublin. The road network must be improved to facilitate that.Transport 21 aims to increase the number of rail carriages and cars by 187 between 2005 and 2008. That is a specific target and I hope the Government will stick to it. It is stated explicitly in the plan and will happen. The renewal of the mainline rail rolling stock will take place in the aforementioned timeframe. In addition, 36 railcars will be provided for the Dublin suburban and Sligo rail services. There will be services every hour from Dublin to Cork, Galway and Limerick and every two hours from Dublin to Sligo. There will be improvements in the Westport, Ballina and Rosslare areas, with four services per day. This will open up the regions. These are specific plans. Senator Norris asserted that there was a lack of specifics in the plan, but I have just outlined some specific targets to which we must adhere.I welcome the commitment by the Government to the concept of interconnection, which will relieve severe bottlenecks in Dublin city centre. That must be welcomed by all. I look forward to seeing the connection of the Luas and DART services, making travel between Heuston Station, Connolly Station, Tallaght, Sandyford and Bray possible. Integrated ticketing will be a part of that development. Again, this is a specific aim, outlined clearly in the plan, which I welcome.There are plans to further upgrade the Luas. The Tallaght line is to extend to the docklands, there will be a spur to the CityWest, and the Sandyford line will extend to Cherrywood and Bray, to link in with the DART and suburban rail network. In view of all this I compliment the Government for creating one single authority. It will be of great benefit to the greater Dublin area and represents the joined up thinking to which the Minister referred. However, one area not adequately catered for is park and ride facilities. Some of the park and ride areas are becoming expensive and deter people from using them, so I ask the Minister to address that issue.I welcome moves regarding the Dublin-Waterford connection. I am aware the Minister has already opened the outer ring road and there will be possibilities in 2009 to upgrade the roads to Waterford. The people in Waterford will welcome that and I am delighted the Minister has made a commitment in that area. It is well overdue because Waterford city is choc-a-bloc and nobody can get in or out of it. The quicker that job is done the better.This is a great initiative. Lifestyles are changing and we need to get people out of the big cities to relieve the bottlenecks. We must improve services so that people can enjoy a better quality of life. It is necessary to decentralise automatically because more and more young people do not stay in Dublin after they leave college but look for jobs in other major cities. I welcome that the focus is no longer on Dublin alone. This transport initiative has started the process of moving people to other areas as they enjoy greater development and prosperity, which will rejuvenate rural life. Facilitating third level education in major cities is welcome, as is upgrading our universities and schools, all of which will result from this initiative.I welcome the launch of Transport 21. The specifics are there but we must have implementation. If we act on what the Minister has said we will have a first class transport system in this country, with railways, roads and bus services all interconnected and with integrated ticketing and park and ride facilities, so that greater Dublin can be relieved as people to move out to achieve a greater quality of life.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I was interested in the comments of Senator Norris to the effect that, unlike the Opposition parties, he did not condemn Transport 21. Nor do we. I certainly have not condemned it, nor was I aware that my party had. The problem is not the content or any lack of specifics, because, as Senator Ormonde rightly said, there are specifics. The problem is we have heard it all before, not once or twice but many times since this Government came into power in 1997.This morning I read a speech that the then Minister for Public Enterprise, now Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, made on 4 March 1999, the better part of seven years ago. I will not take it out of context but will list the six or seven points she made, in the order that she made them. She said the Government was looking at a possible inland rail link to Navan, the possible separation of long distance and commuter rail traffic through the construction of bypass rail lines, a new rail link from Belfast through Swords and Dublin Airport, a new rail loop east of the current loop line in Dublin, quadrupling existing double lines where feasible, the enhancement of rail services in a series of towns, which she listed, and more sophisticated signalling technology to increase track capacity.Of those seven initiatives, two appear to have been ditched, because they have not happened, and the remaining five are repeated in Transport 21. Senator O'Rourke, who was Minister for Public Enterprise at the time, contemplated those options fully seven years ago, virtually the full term of this Government. It is truly remarkable that so little has happened in the intervening period.I will deal with a few of the issues on which Senator Ormonde touched. The national development plan stated in 2000 that the four main priority roads would be completed by the end of the plan in 2006. We were told by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, in December 2003 that he was determined, as was the Government, that they would be completed by the end of 2007. Transport 21 states they will be completed in 2010. In fairness, the timetable had already begun to shift when the NRA stated they would be only substantially completed by 2007, which then became 2008 and 2009 and is now 2010.I acknowledge there were problems with capacity in the late 1990s. The construction industry was not up to speed and was not accustomed to dealing with the scale of budget suddenly available to it. The Department of Transport and the NRA did not have the capacity or experience, so many projects slipped in terms of timing and budget. That is no longer the case because when builders arrive on site things now move very satisfactorily. As the Minister indicated, the Loughrea bypass was opened ahead of schedule and the Kilcock-Kinnegad stretch of motorway, as well as others, will also be ahead of schedule.While these projects are completed on budget and ahead of schedule not much is happening with regard to the main four main pivotal routes. Some projects are under way but there are not many. Many are at planning stage, at the stage of land acquisition or at the drawing board. It means there will be a hiatus on the ground for a year or two.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I accept that is a factor. The Minister promised he would have the critical infrastructure Bill in place to fast-track the decision making process so that people would be allowed a substantive objection but would not be allowed seven, eight or nine attempts, as is the case now. The port tunnel in my own constituency is such an example. First we had to change the development plan in Dublin. Then we lobbied for a change in the project to extend the northern portals. When we unexpectedly got that change we had to start the project all over again. We had to go back to the consultation process and deal with the same objections even though they did not relate specifically to the changes that had been made.Everybody acknowledges the process is too slow and complex. A combination of parallel and consecutive processes delays the implementation of a project for years. There is a need to fast-forward projects to complete them in one process, which respects people's right to object but ensures we get the job done as quickly as possible if plans are approved.With regard to mainline rail, Senator Ormonde expressed her delight that we will have over 100 more carriages on the tracks in the next two or three years. That is fine but again, we have been told this three or four times. There has not been an Estimates process in the past three or four years when we have not been told there would be several dozen additional items of rolling stock available the following year. I have lost track of this. I do not know whether they were made available or whether they are the same carriages that were double counted and announced time and time again. With the exception of the Belfast and Cork lines most of the rolling stock, as the Minister acknowledges, dates from the 1960s. It is cold, dilapidated, frequently full and sometimes dangerous.It is beyond me how, after years of investment, it takes over three hours to get from Rosslare Harbour to Dublin. How can this be? How can it take three hours for a train to travel the 150 km from Rosslare Harbour to Dublin? In other European countries they have invested in fast trains, the TGV in France being the flagship, but there are others in Germany, Spain and Italy which cover 150 km in a half an hour. Nobody in Ireland is ambitious enough to argue for a TGV or anything remotely comparable, but it is not unreasonable to expect to get from Rosslare to Dublin in, for example, two hours. As it is, the rolling stock is terrible and the tracks are not up to speed, if Members will excuse the phrase. When the Leader was Minister, she secured quite a bit of investment in rail safety at the turn of the century. Much of that work was important and had to be done. It involved the underpinning of bridges, infrastructure along the line and the upgrading of tracks but, unfortunately, it did not lead to an improved service for commuters who use rail services. The fact is that the mainline rail service in 2005 is much the same as it was in 1997 when the Government took up office. We are now asked to believe that there will be a substantial jump in the next two years or three years. Let us hope that is the case because history does not give us great grounds for hoping it will be the case.I would like to talk briefly about Dublin. A major element which can be criticised in the Transport 21 plan is the lack of any semi-interest in bus transport in Dublin. The Minister has responded to this since the publication of Transport 21 by saying he is waiting for Dublin Bus to come back to him with its various plans. Unfortunately, I do not believe this is the case. The Government announced in 2000 that it would examine the whole issue of bus regulation. We understood from the Minister of the day that what was in mind was some measure of competition between Dublin Bus and private operators in Dublin. Some of us were sceptical about it, and still are. Having said that, we do not object to it in principle if it makes sense on a particular route to put Dublin Bus up against a private operator. I certainly do not have a problem with franchising out new routes to private operators or getting Dublin Bus to compete with private operators for the tender.However, the problem is that the Minister appears to have very little idea of what he wants to do. If ever there was a case of a Minister being ideologically driven, it was the way the former Minister, Deputy Brennan, dealt with this issue. He appeared in principle to want competition, but he had no idea how he would introduce it. The result is that we got nothing for a period of years and the current Minister is now giving us the same excuse that he cannot do anything until the bus market in Dublin is regulated. I do not believe the Government will introduce regulation of the bus market in Dublin. The bottom line is that had we acknowledged that five, six or seven years ago and decided to just invest in Dublin Bus and improve the QBC network and so on, we would be much better off now. If the Minister is going to do something about bus regulation, will he please get on with it? If he is going to opt out, then fine, let him say so and get on with the business of investing in Dublin Bus as things stand.Much has been said about the west and the Atlantic corridor. Senator Dooley will be aware that I have an interest in this matter because my wife is from Clare and we visit the area on a regular basis. We vary our journey between the Limerick and Galway road, depending on which one happens to be getting any better at a given time. I think we will travel via Galway this year, given that by then the Kinnegad stretch will presumably be open, notwithstanding the toll. Anyone who examines the plan for the west would have to be more than a little cynical. On the face of it, the Atlantic corridor is a fine idea. However, if one examines the proposed route for the Atlantic corridor, very little of it has received serious investment over the past ten years. There has been no indication from the Government that it was a long-term plan. It is true that sections, such as the N18 between Ennis and Limerick, have received investment, but it has never been part of an overall plan. It lacks credibility for the Government to say, without any serious prior discussion, that it will carry out this work. It lacks much more credibility when one looks behind the plan and realises it is nothing more than a broad notion. There are no timeframes and very little serious intent to do anything about the issue.Something similar must be said about the western rail corridor about which perhaps the Minister of State knows more. The interest groups that have been lobbying on the issue have been looking somewhat askance at the timeframes and asking how can it take up to 2015 to put in place a railway line, some of which already exists albeit in a relatively dilapidated form. The first element to be put in place is not, strictly speaking, part of the corridor at all. It is the improved commuter route from Athenry to Galway, which is needed. When talking about these commuter routes, it is worth saying that this is not just about Dublin. I freely acknowledge that Cork, Limerick and Galway have serious traffic difficulties which could be alleviated by a serious commuter rail system.There has been talk for approximately ten years about improving the Midleton route in Cork, but precious little has been done about it. There has been some improvement on the line to Mallow but virtually none to Midleton. There has been talk about connecting Shannon Airport to Limerick for as long as I can remember and it still has not happened. The one improvement that has been carried out is the route between Ennis and Limerick. It was put in place hesitantly in that the services in place at the beginning were few and far between. There were three or four services a day, but that has now increased to eight. The standard of the rolling stock initially was terrible. The carriages used were the ones that were no longer deemed good enough to connect Limerick with Limerick Junction. They were suddenly shunted onto the route between Ennis and Limerick. There has been an improvement in the service but it has been very slow. It has taken approximately 15 years to get to a situation where there is a half decent service. Senator Dooley was correct when he said that there is a point when a service is thought to be sufficiently reliable and people will use the rail rather than the car. I am not sure we have reached that stage on the Limerick to Ennis route.Transport 21 is full of plans about Luas. I would like to express a note of caution about Luas. A few weeks ago, I travelled for the first time on the Sandyford line, and there is no doubt it works exceptionally well. It works effectively as a railway line because it is a dedicated track. The tram moves very quickly between stations once it gets off-street in Charlemont Street. I travelled on part of the Tallaght line which works less well. I passed it mid-morning the other day around the Four Courts when it was full and moving very slowly. There is a real problem with on-street trams in Dublin because we are not used to them. They are potentially dangerous and travel far short of their capacity in terms of speed. I am not sure this will improve. Given our experience of the first year of operation of Luas, if it is to be taken seriously and used well, we must examine a service that has a dedicated track. This is why I agree with what Senator Norris said earlier that a metro is needed.The economists have said the footprint of Dublin is not suitable for metro. These are the same people who told us, and still tell us, that one could not possibly justify a motorway from, for example, Dublin to Dundalk because sufficient cars would not use it. Admittedly there are times when the Dublin to Dundalk motorway is sparsely used. However, I do not think anyone in this House seriously believes that in ten years time we will be saying it is a pity we built that motorway because of all the open spaces. I suspect something similar is true of metro. Perhaps the footprint of the city does not stack up to keep all the economists happy just yet, but I believe, as does Senator Norris, that it is the way of the future, not just because it is my intuition, but because it is the experience everywhere else. It is the experience in cities that are far more diverse and have a bigger footprint than Dublin. We must learn from this. The quicker we do so, the cheaper it will be and the quicker we can get the work done. I would like to think I will still be alive when there is a metro line in Dublin, but I do not have great confidence that will be the case. That plan was also announced by the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke, approximately five years ago.I do not want to sound entirely negative about the transport system. There have been significant improvements in recent years in terms of infrastructure but they have been desperately slow. Some have been inexcusably slow. I get no sense from the gestation of the plan or the way the current Minister and, more important, the Minister for Finance is dealing with the issue that there is a sense of urgency or ambition which will allow us, within a reasonable time, to transform our infrastructure. Roads, mainline rail and public transport in Dublin have improved since 1997 but they have not improved to the level people are entitled to expect.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this timely debate on Transport 21. It is timely because the €34 billion or so that will be spent over the next ten years must be debated. The timeframe must also be debated. I say this because the Dublin Transportation Office has stated that traffic levels in 2003 reached the levels projected for 2016, demonstrating how far behind we are and the need for investment on a speedy basis. The Department's strategy statement for 2005-07 provides for links between provincial cities, local towns, villages and rural areas. Local access is to be facilitated by effective local transport networks, principally non-national roads and bus-based public transport services. The Department's guiding principle reflects the critical importance of bus-based public transport linking cities, towns and villages.The question must be asked, however, if we are meeting that objective. For the last ten years we have consistently and successfully developed the QBC network. In last year's budget, a further €35 million was allowed for expenditure in the course of this year on the further rolling out of QBCs across Dublin. When I was on Fingal County Council and we were putting in place a QBC to Blanchardstown, we were told by officials from the DTO that buses would be so frequent and fast that a passenger boarding a bus would see another bus coming down the road. At that time, why would anyone not have voted to hand over 50% of a road into Dublin? We reduced three lanes to two and two lanes to one on the basis that there would be frequent, reliable bus services. That has not happened, despite the fact that hundreds of millions of euro in national development plan money has been given to Dublin Bus, solely to the disadvantage of every other provider of bus services in the country.In Transport 21, 20 replacement buses were to be given to Dublin Bus. We have since been told that Dublin Bus has been asked to look at its route network across Dublin and then come back to the Minister. That is not the way to go. For too long we have allowed the operator to also be the route regulator and provider. It is time for a body, such as that being established under Dr. O'Mahony in Transport 21, to have responsibility for the working of the systems, independently and on an integrated basis, across Dublin. The operators should not be doing this.I say that for two reasons. Dublin Bus has been responsible for this service since 1932 but delivered very few new routes as suburbs grew, lengthening journey routes instead, leading to journey times in excess of two hours to the city centre. We should start with a blank canvas, asking how we should go about this; it should not be left up to Dublin Bus to provide it. Lately the company stated it needs another 120 buses in Dublin. Who should provide those buses? The taxpayer, at a cost of €300,000 per bus and €150,000 per bus per year for maintenance? There is an alternative which would bring competition and cost the taxpayer nothing — the independent operator.In the independent sector, 5,000 buses are in operation. Not a cent of national development plan money has gone towards their purchase or operation. Why have they been completely excluded from Transport 21? They cost the taxpayer nothing. Why do we not introduce a model where those operators provide the capital using their own buses and let the passenger provide the revenue, not the taxpayer who at present is paying a subvention?That subvention is abused by the Government. If we look at the routes from Cork or Galway to Dublin, taxpayers are subventing Bus Éireann to compete on routes for €12 against Aircoach to Cork or Nestor's to Galway. Is that how taxpayers' money should be thrown away? No. The Cork and Galway routes have shown us that once competition is introduced, the level of service on the routes improves and the numbers using public transport increase. The market grows. I cannot see what Dublin Bus has to fear from competition with the size of its fleet.I agree with Senator McDowell, we have lost our way on this issue for the last seven years. We have seen, however, what competition did for Aer Lingus. Without competition, it would not have survived. It has survived without Government hand-outs in the recent difficult years and is now thriving. To continue as we are to the exclusion of the private bus operators is wrong.The previous Minister for Transport examined the franchising model, with up to 20% to go the private sector initially. That model is being reviewed to such an extent that I would find it hard to agree with the model that may be proposed. Any model that might say that Dublin Bus would franchise the next 15% of growth to the private sector would mean that the current operator in a monopoly would be the regulator and provider of a franchise to private operators who have not received any State hand-out for either their purchases or operations. Surely that is not what we are proposing.This debate must take place if we are serious about competition. The bus infrastructure, including routes and bus stops, must be handed over to an independent body such as that over which Margaret O'Mahony will have control. All the providers should then outline what they can do on various routes. The proposed change in this regard is a retrograde step, which will be challenged in the courts.QBCs are restricted to public transport but not enough vehicles use them. At off-peak times, QBCs should be available to commercial transport users. These people are trying to distribute goods throughout the city and they are prevented from using QBCs, particularly during off-peak times when few buses use the corridors. For example, a bus corridor is in place between the end of the end of M50 and Malahide along the N32 but no buses are scheduled to run on it. It is scandalous that such a corridor is not in use. The existing infrastructure should be used to the maximum but that is not happening.Every day hundreds of thousands of people try to travel into Dublin city from the suburbs. Proper stations, proper access to them and park and ride facilities are not provided. Dublin Bus says it is not responsible for providing a feeder service at train stations while Irish Rail says its business is to transport people when they board its trains. Despite this, €34 billion will be spent on public transport over the next ten years as the Government tries to encourage people to avail of the various services. However, in many areas, commuters must drive to train stations at which parking is not provided. They get drenched waiting for trains in weather such as that we experienced this morning and when they board trains, they are packed. I have experienced this and I have been forced to stop using the train to Pearse Street from Castleknock Station, which is three minutes from my house, because of the sheer inconvenience involved. Driving a car in Dublin is stressful but for many people, using public transport, particularly train services, is as stressful.Integrated ticketing would encourage people to use public transport. It will come under the remit of the new body led by Margaret O'Mahony. A single provider should not be in charge of integrated ticketing because the problem will be the disbursement of the revenue generated at the end of the day. If an independent referee is in place, at least there might be a level playing pitch. I hope there will be progress in this area as a result.I share the Minister's enthusiasm and I hope the plan will be implemented but much of it will not be in place for between five and seven years. Dublin continues to expand and a solution for the city's future transport needs is required. The Minister states in Transport 21 that the bus will remain the best option. Bottlenecks must be addressed and it must become easier for commuters to use buses. Our bus shelters are a disgrace and they are only provided if they generate advertising revenue. That should not be the basis for providing them. The bus infrastructure should come under the remit of an independent body so that people are encouraged to use public transport and are not forced to stand in the rain, as happened this morning.Radical change is needed. A feeder bus service to and from train stations, proper access to stations and proper footpaths and bus shelters must be provided. I refer to the Travelsaver ticket, which is a great secret in Dublin because it is not advertised. I do not see why individuals cannot purchase this ticket and must go through their employers before claiming tax back. Individual ticket purchases would be a cheaper option. The Department of Finance states that if tickets are bought individually, the workload in local Revenue officers would increase. People can claim back tax against their medical and refuse bills on an individual basis and I do not see how claiming tax back on commuter tickets would increase the workload of such offices. The thinking within the Department must change significantly. It will be interesting to see if this will be addressed in the budget. The Minister for Transport must ensure access to public transport is more convenient if he is to encourage the public to avail of it.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Senator Morrissey made a number of comments about the rail service. However, in the north west, we would do anything for a poor train station or poor access to rail lines. We do not have access to train lines, never mind trains. The only sign of a train in Donegal is at Christmas time when small choo choo trains appear on Christmas boxes. That is the unfortunate position in which we find ourselves.I welcome the provision of a new body with responsibility for national roads, aviation and public transportation. That is a sensible starting point and it will be significant in the provision of a more integrated transport policy. However, that was the only noteworthy comment in the Minister's contribution. It has come to my party's attention through parliamentary questions tabled by my colleagues that City of Derry Airport has received upwards of €12 million from the Exchequer over the past six years. The airport has been part of Donegal County Council's plans because it has a strategic value to the county and Donegal people use it. However, what return is generated by this investment? What is the Government's long-term plan regarding the use of City of Derry Airport? Will the State continue to invest in it? What is the long-term plan for transport links between Derry and Donegal?The 2002 national spatial strategy was an aspirational document and it highlighted Derry and Letterkenny as gateway hubs. This was broadly welcomed in Donegal, as it was proposed to create a significant link that crossed the political divide. However, we hoped there would be further exploration of the Derry-Letterkenny link in the Transport 21 proposals but that did not happen. There was no specific mention of the co-operation, engagement or communication undertaken by the Northern and Southern authorities. As far as the people in the north west are concerned the title "Transport 21" is a misnomer, the document a non-runner and there is no cross-departmental co-operation between North and South. I can put this on the record because when, following publication of Transport 21, I asked my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, to ask where this communication was, there was no response. Bypasses for Monaghan and Castleblaney have been discussed, as has the Lifford-Letterkenny road but there is no integrated foresight or vision for the north west's transportation needs in that document or in policy. This point is critical and something needs to be done about it in the short term.I met members of Dungannon local authority last Monday in Letterkenny. Public representatives in the North are frustrated at the lack of coherent vision on a transport strategy. They are frustrated that Northern authorities do not know what is being done in the South and vice versa. There is no political will to bring the responsible people together to create joint policy and Transport 21 does not cater for it.Transport 21 contains a one-line mention of the Derry-Letterkenny road. There are no deliverables or timelines. Where are the solutions for accessing Derry city airport from Letterkenny? Where are the options on a dual carriageway from Derry city to Letterkenny? We have invested exchequer funding of over €12 million in the past six years in an airport that we use but which we have problems accessing. Where is the discussion on having a single line railway from Letterkenny to Derry city airport? There has been no Government thinking on this topic although it has happened at a local authority level. Donegal County Council and the authority members there have talked about this and made recommendations and representations for years but it has not been brought into national policy. It has been talked about at a north west cross-Border group and there has been co-operation at local authority level but nothing in this document gives me confidence.Transport 21 claims to be an integrated transport policy. It is no more integrated than it was 50 years ago for somebody travelling from Letterkenny to Dublin. The document also claims it will offer the commuter choice in terms of alternative, upgraded or faster routes. A person living in Letterkenny could choose to drive an hour and ten minutes north to Carrickfin and fly to Dublin. That option can take as much time as it would to drive at midnight when there is no traffic. The other choice is to fly from Derry city airport. To drive to Dublin one choice is to go via Belfast. Some people in Inishowen access the M1 through Belfast because the A5 is a joke. When I travel up at 3 p.m. today my average speed will be between 35 and 40 mph. I had intended to help turn on the Christmas lights at 6.30 tonight in Letterkenny.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	134	If I leave at 2.30 p.m. I have no hope because my average speed will be 40 mph all the way to Donegal.Another choice is to go as far as Ballygawley roundabout and access the M1 via Armagh and Newry. Some people bypass Monaghan while others go via Enniskillen and Cavan. There is too much choice but because we use too many alternative routes not enough people travel on one road for it to be identified. That is a wrong system for the people of the north west.The M1 from Belfast to Dublin is very good. Donegal people use the Ballygawley to Armagh route. According to Dungannon councillors, the Armagh to Newry route is a low-priority route in the North. We are pushing all our motorists onto these routes and the M1, which will be upgraded while we lose out. The system is wrong in terms of identifying one route. The only route that will satisfy the people of Donegal is not a two-plus-one route but a dual carriageway from Letterkenny to Dublin through Aughnacloy. We need to co-operate with the Northern authorities on the A5. It is fundamental to the needs of the people of Donegal including daily and weekly commuters, and cancer sufferers who travel by ambulance. Two weeks ago it was reported that a cancer sufferer took nearly seven hours to travel from Letterkenny to Dublin by ambulance——

According to the IDA one of the reasons people do not invest in businesses in the north west is because it is too far away and it takes too long. Donegal is not too far away. When there is no traffic one can drive from Letterkenny to Dublin Airport without breaking the speed limit in two hours and ten minutes. That is not far; it is further to Kerry although Dubliners invest in holiday homes in Galway, Wexford and Kerry because they think Donegal is too far away.

We must engage with the Northern authorities. There will be a significant meeting in Enniskillen on Monday between the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, to discuss a joint integrated transport initiative North and South. Let us get the homework done and meet with our Northern counterparts. We must discuss political matters with them but let us also discuss economic and social needs.

One can travel to Dublin using the motorway without going through hardly any town or city. I accept Senator McHugh's remarks on the N2-A5. Part of the problem is that the North has not received the same level of funding for infrastructure as we have and it might have more financial latitude if and when it agrees to form an executive.I travelled by road to launch a book in Thurles last night and returned by rail this morning. Leaving Dublin at 4.30 p.m. it took almost two hours to reach Naas. I was a little late because of the roadworks which reduced the road to a single lane. That is part of the plan which will, when finished, improve the situation. Unfortunately one tends to get pain before gain.On the main train to Dublin from Limerick Junction this morning, one might have thought that Transport 21 meant an addition of 21 minutes to the average journey. Apologies were made for the delay which we were told was due to signalling problems. It was not actually due to signalling but to congestion on the line. I am glad that part of the plan is to make four tracks available. There is a major problem coming into the city where commuter trains mingle with long distance trains, but this will be sorted out under the plan.There is a further problem when one arrives at Heuston Station and wishes to make one's way to O'Connell Street or, in my case because I was going to the Forum on Europe, to Connolly Station to get the DART. I know the Minister of State has a particular interest in Dublin transport. I impress upon him that it is essential there is a third track available at Heuston Station. Instead of Luas trams every six minutes from Tallaght they should be every three minutes at peak times and every other one should just shuttle back and forward between Connolly and Heuston stations. So many people come out of Heuston Station that there is only standing room on the trams. The RPA should be pressed to introduce such a shuttle service.I am not sure this is the appropriate forum to make suggestions. There was an advertisement last week on the link up between the two Luas lines, which would be beneficial. This plan is a clear winner. For integrated planning reasons, the link should go via Pearse Street and Westland Row as this would avoid clogging up Dawson Street and Kildare Street. It would also link up with the DART and we would not just have the one link at Connolly Station. As somebody who goes occasionally to the Gaiety Theatre, I would not like to hear tram bells interrupt performances as they pass the theatre.An Opposition Member said Transport 21 does nothing for south Tipperary and we have just heard that it does nothing for Donegal. I am sure there are enough Fine Gael and Labour Party Members to say this plan does nothing for any number of areas. In a statement to my local newspaper in reply to the chairman of a Fine Gael constituency party, I pointed out that the Dublin-Cork motorway goes right through the centre of Tipperary, joining Cashel, Cahir and on to Mitchelstown, which will make south Tipperary more accessible to both Dublin and Cork. If people avoid the rush hour, there are significant time savings as a result. It is also easier in terms of driving as people do not have to stop and start at traffic lights.I draw the Minister's attention to the cross link between motorways. There was some surprise that the Atlantic corridor went via Cork to Waterford. Obviously, anybody travelling from Limerick to Waterford would not travel via Cork, however good the road, because of the greater distance to be travelled. The N24 is included in the map. My town of Tipperary is probably the most congested town along the route. Progress is necessary on the link routes without waiting for the completion of the motorways. There will be further work required when the major motorways are complete to link up major and medium-sized provincial towns. I am referring to, for example, the road from Tipperary to Thurles on which there is quite a lot of traffic. That road is in an appalling condition, particularly at the Thurles end.I look forward to the proposed hourly rail service from Dublin to Cork. I assume this will mean an expanded service to Limerick Junction, the main mainline station in south Tipperary. That will stimulate much development. The Minister should ensure that next week's budget provides for the maintenance of park and ride facilities. There is no point in phasing them out when a very ambitious transport plan is in the pipeline.The Opposition made reference to the Limerick-Waterford railway. The reason it was not included in the plan is because the work has been done. The bridge was rebuilt when it collapsed, at a cost of €3 million, and the line is being upgraded as part of the rail safety programme. For the first time in 30 or 40 years, there is a thrice daily passenger service on this line, rather than a service just connecting to the port of Rosslare. The line is being used and connects to Clonmel. Some refinements are required on the timetable and I believe they will come later this month.While I accept south Tipperary is just one vantage point, there is much good news in this plan. Last year I travelled to the Galway races and faced various logistical problems en route. I took the train from Limerick Junction to Ennis. The bus for Galway was due to leave Ennis at the same time the train arrived but I took a chance on it not going on time and was lucky to catch it as they were not connected. There is an unwillingness on the part of those who run Bus Éireann to co-ordinate its timetables with Irish Rail, which is a pity.The western rail corridor will be a benefit when it is in place and when the country is connected through the various links of this plan. The whole will be greater than the sum of its parts. The co-ordinated plan will mean we will be able to travel around the country in whatever direction we want to take by rail. We will have a connected system. If people want to visit places such as Dingle or Westport, they may have to travel by bus also, but the connected system will be a significant benefit.It is important politically that when so much needed money is being spent on the greater Dublin area, the relatively modest projects being carried out in other parts of the country are progressed speedily. If the modest projects such as the Midleton line, due to be completed by 2008, are completed speedily, this will greatly diminish any resentment there is in the country at the amount of money being spent in and around the greater Dublin area, which from the point of view of commuting now extends to a radius of 50 or 60 miles. I may not be as sensitive a soul as Senator Morrissey ——

If it was suggested 20 years ago that there should have been a single Department of Transport, I would have been frightened that roads would eat up the budget, but there is a different attitude nowadays and there is a balance between roads and public transport. We need both, and other modes of travel. I wish the Minister well with the implementation of the plan. The more he can get done quickly, the better.

He made a reference to when he was a young man, but I consider he is still a young man.If this were ten years ago rather than now, we would criticise the Government for its lack of planning. We stumbled into the Celtic tiger era without much planning or foresight and we are lucky that matters turned out as they did. Ten years ago the position was different. The Government seems to have contracted a planning disease, with plans coming out of its ears on even the slightest provocation. What is nasty about this planning disease is not that it involves making plans but that it does not involve carrying them through. A symptom of this disease is that the Government fools itself into believing there is a special virtue in making a plan even if it never implements it. Making a plan that is not implemented is not a virtue but a vice. While I accept the Minister's heart is in the right place, this is a vice to which the Government seems particularly prone.Only yesterday we had a good debate on road safety. It focused attention on the fact that the Government's national road safety plan has been largely unimplemented. Yet the Government seems to believe it can continue trumpeting the fact that it conceived the first ever national road safety plan. That was eight years ago, yet much of it remains on the shelf.Another casualty of the planning process was the national spatial strategy. It was a long time in gestation and no sooner was it born than the Government turned its back on it. The final nail in that coffin was the Government's decentralisation plan, which disregarded the spatial strategy, turning it on its head. I cite those plans as examples and I could continue.We have had plans to roll out broadband, which I raised on the Order of Business some time ago, but they have not worked. We are still at the bottom of the European and OECD leagues in terms of broadband penetration. We have also had the mother and father of all plans, the national health strategy, which was announced approximately four years ago and its implementation is no closer to reality now than when it was first drawn up.I spell out this sorry litany of plans that did not come to fruition to make the point, if it needs making, that any new Government plan has a difficulty in terms of being credible. That is the challenge the Minister faces on this occasion. It is especially the case with this transport plan because we have all been here before in terms of this debate. Transport 21 has already been described as a slimmed-down version of previous transport plans that were left on the shelf for various reasons. The plan gets whittled down but the hype about it does not.Notwithstanding that, there are aspects of this plan that are worth welcoming. One of them is the new emphasis on public transport — I welcome the Minister's input in this respect — rather than providing more roads. For more than ten years I have pleaded for public transport to be at the centre of our transport strategy, rather than our approach to it being a futile attempt to keep ahead of the growth in road traffic, which is what happened in the past. By concentrating almost exclusively on our road system, we have denied people the means to exercise a meaningful choice. People cannot use public transport if it is not available. Indeed, they will not use public transport even if it is available unless it is quality public transport, a system that offers people a real alternative to travelling by car.During the past ten years our transport policy has been like a cat chasing its own tail. We have constructed a road system that has facilitated the massive urban sprawl that has taken place around our cities. As people have been driven out of the cities by high house prices — we have made it easy for that to happen — it has made the problem worse, to say nothing of the congestion it has caused. The result is that hardly has a motorway been built but it is declared out of date and there is a call for plans to widen it, as is the case with the M50.The only sensible place to begin planning a national transport system is with public transport, not the road system. We acted back to front in the past, starting with the road system and later developing a transport policy. As a result of not doing the right thing, Dublin has ended up looking a bit like Los Angeles, a city to which there is no centre. The only difference is that people in Dublin do not have as many cars as the people in Los Angeles. If Transport 21 results in a different approach that gives priority to public transport for the first time, I welcome it, although it is a little late in the day to do so.However, I stress that I do not welcome the plan as such but the intention to put it into place. I presume that intention is real. It is real in terms of the commitment of the individuals involved, but the implementation of such plans does not seem to happen. I propose to give the Government the benefit of the doubt on this plan.I wish to make a criticism of the plan. If I understand it correctly, the intention is to create a single authority that will bring together all Dublin's transport development, whether that takes place by road or by the various means of public transport. We must welcome that, but it does not go far enough. To bring all the transport planning together while omitting consideration of land-use planning makes no sense. There is no point in joining-up part of the picture and leaving out one of the most important parts of it. I am at one with the Dublin city manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, who expressed himself forcefully on this point.For the past ten years we have made a dog's dinner of our transport planning. I had hoped to be able to welcome Transport 21 as a turn in a new direction, but unless we revisit the functions of the proposed Dublin Transportation Authority I fear this new effort will be as inappropriate to the real needs of the country as all previous attempts have been. The Minister will appreciate this is not a criticism of the plan but of our inability to put plans into effect. I wish the Minister well in doing that but I want to see determination on his part rather than simply being satisfied with the drawing up of the plan.

We under-invested in public transport in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and we are now playing catch up, although in the late 1990s we corrected that. We have come a long way but we have a long way to go. We have begun to learn from some of our past mistakes. I notice when I travel to Dublin every week that on the road from Carlow to Castledermot the ditches of the new motorway route have been removed as it is planned to commence such work next March or April. With this action the authorities have ensured that birds will not nest in the shrubbery and thereby cause a delay in the carrying out of the proposed work. I am encouraged when I see such activities and forward thinking.More road projects are coming in on time or ahead of schedule and on budget, which was not the case when I was member of the Joint Committee on Transport committee two years ago. That is encouraging and long may it continue. There are two ways to view projects that come in under budget. One is that it is good news and the other is to ask if those engaged in the project were wrong in their initial projections.I am cynical about this plan. The reaction of members of public to it was amazing. I listened to reaction to it in the form of text messages and e-mails on the "Five Seven Live" radio programme. Members of the public are cynical about it and no one can blame them for that. They hear of a ten year plan, a period that could span the life of three Governments and six Ministers having responsibility for this area with the added factor that we do not know what will happen over a period as long as ten years. A week is a long time in politics, therefore, ten years is an eternity. We do ourselves a disservice when we introduce a plan covering too long a period. We must prove to the electorate that politics is worth investing in and that politicians can deliver. We need to ensure we can deliver on projects. The challenge facing the Government is for it to deliver on the projects covered by this plan.I have received many complaints from landowners in counties Carlow and Kilkenny affected by the planned new motorway in term of CPOs to the effect that the NRA is difficult to deal with. The Minister should endeavour to ensure that the NRA deals sympathetically with landowners whose land is taken from them against their wishes. Everyone involved has complained that the landowners' plight is not dealt with sympathetically at the moment.Which sector is Waterford Regional Airport geared towards? It is on the wrong side of the city and does not serve the south east. I have grave reservations about further State investment in this airport because it does not represent value for money and is not being used by sufficient numbers of people. I previously raised the issue of the poor condition of approaches into train stations around the country, even from the perspective of tourism. Could the Minister discover how much land around train stations is owned by Iarnród Éireann and whether it can be redeveloped and cleaned up? The poor state of this land creates an adverse first impression for people arriving in towns.

The next ten years will be the most crucial in this country's infrastructural development. We have almost reached saturation point with regard to the number of cars on roads in Dublin. Certain Senators spoke about their own experience with Dublin traffic. It took me an hour and a half to travel the four and a half miles from Donaghmede to Drumcondra this morning. This morning was exceptional for no obvious reason.Transport 21 is farsighted, well planned and well researched. I remember the Dublin transportation initiative which led to the creation of the Dublin Transportation Office. At that time, I disagreed with the policy of excluding cars from the city centre. We now have long traffic queues, cars parked in streets around the city and a concomitant increase in vehicle emissions. Transport 21 is a holistic and comprehensive look at how we can tackle these problems. I welcome the commitments given regarding value for money in this initiative. These include various guides and fixed-price contracts which have been cost reviewed at the beginning and include inflation and risks.The plan contains provisions for more buses and quality bus corridors for Dublin. A total of 170 bus routes cater for over 500,000 people per day in Dublin. A Senator commented that Dublin Bus has not improved but I believe it has improved immensely. It has increased its transportation of commuters by 25% over the past six years. The Luas and DART systems are considerable successes. I welcome the news that the RPA has called on the Minister to introduce the railway order which will permit the extension of the Luas line to the Point Theatre. The extension of this line is crucial to this area of the city and will link with the proposed new train station there which will be part of the Navan line.The provision of park and ride facilities around Dublin city was part of the original plan, which would enable people living on the outskirts to park their cars and use public transport. I listened to Senator Norris's comments regarding the metro system. The late Rudi Monaghan, whom I knew very well, pushed for the creation of a metro system for a long time. A metro system is essential, particularly when one considers that such systems are the main form of transport in most capital cities in Europe and the rest of the world.The need for connectivity throughout the country comes across in the plan. A Senator commented that there was no timing or detail in the plan but it contains a considerable amount of detail regarding what will happen between 2006 and 2015. The plan also contains an element relating to the upgrading of roads between this country and Northern Ireland. It also provides for the upgrading of provisional bus services, roads and the rail network.Traffic problems in Dublin must be tackled. The Minister and the Minister of State have demonstrated great initiative in attempting to tackle some of the problems facing Dublin. The Clare Street initiative was one such project. I congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department on producing Transport 21.

It was the most important sentence in his speech. He stated that his Department would establish a monitoring committee to oversee Transport 21 and ensure it was implemented. There are many ideas and concepts in this plan but it is important to see that it is implemented. The Minister indicated that the monitoring committee would be chaired by his Department but I am not sure if this is the best course of action. The monitoring committee should be independent and involve representatives from the general public. There is no mention of any public user participation in the committee but I am sure there are organisations representing the general public, aside from Departments and State agencies, that could take part in it.I see Senator Coghlan wishes to speak. There is great affinity between Kerry and Clare so I will conclude and allow him to contribute.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-12-01 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I welcome the Minister of State to the House, as well as the opportunity to speak about Transport 21. I welcome this plan, which has variously been described as a rehash or, as Senator Quinn commented, a scaled-down version of previous plans. Senator Quinn was correct in calling for a total emphasis on public transport. This is particularly apt in Dublin because, as Senator Brady noted, the traffic situation here has reached saturation point. I welcome future developments regarding the Luas and the proposed metro system.My own county of Kerry is on the periphery and its residents are treated as second-class citizens with regard to transport. Both Senator Daly and I have a regard for the jewel in the crown of Kerry but trying to get tourists down to see it is difficult because they must frequently change trains at Mallow and board pre-war carriages. Could the Minister of State reveal when new and proper rolling stock will be introduced on the Cork-Tralee line?The so-called Atlantic corridor veers off at Limerick for Cork and does not go near Kerry or through Limerick. The worst national primary road in the country is that running from Ballyvorney to Macroom.

I do not doubt that it is the first of many debates we will have on this important initiative and the major projects included therein over the next ten years. The recurring message from many speakers related to implementation. Practically everyone welcomed the plan but asked about its implementation. I note Senator Quinn's comment about determination. Some speakers have alluded to the reaction that followed the announcement of Transport 21, some of which, disappointingly, was negative.In the days following the launch, and after the political points-scoring, I was proud to hear the political parties say that if in Government, they would implement the plan. When one studies Transport 21, one can see the amount of detail in it, the costings and the different approach in this plan as opposed to previous ones. My colleague, the Minister, the Government and myself assure Senators that we are determined to address one of the more serious issues in our community. We have addressed many other issues. When we took office, there were problems with high unemployment, housing, education and many other such issues. The majority of people will agree most of those issues have been addressed. However, the one issue on which we need to focus is transport and it is our intention to do so.Two key strategies underpin Transport 21, namely, the development of a high-quality national transport network with improved regional and local public transport networks and services, and the transformation of the transport network in the greater Dublin area. Senator Brady referred to integration and the need for particular programmes, such as the metro. I am particularly pleased of my role as Minister of State in regard to the projects for the greater Dublin area and, of course, nationally.As Senators will be aware, part of my delegated responsibilities as Minister of State in the Department include responsibility for traffic management in the greater Dublin area as well as in the provincial cities of Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford. In this regard, I am pleased to say Transport 21 makes substantial provision for investment in traffic management, such as quality bus corridors, green routes, park and ride, etc. A key objective of these measures is to help reduce congestion in the city of Dublin and the provisional cities through bus priority, car control and other traffic management measures. In turn, this will create improvements in the quality of public transport services with a view to creating the conditions for a modal shift from the private car to public transport. That modal shift can only occur if we have reliable, efficient and regular public service transport.In the greater Dublin area, Transport 21 will fund the construction of many new quality bus corridors, cycle paths, improved pedestrian facilities and traffic management support systems. The bulk of expenditure on traffic management measures in the greater Dublin area is earmarked for the delivery of QBCs designed to reduce the travel time for passengers, improved bus performance and improved quality of the bus transport experience. We want shorter commuting times. I was delighted Senator Brady had a 4.5 minute commute this morning. That is type of time within which I would like people to be able to commute.Since 1994, the Exchequer has funded bus priority and car control measures in the greater Dublin area. The timely and successful implementation of the quality bus network programme between 2006 and 2016 will result in a doubling of the length of the bus priority schemes throughout the region and will lead to further improvements in the quality, reliability and efficiency of the bus service.The provision of bus and rail-based park and ride facilities will make an important contribution to improved traffic management in Dublin. In this regard, I approved the DTO's strategy for rail-based park and ride facilities in the greater Dublin area. I also indicated that I wanted to ensure we considered bus-based park and ride facilities and that capital funding would be available for suitable projects, subject to compliance with the normal requirements for a business-based capital appraisal. Arrangements for park and ride funding will also extend to public transport interchange projects. However, revenue support to subsidised park and ride is not available at this stage.Two types of park and ride are envisaged, namely, strategic and local. A number of larger strategic sites will be identified close to or on the strategic rail corridors where longer distance commuters can transfer to public transport. Local park and ride sites will be smaller in scale and located along all the public transport corridors. Good examples of these types of sites are in the existing facilities with which I presume the Senators can identify.I turn to the provincial cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford where my Department has also funded the implementation of a range of traffic management, bus priority and car restraint measures since 2002. These include measures such as quality bus corridors, green routes, park and ride facilities, cycle paths and improved pedestrian facilities. I congratulate those cities for their work in this regard, in particular my colleague, Mr. Tim O'Sullivan, and his team in the traffic office.Cork is making significant improvements with the implementation of traffic management and bus priority measures under its Cork area strategic plan. A Senator asked why implementation of Transport 21 will take so long. Cork's plan will take 20 years to implement while Transport 21 will take ten. Cork's plan is tremendous and it has made considerable progress. The welcome aspect is that it will snowball and be even better as it rolls out because much thought and effort has gone into it. It has also already drawn down €20 million from my Department. We can learn from the success in Cork.Limerick, Galway and Waterford have also made significant progress and they have many good plans. I would say to those representing any of the cities mentioned or any of the provincial towns that if I can assist in any way to roll out plans, I would be happy to do so. I have met a number of city managers, directors of services for traffic and public representatives on these issues.I thank Senator Brady for mentioning my initiative, the Clare Street initiative. Following my appointment to the Department of Transport, I met a range of organisations and groups with a common interest in achieving improvements in traffic management in the capital. As a result of those discussions as well as my determination to make improvements, I actively explored the scope to progress the effective implementation of traffic management and related measures in Dublin in order to bring added value to major transport investments which are under way and planned. It culminated in the establishment of the CSI at the start of October. The initiative brings together all the relevant players in the greater Dublin area to consider how we can make things better in Dublin. In particular, the initiative will focus on the following: measures which have the capacity to make a material difference, whether large or small; measures which are capable of delivering rapid results; and measures which might not otherwise attract high priority in terms of implementation.Some 37 projects were tabled by members of the Clare Street initiative at its initial meeting held in Clontarf Castle on 5 October last. Workshops were held to consider the projects in detail and a short-list of projects was identified. This was real work in progress. Announcement of a final project list requires that the bodies identified as implementing agencies for individual projects confirm they are prepared to carry forward the projects. The process is currently in hand. When the implementing agencies have decided on the individual projects, the list will be formally announced. I am confident, based on the quality of people on board and on the initial work to date, that the Clare Street initiative can and will make a material difference to the way traffic flows in the Dublin area. I hope I will be able to roll out this model in the other provincial cities when we see it has worked well.Today is 1 December and the countdown to Christmas has well and truly started. Accordingly, I should mention Operation Freeflow, the purpose of which is to manage the increase in traffic flows in the capital which occur each year in the run up to Christmas and into the new year. I am pleased to indicate that all the agencies have come together for the first time this year. I have brought in players, including the car parks, transport providers, local authorities and State agencies such as the Garda Síochána, and asked that they give additional value this year. It is the first year in which all public transport services are running late night services. There is late night car parking and no charge for overnight car parking. There is a host of measures under Operation Freeflow and I encourage people to log onto the website at www.freeflow.ie.I take the opportunity to congratulate all those who have made a significant effort to ensure that people who wish to come to Dublin to visit friends, relatives, Santa Claus, go shopping or whatever else will have an enjoyable and pleasurable experience and that any traffic disruption to their journeys will be minimised to the benefit of everybody.I thank all speakers for their very kind and positive contributions on the bigger picture of Transport 21. I again invite Members to feel free to contact me or my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, or our Department at any time on any one of the issues.On a final note, I am pleased to say we will be able to give Members regular briefings as to progress. An interdepartmental monitoring committee will track progress in our long-term investment strategy in Transport 21.
