#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's investigation into the "Prime Time Investigates" programme on Fr. Kevin Reynolds revealed a shocking systemic failure that resulted in the undermining of a man's character and reputation.  This is a dramatic wake up call for everybody who believes in the value and importance of public sector broadcasting.  It appears from the report that not even the simplest norms were applied.  The Carragher report is good, clear and concise and RTE has undertaken to take its recommendations on board.  Many of the personnel involved are no longer working with the programme.  The board of RTE has assured the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that it will implement all the recommendations in the report and produce quarterly updates.  It has also undertaken to engage in a thorough review to assess the cultural and working environment and the prevalence of group-think at RTE.I welcome those initiatives, but more must be done.  In recent times there has been an intense interest in the media in general, in the role and importance of public sector broadcasting and in media ownership and the consequential interaction between the media and the political world.  The Leveson inquiry in the UK has been particularly revealing in that context.  Can Ireland be sure that some of the practices and activities that took place in other jurisdictions did not and could not occur here?  Notwithstanding the existence of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture, will the Taoiseach consider the establishment of a specific Oireachtas commission to work on these issues and to hold hearings, accept submissions from the public and interested parties and make recommendations to the Government?  These issues go to the core of democracy.  We are living in a rapidly changing world that is challenging the most basic assumptions we had about how democracies and societies operate or should operate.  It is important that the Oireachtas reflects on this and engages actively with these issues through the operation of such a commission.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1	First, it is worthwhile to note that the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, takes to heart the issue of public service broadcasting, what it means for our people and our democracy and the value of a true public service requirement in respect of broadcasting.  Second, this episode justifies the Minister's and Government's decision to have the Carragher report produced on what was an appalling situation in respect of an innocent person.The Minister had a straightforward, face-to-face meeting with the board yesterday and reported on the outcome of that meeting to the Cabinet.  The House will be aware that the board is to respond in writing within seven days as to its response to the recommendations of the Carragher report and what it intends to do to implement its findings.  The chairman spoke about this yesterday.  Members are also aware that significant changes have already been made since the broadcast of that programme.In respect of Deputy Martin's suggestion of a commission or committee to deal with the broader issues, the Oireachtas committee yesterday held a thorough and wide-ranging discussion about this.  There is no reason that a sub-committee of that committee cannot deal with these issues.  It would be entitled to hold hearings, as other sub-committees of Oireachtas committees have done, such as the sub-committee of the European Union affairs committee dealing with the fiscal treaty.  I do not see why that cannot happen.  This is in the interest of all our people and I will make that recommendation known to the chairman of the committee.It is a matter for the committee whether it decides to do that by way of a sub-committee, with the opportunity to hold hearings and conduct a thorough and comprehensive discussion about public service broadcasting, what it means and how the world of broadcasting has changed utterly in the last number of years through a communications capacity that was never dreamt of a number of years ago.  It is fundamentally important for our citizens and for their trust and belief in the quality of public service broadcasting.  The Deputy has made a constructive suggestion and I take it to heart.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank the Taoiseach for his response and for coming some distance with me on this matter.  I respectfully suggest the existing Oireachtas committee has too many issues on its agenda.  One issue with the existing Oireachtas committees is they are covering too many Departments and too many subject matters.  In this case, as the committee must consider natural resources, communications and agriculture, it is covering an enormous spectrum and, in my opinion, it in no way has the capacity to deal with the significant issues that must be reflected on and engaged with by the Oireachtas.  For example, the report of the advisory group on media mergers illustrated the dramatic changes that have occurred, through technology, to the broadcast and print media.  Howsoever the Oireachtas responds to this issue, the group established by it, be it a sub-committee, a separate group or as I have suggested, a commission, should have a status that befits the importance of the issue.  It also should be afforded the time, the backup and the resources to give comprehensive deliberation and treatment to this issue in the Oireachtas.This will be extremely important, given the nature of a fast-moving world, given what Members now know and given what has happened in other jurisdictions both in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  It also is important because regardless of whether one likes it, confidence in public sector broadcasting has been undermined.  I am a great believer in public sector broadcasting and passionately believe in it.  While I want it to hold forth into the future as an important pillar to our democracy, one cannot continue blindly in the face of the realities that have been revealed.  This demands a more sustained and serious response from the Oireachtas.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Deputy Martin is aware that during the previous Government's term of office, there were too many Oireachtas committees and Members on all sides were running from one committee meeting to the next.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	5	As the level of complaint indicated the ability to deal with issues in a real sense did not apply, the Government reduced the numbers of Oireachtas committees.  The changes that now are being made will mean the committee dealing with transport will be joined with the committee dealing with communications.  While I take the basis of the Deputy's suggestion as being constructive, it will be important for the committee itself to consider how best it might deal with this matter.  Rather than having an interminable discussion on this issue, I see no reason the committee cannot decide to set up its own sub-committee to deal specifically with these issues.  It could give it a remit of three months, during which time it could be supported and provided with backup to enable it to deal with hearings and a comprehensive range of the debate and then to report back to this House to have a full discussion here on the committee's recommendations, findings or proposals.  In fairness to the committee itself, however, it should be allowed to present its views here and were precedent to be followed, a thorough analysis and comprehensive discussion could take place, out of which could come a set of recommendations the House could consider in this Chamber.In the interest of public service broadcasting, in which the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has shown a deep interest-----

Sin an ceist.  He stated the national governments across Europe will be obliged to accept the delegation of fiscal sovereignty to some form of central authority.  The Taoiseach has indicated his desire to be the Taoiseach who retrieves Irish sovereignty and yet he agrees with handing over fiscal sovereignty to a European central authority.  As the Taoiseach is aware he cannot have it both ways, he should tell Members the reason he believes that decisions on tax increases, spending cuts or welfare rates should be made in Brussels or Berlin instead of in Ireland.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The Deputy is aware that he was associated, in one way or another, with an outfit that spent 30 years and the Border he sought to remove did not move a single inch.  The argument he has come up with this morning has been trotted out many times.  I have made no secret of the fact that I wish to lead the Government that will retrieve Ireland's economic sovereignty.  The way to do this is to get our own house in order, to provide an impetus and a stimulus that will provide jobs and opportunity, will allow our people to use their creativity to grow the economy, will use exports to generate more money for the country and therefore provide the opportunities for the people and for the next generation.  This is a difficult challenge and the Deputy is aware of the difference between what the Government spends and what it takes in and the challenges the Government and people face together in sorting this out.Since Ireland joined the European Union, we always have recognised there are issues that must be dealt with from a central perspective, be it the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy, the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds or social policy, in which Europe itself has contributed greatly to this country.  From this point of view, Ireland always has been both articulate and a strong advocate of the future direction of Europe, irrespective of what Government was in power.  As the question was asked of another of Sinn Féin's Members, how many referendums did the Deputy or his party support in respect of the European position over the past 30 years?
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The answer is zero.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	29	While Deputy Adams has not been in the House for the past 30 years, he now is an elected Member of the Dáil.  The road back to the retrieval of economic sovereignty for Ireland is to get out of the programme we are in, to put our own house in order, to use the expertise and creativity of our own people with the opportunity that Europe and beyond presents to retrieve that economic sovereignty, grow the economy and in consequence, provide opportunities for our people to live and work in Ireland, if they so wish.  The Government is and will continue to be focused on that area and I hope that on 31 May, the people will give a resounding "Yes" as a vote of confidence to that future, which is in everyone's interest.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I can only interpret the Taoiseach's answer as stating the way to get back economic sovereignty is to give it away.  That does not make sense.Does the Taoiseach remember the document I have to hand, namely, the famous five-point plan?  Yesterday, the Taoiseach told Members that he supported the growth agenda being advocated by the French President-elect.  Given that the Taoiseach is the poster boy for austerity and is the Taoiseach who refuses to ask for a write-down of our private debt, does he intend to return to this manifesto?  Does he intend to invest €7 billion in energy, communications and water?  Alternatively, perhaps the Government intends to implement the Labour Party's pre-election commitment to establish a strategic investment bank or perhaps it eventually will come round to listen to the sense of the Sinn Féin proposition, which is to take up to €7 billion, over three years, from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and from the European Investment Bank and to get people back to work in that way.  As the Taoiseach will not answer the earlier question and now is all in favour of getting people off the dole and back to work, he should indicate which of these plans he will advocate.  Will it be the Fine Gael manifesto, the Sinn Féin plan or that of the Labour Party?

However, it is on the political front that there has been a major game-changer, namely, what the establishment will regard as an inconvenient outbreak of democracy in Greece and simultaneously a vote in France which is epoch breaking.  The Greek people have voted against the austerity agenda and the French people have voted against the Merkozy agenda, which needs to be recognised in Ireland.  It was regrettably recognised by Chancellor Angela Merkel when in response to the election of President-elect Francois Hollande she stated as a fact that there would be no renegotiation of the fiscal treaty.As an Irishman, I believe the Taoiseach and I should resent that the German Chancellor has taken ownership of that treaty and assumes to speak for the people of Europe immediately after democracy has broken out in France.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	73	As the treaty is undoubtedly a creation of the Merkel-Sarkozy agenda and as, thankfully, President Sarkozy is now confined to the political wilderness, will the Taoiseach acknowledge that what comes out of the summit on 23 May, which has just been called in recognition of Francois Hollande's election to the Presidency and will be held only eight days prior to the holding of the referendum on the treaty here, will have a material effect on the treaty and, therefore, on the referendum?  Will he go to that summit willing to consider the Hollande agenda as against the Merkel agenda and will he be flexible about the date for the referendum on the treaty because of the important facts that will emerge from that summit?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	87	The decision of the French people is a matter for them just as the decision of the Greek people is a matter for them.  Their process of democracy is now being followed through with members of the once minority parties now being asked to form a Government.  That is their process and it must be followed through.  It may well be that they can form a Government.  If not, they have a specific process in place there.Many economists, including Deputy Ross, offer views about growth rates and where our country is headed.  It is interesting to note that the growth rates for the eurozone and European Union are very much behind the international forecast of 0.7% growth for Ireland for this year, which is significant in its own right.  What we have been saying for some time is that there should be a balancing of the books here and a utilisation of the opportunity, through Government decision and international agreements, to grow our economy and provide many jobs in the future.I spoke this morning to President-elect Hollande and congratulated him on his victory in the presidential elections in France.  We had a good conversation.  President-elect Hollande is sensitive to and cognisant of Ireland's concerns and is aware that our people will vote by way of referendum on 31 May on the text of the treaty as signed on 2 March 2012 and agreed by 25 countries.  The President-elect fully understands and respects this.  We had a good conversation about growth and reorientation of the European agenda towards a strong growth future, in addition to what has already been agreed.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I look forward to meeting the President on 23 May when Ireland will, through me, contribute vigorously to this proposition.  I reminded the President-elect that I had noted his comments on the ESM in regard to good budgetary discipline and the need for a growth agenda in Europe, which has been replicated in contributions from Ireland and a number of other countries during the past number of months.I am pleased that President Von Rompuy made the decision to hold a European Summit on growth on 23 May.  I see that as being one of a number of meetings at which leaders will discuss the propositions that could lead to growth.  I also expect that proposals for decision will be put forward at the June meeting.  In regard to Ireland, there are particular areas where a growth agenda would lead to Ireland leading in a number of areas, be it the digital market in terms of copyright, where we have a unique position gained to date.As I stated, I had a good conversation with the President-elect and look forward to meeting him on 23 May.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I cannot say I disagree with anything the Taoiseach said because he said nothing, but I would like him to recognise that these summits, to which he referred, are important and that what comes out of them is important.  They are relevant to the treaty he is urging us to vote on.  He talks about growth and the growth agreement but if there is no change to the treaty and if there is a growth agreement or a compact for growth, which is dependent on the treaty or vice versa, he will be asking us to vote in a vacuum on 31 May.The game has changed in Europe; let us recognise that.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	92	A question please.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	93	What François Hollande has said is that he will not sign the treaty as is - that is definite - and that he will renegotiate it or that he will not sign the treaty until a growth compact is agreed.  I ask the Taoiseach once again to recognise the conditionality of this.

A momentous decision was made yesterday by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and good luck to him.  I hope Deputy Ross does not build up his decision on voting "Yes" or "No" into such a big thing.What the French President-elect said was that he would not ratify the treaty until a strong growth agenda was produced in addition to what has already been agreed.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	100	As I said, we have already welcomed the statements by the French President-elect in respect of the development of that growth agenda and the reorientation of Europe towards a growth agenda.  He fully respects and understands the Irish situation.  He has no intention of interfering in any way with the decision to be made by the Irish people on 31 May in respect of the text of the treaty, as signed and agreed by the 25 countries.The development of an additional growth agenda will take some time beyond May, through June.  Obviously, part of that discussion will take place on 23 May.  We strongly support the development of such a growth agenda.  Why would we not?  Is it not in the interests of our people and our country which exports so much of what it produces?  It is in our economy's interest that other economies grow and are able to buy the produce, products and services we produce.  That agenda of growth and development, in addition to what has already been agreed, will take some time to evolve because other leaders in other countries will have their views.  I am very glad to see that the start of the process will take place on 23 May and I look forward to meeting President Hollande on that occasion.  Deputy Ross might tell us before the week is out where he stands on this treaty.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I think the Taoiseach will accept that the situation of elderly people and senior citizens is very important as is their need for security and certainty in terms of the provision of care.  There has been much concern around the fair deal scheme.  The Minister responsible announced that a fundamental review and a legislative review are taking place in regard to the fair deal scheme and providing for the elderly.  The demographics are heading in one direction so there is an urgency attached to this.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House when that review will be completed and when legislation will come before the House in regard to it?Given that the management of the national lottery is up for sale, when will the regulation of lobbying Bill will be introduced?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	104	In regard to the national lottery, I think that will be later this year or early next year.  A great deal of work is under way with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I will come back to the Deputy with a more detailed response as I will in respect of the review of the fair deal scheme which is an important issue and of concern to a great number of people.  I will ask the Minister for Health to respond directly to Deputy Martin.

When does the Taoiseach expect the HSE governance Bill to come before the Dáil?  He will know there are plans for the wholesale reduction of services across most sectors, or perhaps all sectors, of our health care system and a proposition to close up to 900 public nursing home beds.  There is much distress in the community and a sense of drift.  It would be very useful to have some sense of when the HSE governance Bill will be discussed here.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	106	The HSE governance Bill will be taken later in this session.

I do not have a date for the regulation of lobbying Bill but I will get him a better fix on it.

It is part of the consumer and competition Bill which, as I understand, will not be before the House until late in the year.

As the Taoiseach knows, all community groups are registered companies with limited liabilities which means they are subject to audit.  I asked the Minister previously to examine the feasibility of setting up a scheme through the community and voluntary forum whereby communities groups would be able to access audit under a competitive pricing structure.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	112	You are rambling a bit, Deputy.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Given the fact that the Government's main focus is on economic recovery and job creation, when can we expect the collective investment schemes consolidation Bill to be introduced in the House?  Rural capitals such as Longford and Mullingar seem neglected as far as job creation is concerned.  There is a deficit and little investment has been made in those towns since the Government took office.  I would like a more balanced level of development across the country.  Jobs have been announced for Dublin, Galway, Cork and the other main population centres, but I want fair play to be dished out to rural areas like Longford, Mullingar and their respective counties.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I am sure the Deputy could raise that matter with his parliamentary party.

That is why the jobs action plan is being pursued by the Government for small towns and locations around the country.  Decisions made by multinationals are their choices.  One cannot direct them.  The collective investment Bill that Deputy Bannon referred to is due for later on in the year.

At what stage is it and will the Taoiseach assure the House that the Bill will be published before the summer recess?  If we do not see the adoption legislation, it does not give much heart to the prospect of seeing the children's referendum at the end of the year.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	130	When the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, was appointed, there had been no work at all done in respect of the adoption Bill.  A great deal of that has now been completed.  The Minister will expect to publish the adoption Bill along with the legislation in regard to the referendum.  I was speaking to Deputy Martin about that yesterday.  Hopefully, we can do this as a single entity referendum in the autumn.

It has been promised for some time.  I realise there is a heavy legislative schedule, but this is one Bill that is urgently required and I would be grateful if the Taoiseach would indicate to the House the progress to date in the determination of the heads of the Bill.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I can confirm for Deputy Durkan that the heads of that Bill were cleared by Government at the end of February.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Across the Union, people are gathering today to mark the 62nd anniversary of Robert Schuman's declaration in Paris.  It is an important opportunity to step back from the detail of the day-to-day and to remind ourselves of the big picture, how much Europe has invested in its Union and how much we have achieved and gained together as a result.In setting out his plan for a supranational entity to oversee French and German steel and coal production, Schuman was working to make future war between these two ancient enemies not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible.  That was his immediate goal, but he knew that he was doing much more than that.  He saw his plan as the foundation stone of an economic union open to all countries that agreed to be bound by it.  Schuman, like many, lived through Europe's darkest hour.  Unlike most, he saw a light at the end of it.  He thought big and he aimed high.  He was a pragmatic and sensible man as well.  He knew that this new Europe would not be made, as he said, "all at once, or according to a single plan".  It would proceed in its imperfect way over the years.  How right he was.  He knew the value of enduring qualities such as perseverance, co-operation and hope and how much it would be the working together as much as the texts and the treaties that would bind the people of Europe together in a spirit of peace and in mutual respect.Joining the Union, or the Community as it was at the time, threw the windows open in this country, letting the winds of change blow through.  It transformed our economics and our social policy.  It transformed the lives of our women and brought high standards to our workplaces.  It modernised our industry and reversed the decline in our agriculture, keeping people on the land and enabling them to make a decent living.  It allowed us to escape the narrow confines of our history, normalising relations with our nearest neighbour, and brought us to a point where Ireland is now among the most open trading economies in the world.  Pooling our sovereignty with partners has not been about what we have lost, but about everything we have gained and everything we have achieved together.That journey is far from over.  As we celebrate Europe Day, Schuman's vision finds itself under more pressure than ever before.  Europe again finds itself in a low and difficult place.  The crisis that has gripped us is back in sharp focus and stark choices continue to confront some of its member states, none more so than beleaguered Greece.  In keeping with the spirit of Schuman, it is a time for looking forward and for laying plans.  It is a time not for despair and despondency, but for renewal and reform.Yes, Europe has struggled in recent years, but even in the most challenging of circumstances it has prevailed.  We have moved from offering partners in difficulty ad hoc assistance to putting a permanent mechanism of support in place.  Our commitment to each other has been strengthened and underpinned.  We have made our rules more robust and their application more certain.  We have stabilised our banks and have underpinned them so that they will not threaten Europe’s economy in the future.  Through the new stability treaty that I hope Ireland will decide to ratify at the end of the month, we have put in place a framework for the future, ensuring that our common currency is underwritten by the rules it needs to ensure its ongoing stability.We are entering a new and exciting phase.  There is a shared acceptance that discipline is not enough and that we must now all dedicate the same energy to policies that will deliver growth and jobs, particularly for our young people.  At our next meeting of the European Council on 23 May, we will seek to turn that commitment to real and practical effect.  Ireland will be a full and active participant in this debate, especially when we take the chair as President at the start of next year.This country is recovering.  We are a resolute and pragmatic people looking forward to standing on our own feet again.  We are dedicated to doing what is necessary to restore confidence in us and to return to strong and steady growth.  Despite our hard work, our energy, our determination and our hope, however, there will be no Irish recovery without a recovery in Europe.  There will be no recovery in Europe without growth.  There will be no growth in Europe without conviction, leadership and courage.On this day when we pay tribute to the Union's founding fathers, I send out a challenge to its current leaders.  Let us take heart from what they achieved.  Let us offer the same vision and leadership in our time.  Let us be inspired as they were.  Let us see the serious challenges that Europe faces today as the springboard to a new and brighter Union.  Let us have the courage to do what needs to be done, however seemingly difficult the task.  Forty years ago tomorrow, the Irish people voted overwhelmingly to join the European Community.  We have the opportunity to strike a blow for our country's future again on 31 May.  Above all, let us never stop thinking about the big picture, which this country can be a part of through the Union.

Facing adversity united and strengthened is nothing at all new for the European project.  It is what we have done since the Union's foundation.  Despite many predictions of doom or imminent downfall, including from within this House, Europe has weathered many ups and downs, building post-war economic recovery, surviving the oil crises, celebrating the post-communist reunification of Europe and enduring the current economic and financial crisis.  Throughout, Europe has shown time and again that it is a vital part of any durable solution.Working together, the EU and its member states have shaped a more positive future, be it through representation at key international negotiations on trade, economics or environmental issues.  When Europe speaks with one coherent voice, the rest of the world listens.  Ireland has tried isolationism and it was a dismal failure.  Its effects were stifling not just in terms of our economy but also in terms of our society.  This is something we must not allow to happen again.I believe fundamentally that our membership of the European Union over the past 40 years has enabled Ireland to find her voice in our Continent and in the world.  It has allowed us to become the diversified trading nation we are today through an internal Single Market of more than 500 million people and the negotiation of trade deals with third countries.  This ability to export will drive our recovery.  Similarly, the past four decades have witnessed a welcome opening up of Irish society.  Whether on the rights of women, consumer welfare or environmental protection, our EU membership has served as the critical catalyst for change and progress.  The impact of our EU membership on Ireland's social development is arguably even more of a recognisable legacy than the many positive evolutions which have marked our economic progress since 1973.The immediate challenge facing Ireland and Europe is the continuing economic and financial crisis.  Since coming to office 15 months ago, this Government has taken decisive steps to get Ireland back on a path to regaining our economic sovereignty by re-capitalising and restructuring of our banking sector; bringing order to the public finances; introducing a range of measures aimed at restoring economic growth and getting our people back to work; and rebuilding our international reputation.  In each of these areas we have worked closely and constructively with our EU and international partners.  The progress has been hard won but it is now recognised internationally, especially within the financial markets.What Ireland and Europe now need is stability for our economies and, particularly, for our currency.  The instability which we have witnessed since the outset of the crisis has been detrimental to investment and bad for jobs.  The stability treaty on which our people will vote on 31 May represents an important element in our efforts to restore stability to Europe and the euro.  This is our euro.  It is our currency.  Nobody in this Government has suggested that the treaty represents the whole story.  This treaty is a necessary but not sufficient component of the response.  The ratification and subsequent implementation of the treaty will present us with a golden opportunity to ensure that all member states deliver on their commitments.  This will go a long way towards restoring stability to Ireland and Europe.However, the sensible budgeting regime which the treaty codifies is only part of the solution,  The key additional step which this Government has been vocally advocating at European level for many months is growth.  We need sustainable growth for a true return to stability.  Similarly, however, stability is the essential foundation on which to build growth and job creation.  Stability and growth are two sides of the same coin.  They should be understood as complementary rather than alternatives.  I warmly welcome the renewed focus which is now being placed on the growth and jobs agenda and was pleased to congratulate French President-elect Hollande at the weekend.  We look forward to working urgently with partners on this agenda and the Taoiseach will do this when he attends an informal meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 23 May.  Growth will be at the top of the agenda.There is no contradiction between an approach which seeks stability and one which works to ensure growth.  That is an entirely consistent approach, and one which this Government shares.  I look forward to Ireland taking another important step on the road to recovery on 31 May, with a clear signal that wewill continue to support stability and growth for our own country, for the euro area and for the European Union.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Over the years there has been little substance to Europe day in Ireland or elsewhere.  It is not a public holiday and it is mostly marked by the institutions of the European Union.  This is a shame because the great achievements of the Union deserve to be recognised.  By agreeing to work together, the nations of Europe made a decisive move to overcome a history of devastating conflict and deep poverty.  Even in the middle of a profound economic crisis, much of the progress the Union has enabled remains in place.  We must focus on the crisis in hand but the only way forward is to start by recognising that the European Union is worth working to reform.  At its best Europe has worked because it focused on the core goal of enabling the growth which could create jobs and raise living conditions.  Those on the extreme right and left have spent decades attacking the Union as a conspiracy against the people when in fact it has been the vital factor in facing down vested interests on behalf of the people.  With rising unemployment and deep deficits, public confidence in all forms of institutions has fallen.  Polls show is that citizens are highly critical of developments in the Union but they have not given up hope.  It remains the place where they believe the big solutions to the recession can be found.Unfortunately, last year saw the leaders of Europe systematically fail in their duty to show resolve and ambition in overcoming this crisis.  Where swift action was required they kept kicking the can down the road.  Where new policies were needed they kept trying to make failed ones work.  Where co-operation was essential they descended into petty squabbles.  Thankfully, we appear to have reached a moment where a new approach is underway.The agreement on the stability treaty did not solve the economic crisis but it appears to have significantly moved the debate about what must be done.  Growth measures which were ignored last year are now being proposed with great urgency.  Last week the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Olli Rehn, spoke about the need to address investment for growth.  Other leaders have backed this up and, most significantly, François Hollande has made new growth measures the centrepiece of his policy.  They recognise that fiscal controls in individual countries have to be matched with central growth measures.  Incorporating the existing rules into a stronger treaty is a useful means of restoring confidence in basic budget discipline incorporating, as is the establishment of a legally solid basis for creating a permanent fund to help countries in need.  These are vital first steps.On 23 May Europe needs its leaders to formally signal that extra growth measures will be agreed in the coming months.  If these are significant new changes, particularly in respect of the mandate of the European Central Bank, a new treaty will be required.  It will not be possible to simply add such important changes to the stability treaty because that treaty is between 25 member states whereas the entire membership of 27 must agree bigger changes.I hope the statements by  the Taoiseach and Tánaiste over the past several days signal the end of their reserved and timid approach to European growth measures.  Neither of them has undertaken a programme of bilateral contacts with other EU states and Ireland's negotiating position seems to be that we will support anything as long as it does not require a full EU treaty.  Next January the Government takes over the Presidency of the European Council with a strong team of officials and a record of Ireland running consistently excellent Presidencies.  It needs to abandon the way it focuses European policy on the domestic media rather than our EU partners.  The most effective way to prepare for the Presidency is for Ireland to start taking an active role in pushing ambitious measures to support growth and job creation Europe.The Taoiseach and Tánaiste should stop talking about diplomatic initiatives and actually launch one.  During the rest of this year the Union must focus on investment and growth supporting reforms.  These cannot be the usual small-scale reform dressed up as major initiative.  If this happens, Ireland's Presidency may see an about-turn in Europe's fortunes but if it does not we may face an even more serious crisis.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the many challenges which confront citizens of the EU at this time.  Many of these challenges arise out of the economic crisis and the policies of austerity being pursued by conservative governments across Europe, including our own.  Sinn Féin believes that Ireland's place is in Europe and that resolving these difficulties requires co-operation with our European partners.The big question is the democratic one of what kind of EU do we want.  Sinn Féin wants a social European Union and the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013 provides this State with an opportunity to steer Europe towards this goal.  That requires us to abandon the austerity policies supported by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, which are leading Europe in the wrong direction.Austerity has failed.  Deficits are rising rather than falling, there have been deep cuts to public services, taxes are increasing and 16 million people across the EU are now unemployed.  In national elections in France and Greece and in local elections in Italy, Germany and Britain, electorates have taken a stand against these failed policies.  The referendum on 31 May provides Irish citizens with an opportunity to join this growing European-wide movement that is demanding an end to austerity as well investment in jobs and growth.It is telling that it took the French President-elect to put these issues on the political agenda.  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Tánaiste did it and now the Government is tripping over itself to join the growth bandwagon.  A strong "No" vote will ensure that this goes beyond rhetoric and will strengthen the hand of all those who genuinely oppose austerity.  It would also be a rejection of a Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil agreement to hand over fiscal sovereignty to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats.  If these parties have their way key fiscal decisions affecting Irish citizens will be made in future in Brussels and Strasbourg - not the Oireachtas.  This was spelled out by Mario Draghi last week.  Do Irish citizens want to be a province of a European super-state where technocrats take decisions with no accountability?The fiscal treaty also fails to deal with some of the major problems facing economies at this time.  It ignores the debt crisis and does nothing to tackle the jobs crisis.  Instead it will mean more cuts and bank bailouts.  The reality is that imposing deep cuts to public services, reducing wages and welfare payments, and imposing new taxes on low and middle-income families in a recession makes the recession worse.There is an alternative which we have set out and which I commend to the Taoiseach.  Getting people off the dole and back to work needs to be prioritised.  How can we do this?  There is an urgent need to increase the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank to stimulate activity in the real economy; cleanse the European banking system of toxic debts; introduce debt-restructuring agreements involving debt write-downs for heavily indebted states; and end the obligation on the State to pay the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note and unguaranteed senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and other banks.  Sinn Féin has also set out in successive budget submissions how we would close the deficit and fund the State while putting public finances back on a sustainable footing in a socially sustainable and equitable way.  This includes paying the wages of nurses, teachers and gardaí and providing decent front-line services.  The Government has yet to tell citizens how it will pay for a treaty that will cost a further €6 billion in cuts to implement.The opportunity to make a decisive change lies before us.  The question is whether the Government is up to the challenges this entails.  On 31 May citizens here will have the opportunity to guide the Government and give it direction.  Sinn Féin is calling for a "No" vote - no to austerity and "Yes" for investment and jobs.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Facing into Ireland's Presidency the key issue facing the people of this country and those across Europe is what kind of Europe we will have and what the Government will do to shape the future direction of Europe.  The answer to the question as to what kind of Europe we should have is that we should have the sort of Europe the people want.  In recent days we have got very clear messages from the citizens of Europe about what sort of Europe they want.  In France, Greece, Holland and Austria and with mass protests in countries such as Spain and Portugal the message from the people of Europe is unmistakable.  They are saying that they want an end to a Europe which is characterised by brutal austerity being inflicted on ordinary families and citizens in order to bail out banks and speculators.  They want a Europe which prioritises jobs, economic growth, fairness and a decent standard of living for all.  They want a people's Europe.  Sadly all the evidence coming from the Government, Chancellor Merkel and the Government's new best pals in Fianna Fáil indicates that they are hell-bent on continuing to cling to the failed policies and the failed agenda for Europe that has led us to the catastrophic crisis that Europe now faces.  They are hell-bent on continuing to cling to the discredited policy of bailing out banks and speculators at all costs and at the expense of the welfare, jobs and hopes of ordinary citizens, sacrificing those things on the altar of banks and profit-hungry financial markets.Whatever fine words and high-flung rhetoric the Government may use in the run-in to or during the Presidency, its real agenda for Europe is contained in its commitment to the austerity treaty.  Under pressure from the people of Europe and the citizens of this country, it can repeat the words "growth" and "jobs" all it likes, but simply saying those words does not create jobs or growth.  A commitment to the fiscal austerity treaty is incompatible with any serious commitment to creating jobs and promoting growth in this country or across Europe.  All the evidence is clear on that matter.  The impact of austerity over the past four years has been disastrous and has failed to produce anything but greater levels of unemployment and deeper economic stagnation and recession.  It has had precisely that effect in this country.  At what point will the Taoiseach acknowledge that?The Taoiseach has accused us of fantasy economics in opposing the fiscal treaty and tried to claim that it is the Government that is being realistic and pragmatic.  However, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council - set up by the IMF and not a left-wing think tank - has set out clearly the figures showing what will be required to meet the debt and deficit targets over the coming years.  Those figures make it clear that the Government would need to inflict a brutal level of cuts - billions of euro of cuts - for years if we sign up to this treaty.  An alarming graph in the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's recent report shows what would happen if we miss our growth targets by even 1%.  It shows the Government would need to ratchet up the level of cuts from €8.6 billion over the next three years to more than €13 billion and all the signs are that the Government's growth projection targets will be missed by a very significant amount and are being downgraded.  Will the Government continue down a failed road or will it recognise what the people of Europe and this country want, which is to change tack, end the austerity agenda and put the jobs and welfare of citizens first?

The Presidency is a responsibility imposed on all member states in rotation to manage the business of the Union for six months.  It is one of the tangible demonstrations of the equality of each member state, regardless of size or wealth.  It is a responsibility that Ireland has discharged with distinction on six previous occasions and our ambition must be to do no less this time around.Managing the Presidency will present many challenges, particularly at a time when resources are tight.  The day-to-day management of the EU agenda has become more complex with the expansion of the Union to 27 member states and with the new institutional arrangements introduced under the Lisbon treaty.At the same time, the Presidency presents a unique opportunity, particularly now at a time of crisis.  In our past presidencies, we won a reputation for managing the business of the Union in an efficient, impartial and effective manner.  We have the chance again to demonstrate that can-do attitude to our partners and to show that Ireland is fully back in business.  In our Presidency we also have the opportunity to shape and define policies that can have a beneficial impact on the lives of millions of our fellow citizens in Ireland and also across the EU.  This is why I urge Members of the Oireachtas to share through the various sectoral committees their views on Ireland's Presidency objectives.  Earlier this year I met a range of NGOs and civil society bodies and encouraged them to use this opportunity to contribute to Ireland's Presidency agenda and I have been extremely impressed by the ideas and proposals that have emerged from this process.Next year is to be officially designated as the European Year of Citizens, and our Presidency will coincide with the 40th anniversary of Ireland's accession to the EU in 1973.  I would like to see our Presidency as an opportunity to reflect on what it means to be a citizen of the Union and on the changes that Irish society has experienced over the past four decades.  Many will recall the benefits that have flowed from our accession to the EEC in 1973, but I am concerned that a newer generation does not take them for granted, whether it is a fairer society for each and every citizen, a cleaner environment, or the right to work, study and live in 26 other states, not to mention the significant labour rights introduced due to our membership and the immense strides in the area of equality and women's rights throughout the European Union, particularly in Ireland.I would also like next year to be an opportunity not only to consider the benefits of our membership, but also to think about Ireland's place in Europe and our contribution to its future.  We have often thought only of Europe in terms of what resources we can get from it, through the CAP, cohesion funding, Structural Funds and so on.  However, we have responsibilities as members of the Union and it is not good enough for us to sit back and wait for others to decide on future positions, the future policy agenda and the future shape of the Union.  That is for us to do too.  We have a responsibility as a member state.The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have already outlined some of the main themes of our Presidency that have emerged at this stage of planning.  Defining the Presidency programme is an evolving process.  Over the coming months, we will work closely with our partners as we refine the programme and we will also be mindful of the progress made by Denmark, which currently holds the Presidency, and Cyprus which will follow from July.Work is also proceeding on co-ordinating calendars and arrangements for the hundreds of meetings that will take place in Ireland, Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg during the Presidency.  In the light of our current circumstances, we aim to run an efficient but cost-effective Presidency.  As part of our strategy to contain costs, we will hold many Presidency events in a single State-owned venue, Dublin Castle.  Work is also ongoing to develop the Presidency website -  eu2013.ie - which will be, for many, the main contact with the Presidency next year.  In addition to providing detailed news and information on the Presidency, we will use the website to provide information about Ireland and to promote tourism to Ireland and Irish goods and services.I also initiated a working group to focus on ways to maximise the promotional opportunities presented by the Presidency.  This brings together the main State agencies as well as other stakeholders.  I also co-chair a group with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht which is assessing how the Presidency can be used to promote Irish culture internationally and to develop cultural events in Ireland to mark the Presidency.  We will be under an increased focus next year from the international media and from other states which will be carefully assessing how we perform.  We must use to demonstrate our capabilities and strengths as a nation.Strengthening Oireachtas engagement in EU affairs is a key priority of the Government.  This priority is part of the terms of reference of the Interdepartmental Committee on EU Engagement, which was established earlier this year by Government decision and which I chair.   At the core of the issue of Oireachtas engagement is the relationship between the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Other countries, most notably the German federal government and its parliament, have agreed formal co-operation agreements with regard to EU matters.  These agreements outline the respective commitments between government and parliament such as, for example, in relation to constructive dialogue and flow of information.  I believe that such an agreement in an Irish context would be a powerful symbolic statement of our commitment to transparent and accountable EU decision-making, in the spirit of the Lisbon treaty.  The agreement would operate within the current legislative parameters, in that it would build upon the current arrangements in place under the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 and would underpin the commitments on European Union matters in the programme for government, such as the appearance of Ministers before Oireachtas committees to discuss the agendas of upcoming EU Council meetings.I intend to invite the Ceann Comhairle to nominate officials from the Houses of the Oireachtas service to engage in discussions with my officials with a view to developing such an agreement in the coming months in the lead-in to Ireland's 2013 Presidency of the EU.  I am proud to represent Ireland as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs during the Irish Presidency and look forward to using the Presidency to strengthen Ireland's standing abroad.  I look forward to a constructive debate here and to hearing the contributions of both government and opposition parties and to an engaging question and answer session.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I wish the Minister of State well in the task that lies ahead.  While it is a great privilege to take part in this debate, I am disappointed that we are engaged in a debate that will only last 95 minutes and which only allows five minutes to each spokesperson.  The Minister of State attracted considerable praise and commendation last year for her work organising a Europe day that was far more effective and engaging, as it included having a Commissioner and Members of the European Parliament here, which made Europe day far more meaningful.  It is a pity at a time we all admit Europe is central to the political and personal discourse of the Irish people, that is not what we are having today.It is impossible to talk about next year's Presidency of the Union without addressing the urgent issues facing Europe today.  The economic crisis facing the members of the Union is so deep that it will certainly not be over by next January.  In fact, it is highly likely that charting a way out of the crisis will remain the dominant issue on the agenda for some considerable time.  Fianna Fáil has argued consistently since early last year that Ireland needed to actively push growth measures on the agenda of the Union.   Unfortunately, the only initiative which was taken in the Government's first year was to sign letters drafted by other countries which asked for the faster implementation of measures already agreed.  If one looks at the Taoiseach's statements after Council meetings, one finds a pattern of exaggerating agreements which consistently ignored the need for action.  Ireland did not table a single growth or employment creating measure during the negotiation of the stability treaty.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste did not arrange the tour of capitals of the type normally expected, but why they have taken this hands-off approach remains unclear.Thankfully, the Government has finally indicated that it supports the growing consensus throughout the Union for the more ambitious measures needed now.  On 23 May there will be a chance for the Taoiseach to support Mr. Hollande's agenda for urgent action on growth, including changes to the European treaties.  Ireland should specifically call for action on three key areas: agreement to a formal negotiation on the role and mandate of the ECB; a major increase in funding for the European Investment Bank, which would be concentrated onemployment-intensive projects in states with high unemployment; and an increase in Structural Funds for regions with high unemployment, to include both an overall increase and a reprioritisation of funding between countries.  As my party has laid out in great detail, a range of other important changes is required but these are ones that should be tackled in the next few months.  If leaders want to show they are serious they will do so.  These are measures that can help growth and, at the same time, restore the confidence which states need in order to raise money to fund their public services.  Ireland has held the Presidency of the Council at very sensitive times in the past so next year does not present a unique challenge.  Time and again, Ireland has proven to be among the most competent and effective holders of the Council Presidency, and I expect no less from the Minister of State and her colleagues.  The 2004 Presidency remains one of the most successful in the history of the European Union.  During the first six months of 2004 Ireland brought to a conclusion a series of negotiations which most commentators thought were doomed.  On top of negotiating a complex treaty, dealing with a new budget and agreeing a new Commission, Ireland ensured that the largest enlargement in the EU’s history was concluded flawlessly.One of the most disappointing parts of this Government's approach to European issues has been the way in which it has brought a partisan approach to a previously bipartisan area.  Until forced by circumstances there was no effort to respect the tradition of positive consultation with other pro-Europe parties in this country.  Also ignored were constructive warnings about rushing the referendum.  For most of last year, the primary effort was to talk down Ireland's status so that the Government could claim to have resurrected it overnight.  Ireland's last Presidency shows up this petty approach for what it is.  The fact that every state in Europe agreed to nominate Ireland to chair the OSCE is further proof that our diplomatic standing has always remained high, in terms of both our administrative and political activities.In terms of the ministerial councils, our Ministers will be expected to play a leading role.  I have no doubt that we will carry out this Presidency with great professionalism and will move the agenda forward in a number of important areas, the biggest reason being our excellent diplomatic corps and the preparations which have been under way for the last few years.  In terms of the sectoral councils, we believe that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine should use this area as an opportunity to try to change the long-term debate on the Common Agricultural Policy.  For too long the debate has been about trying to reduce the CAP in favour of other areas.  This zero-sum game has led to a constant insecurity about the CAP, which is a vital support both for rural communities and for ensuring a secure, safe food supply.  It should be praised, not attacked.  We need to start arguing for an increase in the overall EU budget rather than accept the constant rearguard fight to protect the CAP.Is the Ceann Comhairle telling me I have little time left?

I offer the Government and its Ministers every good wish as they take on the Presidency of the EU.  We are doing so at a very troubled time not only in the economic affairs of Europe, but also in its democratic affairs.  We have to persuade the member states there is a better way to deal with the problems of both Ireland and of Europe during our Presidency.I will spend most of my five minutes talking about agriculture because that is my brief but will also speak, briefly, on a number of wider issues.  On agriculture, Ireland's Presidency, which begins next January, provides a big opportunity to gain agreement on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  None of us underestimates the importance of Irish agriculture to the economy.  It provides jobs not only through actual farming, but through manufacturing, food processing, transport - so many different areas.  It is a vital industry and it is of vital importance that Ireland gets a good deal from the CAP negotiations.  Ireland's Presidency should be used to encourage debate on reform and to push our agenda on this issue.  From listening to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, I have no doubt he will push it along.However, there are some very clear warning signs in this regard.  The current economic crisis gripping Europe, coupled with the crippling austerity measures being imposed throughout the EU member states, may see a delay in the agreeing of the overall EU budget, the progressing of the CAP reform talks and the reaching of agreement on the CAP budget.  The CAP negotiations are likely to be very divisive because each member state will push for an agreement that best suits its economy.  We need to position ourselves and work with the other member states, particularly during the Presidency, to ensure we have as many friends as possible who understand Ireland's position in regard to CAP reform and the overall CAP budget.  That is why it is essential that as much progress as possible on CAP reform is made during Ireland's Presidency.During the CAP negotiations it is also important there is a close working relationship between the Ministers for Agriculture in both the Twenty-six and the Six Counties.  We have a shared future in agriculture between North and South which must be developed and exploited.  It is important that both Departments work together to further the shared goals of farmers on an all-island basis.  There are very many mutual benefits to be gained for farmers in the Six and the Twenty-six Counties and the Ministers' role in the talks must reflect this.  We encourage very close working relations with the Department of Agriculture in the Six Counties.On a wider note, the European Union is increasingly becoming a less democratic, more centralised and autocratic union of states.  The move towards autocracy will accelerate if the austerity treaty is passed in its current form on 31 May.  Unelected and unaccountable officials will be able to determine the levels of income, taxation and public services available to citizens of Ireland and the other EU states.  This move towards centralisation must be resisted during Ireland's Presidency of the Union.  I say to the Minister of State I am not encouraged by some of the statements issued so far to think the Government will take this role, which I believe is necessary, not only for Ireland but for all EU member states.It is time for Ireland to take an assertive stand in its relationship with Europe.  The Presidency of the EU should be used as an opportunity for proper engagement and as a move to work towards a more democratic Europe.  It is time for Europe to engage with citizens, listen to them and heed their voices.  It is time Europe started looking at and working for an economy that works for people rather than have people working for an economy.Am I all right for time?

That approach must be applied also to the reform of the CAP.  We should push for a policy that provides enough to keep as many farmers as possible on the land.  CAP reform should ensure that all farmers are able to attain an equitable standard of living while environmental concerns are also addressed.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I call Deputy Shane Ross, who has five minutes.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I wish to elaborate on a few matters I mentioned during Leaders' Questions today.  I am not sure it matters terribly whether Ireland is President of the Union.  I hope it does and that the Presidency gives us a pivotal position for influencing the European Union agenda.Since 2008, when we hit the rocks financially, we have punched well below our weight.  Perhaps it was not totally our fault.  If we are to continue to pursue the agenda dictated to us, by Germany in particular, I am not sure our Presidency will be marked by anything except continued subservience to greater and stronger powers overseas.  I would like to hear a vision of our goals in a specific way for those six months from the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and any Minister with responsibility in this area.  There is a danger that we will pursue an agenda that means we will do nothing for Ireland.  There is also a danger that we will do the bidding of Germany and other more powerful countries.  There is a danger that any nation that holds the Presidency will undertake a finger in the dyke operation because of the crisis, which is permanent as far as we can see.  We should not hold out much hope unless the Government fills us with hope by presenting us with a vision and specific goals for Europe and Ireland.There is no doubt that in the past week there has been an opportunity provided for Ireland, specifically, and smaller nations.  What happened in France is monumental and seismic.  The balance of power in Europe has changed.  There is no longer an ideological unity between the strongest countries in Europe.  There was an unhealthy ideological unity, as any ideological unity between two such powerful nations would be.  I welcome the fact that François Hollande has taken over, specifically because he represents something different to Chancellor Angela Merkel.  If the Irish Government is to play a role in the Presidency, rather than being a cypher for Chancellor Merkel, I hope it will play the role of adjusting the balance of power in Europe so there is balance.  At the moment there is no balance of power in Europe.  It is German-led and joined by France, with the rest of the nations falling into line.  I urge the Government to take that attitude and not to be a German satellite.  It is the duty of the Government to crack up this monolithic duopoly that has dominated Europe for so long.I welcome the outbreak of democracy in Europe in the past week.  There is a possibility, as the last speaker mentioned, of people seizing back power from the apparatchiks, the bureaucracy, the Commission, the European Central Bank and the major powers that have dominated.  I do not agree with a large number of statements made by the extremists on either side in Greece but it is welcome that they have sent the message that they matter.  Inconvenient as it is, the people at the top who have been dictating the pace must take their views into account.  That is true in Greece as it is in France.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I welcome the opportunity to address the Dáil on Europe Day 2012.  It is easy to forget what is positive when times are hard and today I want to focus on the benefits the EU has brought us.  Then I will speak about the challenges we face to maintain our work in Europe in one of the most commendable agendas, overseas development, and I will outline the opportunities for the Oireachtas during the Irish Presidency next year.We all know the benefits the European Union has brought to Ireland, Europe and the world.  It has been a force for good since it came into existence.  When hopes of European co-operation first took off, we were recovering from the Second World War, which almost brought the Continent to the point of self-destruction, with millions of people killed.  People of previous generations were used to living with the threat of war looming over their everyday lives.  In the past 70 years, a short period, this has changed completely.  We struggled initially and, until 30 years ago, Europe was divided by the Iron Curtain and torn between two conflicting ideologies but today we find ourselves in a different place.  Now, children struggle to believe how Europe was.  Before speaking here, I spoke to schoolchildren from Ashbourne.  We spoke about how, 30 years ago, we needed visas to get into countries like Poland and Czechoslovakia, as it was.  I told them about my experience in the 1980s walking through Checkpoint Charlie in a divided Berlin.  It is difficult to understand how far we have come in a short period of time.Europe has also been beneficial to us in Ireland.  European involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process was instrumental in ensuring we reached a point where we could sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  The peace that was difficult to imagine at home and throughout the European Union is now a reality.  The European project has resulted in our continent being seen as an example of peace and co-operation.We must not just celebrate our internal successes but also the positive impact Europe has had throughout the world.  In overseas aid, Europe has built up an international reputation of which we should all be proud.  Our programmes have brought benefits to many people throughout the developing world.  Some will argue that we should reduce these programmes when we are in hard times in Europe but in times of difficulty we reveal who we really are.  We must ensure that Europe's aid programmes continue to help those who need it most.As we get ready for the Irish Presidency of the European Union in January, we must make sure the Oireachtas plays its part in shaping the agenda.  With the EU having a greater impact on our day-to-day lives, national parliaments must step up to increase awareness of the European Union.  It is a great opportunity next year to do just that.  In the six months of our Presidency, there will be many interparliamentary meetings in Dublin and throughout the country.  We must use the coming months to agree our priorities for the Irish Presidency.  I mentioned our involvement in the overseas aid programme and I want to see the Presidency focus on employment, particularly youth unemployment.  This is a major issue for Ireland and throughout Europe.  We can use our time between now and then to plan.  Deputy Shane Ross says he wants to see some detail and so do I.  I want to see the detail and meat on the bones of what we can hope to achieve on youth unemployment throughout our Presidency.Tomorrow, the Joint Committee on European Union affairs will mark Europe Week 2012.  Mr. Brendan Halligan will appear to outline his vision for Europe for the next 20 years.  We must celebrate the benefits of Europe in Ireland and beyond and use this to move forward and bring better prosperity, continued peace and harmony for the people of Europe.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	154	There is far more to Europe and the European Union than the eurozone but, for many people, the most concrete manifestation of the European Union is the euro in their wallets or purses.  There is no doubt that what happens to the eurozone will have a seismic impact on the health of European political project.  As we survey where matters stand after the past few weeks, the eurozone is facing a grim vista of challenges.  The most recent developments include what happened in France, where one in five people voted for the Front National Party, which is anti-euro and anti-globalisation.  It espouses views and philosophies not held by any Member of this House.  It is now a mainstream political party.Other speakers have referred to youth unemployment in this country and across the European Union.  The figures show that between one in three people under the age of 25 is unemployed in certain states of the European Union.  The results of the recent Greek election demonstrate that it is very difficult to imagine that this result will contribute to an alleviation of the current crisis in that country.  The response of some member states to date puts me in mind of the words of William Butler Yeats, "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold".  He wrote those lines in the aftermath of the First World War and in the years prior to the Russian Revolution.I contend that Europe is facing the battle to preserve the eurozone, the battle to preserve the political identity of the European Union to which everyone can subscribe.  In addition, in many ways this is also a battle for the future of centrist politics within Europe.  I do not mean whether one sits on the centre left or the centre right.  Regardless of one's position in that spectrum, we have far more in common than divides us.  I note the ability of parties and movements who sit outside that centre to gain momentum and more support within Europe.  I am fearful that if this happens, the prospect for Europe and the European Union is very grim.Europe needs to recognise this possibility and to act upon it.  The situation is evolving rapidly.  We need to commence a discussion about how to facilitate the orderly exit of a country from the eurozone.  We need to consider what this would mean for the country concerned but also we must facilitate a process for countries which want to remain in the eurozone to allow them to do so.  Otherwise, forces will be set in motion which could lead to an unravelling beyond the power of anyone to control.We must regard the eurozone and the current economic difficulty as a balance of payments crisis.  I differ somewhat from the views of my colleague, Deputy Ross, in this regard.  It is not a question of a balance of power but rather a crisis of a balance of payments.  If peripheral countries are deflating, it is essential that countries in the core are inflating.  If this does not happen, there will not be the balanced adjustment needed.In conclusion, I wish to make two political points.  I agree with my colleague from Sinn Féin regarding the role of politics.  There needs to be an infusion of democracy into the resolution.  If the price we pay for dealing with an economic crisis results in a further distance between the people and their rulers, we prolong the inevitable.When growth returns, as it will, we must ensure that the fruits of that growth are distributed equally and fairly.  Those dividends must not be concentrated at the top.  I refer to a recent article in the Financial Times by Niall Ferguson and Pierpaolo Barbieri writing on the prospects for Europe, where they state:  “Today, the biggest threat to its survival is no longer the economic consequences of austerity, it is the political consequences”.  We need to take steps to recognise them.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate on the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  In the midst of a referendum campaign that will play such a crucial role regarding our position in the future of the Union, it is fitting that we use Europe Day to reflect upon what the future will hold.  It is an opportunity to consider what we hope to achieve when we hold the Presidency of the European Council next year.  It is also a moment to reflect upon how far Europe has advanced since the Schuman declaration first echoed through the Continent in 1950 and the European movement was begun.First, I wish to speak about the theme developed by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan in London yesterday when he floated the idea that the European bailout fund would be used to directly recapitalise banks throughout Europe.  The Fianna Fáil Party supports this view.  Any objective analysis of European Union policy with regard to the sharing of the burden of bank losses will conclude that the current policy is fundamentally unfair.  The Irish State has injected approximately €64 billion into the Irish banks, which amounts to approximately 40% of Ireland's GDP.  In view of the trenchant policy of the European Central Bank, senior bondholders would not be asked to contribute one cent towards those losses.  We can argue about domestic policy decisions all we like but that ECB policy alone is central to the fact that the Irish people have had to take on that burden.  An issue now arises with regard to Spain's third largest bank and there will be major issues with regard to many other banks in the European Union who may require additional capital injection. If there is to be any European assistance for the recapitalisation of banks, then Ireland should be first in that queue.  The Government should be making that case at every opportunity.  There is an opportunity to retrospectively apply the provisions to which Professor Honohan referred, to Irish banks.  This would probably arise in the form of the European bailout fund taking a direct stake in the Irish banks which have been bailed out and recompensing the Irish taxpayer in that respect.  We believe there is great potential in this proposition.As regards the Irish Presidency, the Government should be prepared to take the initiative on a number of key issues and to show leadership.  Adequate resources in terms of diplomats, technical assistance and most critically, the time and energy of Ministers, will need to be fully committed if we are to make progress and secure tangible achievements during our Presidency.  By January 2013 of next year, the EU will have taken steps, through the intertwined stability treaty, and the European Stability Mechanism, to stave off the storm clouds gathering around the euro.  However, in order to drive growth and create jobs to tackle the rising unemployment queues throughout the Continent, much more action will be required.  The consensus is growing across Europe that fiscal prudence alone will not be sufficient to stem the most severe crisis the developed world has witnessed since 1929. A comprehensive stimulus package, as our party has consistently called for, is an integral part of any meaningful solution to address the crisis.  This must be a strategy that will take people off the dole queues and get Europe working again.Taking steps to address the debt problem through strong fiscal rules combined with measures to stimulate growth is the only feasible strategy to tackle the economic problems of Europe.  The multi-annual financial framework from 2014 to 2020 is currently being worked out in Brussels.  This will have a major impact on what resources will be available to the cornerstone of the Union.  The resolution of the multi-annual financial framework may fall under the watch of the Government if negotiations continue to drag on.  Taking leadership on a growth agenda, possibly using the multi-annual financial framework, should be a key priority for the Government when it assumes the Presidency.Another critical issue from an Irish perspective will be the resolution of the CAP post-2013 negotiations.  The decisions by the multi-annual financial framework as to who gets what in the EU will have a significant impact on the future of CAP.  Several areas of contention threaten to have a very greater impact on Irish farmers.  The introduction of a flat rate payment system, the intricacies of greening, a 2014 reference year and supports for young farmers all need to be addressed during our Presidency.  These issues will have a profound impact on the shape of agriculture in Ireland, on our landscape and for a major section of our economy.  The timing of our Presidency and the deadline for reform make it an ideal opportunity to press home changes that will benefit Ireland and Europe as a whole.The challenges that face Europe are immense but through co-operation as equal partners with our European neighbours we can rise to face them.  I look forward to the EU Presidency as an opportunity for Ireland to take a strong role in this regard.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I also welcome the comments made yesterday by Professor Honohan.  It would have been a lot better if the European financial system had dealt with the banks' problems rather than passing them on to citizens.  The notion of turning private debt into State debt has been the root of most of the present crisis.It has been an interesting time in Europe for a while, and the last few months have been no different.  Without doubt the strongest statement coming from Europe in recent months has been that politicians are out of touch with the people they are supposed to represent.  The policies are not working, the method of government is not working and the people are certainly not working.  We have seen an upheaval right across Europe.It is disingenuous of the Taoiseach to say that he is all in favour of French president-elect Hollande's approach to the problem and to the fiscal treaty, given that we have rolled along with everything so far.  Whatever the Germans have told us, the Government says: "Oh yes, that's the best for us; and if a growth pact comes along, sure grand, we'll take that too".Clearly, however, Mr. Hollande has a few other ideas just to show that he is a little bit different.  Prior to his election, The Economist  magazine said that he was a rather dangerous individual who genuinely believes in the need to create a fairer society.  My God, that is something to worry about.  He is also in favour of eurobonds, although I do not see the Germans agreeing to that idea.  What he is really seeking, however, is an acceptance by Germany that the intra-euro area imbalances are two-sided.  The reason the periphery overborrowed is because the German financial system overloaned.  The imbalances still exist and the Italians have been at pains to point that out lately.In Italy, the economics spokesman for the PDL - the largest party supporting Mario Monti's technocratic Government - Mr. Renato Brunetta, said it was "intolerable" that Germany could finance its debt at costs below the level of inflation, while the rest of Europe was paying on average three percentage points more.  "We cannot give as a gift this competitive advantage to Germany.  This is provoking the destruction of the European club," he said, adding: "If there is not a commitment by the European Council in June to amend the fiscal compact, it won't be ratified."Italy is probably only at the start of its problems and given the manner in which it is going about fixing them I fear for the Italian people.  We do not need to discuss Greece, given that two thirds of the people there have clearly said "No" to austerity.  In addition, it will not be long before the Dutch have their say in September when fresh elections take place there.Spain has become the new basket case.  Next week it will be two years since Zapatero's socialist Government adopted the first austerity measures and passed a series of structural reforms.  These measures brought about the electoral suicide of the Spanish socialist party.  Now the conservatives find themselves in a similar situation.  Little more than 100 days after gaining power, they have alienated citizens by pushing austerity well beyond their electoral mandate only to find themselves as heavily penalised by the great financial markets as Zapatero was.It is true that the markets are making life difficult for the Spanish Government, but that is no surprise.  What is outrageous is that while Spaniards face recession and soaring unemployment, the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, who is also a member of the European Central Bank's council, states that above 6% interest rates for Spanish sovereign debt are not the end of the world.  I am sure they are probably not the end of the world for Germany, but they are surely not making things easier for the Spaniards.Austerity has no doubt taken a larger than expected toll.  Demand is falling for loans to businesses and consumers despite ECB action to help the region's banks.  The confidence fairy seemingly does not exist.  The notion that by slashing spending confidence will return to businesses and consumers, and that they will all start spending again, has been blown out of the water at this stage.This Government promised to be different from the Fianna Fáil-Green Administration, and was elected because of that promise.  If there is one thing that stands out for the people more than anything else, however, it is that this Government is the same as its predecessor.  People do not see any difference.  That is why 50% of the people refused to pay the household charge because they are disillusioned beyond all belief.  They were so glad that an election came around last year so that they could change things at last.  They thought they would change things by putting Labour and Fine Gael into government, yet they got more of the same.

More important, France has a new president who has campaigned against austerity without any plan for jobs and growth.  In Greece, we have seen an historic election in which the people have rejected austerity.  In France and Greece in particular it has been a victory for hope over fear.  Yet our Government is conducting a campaign for an intergovernmental treaty, not an EU one, which is based on fear.  It is based on the idea of saying "It's not much of a treaty but, sure, we're going to have to say ‘Yes' to get future funding".We have the spectacle of our Tánaiste jetting out to Paris seeking to be part of the celebrations there.  One could not write the script.  On numerous occasions in this Chamber, I have appealed to the Tánaiste and his colleagues to listen to social democratic, left-wing and trade union voices across Europe who have opposed this crazy austerity policy.  It is failing and is pushing people into the margins and despair, particularly in Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal.  No doubt other countries will join them.Here we are on Europe Day but where is the solidarity?  Where is the real sense of us all being Europeans together?  Where has the real vision gone?  The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants to have it all ways.  She wants to have trade surpluses in her country and wants to maintain competitiveness as well as boosting exports.  She does not want to drive up domestic demand that could assist the European project.  At the same time, she tells her own people that we were all reckless and feckless on the periphery, and if only we could be more prudent like the Germans we would not be in this mess.  She does not tell them, however, that the Landesbank and other German banks were up to their necks in this crisis.  Without due diligence, regulation or any management sense, they recklessly stuffed money into the periphery - particularly in Ireland, into private banks - and have asked our people to take that burden.Here we are on Europe Day but it is a bit of a charade because the Government is all over the place.  The Fine Gael Party wanted Sarkozy to win the French presidential election, because his UMP is a sister party of Fine Gael's.  Meanwhile, the Tánaiste is diving over to Paris to get photographed, if possible, with the victorious  team there.  He wants to rewrite the narrative that all along he was opposed to austerity.They want to prove that all along they were fighting the good fight, agreeing with Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, Roubini, Sinn Féin, the United Left Alliance and all the other advocates of a new direction.  It will not fool anybody, however.  Maybe now is the time for reflection and courage.  It is the time to stand up for the national interest once and for all, and see that the tide has well and truly turned, as it was always going to.  People in Europe could only take so much of this.  They have started to fight back and have done so with immense civil disobedience.  Here in Ireland we have had mass resistance to the household charge.   In all reality we have already had a referendum on that issue and on austerity.  Perhaps now finally we can have an Irish Government that will stand up for our interests, give our people hope and reverse this madness.

I have four or five short questions.  Many Members have referred to the need to return to the communautaire approach and the abandonment of the "Merkozy" approach.  Does the Minister of State see us having an opportunity during our Presidency to do something effective about that?The Honohan proposal and the development of the role of the ECB were mentioned.  Is that a priority for the Minister of State and what initiatives has she in mind?The issue of the Western Balkans and the maintaining of stability there is important.  Can the Minister of State give us an assurance that under Ireland's Presidency focus will be placed on that area?The question of enlargement has been marginalised to a very large extent by virtue of the financial crisis we are all confronting.  We know of the Minister of State's keen interest in the issue of accession for Turkey.  Has her views on that developed?  What about Iceland and the impact of Icelandic accession on the fisheries industry?  During our Presidency will we be able to achieve anything in that respect?On the millennium goals for development aid, we seem to be operating in a situation where 0.5% of GDP is the baseline we have while working towards 0.7% at some stage in the future.  What can we do as a country that is now borrowing the money we are giving away in development aid to use our moral authority to get our European partners to step up to the mark and ensure they give from the substantially greater resources they have to assist those in greatest need in the developing world?

The Leas-Cheann Comhairle can rule me out of order on that.I will begin with the question on the community method of decision making, something about which I have spoken repeatedly for the past year and about which I feel strongly.  I chair the interdepartmental group in government preparing our priorities for the Presidency.  This is something we have already agreed will be a very important feature of our Presidency, that we will advance the community method of decision making.  I stress there would not necessarily be consensus in the Chamber about that.  While some of our colleagues are happy to condemn France and Germany for their role in trying to provide leadership at a European level, equally if we start talking about strengthening the role of the European Commission, which is the body where every member state is represented equally and impartially, they will clamour to condemn that approach as well.  One has to begin to wonder whether they want any leadership at a European level or whether they want to deconstruct the entire thing.I welcome the focus on the Presidency in the Deputy's questions.  I hope what I said goes some way to answering the question on how we intend to approach our decision making.  We want to bring all stakeholders on board.  We want to ensure that all member states are central to decision making and that the European Commission will be more proactive in leading the legislative agenda, particularly when it comes to implementing the key growth enhancing measures that we so desperately need.  It may come as a surprise to Deputies that these are not something that have suddenly fallen out of the heavens in the past three days; they are measures on which we as a Government have been providing plenty of leadership, especially during the past four months where the Taoiseach along with a number of other Heads of State and Government have been leading the charge in putting the growth and job creating agenda front and centre at a European level, not least at the informal summit in January and again at the spring summit in March.On the Deputy's question on the role of the ECB, this is something we are currently discussing internally in government.  We had a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs last week at which we prepared our approach to the June summit, to the informal dinner at which growth will be discussed which will take place 23 May and to forthcoming ECOFIN and eurozone meetings.  We are anxious to see an enhanced role for the ECB.  That again is not something new from the Government's perspective.  We have seen clearly that there has been a quid pro quo at European level in recent months.  When the stability treaty was agreed in principle in December we immediately saw a direct response from the ECB, which immediately pumped €500 billion into the financial system.  We saw a repeat of that action in January, which was hugely important to stabilising the European economy.  I do not think any of us are particularly fans or cheerleaders for the banks at present.  In terms of the reputation, behaviours and activity of the banks during the past number of years, be it before the crash or since it in terms of credit and providing funding for SMEs and start-ups and so on, we all know the problems, but one thing is for sure, without a financial system and a banking system we would not have an economy and without an economy we would not have a society.  It is as simple as that.  We cannot unfortunately separate one from the other.  The role of the ECB in December and January in pumping that liquidity into the system right around the eurozone was crucial and was a direct response to the political agreement for the stability treaty.  I believe we will see more flexibility and more advances.  It has been incremental and it may be frustrating but guess what, we are dealing with 27 democracies, 27 governments often pulling in different directions, more often than not working together but not necessarily always agreeing together.  That is the beauty of democracy and of the unique construct within the European Union and we have to respect that.  Some might like if we could dictate to the Bundestag, the Assemblée Nationale or any other parliament but that is not the way it works.  Nor can we dictate to Greece for that matter and on every occasion it has had to vote for these packages and bailout programmes.  We have achieved a huge amount.  We have seen major progress but we will see more and we need to see more.I am a supporter of a policy of euro bonds, something for which I have been calling for many months, in fact since I was appointed more than a year ago.  We have not got there yet but I believe we will get there.  Anybody who believe it is a serious prospect that we will get there before we put in place binding and enforceable rules to govern our currency needs to get into the real world because it is not.  A more robust and enhanced role for the ECB is something I and the Government very much support.On the Deputy's question on the Balkans, I thank him for his continued interest, along with Deputy Mac Lochlainn and others, in this region.  It is a cause for concern but also a cause for hope and optimism particularly because of Croatia's accession next year.  The Deputy will be pleased to know that I will be travelling to the Balkans for a week in July and I will then travel on to Turkey.  If memory serves me correctly, I will visit Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro and Bosnia.  I may not be travelling to Serbia until September but I will certainly be travelling to Bosnia and will be there for the 20 year anniversary of the massacre there and I will then travel to Turkey where I will talk to representatives of the government.  This is something I consider to be a priority.  Some would say I should just be focusing on the existing member states of the European Union, but I disagree with that.  Enlargement is hugely important.  Reaching out to prospective member states and to the countries in the Balkans is extremely important, especially as the holder of the incoming Presidency of the EU.  They really value our interest and are thrilled with the long-standing co-operation on the part of the Irish Defence Forces but also the political engagement from the Government.  I look forward very much to that.

The Government's plan A is to have a "Yes" vote on 31 May but a plan B may be required if the people vote "No".  Will the Minister of State give a commitment in that event that she will not allow the blackmail clause, as it is referred to, which links the austerity treaty, as we call it, to the ESM?  We have Article 136 and the amendments to it that give legal cover and sustenance for the ESM.  If it did not, the European governments would not have pursued it.  Why would one amend an article if it is not required?  Therefore, it is required to give legal force to the ESM.  This means the Government has the ability to use its unanimous veto to re-negotiate.  To be very clear, in the event of a "No" vote will the Government use this power to seek to remove this link which was introduced at the very last stages, is menacing and is blurring the debate we need to have?  There is a great amount of detail in Article 136 and the Government never answers the question so I am trying to make as clear as possible what is the question.It is estimated that meeting the 0.5% structural deficit will require an additional €6 billion of cuts or increased taxation.  How does the Minister of State propose to do this?
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	167	With regard to the question on plan A I am still waiting for Sinn Féin to give us plan B and I look forward to the day when Deputy Mac Lochlainn, his leader and all front line advocates of a "No" vote will give us their plan B and tell us exactly with what they propose to replace the ESM.  Will I commit to not ratifying the ESM?  Certainly not.  The Government is committed to ratification and implementation of the ESM.  It would be akin to national treason to suggest otherwise.On the Deputy's question on the supposed veto, let us remember the ESM will be established this summer on the basis of paid in capital.  Once 90% of the paid in capital goes in and those countries who provide it assent, the ESM will be established.  Even if we, with our 1.23%, were to decide we did not want the treaty to go ahead and we did not want to be part of it we cannot stop it.  What the Deputy proposes is that in 12 months time, after the ESM has been established, is functional and is operational, we would then somehow try to dismantle it.  The answer to this is a very resounding "No, we will not do this" particularly in 2013 when we will be exiting our programme.  It is the very point in time when we will most need the insurance policy and safety net of the ESM to assist us.  It would be quite a bizarre position for the Government to adopt to suggest we would try to dismantle or undo a fund that will already be in place at that point.With regard to the €6 billion spending cuts or tax increase agenda which supposedly would have to be implemented in 2015 we must make clear that we exit the programme in 2015.  A three year transition period is spelled out very clearly in the six pack during which we will be able to adjust in our own time and way, obviously in consultation with our European partners.  This transition period exists for Ireland specifically.  Transition periods will also apply to the other programme countries.  We are speaking about 2018.  A €6 billion figure in 2018 would be to suppose there would be no inflation or growth between now and then and I do not accept this.  The Deputy's proposition is the very worst case scenario which ignores the three-year transition period, therefore I reject it completely and I do not agree with it.  Seamus Coffey and a number of other economists have suggested that no adjustment would be required by 2018 because our growth and inflation would have us on track after we exit the programme and the three year transitional period so a €0 adjustment would be required.

Will the Minister of State tell us specifically what she is speaking about in terms of a stimulus for jobs and economic growth?  Economist after economist, including Martin Wolf in The Irish Times today, state if we sign up to the provisions of the fiscal treaty it will rule out any substantial or meaningful financial stimulus and that all that will be available to governments are what are called “structural reforms”, which are more privatisation, property charges, water charges and downward pressure on wages and conditions for workers and workers’ rights because they will have given away the option of financial stimulus by signing up to the targets of the fiscal treaty.

Will she explain why the Fiscal Advisory Council suggests if we are even 1% off on our growth forecasts over the next three years, and all of the forecasts and commentary suggests we may well be, instead of having to have €8.6 billion of cuts over the next three years we will need €13 billion in cuts?  How the hell can we promote jobs and economic growth if, as is looking very likely, we are significantly off on the growth forecast?To meet those debt targets we will have to reduce our debt by half.  Just under half of our national debt is bank related debt.  Is it not true that what the treaty actually requires is that over a 20 year period we will be forced to pay off the bankers' portion of the national debt?  That is what it will require us to do.

With regard to the Deputy's threats on the potential of being 1% off, if he has his way our growth forecast could be much worse than 1% off target.  The type of irresponsible posturing by him over the past number of weeks is much more likely to cost us growth and jobs and investment in this country.

It is extraordinary.  It is an amazing coincidence that IBEC, the Small Firms Association, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Hotels Federation and 15 of the top global CEOs in the Internet and ICT sector all advocate a "Yes" vote with more and more coming out to do so every week.  This morning I attended a Business for Ireland event-----

That is the Deputy's job.  He talks about it, but they actually implement it.  They put their money where their mouths are.  We could do worse than listen to them.The Deputy wants to know where the growth will emerge.  Structural reforms are necessary.  The European Union, as a hegemony, cannot afford to price itself out of the global market.  We live in a globalised economy.  We must trade and sell products and services all over the world and, in turn, we buy and consume them.  That is the way the world works.  If the Deputy wishes to turn off globalisation, he will have to travel back in time because it will not happen in 2012.  Therefore, we need structural reforms.To talk about a European Union that is obsessed with driving down living standards and the rights of members of society, workers and so forth is just farcical.

Look at the rights workers enjoy in this country in terms of working hours, pay and conditions, and equal pay for men and women.  These would not have happened in this country without the European Union.  At least Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn of Sinn Féin has the good grace to acknowledge that, but Deputy Boyd Barrett does not have that good grace.  That is really unfortunate.  It is very difficult to take lectures from the Deputy.  I do not believe he asked a question as it was just a monologue.

He has not put forward a single constructive idea throughout this campaign or today in the House.  It is very difficult to listen to a litany of negativity without ever hearing anything constructive.  This is supposed to be a debate about the Irish Presidency for 2013.  Perhaps the Deputy will put on his thinking cap and when he next comes to the Dáil or attends an Oireachtas committee meeting to talk about the Presidency, he might bring some constructive suggestions.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	192	This is supposed to be a question and answer session in which Members on this side of the House ask questions and the Minister is supposed to answer them.  I will deal with the facts in Europe on European day.  There are 25 million people unemployed, the largest number since the start of the eurozone.  It is largely a consequence of the policies of austerity being perpetrated throughout Europe.  There is the same situation in Ireland where, despite all the Minister's waffle about job creation and the agencies speaking about job creation, there are 100,000 fewer people working now than was the case at the time of the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  How does continuing with more of the same address the chronic unemployment situation not just in Ireland but throughout Europe?My next question is about the ECB.  The Minister spoke about the ECB releasing more than €1 trillion in funds at 1% to the banks and how this was such a great thing.  Given that she told us she is leading the charge throughout Europe, which is totally laughable and nobody buys it for a minute, where is her commentary on the fact that the ECB should be releasing those funds to national governments to stimulate jobs programmes and so forth?  If we ratify this treaty, that avenue will be excluded from us.With regard to growth, the Minister continuously refers to the targeted cutbacks that will be necessary to achieve the austerity treaty targets.  That has been supported by economists.  Based on the Department's growth figures by 2015, the amount of extra cuts required will be €5.7 billion.  The Minister's answer to that is to say it is only if the economy does not grow and if there is no inflation.  The reality is that every growth projection figure from Government Departments has been wrong.  Why will the Government get it right this time when it got it wrong every other time?

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	195	My apologies.  I meant to say Bundestag.  I agree with the Minister, but does she not think it is quite undemocratic that it is telling us what to do and we have no say in the matter?  The democratic deficit at the centre of power in Europe at present is frightening.  It is obvious the people have a different opinion on how things should be done but it will not necessarily change how Germans perceive things.  Does the Minister not think we should have a little more to say when talking to Chancellor Angela Merkel?On the point the Minister made in response to Deputy Boyd Barrett about employers all voting "Yes", I still employ over 50 people in the restaurant and wine bar industry.  I do not believe voting "Yes" will be good for small and medium-sized business, so I will be voting "No".
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The Minister spoke about the last 40 years and the brilliant things that have happened for Irish and European workers.  The Celtic tiger economy and boom time throughout the world was due to globalisation and deregulation of the banking system, which poured loads of credit into economies and people's pockets.  Over that period of time workers' rights were driven back.  Most private companies now offer contract work, not full-time jobs.  A major company such as Diageo, for example, has a workforce in which only 5% are full-time workers.  The Minister referred to equal pay.  In my old job, workers who are working side by side and doing the same job are on different levels of pay.  That is also being driven down by the economy.  The situation was not rosy beforehand and it is even less rosy now.  How can the Minister stand over her point?There are 25 million people unemployed in Europe.  Under this treaty €166 billion could be cut across Europe.  How will that bring growth into the economy?  The Minister mentioned money growing on trees.  Her Government's slash and burn policy will create no growth in the economies across Europe, and people are pointing that out.  She also referred to IBEC and various businesses supporting the treaty.  For the first time, however, three major unions - Mandate, UNITE and the TEEU - are opposing it, while SIPTU has said it would call for a "No" vote if there is no job or growth creation in the treaty.  It is not the same as previously.  The balance has changed in this regard.  What is the Minister's opinion on that?
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I will try to answer all the questions as quickly as possible.  Both Deputy Daly and Deputy Collins referred to the 25 million unemployed people in the European Union.  I do not dispute that there is a massive unemployment problem both in Ireland and many other European countries.  However, it is not correct to state that we can continue spending money we simply do not have.  It is just not possible.  By saying that a "No" vote to austerity means the types of savings, cuts and tax increases that have happened and are happening will somehow not be required is not accurate.  In fact, in saying "No" to austerity today one is potentially saying "Yes" to worse and more austerity in the future.  While we all acknowledge the problem, we have a very different solution to it.I do not accept that the reforms in this country are not beginning to work.  I give credit to the late Brian Lenihan for the efforts he made to try to get our public finances under control during the last Dáil, but we are only half way there.  There was a small sign of growth in 2011, at 0.7%, and it is anticipated that it will be similar this year.  I wish that it were stronger, but we cannot work miracles.  What we can do is try to be realistic and work within the parameters of the huge pressures on us in terms of the global downturn and particularly the European downturn, and the enormous challenge that poses for an export economy such as ours.  If we are to believe that the solution is to send out a signal that we are not committed to our currency or that we do not want rules to govern that currency, that would be quite delusional and it would backfire.With regard to the role of the ECB, I have a fundamentally different perspective from that of Deputy Daly.  It is absolutely essential that we have a functioning financial and banking system.  There is no way around that.  Everybody wants the banks to lend and for credit to be made available to companies.However, that will not be feasible in the absence of a robust and sustainable banking system and the role of the European Central Bank has been vital in this regard.  The governing board of the ECB has taken a very strict interpretation of the treaty and of its capacity under the existing European treaties.  I differ with its interpretation in this regard as I believe the ECB can do more.  The Government is advocating that the ECB can do more and on this point, the Deputy and I are in agreement.  While I could revert to the figure of €6 billion for 2015, I must reiterate it does not take into account the three-year transition period.  Moreover, I do not accept the economy will not grow or there will be zero inflation for the next eight years.As for Deputy Wallace's question on the Bundestag telling us what to do, this is not factually correct.  Ireland will hold a referendum on this treaty and a robust debate on it is taking place.  I disagree with the Deputy but I respect his right to make his point and to express his opinion, as I hope he accepts mine.  This is the nature of the debate but the Irish people will make up their minds.  No German citizen will make up their minds for them and nor will the Bundestag, as it is the Irish people who will make their decision.  In their wisdom, they will make a decision, which I hope will be the outcome I advocate but it may not be.  Consequently, I do not accept the point that we are being told or instructed what to do.I already have dealt with the question from Deputy Joan Collins.  On her point relating to the unions, the unions are split on this issue and a number of them have advocated a "Yes" vote, as is their entitlement.  I travel around the country to meet representatives of chambers of commerce, as well as people from small and medium businesses, big companies and global investors, that is, from the entire spectrum.  The vast majority of them - as in 99.9% - as well as all the business representative bodies, advocate a "Yes" vote to retain jobs and stability in the country and to keep investment flowing in.  I do not believe these figures can be disputed because this is the fact.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	201	During the passage of the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas, the provisions providing for retrospection to 5 December 2011 have been the source of considerable debate.  Section 1 as originally passed by the Dáil provided that with the exception of the provisions relating to offences or the instigation of legal proceedings, all other provisions of the Bill would be deemed to have come into effect on 5 December 2011.  In light of the debate in both Houses and on further consideration of this issue with the Office of the Attorney General, the amendment to section 1 as proposed in subsection (3) restricts the application of retrospective cover to the basic working and employment conditions of agency workers to extend only to pay.  As for the other non-pay elements that come within the basic working and employment conditions set down by the directive, such as working time, rest breaks and access to collective facilities and to job vacancies etc., I am advised that in practice, enforcement of these on a retrospective basis would be almost impossible as they cannot be undone after the event.  I believe this amendment should go some way towards meeting concerns that were expressed previously about the intention to make the provisions of the Bill in their entirety, with the exception of the offence provisions, retrospective.  I recommend the amendment to the House.Subsection (2) of the amendment applies the general provisions of the Bill, such as section 2 on interpretation etc., on a retrospective basis.  Subsection (4) provides that the offence provisions in the Bill will not come into effect until the day following the passage of the legislation.  All the other provisions of the Bill will come into effect upon enactment of the Bill.  I hope this measure, which balances the need for the Government to meet its directive obligations, also meets to a greater extent than heretofore the concerns expressed about this provision.  This amendment will ensure that agency workers who are entitled to equal pay from the transposition date of the directive will have this entitlement backdated to 5 December 2011.  However, they will not be able to claim entitlements from 5 December 2011 in respect of other aspects of basic working and employment conditions, including breaks, working time, collective facilities, etc.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I thank the Minister for the change he has introduced to this section of the Bill and the legislation now is much better than was the case on its initial introduction to the House.  While technically, one can state that one cannot retrospectively give people rest breaks they did not receive at the time or give access to collective facilities, if one wished to be completely consistent one could of course put in place a system to compensate them for not getting such breaks or access.  Nevertheless, I welcome the change made by the Minister.  During the Second and Committee Stage debates, I made the point that the retrospection in this section regarding pay would be very harsh on certain undertakings.  Almost six months have elapsed since the commencement date of 5 December 2011 and the longer this goes on, the greater the burden will be.  I also pointed out to the Minister the possible constitutional implications and the danger, were someone to mount a constitutional challenge.  However, I do not propose to oppose this amendment because it represents a considerable improvement on what went before.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Sinn Féin supports the retrospective nature of the legislation but is concerned that, due to the passage of time while enacting the legislation, many workers may have been obliged to endure unequal pay and conditions.  While this measure caters for pay, it does not cater for the other matters.  Sinn Féin believes this should not be the case and that workers should be entitled to claim back, for example, time off in respect of breaks and so on if they were treated unfairly.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I thank Deputy O'Dea for his support in this regard.  We discussed the Attorney General's advice at length on a previous occasion and that is a robust way to go.  However, the reason I have focused the amendment on pay is in light of the concerns regarding the practicality of seeking to enforce back to 5 December 2011.  Seeking to disentangle some of the other items would pose a practical difficulty and I have been advised by the Attorney General that this is a better approach to take.  It meets the general concerns expressed in both Houses that the retrospection element had to be applied in a balanced way.  While I recognise Deputy Stanley's comment, I believe what I propose in this amendment to be the best way to proceed.    Seanad amendment agreed to.Seanad amendment No. 2:Section 2: In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:" "Act of 1971" means the Employment Agency Act 1971;".

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Seanad amendments Nos. 2 and 15 are technical amendments.  It is the practice in drafting legislation that where there is a reference to another enactment on more than one occasion, the definition of the enactment is included in the interpretation section and the enactment is thereafter referred to by its shorter title.  This is the effect of Seanad amendments Nos. 2 and 15.Seanad amendment No. 3 essentially is of a technical nature to ensure the legislation aligns properly with the European Union directive.  Article 3.1(f) of the directive lists overtime as a constituent element that goes to make up basic working and employment conditions.  While overtime is listed in the Bill as a component element in the definition of pay, it is not included in the definition of basic work and employment conditions and to be correctly aligned with the directive, it also should be included under the definition and this is the intention of the amendment.Seanad amendment No. 12 replaces the current text of section 13(1) to provide specifically for the prohibition contained in the directive on an employment agency charging a fee to an agency worker, following the completion of his or her assignment with a hirer, after which the agency worker is offered direct employment with the hirer.  Amendment No. 13 clarifies that the new provision inserted by amendment No. 12 is in addition and not in substitution for the separate and distinct prohibition contained in section 7(2) of the Employment Agency Act 1971.  The latter provides that it is unlawful for an employment agency to charge an individual a fee, commonly referred to as a placement fee, for facilitating the introduction of that individual to a third party who will hire him or her on a temporary assignment.  In other words, a fee, either at commencement or end of placement, by way of recruitment charge is being outlawed.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	212	These are the more substantive amendments.  Amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6 relate to section 7 of the Bill as passed by the Dáil.  These provisions go to the core of the Bill and have been the subject of considerable and valuable debate in both Houses.  The original formulation of section 7 referenced two distinct situations, namely, where there is a comparable employee against whom the agency worker can be compared and, where there is no comparable employee.  In the first instance, the Bill as passed by the Dáil set out at section 3 the criteria to be fulfilled and the type of considerations that could be taken into account in measuring the level of comparability as between the agency worker and the comparable employee.  In the latter context, where there was no comparable employee, the Bill set out that the entitlements of the agency worker would be those that would apply if a comparable employee were to be employed.  This construct was considered to accurately reflect the directive requirement and was an attempt to provide clarity and guidance beyond that provided by the directive.In the course of indepth consideration and examination of the Bill in both Houses concerns were raised as regards, in particular, the inclusion of the notion of the comparable employee in the legislation given the potential difficulties to which this could in practice give rise.  For this reason, I had these issues considered further with the Office of the Attorney General with a view to providing greater legal certainty and clarity in the Bill.  As a result, it is proposed to remove from the Bill the notion of using the comparable employee construct and to defer to the wording of the directive.Amendment No. 6 now provides that an agency worker is entitled to the same basic working and employment conditions as those to which he or she would be entitled if employed directly by the hirer to undertake the same or similar type work.  I believe that this should meet the concerns raised in both Houses and should provide greater certainty to agency workers, employment agencies and hirer undertakings that will be required to work within the confines of this legislation.  I am satisfied that the revised text ensures that agency workers are properly protected in terms of their entitlements under the directive and that the Government will remain in compliance with that directive.The changes proposed require some revision of the existing provisions of the Bill and this is the intended combined effect of amendments Nos. 4, 5, 11 and 14.  The intention of amendments Nos. 4 and 5 is to retrospectively remove the definition of "comparable employee" from section 2 of the Bill and to delete section 3, as passed by the Dáil, in its entirety.  Acceptance of these amendments makes those aspects of the Bill redundant.  As I mentioned earlier, amendment No. 6 proposes to substitute section 7(1) of the Bill as passed by the Dáil with the new formula for setting out the core entitlement of agency workers.  This essentially provides that agency workers will be entitled to the same basic working and employment conditions as those to which they would be entitled if employed directly to do the same or similar work.Amendment No. 7 is a saving provision which clarifies that those arrangements that exist separately from this legislation and which provide for better terms for agency workers than those provided for in this legislation stand on their own merits.  This is to ensure that no agency worker is disadvantaged by this legislation and ensures compliance with Article 9 of the directive.  Amendments Nos. 11 and 14 are consequential amendments involving identical amendment to sections 11 and 14 of the Bill respectively.  This arises owing to the removal of the reference to "comparable employee" from the Bill.  Section 11 of the Bill relates to access to information on employment by agency workers and the amendment removes the reference to "comparable employee" but does not otherwise change the provisions of that section.  Amendment No. 14 has the same effect in relation to section 14 which deals with access by agency workers to collective facilities and amenities.  Deputy O'Dea raised concerns in this regard when we last discussed the Bill.  My Department took the opportunity when preparing for the taking of the Bill in the Seanad to assess the practicality of what was suggested.  On reflection, remaining closer to the original wording of the directive is easier, safer and clearer.  To be fair to the draftsman, "comparable employee" was included to ensure greater definition.  However, given the practical cases that have emerged, it was felt, as correctly articulated by Deputy O'Dea in the Dáil, that we should stick closely to the wording of the directive.  I hope these amendments are acceptable to the House.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I thank the Minister for his remarks.  I accept these amendments, which represent a considerable improvement on the Bill.  I can understand from where the draftsman was coming in terms of the original legislation.  However, the difficulty is that the more one tries to define the more loopholes open up.  The Minister has taken the wise decision to stick closer to the wording of the directive, which better achieves the intention of the directive.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Sinn Féin will be opposing amendment No. 4.  On amendment No. 7, the directive and legislation were based on ensuring equality of pay and conditions between temporary agency workers and permanent employees.  They are intended to safeguard employment and terms and conditions for both sets of employees.  The Government has introduced a loophole that will exclude so-called permanent agency workers from the provisions of the Bill.  Sinn Féin is concerned that acceptance of this amendment will result in the creation of the further loophole of two workers doing the same job being on different contracts with different terms and conditions.  What will prevent an employer employing an agency worker on lesser terms and conditions?  I urge the Minister to reconsider inserting the words "existing contracts of employment" to ensure that these potential loopholes are closed.We will be supporting amendments Nos. 11 and 14.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	215	The intention was to provide clarity for employers and agency workers in terms of where they stood.  The problem with the comparator was that such person may have been employed when conditions in the labour market were different and issues in terms of experience and so on may have arisen.  We used the comparator in the first formulation of the legislation.  We then tried to modify it to take account of different things that might make the comparator not a relevant person with whom to compare the new recruit being taken on as an agency worker.  As Deputy O'Dea stated, this led to the creation of a complex set of different provisions.  Following further consideration of concrete examples, we realised this provision would create more uncertainty in terms of where people stood.  If a person is recruited as an agency worker, he or she cannot be recruited on terms different from those if the employer went out into the market that same day and had a direct recruit.  That is what is provided for in the directive.  We sought to use the comparator and then make modifications to the comparator to take account of different things which might make those two workers different because one was maybe five years earlier.  In practice, it is better to revert to the wording of the directive.  It is clearer in its application.Having had a lengthy debate in the Seanad and having discussed practical cases, the consensus across the Oireachtas is that this is the better way to go.  I will stick with it because having had the debate and having listened to the views of Deputies and Senators, this is the more robust way to proceed.  It is fairer and it deals with what is the purpose of this, that is, that people cannot take on agency workers and apply entirely different terms and conditions.  That is the sort of abuse this is designed to stamp out.  This was not designed to create a new set of entitlements over and above what is in the directive and that is what the construct could have done.  This is clearer, closer to the directive and commends itself to consensus across the Oireachtas.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Seanad amendment No. 8 proposes the inclusion of an entirely new section in the Bill.  This amendment is particularly important given the revision of section 7 of the Bill that deals with conferring on agency workers entitlement to basic working and employment conditions.  Section 7 now follows closely the wording of article 5 of the directive.  As a consequence, this requires that measures are adopted at national level to ensure proper protection of agency workers in line with the anti-avoidance provisions of article 5.5 of the directive.  In particular, there is a requirement to prevent the use of successive assignments of agency workers designed to circumvent and override the entitlement conferred on them.Seanad amendment No. 8 responds to this by proposing the insertion of a new section 8 in the Bill.  The intention is to ensure that agency workers on assignment with the same hirer in a series of assignments in which they are doing the same or similar type work are not reverted to the starting point on each occasion they commence a further assignment with that hirer.  Rather the provisions in section 8(1) provide that the series of assignments will be treated as a single assignment which means that agency workers will properly accumulate service and other entitlements under employment law, thus the first assignment in a relevant series of assignments is treated as the objective starting point for determining the commencement of the assignment.Section 7(1)(b) provides a safeguard to ensure that timing between assignments when the agency worker is not working on assignment with the hirer is not taken into account for the purposes of determining entitlements.  Section 7(2) defines what constitutes a series of relevant assignments which is that the hirer is the same person or a person connected with the hirer as defined in section 7(3) and the agency worker is the same person in regard to the relevant assignment and works in whole or in part at the same place of work, his or her work is directed and supervised from the same place and the work done is the same or of a similar nature and undertaken in the same or similar conditions with any differences being of minor significance.Additionally, section 7(2) provides that where there is a break between assignments that is greater than a three-month period, this breaks the sequence of the series of assignments and further assignments after that point would commence from the start.  The three-month period in between assignments is borrowed from existing legislation in the employment rights area and is the case in section 2(2) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	217	This is a reasonable amendment and I thank the Minister for bringing it forward.  It seems reasonable that if an agency worker is employed for a long period of time, goes on a temporary break and is taken back after say a few weeks, the employer cannot more or less start him or her again and thereby ignore rights which he or she has accumulated or is accumulating because of his or her previous service.  That is only right and proper.While I appreciate the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has done all in its power to ensure there are no loopholes left, looking at the provisions in regard to companies, I might spot one or two but I will not say anymore about that.   We will hope for the best and hope that the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has completely covered all eventualities.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I welcome this amendment, in particular the fact it will stop employers recruiting agencies workers several times instead of making them permanent.  This brings some clarity to that.  I support the amendment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	219	There is broad support in the House for this amendment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	220	This proposed amendment is purely technical and relates to an amendment to section 8 of the Bill that deal with collective agreements.  The reason for this amendment is that section 8(1) allows for a body or bodies representative of employees to agree to a collective agreement.  However, the language in section 8(4)(c) refers only to a body, that is, it describes the body that negotiated the agreement.  This amendment ensures that this section aligns with section 8(1) by covering the plural version, that is, bodies.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	221	This too is a technical amendment to section 9 of the Bill, as passed by the Dáil, and it seeks to ensure that for purposes only of equal treatment of working and employment conditions for agency workers that are part-time employees, it is the provisions of this legislation and not that of part-time legislation that applies.  In effect, this means that whereas in part-time legislation, the appropriate comparator established for an agency worker is another agency worker that is superseded by this legislation which takes as the appropriate comparator another directly recruited employee.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	222	Seanad amendment No. 14 states: "A hirer shall, as respects access to collective facilities and amenities at a place of work, treat an agency worker no less favourably than an employee of the hirer unless there exist objective grounds that justify less favourable treatment of the agency worker."  Will the Minister explain the last sentence?  Why type of objective grounds does that cover?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	225	It is if there was slight pressure on the facilities and there was a queuing mechanism - in other words, that a reasonable approach would apply in allowing orderly access to the facilities.  It would not be to so constrain the employer that those sort of normal provisions would not be acceptable.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I take the opportunity to thank Deputies and Senators for their very constructive contributions to the debate.  The Bill, as passed, is better than the one introduced.  This is due to the vigilance of Members, in that they drew our attention to difficulties that might have been from the original drafting.  I acknowledge the work done by Members as well as by my officials and those of the Attorney General's office in responding to the issues of practical importance raised by Deputies and Senators.  It was a useful debate and I thank the Opposition for its contribution.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I will reiterate the Minister's comments.  He introduced this legislation on foot of an EU directive and his job was to fashion the legislation within the directive's broad terms.  On Second Stage, I stated that the legislation as introduced had all of the hallmarks of something that had been prepared quickly.  This was reflected in some of the anomalies that we identified.I welcome the flexible approach taken by the Minister, who took much of what we stated on board, although he could not agree to everything.  This is what parliament is about and the Bill is better as a result.Seanad amendments reported.

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that at its meeting yesterday the Government decided in principle that Shannon Airport will be separated from the Dublin Airport Authority and merged with parts of Shannon Development, including its property portfolio, to form a new entity in public ownership.The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and I will revert to Government later this year with detailed proposals.  These will include an implementation strategy for the establishment of the new entity and a plan setting out how it will contribute to strong regional development while ensuring the highest standard of enterprise support in the region.  This decision is an exciting first step on a new road in aviation development in Ireland and it heralds a new era for the Shannon region.The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and I will presently establish a steering group tasked with bringing forward detailed proposals on matters that arise from the Government decision.  In particular the steering group will make recommendations on the optimum organisational structure of the new entity in regard to best supporting the future development of the Shannon area.  Among other matters, the steering group will assess the feasibility of creating an international aviation centre of excellence at Shannon Airport.  We look forward to working with the key stakeholders to progress the many issues that have to be addressed prior to going back to Government with detailed proposals later this year.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I welcome that the Government has at long last made a decision after procrastinating for the past 14 months.  However, the decision puts the cart before the horse.  The Minister outlined his plans to set up a steering group to bring forward detailed proposals but I would expect the Government to have a clear understanding of how to proceed with the development of Shannon.  Today's statement contains nothing except a cut and paste of existing operations to other entities within the overall State structure.  Dublin Airport Authority has been relieved of the burden of the €8 million which the region required.When will the Government set out a clear strategy for growth in passenger and tourism activity at Shannon Airport?  When will it set out proposals that show it is serious about regional development and not solely concerned with protecting the interests of the Dublin Airport Authority?  When will it get real about the need to protect investment in the infrastructure that has played a vital role in the region's development and the 7,000 or 8,000 jobs that have been created there?  This is a question for the Government as a whole because the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has taken a wrecking ball to Shannon Development, a State entity that has been responsible for the developing the region, creating jobs and allowing Shannon to pass through its different phases from light engineering to the knowledge economy.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	232	The Government has set out a clear strategy for the region.  We intend to recapture the pioneering spirit that existed at the foundation of Shannon Airport and the duty free zone.  Shannon will become independent of the DAA and no longer will it have to carry its current debt burden.  It will be able to set its own charges and compete properly with other airports.  This strategy could work very successfully for the airport, although I understand there are mixed feelings about it in the DAA.  Some people accept the decision but others are concerned that its success might threaten the dominance of Dublin.  The new entity will combine the land assets around the airport with Shannon Development's skills in product and land development to develop an aviation services hub that creates jobs and investment.One has to decide in these matters whether to wait until the process is complete before announcing one's strategy or to announce the strategy before putting an implementation group in place.  Given the uncertainty that has existed over the past several months, I thought it made sense to go down this route.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Can the Minister confirm that it is his intention to transfer Shannon Airport free of debt to this new entity and that the Government will retain Aer Rianta International as an integral component of the new company?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	234	It is our intention that the new State company will have no net debt.  It will either be debt free or it will have a small amount of debt equal to its cash reserves.  It may be important for the company to have cash reserves if it needs to make capital investments or absorb losses in its initial years.  The reason it will be debt free is to recognise Shannon's contribution to the establishment of Aer Rianta International.  The latter will remain part of the DAA group, which will be renamed to reflect its new mandate.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Regulation of the taxi industry, including issues pertaining to the nine year vehicle age limit, is a matter for the National Transport Authority under the provisions of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.A public consultation was carried out by the NTA in 2011 on vehicle standards and, in particular, issues pertaining to vehicle age and size.  The outcome of the consultation was made available to the taxi regulation review group as part of its deliberations on a wide range of matters of concern to the taxi sector, including the safety of small public service vehicles for the travelling public.  The review report sets out the proposals of the review group with regard to vehicle standards.Action ten of the report proposes that existing vehicles in the fleet prior to 1 January 2009 should be allowed to operate until they are 14 years of age, subject to passing a roadworthiness test and an NTA licence renewal assessment at six monthly intervals for vehicles aged nine years or older.  Regulations under section 18 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 will be drafted by my Department in consultation with Road Safety Authority, which has responsibility for NCT testing.  This approach will give licence holders time to adjust to the new arrangements and will work out cheaper than replacing the car outright, as was proposed previously.  Feedback from consumers indicates that they are concerned about vehicle standards and safety.It is envisaged that vehicles older than nine years will gradually transition out of the fleet.  In considering these matters, the review group was conscious of the need to ensure an effective balance between the provision of a high quality and safe service to the public and the interests of taxi drivers with a long-term commitment to the industry.  It is hoped that the six monthly NCT testing of vehicles aged between nine and 14 years as proposed in the review report will be commenced in tandem with new vehicle standards to be introduced by the NTA in January 2013.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	236	The taxi regulation review has come up with a number of good ideas but I do not agree with some of their recommendations.  The main issues that the taxi industry faces at present are oversupply and proper enforcement.  The proposals to phase out vehicles that are older than nine years suggests that we operate differently from other countries in Europe and America.  Some of the yellow taxis in America are 20 or 30 years old, as are the black cabs in the North and England.  These vehicles are subject to a proper testing system.  We have a system that includes the NCT and other tests.These new proposals will create an additional burden for taxi drivers, many of whom are getting on in age.  They will be forced to change their vehicles.  Once their vehicles are nine years old they will have to be tested every six months.  These tests will impose further costs on an industry that is struggling.  The various charges that apply to the taxi drivers are pushing people out of the industry.  I agree that we should push out the rogues who are messing up the industry by abusing the system.  Nobody disputes the importance of health and safety.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I am delighted the Deputy supports the majority of the recommendations of the review group.  The extension of the nine-year rule to 14 years in certain circumstances recognises the difficult situation in which many taxi-drivers find themselves.  No Minister responsible for this area has met taxi driver representatives as often as I have met them in this report phase.  Along with that we need to take into account the requirements of consumer groups.  Consumers want to be in cars they recognise as being safe.  It is essential that we have conditions that show that these cars are safe.  We do not want any issues regarding the safety standards of these cars affecting public confidence in the use of taxis.  Taxi-drivers will confirm that.  That is why cars older than nine years and up to 14 years are tested at six-month intervals.  The majority of the taxi groups were very supportive of the changes recommended by the committee I chaired.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I brought this matter to Dublin City Council a few years ago when I was a councillor and all Labour councillors supported not having a nine-year rule.  Action 10, which the Minister of State mentioned, clearly outlines why this is being done.  It states that the system was based on vehicle inspection and mileage, and that it was too expensive to develop and operate.  We have been operating this system for many years and have not had the complaints or the reason to change the system.Does the Minister of State intend giving the RSA responsibility for all taxi vehicle testing?  Is that part of the future plan?  The RSA seems to be taking over everything for which the local authorities previously had responsibility.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	239	On the latter question, no firm decisions have been made in that area but it is being investigated.  The Deputy seems to imply that the taxi drivers did not speak about the requirement to change the nine-year rule previously.  The drivers we met understood that consumers needed to have confidence in their vehicles.  The consumer groups' representatives on the committee stated clearly that they expected a very modern fleet.  Bearing this in mind and given the financial difficulties in which the drivers find themselves, this was the compromise reached.  It is a compromise that was welcomed by the consumer groups and the taxi industry.  It recognises those drivers who have cars and have been in the industry for many years - preceding 2009 - and generally many of them are full-time drivers.  They are allowed to hold on to their cars for 14 years.  This is a very effective and good compromise.  It instils confidence in consumers, who know that they need to pass the standards test and an NCT every six months, which is appropriate.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	240	The Deputy's question relates to commercial bus service licensing by the National Transport Authority and the impact on Bus Éireann services.  I have no function in this matter.  The responsibility for the licensing of public bus passenger services was transferred under Statutory Instrument No. 566 of 2010 from my Department to the National Transport Authority with effect from 1 December 2010.The NTA published, in November 2010, new guidelines for the licensing of public bus services which set out the basis for a reformed licensing system for commercial bus passenger services in the State.  The guidelines identify commercial bus passenger services as a key part of public transport services in the State.  These guidelines are available on the NTA's website and include details of the objectives and factors taken into account in considering an application for a licence.Bus Éireann's Expressway services are subject to this licensing regime.  It is important that the company responds to the challenge of increased competition and the drop in demand for public transport services by continuing to enhance the passenger experience including through service improvements, such as the introduction of new and modern Wi-Fi enabled vehicle and improved customer information.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I am raising the issue owing to the concerns of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann workers who are members of the NBRU who see an increasing privatisation of public transport.  The concern is the issuing of licences by the National Transport Authority to the private operators to compete with Bus Éireann on intercity routes, including Dublin to Cork etc., and the commercially viable routes upon which Bus Éireann depends to help subsidise loss-making routes.The Government's action plan for jobs proposed to examine opening public service obligation routes after 2014.  Does the Minister agree this contravenes section 10 of the Public Transportation Regulation Act 2009, which states that consideration be given to the impact proposed new services would have on existing PSO services?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I will first answer about Expressway.  As the Deputy is aware Expressway covers interurban services.  It is already deregulated and is fully competitive.  Bus Éireann has made profits out of its Expressway services in the past.  While Expressway is not currently profitable, it could become profitable again.  The NTA adjudicates on whether licences are given on those routes.  Bus Éireann has expressed concern to me and to the Minister of State regarding the number of licences granted on some of those routes.  At the same time the NTA is the regulator making that decision on Expressway and decides the number of routes that are viable.  There are differing views among Bus Éireann, the private operators and consumers as to what the appropriate number of services should be.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The Minister should take into consideration the impact of this on the revenue, jobs and service of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  It would lead to increased fares, increased subvention, less service and fewer jobs.  That needs to be taken into consideration before any further licensing that is granted.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I agree that needs to be taken into consideration.  CIE and the CIE companies are State-owned companies.  We always take in mind that we want State-owned companies to be successful.  It is also important to bear in mind that some of the new intercity private bus services are very popular.  Passengers like the quality of service to be very good and find them relatively inexpensive.  Of course jobs are created by those services, which means the net number or people employed may be much the same.On the Deputy's other question, while I do not know that particular section of the Act, the PSO licences for Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann expire at the end of 2014.  In line with the action plan for jobs and the programme for Government, the NTA, in conjunction with the Government, is exploring options for offering out those contracts or parts of those contracts to tender, but no decisions have been made in that regard.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	245	The Deputy asked if I will refuse any application to raise clamping charges in view of the increased pressures already felt by motorists.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to regulate the vehicle clamping industry.  In this regard, I presented a discussion document to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht in December 2011 in which I outlined the principal issues to be addressed in regulating the industry and my proposals on the shape of appropriate legislation, and I invited their views.  This was the first time a committee was asked to participate in the drafting of legislation at the pre-heads of Bill or principles stage.The committee, of which the Deputy is a member, responded to me on 28 March in a comprehensive report which contained a number of recommendations, many of which will be reflected in the resulting legislation.  In its report, the committee made specific recommendations on the level of de-clamping fees, to which I will give careful consideration when framing the legislation.  It is my intention to bring my proposals for legislation on vehicle clamping to Government in the coming weeks.The current maximum de-clamping fee that may be charged by public authorities for parking offences on public land was set by statute in 1998 at £65 which, with the introduction of the euro, converted to €80.  I have received no formal application to have that fee increased and I have no proposals to do so.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I welcome the clarification.  Motorists in this city had expressed some concern over a Dublin City Council report, which seemed to suggest it was interested in increasing the charge to €130.It was also expected that a request to the Minister might come in advance of him having had an opportunity to have the final legislation drafted.  I welcome the fact that it is not the Minister's intention to address clamping or any changes to it in advance of the legislation.  Will the Minister confirm that is his intention and will he confirm that in the event of any application from Dublin City Council or any other local authority, he will refuse those applications pending the outcome of the publication and enactment of the legislation?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I can confirm that.  I have not received any application from Dublin City Council or any other council.  I can increase the cap by order, but I am not going to do so if asked.  I want to build on the recommendations made by the joint committee and bring legislation to the House.  The recommendation made by the joint committee was that the release fees should be reasonable and that clamping should not be used as a profit generating exercise.  The committee recommended the prescribing of a band of release fees, ranging from a minimum to a maximum amount and that it should be a reserved function of local authorities to set the release fees most appropriate to their administrative are.  That is probably a good proposal and the appropriate time to put that proposal into law is when we have the new legislation.  In the meantime, I will not be granting any requests to increase clamping fees.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	248	This question relates to proposals for integrated rural transport.  Following a Government decision  last January I allocated responsibility for the rural transport programme, RTP, and for the integration agenda to the National Transport Authority, NTA.  I also announced the establishment  of the national integrated rural transport committee, NIRTC, chaired by the NTA to oversee a more focused and coherent approach to the integration of local and rural transport.  The committee is drawn from organisations representing key stakeholders including rural transport groups, Bus Éireann, the HSE, Pobal, local authorities and policy makers from relevant Departments.At its meeting last Friday, the committee established sub-groups to examine four key areas including health related transport services; schools transport service integration; logistics such as trip-booking systems, ticketing and information; and appropriate structures to support integration, including the key role of local authorities.  These groups will involve other stakeholders in their work and will seek input from appropriate sources.The NTA, in conjunction with the committee, will manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport in order to achieve greater synergies, meet identified transport needs and deliver value for money for the Exchequer.  A key to progressing this agenda is the decision to develop proposals for a number of model areas.  These model areas  will, with an evidence based approach, test how integrated local and rural transport services can best operate and how savings can be achieved across the various transport services.  The outcome of the model  areas will inform the wider national roll out of integrated rural transport services on an incremental basis. The NTA, in  conjunction with the committee, will select the models and submit them to me for approval.  I expect to announce these in the near future.This new approach, which is endorsed by the Government, is the first time that a national focus and coherence has been brought to the delivery on an integrated rural transport service.  This reflects the importance that the Government attaches to the contribution that a carefully designed and efficient rural transport service based on local needs will make to overcoming social exclusion in rural areas.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	249	That is good news.  It will be even better news if the talk turns into action.  The Minister of State lives in rural Ireland and as he knows, a proper integrated rural transport system would be a huge boon to rural areas.  It would help people with disabilities in particular to live more independently.  When I was canvassing for the 2009 local elections I was struck by the frequency with which the issue of rural transport arose, particularly when I visited a house where there was an English person or someone from outside the country, although this was an issue that had not arisen much in the previous five years.  It struck me then that as someone living in rural Ireland, I was not ambitious enough for the service we had.  These people seemed to think the provision of rural transport services should be the norm.It is clear there are significant resources.  We have school buses that are idle when school is closed and when pupils are not being brought to and from school and we have services paid for by the HSE that are duplicated and unco-ordinated.  For example, we might have two people travelling on a bus on a 20-mile journey and two other people on a similar bus going to the same place at the same time, all paid for by the HSE.  I am pleased to hear a committee has been set up to consider an integrated approach, but we need action.  That would bring about a good situation.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I thank the Deputy for his comments.  As the Deputy knows, mine is a very rural constituency and this issue is something about which I am very passionate.  I thank him for his support for the initiative.  Much of this is common sense.  The issue should not be about rural transport, but about transport in rural areas, which should not be a different issue than for other areas.  People who live in rural areas deserve transport as much as people in urban areas.  However, there are huge challenges.  We need to face reality.  We cannot continue with a situation where the level of spend on taxis on non-acute HSE services increases every year when that money could be utilised better in an integrated approach to transport.  Nor can we continue with the situation relating to school transport, where we have buses left parked on the side of the road for a number of hours a day and left idle over the summer months.However, there are larger issues.  Local authorities need to be involved in this because of the issues relating to co-ordination.  We also need to be aware of what other issues outside of transport we need to deal with when we try to integrate the services so as to ensure that transport services can be delivered.  For example, we need to look at the issue of the scheduling of medical appointments in hospitals in order to develop a coherent transport policy that will allow us ensure people can travel on the one bus.  All these issues are being examined.  The group is considering the model areas and I hope to be able to announce them in the near future.  These will look at the issues raised by the Deputy and myself here.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	251	This is a very good idea but we need action.  We have had plenty of good ideas that have never been followed through.  It seems to take years to develop programmes and the sooner this is done the better for me, the Minister of State and all those living in rural areas.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	252	The junior certificate is, in the first instance, a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  However, I believe that the reformed junior certificate, and the proposed short courses in particular, offer significant opportunities for important cross-subject learning.  Education in the area of road safety is one such possibility.The Road Safety Authority's current approach to road safety education is to deliver road user education in a cumulative, age appropriate approach commencing in preschool settings, through to third level and on into community settings.  Road safety education ensures all road users develop appropriate attitudes and safe behaviours.  The authority's road safety educational programmes are not currently compulsory but are aligned with the relevant curriculum strands in each educational setting.While we have made significant progress on road safety in recent years, we need to continue to focus on ways of making our roads safer.  A key factor in road safety is driver behaviour, and education clearly has an important role in influencing the behaviour of existing and future drivers.  The proposed development of the junior cycle programme presents opportunities for the Road Safety Authority to further develop its existing road safety programme, Streetwise.  This programme could be developed  to take advantage of the proposed short courses - 100 hours - or integrated into the priority learning units outlined in "Towards a Framework for the Junior Cycle: Proposals for Junior Cycle Development".   I continue to engage with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, with a view to progressing this matter, and will keep the House advised of such progress.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I appreciate the Minister does not have an input in the design of the junior certificate but his intervention with regard to the need to include some road safety training in the junior certificate programme could be critical.  A few years ago I visited a secondary school in my county.The teacher told me she had a group of boys in the class whom she could keep engaged only by promising that if they were quiet and participated in class she would take them out afterwards and show them the engine in her new car.  There is an interest in the mechanics of the car, among boys in particular, although I do not exclude the female student population.  We should harness this positivity.  We should look at what is happening in Finland, in that country's education process, whether it is the use of simulators, having self-evaluation or even bringing driving instructors into schools.  We can tease out the details but I welcome that the Minister is exploring the idea of incorporating this into the junior certificate.  I look forward to his work with the Minister for Education and Skills.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I very much welcome the Deputy's comments.  This is certainly something we will consider in the context of the next road safety strategy which is in the process of being formulated.  There are already many road safety programmes in schools, such as the Simon and Friends preschool programme, the Be Safe programme or the annual back to school campaigns.  They offer a great deal of education in road safety that was not available in schools in the past, certainly not when we were in school.  In addition, some local authorities have road safety officers, which is important.  The proposal now being developed is to make this type of education one of the modules a student can take for the new junior certificate.  It would not be compulsory but I imagine it would be very popular, particularly with young men, especially if it allowed them to do the theory test or make some progress towards getting a driving licence.  Obviously, this is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills rather than for me but it is one of the areas we are working on together.  In addition, there is a possibility of making sports one of the modular subjects in the new junior certificate.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I agree with the Minister.  It is important that we improve teaching in this area in schools.  I note, too, we have a fairly good record in road safety.  In 2009, an OECD report on road deaths and risks in Ireland showed fewer deaths per capita, per vehicle and per billion vehicular kilometre than in Finland.  I know we can improve but if we are beating Finland we must be doing something right.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The question concerns  the remit of the Irish Sports Council.  In November 2011, the Government announced its programme of public service reform.  A key deliverable of the reform programme will be the radical streamlining of State bodies.  This measure will deliver enhanced service efficiencies and will offer significant long-term savings in the operation of State bodies through the sharing of back-office administrative functions and other services.In regard to the sports bodies, the plan provides that legislation is to be published in 2012 to enable the merger of the National Sports Campus Development Authority and the Irish Sports Council in 2013.  The merging of these two bodies will deliver a more streamlined sports structure at national level.My Department is currently examining the issues involved in merging the two bodies and any changes to the remit of the bodies will be reflected in the legislation.  My officials are consulting with the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority on issues that arise during this process.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I welcome the Minister's statement on the amalgamation of, or reduction in quangos, about which he talked a great deal before the election.  As Minister, however, he has a responsibility to set forward a strategy for the continuing development of sport in this country.  Although I am aware the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is currently in the process of assigning moneys set aside to develop a sports infrastructure in the various constituencies around the country, it is important that this is done with a strategic focus.  To that extent, I am aware there had been discussions during the tenure of the previous Government about working with local authorities to ensure there was no duplication of effort across different counties and that, where possible, there was the capacity by different codes to share facilities and resources.  I recognise the limited resources available and am aware of the pressure on the Government in that regard.  Any money spent, therefore, must be spent with a strategic eye.I would welcome if the Minister were to outline for us whether the Government is prepared to leave this to the various sporting organisations, providing them with money on an ad hoc basis when it is available or whether it will form part of an overall strategic approach that would see not only the development of the infrastructure, but the development of skills.  That would mean the sporting organisations were collectively responsible for ensuring that Ireland developed its sporting potential to the highest standard possible.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I should say that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, sends his apologies.  He is on his way to Brussels for a meeting of European sports Ministers.In fairness to the Government, we do not merely talk about reducing the number of State agencies, we have actually done it.  Coaching Ireland has been merged into the Sports Council, Dublin Tourism into Fáilte Ireland, and, as the Deputy knows, today there will be a reconfiguration of Shannon Development.The point Deputy Dooley makes is absolutely correct.  Too often in the past grants were given to sports clubs and local authorities on an ad hoc basis.  Often two clubs with very good facilities may be close to one another while down the road in another locality there are no facilities.  In part, this was historic because in the past clubs were not prepared to share facilities or open up their grounds to other codes.  In newly developed areas that is less of a problem because, by and large, when new schools are built they incorporate a community centre with sports facilities alongside which are open to the entire community.  It is hard to retrofit that into more established areas but we are doing two things to drive it.  The first is the national sports facility strategy which is currently under consideration by the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and me and is due to be published in the coming weeks.  The second is the criteria for the current round of sports capital grants which give additional points to applicants who are willing to open up their grounds or facilities to more than one user.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Although I welcome the idea of shared resources, does the Minister have a concern there might be a loss of volunteerism, or of funding from his Department?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I do not believe so.  It is merely that funds are scarce, much more so than in the past and increasingly it makes sense for clubs to team up with schools or to come together and agree to share facilities where they can.  One of the most interesting models I have seen is in France, where almost every municipality has a very high quality municipal sports centre which is shared by different clubs and bodies.  That seems to work very well.  Obviously, it is hard to retrofit this model in older established areas where it has not been the norm.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	261	This question relates to the roll out of real time passenger information signs  at bus stops.Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority  on 1 December 2009, the implementation of public transport infrastructure projects in the greater Dublin area, such as real time passenger information, now comes under the remit of the authority.  The authority's functions were subsequently extended by ministerial order to include provision of real time passenger information to the four major regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, and the contiguous areas of those counties.  In the light of the authority's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to it.  The authority will respond directly with details of the ongoing development of the real time passenger information system.  The Deputy should advise my private office if he does not receive a reply within ten working days.I have been advised that recent independent surveys carried out on behalf of the National Transport Authority at a number of stop locations in Dublin indicated that 93% of buses arrived within three minutes of the due time indicated on the real time passenger information sign.  This level of accuracy compares very favourably with the best international real time passenger information systems for buses.  As I am sure the Deputy will agree, the provision of real time passenger information has enhanced the public service for users of the bus service.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I welcome the Minister of State's outlining of the current situation in respect of real time information which is an integral part of enhancing the commuter's user experience.  Concern was expressed to us by a number of people who believed the information was not quite so accurate.  The Minister of State will be familiar with that, however, as one will always hear complaints of this kind.  However, it is important that the Government remains committed to the continued roll-out of this service and that it ensures that any teething problems are dealt with quickly and efficiently.  As is the case with many such services, if they are rolled out widespread at too early a stage people end up by not having confidence in them.  It is very hard to revisit the system and get people to have confidence in it.  I welcome the information provided and look forward to the Minister's continued oversight.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	264	This is a great initiative and it should be rolled out further.  I was very surprised to see it in large working-class areas and it is working very well.  There have been complaints but, by and large, it is very good.  The apps have been a major success, with tens of thousands of people downloading various apps that provide information.  Initiatives such as this could encourage visitors to use the apps, as could functions to allow users to determine fares for their journeys.  It would enhance the experience of tourists.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	265	As someone who uses Dublin Bus regularly, the information service is excellent.  Using it in conjunction with the Dublin Bus app is a marked improvement.  It is important to continue the roll-out to those living in outlying areas, where the information is not available.  There are fewer options and a lower frequency service for those people, which means delays and waiting times have a significant impact on journey times.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  The real-time passenger information signs have been a great success.  The feedback to the Department has been fantastic.  There were teething problems in some areas but, by and large, they were dealt with very quickly.  There are plans to roll out 500 signs in the greater Dublin area.  Some 393 have been rolled out and 27 have been rolled out in Cork, which is 50% complete.  Galway and Limerick cities are next in line and the roll-out is expected to be completed by the end of the year.  The text and phone service has been phenomenal and there have been 100,000 visits to the app site per day.  That number of requests is huge and shows that people use their phones to check bus times.  Passenger numbers will increase on buses over time because people know when buses are coming and experience the reliability of buses.  The technology used for these signs is excellent.  The signs are used for real-time passenger information but can also be used for further information, as required, to notify passengers of different issues.

The sports capital initiative, which was developed following discussions with the County and City Managers Association, allocated funding to projects that could increase participation in sports.  All local authorities were invited to submit applications for funding and every application received was assessed according to criteria set out in the letter to local authorities inviting applications.  All eligible applications were allocated funding.  In total 111 separate allocations were made with a total value of €4.5 million.The swimming pools allocations were also made on foot of an invitation to local authorities to submit applications to improve access for people with disabilities and/or to make pools more energy efficient.  In total 56 pools were allocated funding of €10.9 million.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	270	If I understand the Minister correctly, 110 applications were successful.  Does the Minister have the number of applications made?  This question has been tabled because of the concern, which is not a new phenomenon, that sports capital funding has been assigned to constituencies or counties where there is a Minister.  I do not want to get into the politics of it but Mayo came out particularly well on this occasion.  I am sure the Minister has information on the distribution of funds in the past that point to other Ministers from my side of the House.  The Government came to power and said it would do things differently and that there would be a more transparent approach to the dispersal of funds.  Either the Minister accepts the previous practice was fair and equitable and it was coincidental that constituencies and counties with senior Ministers were more successful because they were better able to apply for grants or the Minister has decided to adopt a practice that was heretofore unacceptable.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Deputy Dooley should not believe everything he reads in the newspapers.  Having been a Government party Member, I am sure he was amused by some of what he read in the newspaper, as I am now.  Some 111 applications were eligible and all eligible applications were granted funding.  Twice as many were ineligible.  Of the applications from County Clare, funding was granted to Lees Road Sports and Amenity Park in Ennis, which was eligible.  Three other applications were not eligible.  In two cases, the town council did not have title to land and in the third case, Kilrush, the land was owned by the ESB.  Very often, applications were not allowed because the applicant did not own the land or the project would not have been completed by the end of the year, as was required in order to gain funding.On a per capita basis, Sligo received the most funding, at €19.93.  Sligo does not have a senior Minister although it has a Minister of State.

Or a raw cash basis, Dublin got most as the most populous, at €1.74 million, followed by Cork, the second most populous, at €1.41 million.  Everything that is in the newspapers may be the truth but not the whole truth.  The past two Ministers with responsibility for sport made allocations proportionate to the populations of counties.  Perhaps that was not the case for those who preceded the last two Ministers.

On the issue of local authority grants, if a local authority such as Wexford County Council gives a builder over €500,000 to build a road for a development that may happen in the future, does the funding come from the local authority or from central funding?

It depends on the road in question.  I do not know the answer to Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan's question but I undertake to ensure the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, responds to him in correspondence.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 239 together.  The Government recognises that tourism is important to all regions, employing an estimated 180,000 people, many in rural areas.  The jobs initiative introduced last year and the Government's action plan for jobs 2012 recognise the vital contribution of tourism to employment, economic activity and foreign revenue earnings.  The VAT reduction on a range of labour-intensive tourism services from 13.5% to 9%, enhances the competitiveness of our tourism product.  The visa waiver scheme is encouraging visitors from emerging markets to include a visit to Ireland when visiting the UK.  The Government has also significantly reduced the cost of employing people by halving employers' PRSI for employees on modest wages.In addition, the necessary structures to deliver The Gathering Ireland 2013, a major tourism development to attract overseas visitors to all parts of Ireland, have been put in place with the target of bringing an extra 325,000 visitors here in 2013.  The initiative will be launched domestically this Friday, following successful international and trade launches in recent weeks.The year 2011 saw a welcome recovery in overseas visitor numbers with year-on-year growth of 6%.  While there was a marginal decrease in overseas visits in the first three months of this year, I understand that industry partners are positive about prospects for the year, with reports of advance bookings and inquiries being up on this time last year.  Industry representative groups are hopeful we can achieve our target of a 4.5% increase in visitor numbers for the year.The Government is providing over €143 million to support tourism in 2012 across a range of activities including overseas and domestic marketing, investment in tourism product and vital business supports to develop tourism across Ireland, in both rural and urban areas.   I am satisfied tourism agencies are taking the necessary steps to support the sector at national and regional level.

I also welcome the confirmation by the Minister that the 9% VAT rate will remain until the end of 2013 as this is a positive development.I wish to raise the issue of the Cinderella regions of the country as regards tourism promotion and the midlands is one of those areas which has fallen well short when compared to other parts of the country.  I am sure the Aire Stáit's county of Tipperary has the same problem.  Is it planned to reconfigure the tourism regions?  For example, there is the ludicrous situation where the River Shannon is a boundary for tourism regions rather than being used as an asset or for the development of tourism with a specific focus on the river itself.  Has consideration been given to encouraging
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	286	There are currently no proposals to reconfigure the regions as this has been a recent reorganisation.  I am not sure to what extent tourists even recognise the existence of regions in any case.  People tend to visit destinations rather than a region created by a tourism body.  People have been travelling to traditional tourism hot spots to which visitors have travelled for centuries and these destinations tend to do very well, such as Killarney, Galway and Dublin.  It is a challenge to get people to go to other areas which are less visited and should be visited much more, the midlands being a case in point.Dublin Tourism is being reintegrated into Fáilte Ireland and it will be used to disperse tourists who stay in Dublin by encouraging them to visit other parts of the country such as the areas around Dublin and beyond and ideally, for them to spend a night in these areas.  One of the factors mitigating against overnight stays by tourists is the great improvement in the road network.  It is now very common for visitors to take day trips to Clare and the Cliffs of Moher, for example or to other parts of the country whereas in the past they would have stayed the night.  It would be desirable to have events at night to persuade them to stay later in a region and perhaps overnight.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I take the Minister's point but it is also important to develop packages so tourists visit more locations other than Clonmacnoise, on whichever side of the Shannon.  The difficulty arises when different regions are in place.  I acknowledge that Tourism Ireland is focusing on Athlone and developing tourism packages in that area.  Hopefully this should bring about a positive development.I ask the Minister to spearhead a proposal to bring together the Office of Public Works, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the tourism agencies and even the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to develop the types of tourism for the midlands such as heritage tourism.  Issues about access can be dealt with by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the upgrading of facilities can be arranged by the OPW and the National Parks and Wildlife Services.  I refer as an example to Lough Ree which has an abundance of heritage assets.  A total of 2.5 million tourists visited those type of facilities last year in various parts of the country.  I refer also to activity and walking tourism with a total of 750,000 tourists last year.  The midlands has plenty of capacity to develop this sector of tourism.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I am not sure I can spearhead such an initiative but if the Deputy has specific proposals I would be happy to have a meeting with him to see what can be done in this regard and involving those agencies.  The most visited OPW site is the Rock of Cashel which is not situated in a traditional tourism hot spot, in the core of Ireland.  It is crucial to develop a cluster of attractions because people are more likely to stay.  There has been a lot happening on the development of activity tourism, in particular cycling and walking tourism, through the development of green ways and if we can afford it, the development of cycle and walking routes across Ireland which is a good way to bring people off the beaten track and encourage them to stay overnight in places they would not otherwise consider.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I thank the Minister for his response.  The Gathering is a significant initiative and I am delighted to hear it is being launched this Friday.  People have been very enthusiastic about it.  However, like many other Deputies, I ask about the arrangements and the criteria for funding under the scheme.  I ask what levels of co-operation exist between the Minister's Department and the cultural and tourism bodies and the local authorities regarding the Gathering initiative.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I refer to the Gathering initiative and what Deputy Naughten said about the Cinderella areas.  If ever there was an area for growth it is the area that I come from, the Leitrim-Roscommon area bordering the Shannon.  All of the ingredients are there.  When it comes to the Gathering initiative, the ingredients are certainly there, considering that for all of my lifetime and for my father's lifetime, the only thing we could ever do was leave the area and emigrate and move to a different part of the world.  From the point of view of the Gathering initiative, there will be any amount of people coming back and from the point of view of having ingredients, they are all there.  We have the longest border with the mightiest river in these two islands.  I come from south Leitrim and Roscommon.  Only one eighth of the amount of money spent on tourism in Galway is spent in our county.  I am not saying we will ever reach the level of Galway but to aspire to reach one third of the level spent in Galway would lead to increases in revenue of €90 million and at €30,000 for every job that is created, there is the potential to create 3,000 jobs.  Instead of concentrating on the areas that everyone normally visits, I am trying to get a six foot eight man to reach to seven foot, which will never happen.  We must try to get the ones that have growth potential and then jobs will be created.  We have the ingredients and the Minister is the baker, so bake them.
#BrianWalsh	unknown-#BrianWalsh-party	unknown-#BrianWalsh-dob	unknown-#BrianWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	291	The final leg of the Volvo ocean race visits Galway city this July.  One of the events being organised by Let's Do It Global is a global village which will promote Irish food, innovation, the marine and tourism.  Given that 350 accredited members of the media from participating countries including China, Canada and the United States, will be in Galway, does the Minister agree this presents an opportunity to promote the Gathering initiative?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The website for the Gathering initiative is now active and it contains the information.  The initiative will be launched on this Friday and more information will be available then.  The events and festivals programme is not yet fully developed but we are getting there.  There has been engagement with the City and County Managers' Association and also with the cultural institutions.  The Gathering initiative should not be regarded as a source of grant aid because it is about what people and communities can do and what they can contribute.  There will be some funding for existing festivals but it is not intended that thousands of grants will be distributed to bodies, towns or families organising events.  That is just not possible.  It is important to get that message out and understood.  We will certainly set up a platform by which we can assist people to organise gatherings, but we will not be handing out money for people to organise gatherings beyond a limited number of festivals and events.As regards Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan's question, I think the ingredients are there in many parts of the country.  Places such as Killarney and Westport, which have led the way in tourism in many ways, look at it differently from the way the Deputy does.  They say they are the bakers who will take the lead for their areas.  In Westport, all the hoteliers contribute to a fund which is used to market the town.  Killarney has been co-operating like that for a long time also.  The Government can assist but the bakers are the people on the ground who make the most of what they have, and perhaps do not expect No. 44 Kildare Street to do it for them.The Volvo Ocean Race will be a great event and I am very much looking forward to it.  I do not know if there are plans to market The Gathering at it, but I agree with Deputy Walsh, given the number of journalists attending, it makes sense to do so.  I will certainly take that up with The Gathering's project team.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 22 together.The Deputies' questions relate to the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus.  Two working groups were established by the Government in 2011 on State asset disposals, one to consider the best approach in progressing the proposed part-sale of ESB, and the other to undertake a similar analysis of a number of other State assets identified by Government as potential candidates for disposal.  The State's remaining 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus was considered as part of this group of assets.  Both of these working groups completed their work in 2011 and reported to Ministers in December 2011.  NewERA was centrally involved in this process together with all relevant Departments including mine.  It was on the basis of the analysis undertaken by these two working groups that the Government agreed to the list of asset disposals announced on 22 February.In relation to Aer Lingus, the Government considers that the State's remaining shareholding in the company is no longer a strategic asset as it does not enable the Government to determine Aer Lingus policy on issues such as the use of the airline's landing slots at Heathrow Airport.  Accordingly, the Government has decided that the State's remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus will be sold at an appropriate time, but only when market conditions are favourable and at an acceptable price to be agreed by Government.My Department is working in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and NewERA, to examine the potential options for the disposal of the State's stake and the issues that may need to be addressed in the context of the disposal of the stake.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	294	It is disappointing that we are even considering the sale of Aer Lingus, which has been a flagship for this country for so many years.  If we were to sell it at today's price of 97 cent per share, it would bring in approximately €160 million.  In terms of a cost-benefit analysis, I do not know whether we would get value from selling it off given the effect on tourism, the jobs we have lost and the accessibility of Aer Lingus for people here, on the Continent and elsewhere .We know the Minister has been in talks with other companies.  At one stage, Ryanair said it was interested and Etihad Airways has also shown some interest.  Is there any truth in the rumours that some of these companies are pitching for Aer Lingus?  It has been mentioned in the Sunday Business Post that approaches were made.  The Minister may be keeping tight-lipped about the matter but I would be interested to know.  I do not believe it is in our interest to sell Aer Lingus.

It would not be appropriate for me to meet with individual potential buyers.  It is being done through a group made up of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and my Department, and is led by NewERA.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I appreciate Deputy Ellis letting me in on this particular question.  There were some media reports about a board meeting of Aer Lingus, which was due to take place last Friday.  Part of the leaks in advance seemed to suggest that there was an item on the agenda concerning the consolidation of Aer Lingus maintenance activities on the grounds of the campus at Dublin Airport.  Can the Minister give us any insight into that?  In the context of today's announcement on Shannon, the Minister has set the future for the region based on activities which are ancillary to passenger activity, as to providing future employment potential at the airport.  It is my view that if Aer Lingus, as the national carrier - or, at least, a carrier with a significant national shareholding - was to move its maintenance from Shannon to Dublin it would be somewhat belittling for the Government's policy to set Shannon as a centre of excellence for ancillary aircraft maintenance and general activity in that regard.

It is a plc which the Government does not own or control.  I cannot answer questions on behalf of Aer Lingus, or on behalf of Transaero for that matter.  When I read reports about this in the media, which is where I heard about it, I contacted the chairman of Aer Lingus and the Government representatives on the Aer Lingus board to express my concerns.  I impressed on them the Government's view that it is important to maintain employment in the mid-west.

This is a day-to-day operational matter for Iarnród Éireann and not one in which I have any role.I have, however, been informed by Iarnród Éireann that the stations at Midleton, Carrigtwohill, Glounthaune and Little Island in County Cork have car parks which are charged on the same basis as commuter stations through the Iarnród Éireann network.  Cash charges of €3 per day or €10 per week are payable via the car park pay and display machines.  Alternatively, customers can use the "PaybyText" system at a cost of €2 per day or €8 per week.I will ask Iarnród Éireann to respond to the specific  concerns the Deputy has about parking policy at these stations.  If he does not receive a response within ten days, I would ask him to contact my private office.

The initiative is aimed at supporting the creation and maintenance of employment as well as helping tourism businesses to lower their cost base.  This allows those businesses to offer a more competitive product offering to tourists.Recent data from the CSO shows that prices as measured in the restaurant and hotels index are at pre-2008 levels, while the recreation and culture index shows prices are at 2006 levels.  In pursuing these objectives, I was pleased to see that overseas visitor numbers increased by 6% in 2011.  While there has been a marginal reduction in overseas visits in the first three months of 2012, indications from industry representative groups are positive with inquiries and advance bookings for the coming months ahead of those at the same time last year.  Tourism Ireland is targeting growth in overseas visitor numbers of 4.5% in 2012.Following recent discussions with the Minister for Finance, I can confirm to Deputy McHugh that I have obtained his assurance that the lower rate of VAT will be maintained throughout 2013 so that businesses, tour operators and customers alike can continue with their planning for the 2013 season with the assurance that the 9% rate will apply.  Moreover, 2013 is the year of The Gathering, during which we hope to bring an extra 325,000 visitors to Ireland, and the lower VAT rate will be an important contribution in this regard.  The maintenance of the lower rate, particularly in the context of continued pressure on the public finances, is a further example of the importance which the Government attaches to the tourism industry and the contribution it can make to economic recovery.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I welcome this announcement which is significant.  As regards the reduction of 9%, when the wheel is not broken it is important not to fix it.  Having spoken to many people in labour-intensive restaurants, the real difference in moving from 13.5% to 9% is whether it permits them to stay in business.  That is how significant this matter is.  The Minister is working on a range of measures, be it the tourist visa waiver, on which he is working with Minister Deputy Shatter, or his announcement, in an Irish Independent supplement entitled “Tee Time in Donegal”, of links courses in the north west recently.  He can help to create the proper environment at a political level or dimension but grassroots leadership is also required.  Last weekend Daniel O’Donnell, a household name in the UK and in Ireland, opened a Daniel O’Donnell visitor centre in Dungloe.  I spoke to Jim White, a former Member of this House, last weekend and he told me he will be bringing 10,100 German tourists to Donegal between now and October.  Local leadership will be shown once a proper political environment is provided.I welcome this measure.  It is a good news story for people in the restaurant business.  That business is labour intensive and this measure will mean the difference between restaurants staying or going out of business.  It is a positive announcement.I wish to refer to a previous question related to the traditional patterns of tourists.  There is a traditional triangular tourist trail.  Tourists who came into Dublin would have gone to Killarney, travelled to Galway and perhaps up as far as Mayo and then back to Dublin.  That is the extent of the lifespan of the tourist trail.  We have to change that and we will do it.  We will look at the spin off from Derry being the City of Culture next year, our being a host port for Tall Ships Race this year and the Royal Portrush staging the Irish Open.  There will be spin offs for counties such as Deputy ‘Ming' Flanagan's if we start to work with our northern counterparts.  Let us create a new triangular trail.  Let us get tourists into Belfast, over as far as the Giant's Causeway and into Donegal.  Let us be positive.  A day such as today is a positive one and I welcome this announcement.

The reduction in the VAT rate has been successful in increasing employment in the sector and it is clear that, by and large, it has been passed on to consumers.  It is important the reduced rate be continued until the end of 2013.  That was always the intention.  That was the announcement made at the time of the introduction of the jobs initiative and it is what is on the Revenue notice.  There was some uncertainty about it earlier in the year and the tourism industry lobbied hard to make sure it had certainty on this.  Having discussed it with the Minister for Finance, I am glad he is willing to allow us to give certainty in order that the industry will know what prices it will charge for next year.Regarding the opportunities for Donegal, I agree strongly with Deputy McHugh's comments.  There is a huge opportunity there to build on what is happening in the North.  With the ongoing improvements on the A5, it will make it easier to get to and from the county.

How does one differentiate between visitors overseas and the hundreds of thousands of people who have left and will leave the country and come back to visit their families for a week?  Is there a way of differentiating between those visitors?  If there is not, the more who emigrate, the more our tourism industry will thrive in the coming years.  My brother likes to come home every now and then but he is not a tourist.

I point to the importance of the Minister liaising with his northern counterpart on the issue of tourism investment and ensuring tourists are attracted to visit counties such as Donegal.  With the opportunities that will arise in the near future with Derry being a host port for the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race and it being the City of Culture next year, tourist offices in Northern towns will be key in directing tourists to visit those counties.  It was difficult in the past to get tourists to visit the northern part of the country, understandably because of the fact that we are so close to the North and there were probably not the required interlinkages.  I commend him on his golf initiative covered in the Irish Independent.  I ask that in his marketing strategy he gives particular attention to the points I made.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I welcome the Minister's announcement on the VAT rate.  It was great to see the number of English tourists who were over for the racing festival at Punchestown two weeks ago.  The retaining of the low VAT rate will ensure festivals such as Punchestown and race meetings around the country will benefit from it.On Deputy ‘Ming' Flangan's point, a Dublin Bus driver who drives one of the hop on hop off tourist buses told me recently that the number of tourists around the city of Dublin is much higher than it has been for the past number of years.  The sort of initiative the Minister has shown today is extremely welcome.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I welcome the Deputies' comments.  I do my best to keep in close contact with my Northern counterpart, Arlene Foster.  We even managed to attend a rugby match in Ravenhill together two weeks ago.  We try to keep in contact as much as possible.  One thing I would like to see happen which has not happened yet is for Derry to get involved in the Gathering, particularly with it being the City of Culture next year and the various events that will happen in 2013.  Even if Northern Ireland as an entity does not get involved in the Gathering, perhaps Derry might decide do so on its own bat.  That would be positive for Derry and Donegal.On Deputy ‘Ming' Flanagan's question, we do get a breakdown of such visitors.  It comes later in the year.  The numbers are broken down into holidaymakers, business tourists and VFRs who are people visiting friends and relatives.  What we cannot break down within the category of those visiting friends and relatives is how many of them are returning migrants and how many of them are people who have moved abroad perhaps permanently who come back to visit friends and relatives.  We know they bring money into the economy, spend money here and they go to events and attractions and so on.Written Answers follow Adjournment.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for putting this important issue on the agenda given its urgency.  I ask the Minister for Children and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, who is present, to intervene to ensure there will be Irish Government representation at a meeting being held by the Kazakhstani Adoption Authority this Friday in Kazakhstan to liaise with countries which would wish to have inter-country adoption agreements with Kazakhstan.  It is crucial that every action is taken by the Government to ensure we have representation at that meeting.  There reason is that many citizens in Ireland are keen to adopt from Kazakhstan, as are many families who have indicated an intention to adopt from other countries as well.  Were we not to ensure every opportunity is taken for Ireland to be represented at these talks with the Kazakhstani Government, it could lead to undue delays in trying to ensure that Kazakhstan is opened as a country through which we will have an agreement to have inter-country adoptions.This is all the more important because as a result of Ireland signing up to the Hague convention at the end of November 2010 we have seen a significant drop in the number of inter-country adoptions by Irish citizens.  Those adoptions have decreased from a high of 397 in 2008 to below 200 in 2010 and 2011.  Most of those adoptions were based on transitional agreements made with countries prior to Ireland's signing up to the Hague convention.  We are now in a position where Ireland must establish new procedures with many of the countries that have signed up to the Hague convention while also seeking to establish bilateral agreements with some of those countries that were the main base for previous Irish inter-country adoptions to ensure we can resume adoptions from those countries.In that context and in the context of the many citizens and families throughout the country who are willing to offer a loving home to children in need of that, it would be a major setback and disappointment for those families if the Minister of State and his Government did not take every step to ensure the opportunity of the meeting this Friday is taken up.  I understand the Adoption Authority of Ireland has been in touch with the Irish Embassy in Moscow with regard to this.  This would be the most appropriate way of ensuring at relatively short notice that Ireland is represented.  I see no reason this should not be the case.  What investigations has the Government undertaken to ensure this comes to pass and that we are represented at the meeting on Friday so we can ensure as soon as possible a process is established by which prospective Irish parents can apply for inter-country adoptions with Kazakhstan?
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  I am taking this topical issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.With effect from 1 November 2010, inter-country adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-Country Adoption, known as the Hague adoption convention, or with countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  Kazakhstan has ratified the convention.  The Hague adoption convention is a formal state-to-state agreement between countries developed on a multilateral basis.  It is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries mutually to support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the inter-country adoption process.  It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures mutually to assure countries of the safety and standard of inter-country adoptions in those countries.The Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, performs the function of a central authority under the Adoption Act 2010 in accordance with the convention.  In choosing to deal primarily with other Hague countries, the AAI has the mechanism to work collaboratively with equivalent structures in that country.  Each central authority has the responsibility to oversee standards in respect of those parts of the process taking place within their respective jurisdictions.  This mutual arrangement is designed to give the AAI, the Government and, most importantly, those involved in the adoption process assurance as to the standards being set and the oversight of the system.If a country has ratified the Hague adoption convention then the Adoption Authority of Ireland may establish administrative arrangements, as provided for in section 72 of the Adoption Act 2010.  The key difference between an administrative arrangement and a bilateral agreement is that governments are bound to one another by a bilateral agreement while administrative agreements are related to the sequence and process arrangements in place to support the safeguards already agreed between states.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland works with central authority counterparts in the establishment of administrative agreements while bilaterals are government to government agreements.In the case of Kazakhstan, the AAI has written to its counterpart central authority on three separate occasions, starting in September 2010, to begin the process of developing an administrative agreement for inter-country adoption.  To date there has been no reply from the Kazakhstani authorities on the matter.The AAI and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs became aware in the past two days that the Kazakhstani adoption authorities intend to hold a meeting on this coming Friday with representatives of Kazakhstani Government institutions and diplomatic representatives of foreign embassies and consulates.  It is important to state that neither the AAI nor the Irish embassy were made aware of the meeting by the Kazakhstani authorities.Unfortunately, it will not be possible for someone from the AAI to attend this meeting at such short notice.  The Irish Embassy in Russia has also informed the Department that it will not be possible for the embassy to attend the meeting in Kazakhstan on Friday afternoon and nor is it in a position to authorise any group to attend on its behalf.  However, the embassy, at the request of the AAI, will request information from the relevant authorities on the position for Irish couples hoping to adopt from Kazakhstan as soon as possible.  In this regard, the AAI has indicated it is willing to open discussions with the Kazakhstani authorities at any time.  In the interim the AAI is completing a review of Kazakhstan's adoption legislation.The Adoption Act 2010, which provides the legislative framework for adoption in Ireland, is designed to provide a framework to ensure all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child and to the highest possible standard.  The phrase "in the best interests of the child" is absolutely key in this regard.  It must not be forgotten that inter-country adoption is a service for those children who cannot be raised by their birth parents or cared for in their own country.  The interests of the child must always be paramount throughout the adoption process.  This is best achieved through the full implementation of the highest national and international standards governing adoption practice.  This is the primary concern for the Adoption Authority of Ireland in conducting its business as it relates to inter-country adoption.

It is simply not acceptable that this is the approach taken by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Government.  The reply made no reference to an effort having been made by the Government to establish whether an invitation would be issued for Irish attendance at the meeting in Kazakhstan.  All I heard is that no one is able to attend and that in the past year three letters were written by the Adoption Authority of Ireland to Kazakhstan without reply.  This is an opportunity for our country to become part of negotiations with the Kazakhstani Government to ensure inter-country adoption can be opened up.  It is not good enough to say the Government is willing to open negotiations at any time especially when communication has not been what it might have been over the past year.We should ensure we are represented at the meeting with the Kazakhstani Government at which will be representatives of other countries seeking to establish inter-country adoption agreements with Kazakhstan.  If we do not attend we will let down the many families throughout the country waiting on action from the Government and its engagement with the Kazakhstani authorities to establish an agreement whereby they can proceed with an inter-country adoption.  Many families have already adopted from Kazakhstan and are seeking to adopt again and ensure their child has a sibling from the same country.  It is not acceptable that the Minister of State can say the embassy in Moscow cannot attend this meeting.  The embassy in Moscow must send a representative.  Anything less than this does a grievous injustice to the families awaiting action from the Government to proceed with their adoptions.  Has the Government made contact with the Kazakhstani Government to see whether Ireland would be welcome at the meeting - I have no doubt we would - instead of coming to the House with a reply stating we cannot make it?
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The Government contacted the Kazakhstani Government on three occasions but received no response.  We were not officially notified of this meeting so there is no point in looking for a second invitation.  The meeting will take place and the Government became aware of it two days ago.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland is quite prepared to enter negotiations with the Kazakhstani Government on the potential inter-country adoption so it is disingenuous of the Deputy to say we are not fulfilling our duty.  We have made every possible attempt-----

This originates in the centralisation of CAO applications which has been flagged for some time but is due to be implemented in September.  I understand this involves new applications so it will mainly affect leaving certificate students applying for grants for the first time.We all witnessed the difficulties in the old system with delays and backlogs, particularly in recent years.  All public representatives have received appeals at local level to sort out those problems.However, the reason I raise this matter today is that there is a fear among some parents and students that what was a backlog at local level will now be 66 times greater and cause a total bottleneck at national level.  Local authorities in the past provided information evenings for parents and students on how to fill in forms and get them in on time and so forth.  What plans are in place to get this system up and running in a smooth, streamlined way that will not end up causing a bigger problem than the one it is designed to resolve?  Will there be information evenings or will information be provided through the schools?  Will there be help-lines and websites available?  Will applicants get quick responses to inquiries?  A positive aspect of the old system was that students or their parents were able to call to the local office and meet somebody face to face.  Will we be confronted with help-lines which nobody answers?  The success of this system will be gauged on how little public representatives are involved.  In other words, if it is successful and there are no problems, we will not hear about it.We saw what happened with the centralisation of the administration of medical cards.  While that situation has been alleviated to some extent, I am raising this matter in the Topical Issues Debate today because prevention is better than having to implement a cure when there is a crash under a mountain of applications.  The system will apply to new applicants, that is, students going into third level for the first time.  They have enough trauma and enough issues to overcome without being faced with a situation similar to that which has occurred in the past, where students were threatened with being unable to sit examinations because the grant had not been paid.  What plans are in place to ensure this system works?
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and I thank Deputy O'Mahony for raising this important matter.The Student Support Act became law last year, providing for fundamental reform of the student grants system.  In practice, what this means is that, instead of four different student grant schemes with different terms and conditions, there is now just one consolidated scheme which the Minister introduced in 2011.  The Minister has also made arrangements for the designation of a single grant-awarding authority under the Act, which will replace the existing 66 grant awarding bodies - local authorities and vocational education committees, VECs - for all new applications from 2012-13.  These developments will make it far easier for students applying for grants and should make the processing of applications more efficient and consistent.It is planned that the new universal online grant application system will go live from 28 May next.  It will be operated by Student Universal Support Ireland, or SUSI, which has been established as a unit of the City of Dublin VEC.  SUSI will commence operation for all new grant applicants for the 2012-13 academic year and it is intended that all new grant applications will be made online.  The new application process will be applicant-centred and aims to provide a more efficient service for the student.  The existing 66 grant awarding bodies will continue to deal with the renewal of applications for their existing grant-holders for the duration of their current courses.SUSI has a comprehensive communications plan which is already well under way.  Various stakeholder groups have been targeted, including school principals, guidance counsellors and existing awarding authorities.  Students themselves are being targeted through social media and other multimedia channels informing them about the role of SUSI and the process of grant application.  In addition, the communications strategy will be supported by print media advertisements in the national press and local and national radio.  Following the online launch, the availability of the grants online system will continue to be widely publicised.Another significant part of the customer service strategy is the SUSI support desk, which will deal with e-mail and telephone queries relating to the application process and grant scheme.  This support desk is already available during office hours and an extended service will be available when the online application system is launched.  The service will provide a comprehensive response to queries from students, parents and other information providers nationwide.The formulation of the 2012 student grant scheme is currently being finalised.  The 2012 scheme and regulations will be issued to coincide with the go-live date for the online grant applications system on 28 May 2012.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that this is a positive example of genuine public sector reform.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for his comments on it.  He will agree that the fundamental reforms being delivered in this area have the potential to be transformative in their effect.  The establishment of a single student grant awarding authority will provide both for significant improvements in the student experience of the grant system and for substantial efficiencies for the State in the administration of support to students to ensure access to higher education.This fundamental reform of the student grant system also represents a concrete development in meeting the objectives set out in the action plan for the education sector under the Croke Park agreement.  I believe it will ensure a better and more consistent level of customer service for all those who rely on these critical supports.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I welcome the Minister's comprehensive reply.  The key issue is to prepare the way, and all those methods of advertisement, including the website going live on 28 May, are welcome.  I am glad the Minister is using social media as well to convey the message.  If all this information is disseminated to the parents and students in advance, there will not be a problem.  The Minister referred to a help-line or telephone line.  Will applicants who use that line get to speak to somebody or will they be left hanging on?  This was the big issue in the medical card area, where people were left hanging on the telephone or had to leave a message but nobody got back to them.  The other issue that arose was where an application was not filled out correctly.  When further information was sent in, the original application and the new information were not connected.  These are the pitfalls that helped create the mayhem in the medical card system for the first six months.  Will those pitfalls be avoided in this case?
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I assure the Deputy that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, is a transforming Minister in the education area.  This is a major transformation in the grants system.  While the Deputy referred to the example of the medical card system, we are dealing with a completely different cohort of people in this area.  They are very much into social media and the Internet.  There is also the involvement of local radio.  In addition, this will only apply to new applicants.  I am confident that we are dealing with a highly intelligent student base who will be familiar with social media and can make their applications online.  It will be a keep-it-simple application.Given the access to information, I sincerely hope there will not be much requirement for telephone guidance but if it is required, I am assured it will be provided in a very effective way that will allay concerns.  A one-stop-shop for grants is a tranformational concept.  It will certainly ensure that people will know where they stand, and I have been assured it is designed to keep everything very simple.  Applicants will fill in the boxes and provide the relevant information.  It will be a user-friendly website.  I accept the Deputy's concerns about people not getting through on the telephone and so forth.  That concern prevailed in the medical card situation but I assure him there will not be a repeat of that in this area.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter.  My interest in it was born out of the frustration I felt on recently receiving a reply to a parliamentary question confirming there are no plans at present for the development of a national autism strategy or for the introduction of specific legislation on autism.  Such a statement is disappointing given the increasing prevalence of autism in Ireland and because the Department's stance is wildly out of sync with international standards.  In this context, I appeal to the Minister to review the position and to consider taking a different approach, based on the arguments I am about to outline.  I note for context that in the United States, the number of children diagnosed with autism has doubled over the past decade.  While no equivalent figures are available yet for Ireland, an estimated 600 children are born here each year with this condition and that figure is rising.  It is hard to determine whether the increase can be attributed to an actual rise in the incidence of autism, improvements in diagnostic tools or greater access to psychological services.  However, there is no doubt but that autism has risen dramatically in Ireland in recent years.At present, Ireland is the only country within the British Isles that does not have autism-specific laws or a national autism strategy in place.  In 2008, the Welsh Assembly Government issued an autism strategy and began to implement it immediately.  In 2009, the House of Commons brought into force the Autism Act 2009 and quickly followed it the following year with its strategy for adults with autism.  In 2011, the Scottish Government launched its national autism strategy and the Autism Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 was passed.  The latter legislation compels the authorities there to publish an autism strategy within two years of the Act being passed.  In recent years, there has been a general move towards implementing autism-specific strategies in many western democracies.  As the aforementioned examples illustrate clearly, this movement has been prompted by the increasing prevalence of autism, the soaring cost of providing autism services, a squeeze on resources and the need to prioritise such resources effectively.  There are many lessons to be learned from the Government's counterparts in the British Isles.  For example, the proposed Scottish autism strategy Bill would place a statutory duty on the Government to prepare and publish a strategy to meet the needs of children and adults with autism and to consult with appropriate organisations and people.  It also would oblige local authorities and local health boards to comply in respect of the provision of diagnostic services, the identification of children and adults with autism locally, the assessment of their needs, the planning and provision of services, the training of staff and leadership at local level.As I noted earlier, approximately 600 children are born in Ireland each year with autistic spectrum disorder.  However, these are merely approximate figures as the absence of a national autism strategy leads to an abject absence of prevalence rates.  Naturally, this has huge implications for the provision of services nationally, as without access to a reliable bank of statistics in this area, it is difficult for service providers to know what policies and guidelines should be put in place for future planning of services.  One should bear in mind that behind the figures are real individuals, real households and real families who are struggling with this condition.  Autism spectrum disorder is a complex and lifelong developmental condition and while some people can live relatively independent lives, others have high dependency needs and require specialist care.Autism also presents a significant public health challenge to the State.  Until such time as a national autism strategy has been put in place in the State, there will be an ongoing cost to society of the resources that are wasted.  For as long as services fail to be properly targeted, ineffectiveness and waste will continue and society will fail to equip people with autism with the right supports that ultimately will enable them to lead independent and productive lives.  If one borrows from the example of the United Kingdom, components of a national strategy could include a national autism programme board similar to that which exists in the United Kingdom, a programme to develop training with health and social care professional bodies, autism awareness training for those who work with people with autism and guidance on making available public services for adults with autism, such as improving buildings, public transport and communications.  In conclusion, the latter point already has been addressed in the HSE national review of autism services that was published in February 2011.  It undertook to carry out a review of existing services and aimed to identify pathways on how services can be accessed and delivered.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I thank Deputy McCarthy for raising this issue.  As he noted correctly, this is an issue that is increasing and of which the Government must take account.  Autism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that both affects approximately one in every 100 citizens in Europe and has an impact on their families and society at large.  Policy in this area aims to enable people with complex disabilities, including those with autism, to live as independently as possible within the community.  The Government is committed to providing specialist disability supports to enable each individual with a disability, including those with autism spectrum disorder, to achieve his or her full potential and maximise independence, including living as independently as possible.The management and delivery of services related to autism is the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  It provides services for individuals with autism spectrum disorders from childhood to adulthood, either directly or indirectly, by both statutory and non-statutory service providers.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families, carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.  It is worth noting that a number of Departments have responsibility for the provision of services to people with autism.  The Department of Health is responsible for health-related aspects, while the Department of Education and Skills has responsibility for education aspects.  Moreover, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs also has a role in respect of services for children.  In recognition of the cross-departmental issues arising on autism, a principal officer now has been appointed in the Department of Health to promote a co-ordinated approach to the needs of children, adolescents and young people with complex disabilities, including autism.The Health Service Executive published a national review of autism services in February 2011.  The aforementioned review outlines the historical background, the current models that exist, the gaps in service provision and the need for a consistent and clear pathway for individuals to access services in the least restrictive way.  The report highlights the imperative for a clear focus on the individual and his or her family in ensuring the needs of the individual remain at the centre of service provision.  It is intended that future provision of services for children and adults with autism will be developed having regard to the Government's commitment to mainstreaming, that is, to enable people with a disability to have access to the same services as the general population, as well as receiving the appropriate support and intervention to address individual needs.  No plans are under consideration at present in the Department of Health for the development of a national autism strategy or for the introduction of specific legislation on autism.  The recommendations of the national review of autism services report will be implemented through the reconfiguration of existing service provision and having regard to the most efficient and effective use of resources available in the current economic climate.  The Department of Health's forthcoming value for money and policy review of disability services will set the wider context for achieving a person centred disability service overall.  I again thank the Deputy.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	335	Unfortunately, identifying the cause of and finding the cure to autism still eludes the medical profession.  In the meantime, however, the best approach is autism-specific education and early intervention in order that people with the disorder can live culturally, socially, economically and spiritually fulfilling lives.  I welcome the Minister's recent pledge to invest €2 million in additional funding for early detection and treatment services over the next two years.  I suggest that to ensure the effective utilisation of this investment, a national autism strategy be developed and implemented.  In addition, a huge opportunity arises, in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in 2013, to make autism a European Union priority from a policy perspective.  Many challenges exist at European Union level in respect of autism and Ireland's Presidency affords it a glorious opportunity to put this issue at the centre of its agenda for the Presidency.  For too long, people with autism have been falling between the cracks of an overweight system and as a result, many people have led lives that were not as fulfilled as they could have been.  This is no longer acceptable and a national strategy provided for by legislation would both transform services and would change attitudes across society.  The Minister of State has demonstrated great bottle and passion for her briefs within the Department of Health and I believe this to be another area in which the right thing can be done for those who unfortunately suffer from this condition.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	336	The matter is not currently under consideration.  What the Deputy proposes has neither been ruled in nor out.  Additional resources have been made available in recognition of the prevalence of autism.  As stated by Deputy McCarthy it is difficult to know if this is as the result of clearer diagnosis or an increase in the incidence of autism.We need to gather data, similar to that which we have in respect of other disabilities, on this issue.  I acknowledge there is a need for discussion around whether autism is a disability.  It has for instance been suggested to me that the inclusion of an additional question in the census might be of assistance in this regard.  We will need to consider this.  We cannot plan unless we have the type of data and information we need to be clear on where money needs to be expended.  Some €3 million will be allocated over the next three years to the early detection and treatment of autism.  Despite the allocation of additional funding to other disabilities no sustainable service has been put in place.  We need to ensure that when money is invested in development of a service, that service is sustainable.  This is important in the context of autism in particular given that structure and the need to know what is happening is important not alone to those affected by autism but their families.It is hoped that the gathering of information and the putting in place of a sustainable structure will lead to a better service for everyone.

The High Court case settled by Mr. Ronan MacConnoran highlights once again the scandal of what happened to the victims of Mr. Michael Shine.  As stated by Mr. MacConnoran's solicitor, no quarter was given by the State side in defending the case.  This is one of the greatest scandals ever to blight our health services.There are scores of victims, many of them in counties Cavan and Monaghan, which I represent here.  In 2009, I met with one of them, Mr. Patrick Cusack of Carrickmacross, who was first abused by Mr. Shine when 11 years old and an inpatient at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Mr. Cusack returned to the hospital at aged 19 when very seriously ill with meningitis and was, when in a semi-conscious condition, again abused by Mr. Shine.  As stated by Patrick: "My life was turned upside down.  It took me another 20 years before I started to deal with the extreme pain that his sexual abuse had caused."The pain of the victims has been compounded by the slowness of the system in responding.  An inquiry is clearly necessary because of the complete failure of the system to respond appropriately to the very serious complaints made by those who suffered abuse at the hands of Mr. Michael Shine.  Major questions remain to be answered by the hospital management, the former health board and its successor the HSE, the Department of Health and Children, an Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  A major questionmark hangs over the thoroughness of the original Garda investigation into the conduct of Michael Shine, which investigation culminated in his 2003 acquittal on charges of indecent assault on six teenage boys.  The role of management at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda must also be probed.  Its role in the Neary case was nothing short of reprehensible.  Are we expected to believe management was not aware of the activities of Michael Shine and did not conspire to cover up his many abuses carried out over so many years?A public inquiry is necessary to answer these and other key questions.  The call by Dignity 4 Patients for a public inquiry is supported by One in Four, the Rape Crisis Centre, the Children's Rights Alliance and Barnardos.  Crucially, this demand was supported on 30 June 2009 in a Dáil motion tabled by the then Fine Gael spokesperson, now Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  I have repeated in my request for this Topical Issue Debate the core wording of the Minister's then wording of the motion.  The principal author of the wording before the House today is the now Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly who, when Fine Gael spokesperson on health called for "a credible inquiry to investigate how complaints relating to allegations of abuse by Michael Shine in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, were dealt with by the Hospital, An Garda Síochána, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Health Board, the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health and Children and any other relevant party".That motion also called for appropriate services for victims.  It is a great matter of disappointment to note that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has failed to establish an inquiry and has presided over a significant cut in funding to Dignity 4 Patients which represents all of the victims of Michael Shine.  That cut in this current year is so severe it is not only restricting its ability to represent these victims but is making its project impossible.  The Minister must act now according to his own words by establishing an inquiry.  I appeal that in the interim the funding stream be restored to Dignity 4 Patients.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for raising this issue, which needs to be dealt with.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.We are all agreed that the abuse of trust and attack on the dignity of patients by Mr. Michael Shine was a terrible betrayal by him of his patients.  The professional conduct of Mr Shine has been the subject of a number of inquiries.  In 1995, the Medical Council instigated a fitness to practise inquiry but this was delayed pending the outcome of separate legal proceedings, including criminal and judicial review proceedings.  Following a Supreme Court judgment in July 2008, the Medical Council recommenced an inquiry and on 25 November 2008 formally notified the Minister of its decision to remove the name of Dr. Michael Shine from the medical register.  The Medical Council made its decision following its consideration of the report of its fitness to practise committee, which found the person concerned guilty of professional misconduct in respect of three of nine allegations made by male patients.A review of the hospital's response to the allegations against the consultant was conducted in 1995 by an independent review group chaired by Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien.  The review group recommended that common written protocols for dealing with allegations of sexual abuse by members of staff be introduced and applied in all health care institutions.  The Trust in Care guidelines, which were published in 2005, deal with the recognition, prevention and management of cases of abuse.  The review group also emphasised the importance of having in place a complaints system to deal with allegations of sexual abuse.  A regional complaints policy and procedure is in place covering the Drogheda Hospital.  In addition, a support service has been made available to all staff in the hospital on a confidential basis.  The Hederman O'Brien review has helped inform the development and updating of policy in this area.This learning has been given practical effect through, for example the publication of the Children First Guidelines in 1997 and, more recently, the establishment by Government of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with a full Minister at Cabinet.  Early in 2011, my colleague the Minister for Health indicated that the issues raised by the case of Michael Shine, former consultant at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, would be the subject of an inquiry by an Oireachtas Committee.  This was dependent on the powers that had been proposed under the 30th amendment of the Constitution.  As it was not possible to proceed as proposed, the Minister is now considering how best to deal with the issues involved.  These considerations must take into account that Garda investigations are ongoing, investigation files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions and civil cases are pending against Michael Shine.  It would be wrong to do anything that might impede these investigations and pending cases.The Government will take all of this into account and remains determined to ensure a fair and satisfactory outcome for all the victims concerned and hopefully to give them all the closure they deserve in dealing with the terrible treatment they suffered.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	339	We have to recognise that the long delay in these Garda inquiries is only likely to lead us to one place - Michael Shine will have passed on.  There will be no opportunity for his victims to face their abuser and to give account of the terrible vista he visited on their young lives.  It is understandable that among the voices of the abused, there are those who believe that indeed is a subtext, an agenda, that is being allowed to unfold.  It is a very serious matter and it has to be taken seriously.  These are very hurt people.As the Minister of State rightly said, we are all agreed that this inquiry must happen but if everything is predicated on when the Garda inquiry will conclude, surely there must be cross-departmental action here and surely the Minister for Justice and Equality must be encouraged to speak to the relevant authorities within the Garda.  What prospect is there, after all these years, of new and further information presenting that would significantly alter all that we already know?  We need to have this opportunity.  These people are deserving of closure.I appeal to the Minister of State not to just note this and walk away but to speak to the Minister who already is totally conversant with the whole situation and who sponsored a motion in the House only three years ago which I happily spoke in support of and voted for absolutely.  I appeal for a cross-party approach.  This is not something for Government and Opposition to be adversarial about.  We are of one mind but we need to proceed with one clear intent and that it to bring closure at the earliest opportunity.My final appeal - the Minister of State did not refer to it in her reply as it was not part of what had been constructed for delivery here by the Minister - concerns the situation in regard to Dignity for Patients.  I can personally assure the Minister of State that the service it gives is critical to the well-being of those very hurt people today in 2012 as at any point in time in the past.  If we are to allow that funding stream to virtually dry up, as is the situation in this current year's provision, we are compounding a terrible pain and hurt and we cannot be a party to that.  I urge the Minister of State to immediately intervene to ensure there is adequate support in order to allow the work of Dignity for Patients to continue until that closure we are all agreed must happen is achieved.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	340	As the Deputy said, I do not think there is any disagreement as to what has happened to these people.  We are all agreed about the breach of trust that occurred.  I hope people will recover but it is very difficult to see how that recovery will occur.  The difficulty we have in terms of an inquiry is that I do not believe there is any stomach in the House or among the public for another public inquiry, no matter the circumstances or what we believe.  Our difficulty is that the constitutional amendment in regard to inquiries which could have been carried out by committees of the Dáil Éireann was rejected by the people.I very much take on board what the Deputy said about the conclusion of other inquiries going on.  Let us see a way forward from them because they are taking an inordinately long time and we need to ensure they are brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible, no matter what the outcome.  While the Garda inquiries are going on, there is a barrier there which we need to try to get over.  The only way to get over it is to bring the inquiries to a conclusion.  I agree entirely with the Deputy on that and I will pursue that matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality.In regard to the funding, unfortunately, the circumstances are as we find them.  However, I will not just note what the Deputy said but I will convey his sentiments to the Minister in the strongest possible terms.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I will pick up where I left off on last day.  The fact donations to parties and individuals will be more than halved in some instances may lead to other beneficial reforms.  With less cash to spend, perhaps costly posters, which are environmentally and aesthetically problematic, might be reduced.  When I was coming to the House this morning, I noticed a large number of posters campaigning for a "Yes" and a "No" vote in the upcoming referendum but what surprised me was to see the mugshots of Socialist Party members, who are MEPs, on posters.  They are campaigning for the next European Parliament elections.  Those people do not reject the large salaries, expenses, etc., they get from Europe.  Hopefully, at some future date, the Minister will ensure candidates cannot promote themselves for local, general or European Parliament elections at referenda.  Apart from party leaders, mugshots of people should be omitted from posters.  I nearly tripped over when I saw a poster calling for a "No" with the mugshot of someone who will offer himself to the electorate for election to the European Parliament at the next election and will draw down a huge salary with expenses, etc.I hope the legislation will lead to the setting up of an electoral commission as a matter of urgency.  As a member of the committee that proposed the setting up of such a commission, the Minister is only too aware of the extent of the legislative provisions needed to bring about a total overhaul of our electoral system.  The committee proposed that commission would be established through an electoral commission Act, which would establish an electoral commission with its own corporate legal personality; chief electoral officer, as the commission's chief executive; a staff who would be civil servants of the State, where appropriate transferred from Standards in Public Office Commission or the Office of the Ombudsman; and with it own assets and liabilities and a budget.It was envisaged that such a commission would encompass an independent role in the maintenance of the electoral register.  We have all witnessed the mayhem at election time.  Particularly memorable was the 800,000 errors that appeared under the watch of the previous Government.  An electoral commission was promised by the last Government but failed to materialise.  There is a strong need for a single independent body to increase public confidence in the democratic process.  I am hopeful that the necessary legislation will be brought forward by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, who I am pleased is present in the Chamber for this debate.  He is progressing electoral reform, which is very welcome.  I have with me a copy of an electoral document that I drafted.  It calls for the safeguarding of electoral integrity through the setting up of an electoral commission and the maintenance of an accurate electoral register.  While the debate on identity cards is fraught with opposing views, an electoral identity card with photographic identification would eliminate fraud.  We should strongly support the introduction of such cards as part of the overall revamp of the electoral process and as a valuable tool in the drive to complete registration.  Obtaining an electoral identity card would necessitate prior registration.It is positive that this Bill will impose a penalty on political parties that do not adhere to quotas in respect of female and male candidates.  Across the spectrum from education to employment, a trend has developed in which women and girls outperform men and boys.  I am struck by the thought of how many years will pass before it will be necessary to introduce legislation to ensure equality of male representation.One of the greatest challenges to democracy globally is women's participation in politics, both as councillors and parliamentarians.  Gender equality must be our society's aim and should be a central element in the development and progress of democracy.  Quotas are controversial and many women resist such a move.  One of the great opponents of gender quotas is a former Deputy from my constituency, Mrs. Mary O'Rourke, who has gone on to a new, bright career in the media.  However, it is only through certain duress that the under-representation of women in our Parliament will be addressed.  The diversity of needs within a society cannot be adequately met by a mere 50% of the population.  Equality of gender requires equality of representation.  I am proud of the fact that Longford-Westmeath, particularly its Fine Gael element, has always been the main driver of progress in terms of gender equality.  For example, Deputy McFadden and I equate to 50:50 representation.It is interesting to note that, in 2003, Wales became the first country in the world to have a legislative body with equal numbers of men and women.  Thirty women were elected that year to the 60-member Assembly.  The Welsh First Secretary stated that Wales was setting an example for the world.  His wife, an MP, rejoiced that the mould had been broken.  By 2007, the number of women in the Assembly had decreased to 34.88%.  Last year, female representation stood at the slightly higher level of 40%.We must ask ourselves a question.  Does the electorate choose its candidates of preference regardless of gender?  If so, while it is necessary that there should be equity in terms of candidates put forward, their eventual election is dependent on a number of variables at any given election.On a name and shame basis, Ireland's record is poor and I am glad that something is finally being done about it.  I must acknowledge the fact that Ireland had two exceptional female Presidents in Dr. Mary Robinson and Mrs. Mary McAleese.  I also acknowledge their great contributions to society in Ireland and elsewhere.  They were a credit to themselves, Ireland and women around the world.The UK, which has a 22.2% rate of female representation in Parliament and is placed 50th out of 188 countries worldwide and 12th out of 27 European countries, has seen a small but significant rise from the 2001 figure of 18.2% of women elected to the House of Commons.  This increase followed considered remedial action.  The use of positive action strategies by political parties is the decisive factor in increasing women's representation in national parliaments.This Bill will ensure that women are not discriminated against at the short-listing and nomination stages of the electoral process.  It is up to the Government to encourage parties to adopt forms of positive action in order to increase the number of female candidates they select to meet the statutory requirements.  I do not doubt that the Minister will see this done.  It is recognised that the balanced participation of women and men in the decision making process leads to the achievement of a truly democratic society.  Only when the gender balance of the Dáil reflects the gender base of our society more accurately than it currently does will there be real integration of equality issues into Government policy making.While I am aware of what could be perceived as the "make haste slowly"modus operandi of the political sphere in terms of equality, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has taken the bull by the horns as regards female candidates.  The next step is to consider the contribution to be made to our legislative process by ethnic minorities.  We have only to consider the input of many “new Irish” citizens to their local communities to realise what an asset their representation would be in the national arena.Given the name of this Bill, I hope that it will fully address the issue of political funding.  The Minister will welcome Opposition amendments to foster the integrity of and public confidence in the democratic process and to regulate party and election finances as the foremost considerations.  That is Government policy.  This legislation ensues from a commitment in the agreed programme for Government to take responsibility for electoral administration, to implement modern and efficient electoral practices in electoral spending and to deal with the issues involved in financing the political system.  To date, the Government has only partly fulfilled its commitment by removing the influence of large political donations and promoting gender equality.  The establishment of an electoral commission is conspicuously absent.  Such legislation is long overdue.  When will it be introduced?  It is apparent that an electoral commission that would centralise all matters pertaining to the electoral register would fill the void created by the decentralised, multi-agency approach.  An accurate register of electors is essential to an open, transparent and fulfilling voting process.  Although local authorities have done the best job possible in the circumstances, the care of the electoral register is not within their remit and has placed an undue burden on their staff and resources, particularly among smaller local authorities.  Currently, 34 registration authorities are legally responsible for preparing and maintaining the register even though it is not a core function for local authorities.  This undoubtedly means that maintenance of the register is not given the priority it deserves.While it is not productive to hark back to the mistakes of the previous Government, it is evident that the register was woefully neglected in the past.  The previous Government's apathy culminated in the discovery of 800,000 errors.  This is completely unacceptable because every person who is entitled to vote must be able to do so.  Citizens' confidence in the accuracy of the electoral register was eroded during the last general election.  As a politician in a busy constituency, I was asked to find out why one individual was left off the electoral register despite living in the same area for 60 years.  This situation should never have arisen.I have every confidence that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, will bring forward legislation to deal with the issues I have outlined.  Parliaments mirror our societies and they aspire to respond to everyday reality.  In doing so, parliaments are constantly evolving and modern parliaments are places in which people aspire to recognise themselves and find answers to their questions.  I have no doubt the Minister and his colleagues in Cabinet will ensure these aspirations are achieved.The abuse of political power in the past was shameful and has come back to haunt us.  I hope action is taken against those who wrecked our country.  It is annoying that the people who ruined the country continue to walk about and receive huge payments.  I have every confidence that the Government will address this issue.  People are waiting for this legislation to be enacted and when I go out to meet people on walkabouts at the weekends, when they visit my clinics or in general conversations they ask me, as a Member of this Parliament, why certain individuals continue to receive massive payments when the country is bankrupt.  It is inexcusable.  I do not doubt the Minister will introduce legislation to punish these individuals for wrecking this fine country for which our forefathers fought.  Our forefathers would turn in their graves if they saw what happened to this country at the turn of the century.  They took nothing and they entered politics for the good of the country.We should build the entire system anew from town councils and local authorities to the Dáil and Seanad.  The Taoiseach has promised to reform the Seanad and I hope proposals will be made in this regard in the not too distant future.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I welcome the Bill and, in particular, the important measures it contains on gender quotas and funding.  These measures go some way towards addressing this House's failure to meet the needs of the Irish people.  We are operating well below our capabilities.Late one night during the general election campaign I had a conversation with an American friend.  We were trying to decide, in the unlikely event of my being elected, what impact I could make as an Independent Deputy.  I kept returning to my jaundiced view of politicians because I found it deeply uncomfortable to refer to myself as a potential politician.  My friend told me I had to change my opinion because politics is an honourable profession.  It is the greatest of honours to serve one's country.  She was reflecting a view which I observed in the Kennedy School in Boston and when I worked in Washington DC.I have no doubt that every Member regards it as an honour to serve in this House.  Deputies are patriotic, hardworking and smart people.  That is not the view of the Irish public, however.  I was shocked by the results of this year's Edelman trust barometer, which indicated that 70% of Irish people do not trust their government leaders to tell the truth.  We are ranked 24 out of the 25 countries surveyed, with only Italy inspiring less trust.  All of us have seen surveys that routinely rank politicians as the least trusted profession in this country.That attitude is not inevitable, however.  I have lived in countries where it was absolutely not the case that the public mistrusted politicians.  It is not a structural problem.  I put it to the House that the total breakdown of trust in politicians is the result of the rules that we apply to ourselves, which this Bill helps to address, and the culture which governs how we behave.Political scientists may hold a particular view but I wish to approach the problem from a slightly different perspective.  I spent several years in the private sector working with large and complex public sector organisations.  My role was to help senior management teams figure out how to improve their organisations' performance and do more for the public, usually with less money.  I focused in particular on the culture of the organisation and whether employees understood what it was trying to do.  The questions I asked included whether employees agreed with it, whether they were consulted on its priorities, did they know what was expected of them and did they have the capabilities and opportunities to develop.  The empirical evidence is compelling in regard to persuading complex organisations to improve their performance.  In order for an organisation to perform highly, it must operate according to the right systems or, in our case, the right rules and it must have a healthy culture.  I put it to my fellow Deputies that Dáil Éireann has neither the right rules nor the right culture.   If we can get the rules right and change our culture we will be able to serve the people of this country in a new and better way.The Dáil and the Seanad should be the beating heart of Irish politics.  These Houses should be full of rigorous debate but they often feel like a sham or illusion of democracy.Ministers come in during Question Time or the Topical Issue Debate and read the start of their statement.  An Opposition Member will challenge that and make a few points following which the Minister will simply read the second part of the statement regardless of what has been said.  I am sure that many of the Government Deputies experienced the same frustrations when they were in opposition.Ireland is recognised has having the most centralised Executive power of any Western democracy.  In other words we, the Members of the Oireachtas, do not hold our Cabinet to account in the same way as other parliaments do.  The extent of the centralised control can be shocking.  Recently, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform discussed issuing an invitation to the Governor of the Central Bank to appear before the committee.  One of the Government Deputies wanted to frame the invitation in a particular way, which was no big deal as it was an internal committee issue.  However, the Whip was applied.  Word came from the Executive that the invitation needed to be written in a certain way.  As it happens the Government Deputies did not get into the committee room in time and I had the pleasure - possibly the one time it will ever happen during this Dáil - of defeating the Government in a vote.  It was symbolic of real control-freakery.  The committees are meant to be at least quasi-independent where Opposition and Government Members really can go beyond party lines and bring everything they have to bear in scrutinising legislation.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, a very important committee particularly at the moment, is not even allowed to write the wording of its own invitations, which makes a mockery of any independence that the committee could have.Deputies are given almost no notice of legislation - we find out on Thursday what is coming up the following week.  Most of us are in our constituencies on Friday.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service does not get any additional notice either making it very difficult to put serious time and energy into scrutiny of upcoming legislation.  The research professionals who are there to help us do not have the time either.  Much of the time we do not get debate packs.As a new Deputy coming from a highly quantitative world where things are usually backed up with empirical evidence, theory and so forth, I have noticed a real absence of that here.  While it may go on at Cabinet and in the Departments, as a Dáil Deputy I do not see it.  Regulatory impact analysis is supposed to happen for all major legislation, but it does not.  It did not happen for the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill - there was no poverty impact analysis, regulatory impact analysis or gender impact analysis.  Nobody had worked out how many people the various measures would put into poverty or at risk of poverty.  Slightly tongue-in-cheek I described it as "what does this button do" policy making, but it has a very serious implication.The OSCE ranks Ireland as second worst in its budgetary process - we came 35th of 36 countries surveyed.  On a scoring of the level of data given to Parliament to interrogate a budget, we scored zero out of ten, which is extraordinary.  In the time given to Parliament to scrutinise the legislation, use the data and come back into the Chamber and try to hold the Government to account, we scored zero out of ten.  It is basically impossible to meaningfully hold the Ministers for Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform to account on two of the most important pieces of legislation that come before the House every year.Worse than that, when the capital expenditure programme was announced, we were given a list of stuff.  It did not indicate how it was arrived at and had no technical appendices or decision criteria.  It simply outlined how we would spend more than €30 billion of borrowed money.  In the Chamber I asked the Minister for the technical appendix.  I told him that I could not indicate whether I agreed with, for example, the school building versus the road building without the technical appendix, the decision criteria and the cost-benefit analysis.  He said I could not have it.  He told me that I could try to get it from the Departments if I liked and the phrase he used was "we were elected to govern", which is unhelpful.The Government has used the guillotine on 68% of its own legislation.  In spite of commitments in the programme for Government not to use statutory instruments and the guillotine, on nearly seven out of ten Bills the Government has introduced, it has used the guillotine.  Two weeks ago the guillotine was used on every section of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, which is not good.  The intent in the programme for Government was to stop using statutory instruments.The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, debated a statutory instrument on an Internet copyright issue for more than an hour with Deputy Catherine Murphy, me and others - we had submitted a counter-proposal.  At the end of the debate I asked the Minister of State if he would take on board a single proposal, a single word or a single letter of what was covered during the debate.  He said that he was not changing anything and that he had told us before the debate that he would not change anything.  For me that really symbolised a particular culture whereby people who had been on this side of the House for years and were passionate about getting into government and doing the right thing, within a year were saying things like that.  It is an extraordinary symbol of a culture that accepts this House is not really here to influence the legislation, although obviously there are notable exceptions.  It is a very serious issue.One of the other problems comes down to culture as opposed to rules.  Even if Deputies were given the data we needed and the time to use them, the problem for Opposition and Government Deputies alike is that they pretty much have to say what they are told within reason.  They have to toe the line and vote the line as well, which is really dangerous.  For example, during the referendum campaign on Oireachtas inquiries, all the parties canvassed for a "Yes" vote, but it was defeated.  Many of the Deputies I spoke to privately said they were voting against it and told everyone they knew to vote against it because they had serious concerns about it.  I do not mean to bring up whether a "Yes" or "No" vote was correct, but it signifies an extraordinary failure by us, as the people's representatives, to give a balanced view to the people.  It is a very dangerous manifestation of the strict adherence to the party Whip.We have a ludicrous situation now with Deputy Ó Cuív and the referendum.  He has said that he has agreed not to say publicly what he believes to be true - that people should vote "No".  When that is the case, is it any wonder that nobody trusts us?  When a politician says what he believes, he is obliged and told to stay quiet.  How dangerous could it be to Fianna Fáil to have one of its prominent members say: "You know what, I respect the party line, but I do not agree with it.  Here is my opinion.  I have been in here a long time and have a lot of experience and here is what I believe"?  I do not know when it became the consensus that parties and the political system as a whole were so allergic to dissent.  I have never attended a parliamentary party meeting.  While I am sure there is plenty of good rigorous debate in them, it is not reflected publicly.

The Topical Issue Debate has been good.  I was lucky to have a Bill selected for discussion on a Friday, which was a fantastic opportunity.  However, we are tinkering at the edges.  While I really welcome the Bill and the impact it will have, it is still marginal at a time when the Government has the space - there is the need - to be radical.Article 28.4.1° of the Constitution states: "The Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann" - to us.  That means the Government should be responsible and accountable to this House.  My experience over the past year indicates that is not in any way accountable to this House.  The examples I have given suggest a culture that suggests it in no way believes itself to be accountable to this House.  We are less than we could be with that culture in place.The Bill considers gender quotas and political funding.  As I have said previously, I applaud the Minister for dealing with gender quotas.  This is a great move.  The current situation is appalling.  We are 77th in the world in terms of gender representation and 22nd among the 27 EU members.  Only 15% of the Dáil is female and only 12% of Cabinet is female, and the situation is getting worse.  Only 15% of candidates last year were women, which is the lowest percentage since 1989.  Ireland is one of the worst in the developed world in terms of representation by females and we are getting worse.  This is not represented in the make-up of the parties or political interests.  Fianna Fáil is the most notable example.  Some 35% or slightly more of the party is female, but there is not a single female Fianna Fáil Deputy.  This is an extraordinary situation.  Almost half of constituencies have no female Deputies - a shocking situation.  At local government level the situation is just as bad, with just 16% of councillors being women.  Only two of the 24 county councillors in Wicklow County Council are women.Nobody likes quotas, but the research is unambiguous - gender representation does not work without quotas.  When the system is so totally skewed and dominated by men, the introduction of quotas is a necessary - but insufficient - element of a policy response that will kick the system back to a better equilibrium.  We are all aware of the Five Cs report, which states that candidate selection, cash, child care, confidence and culture are the five blockers to more female participation.  Evidence from around the world suggests the critical mass is 30% - that is reflected in the initial quota here - and that at 30%, things begin to happen at the candidate selection stage.I put it to the Minister that we need to go further.  France and Belgium have quotas of 50% and Spain has a quota of 40%.  The 30% rule requires very minor changes from Fine Gael and the Labour Party, in terms of finding more female candidates.  The timing issue suggests that we will not hit 40% by 2021.  While I applaud what the Minister is doing, I advise that he should select a 40% quota, sooner rather than later and he should also apply it to local government.  The Minister told me before that he does not have the power to apply the rules to local government because political funding only applied nationally.  He should find that power.  We make the rules in this House, so let us make a rule that will allow the regulation apply to local government.  This change needs to happen.I welcome the various changes in the Bill with regard to political funding.  However, I urge that the Minister takes a serious look at party political funding.  We have a very strange situation in this country whereby some political funding goes directly to the elected Deputies.  We all get a parliamentary allowance, a travel allowance, a staff of two and an office.  Independent Deputies also get a leader's allowance which other Deputies do not get.  However, the parties get vastly more per Deputy than the €41,000 or €42,000 Independent Deputies get.  Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin get €120,000 per Deputy and an extra staff member for a central secretariat.  Labour and Fine Gael get approximately €60,000 and €70,000 extra per Deputy and an extra staff member.  They get less because they are in government and have access to the Civil Service.  I put it to the Minister that it would be healthier and more democratic for all political funding to be directed to the Deputy.  The power and authority are invested in each of us as Deputies of Dáil Éireann.  If Deputy Timmins wants to be a member of Fine Gael and the rule in Fine Gael is that any member must provide certain staff resources and money, that is fine.  If someone wants to leave the party, they should take those resources with them.I urge the Minister to consider two suggestions seriously.  He should direct all political resources and funding to the individual Deputies, and let the parties decide for themselves how much should be given up.  He should also radically reduce political funding.  For example, if parties were only paid per Deputy the same as Independent Deputies get currently, this would save the Exchequer over €10 million per year.  I applaud what the Minister is doing and urge him to be more radical.  He has the political space and the country needs bigger and bolder changes than those currently in this Bill.

They all have their snouts in the trough.  They are all corrupt  The only thing that motivates them is their re-election.  They have one hand longer than the other.  Their only concern is their expenses.These statements are comments from an Internet discussion site and a radio show that took place in the past couple of days.  While they are easy to write off as ranting from an angry public or anonymous posters, we should not write them off that easily.  These comments are an expression of the widespread cynicism towards politics and politicians in this country and we are only deluding ourselves if we think otherwise.  Research carried out after last year's general election found that politicians are the least trusted of all professions.  The last couple of decades have done untold damage to the reputation of politics and politicians.  While it is easy for some to point to Fianna Fáil as the main problem, this fails to recognise that these attitudes were not simply confined to just one party.  The damage done is not confined merely to Fianna Fáil, but to the body of politics.  Such cynicism and distrust may eventually lead to damage to the democratic legitimacy of the State and we should pay heed to that.This Bill addresses some of the concerns about the corrupting effect of money in politics.  It will restrict donations to political parties, be they corporate donations from private sector companies or contributions from trade unions.  The Labour Party fully supports the Bill and acknowledges the Minister's dedication, commitment and action in this regard.  Although there will be a considerable financial cost to the Labour Party, it is our view that the interests of democracy and transparency are best served by substantial legislation in this area.  It has long been the policy of the Labour Party to end the corporate funding of political parties, in so far as that is possible within the confines of the Constitution.  We welcome this legislation on that basis.  The Bill will contribute to an improvement in the standard of practice of politics in this country and by doing so will help to lessen the corrosive cynicism towards politics.  Much of this will be achieved through regulation, but also through the practices of politicians and political parties.There are few Members of this House whose bona fides I would question.  What I mean by this is that most of us are here because we wish to serve the people and to work for the good of the State although we differ with regard to the means to do this and our goals.  These differences are important in terms of the dynamics between government parties and the Opposition, but I recognise that the majority of Deputies are here with the best of intentions.  However, there has been some corruption, with the result that much political activity is now seen - fairly or unfairly - through that lens   Further legislation and work on the part of every party and Independent Deputies is required in order to counteract both that perception and the  challenge posed by cynicism towards politics and to ensure we root out that perception.  We must develop an intolerance of corruption in this House and of those associated with the actions of those found to have been engaged in corrupt practices, whether by the courts or tribunals of inquiry.The two issues in this Bill are mirrored, in a way, by the election to the House of Commons in 1865 of a man named John Stuart Mill.  His opponent in that election was W. H. Smith, of the famous book-selling family, who used his vast wealth to buy a great number of votes.  Political corruption was present at the start of Mill's time in parliament.  Twelve months after his election he touched on an issue of relevance to the other aspect of this Bill, an issue that would see him pilloried, in both his own time and in history, as well as dismissed by some of his fellow MPs as being mad.  In 1867, during the debate on the Second Reform Bill, Mill introduced an amendment that would have resulted in women receiving the vote.  It was rejected but this was the first time that such a motion had been proposed in the Commons.  Mill felt that it was appropriate to create that debate in English society.  Sadly, and shamefully, it was 50 years later before women's suffrage finally won the vote, in 1918, but even then it was not on the same terms as men.In Ireland, women have had the vote since Independence.  Indeed, before independence, Ireland had elected the first woman MP, Countess Markievicz, who later became only the second female Minister of government in Europe.  She left office in 1922 and we had to wait until 1979, 57 years later, until another woman was appointed to Cabinet.  Of the total of 4,744 Dail seats filled since 1918, only 260 have been occupied by females.  Only 91 women Deputies have been elected since the foundation of the State.  In this, the 31st Dail, women hold only 25 seats out of 166, which, as outlined earlier, represents a percentage of just 15.1%.  This places Ireland in a global position of 79th, considerably lower than the global and European averages of 20% and 22.3%, respectively.This under-representation of women means we are missing the talents and insights of half the population.  This may be a matter of humour for some but it cannot be denied that the lack of women in politics is having an effect, in the context of our policies and in outcomes of our work and our deliberations.  Their different experience means that women parliamentarians are more likely to raise issues that involve women and to bring their perspectives to bear on policy-making.  Women are often less adversarial and, as was mentioned by one of the Opposition speakers, are often more consensual in parliamentary and committee debates.  This can only help to enhance the quality of governance in this country.  In any event, the appeal of democracy as an idea is not that it is the most efficient system of government, rather that it is the most legitimate form of same.  Having women, who make up just over half of the population, so under-represented undermines the legitimate authority of this House.  This must be remedied.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to addressing the situation in this Bill.The issue is not that the electorate does not vote for women but that they do so in proportion to the number of women who run in elections.  The issue, therefore, is that there are not enough female candidates participating in the democratic process.  In the last general election, in Cork South-West, Kildare South, Limerick and Roscommon-South Leitrim there were no women on the ballot paper.  The Labour Party's commitment to this ideal is reflected in its high percentage of female candidates but, as noted earlier, we have not reached the 30% mark.  Our having only two extra women candidates participate in the democratic process would have addressed that 30% quota.  It is important that all parties work in this regard, simply by reaching the quota outlined in the Bill.  A quota of 40% is a goal we must look to achieve later.  These are starting points; we must be blunt about it.An earlier speaker mentioned the five "Cs": child care, cash, confidence, culture and candidate selection.  These are important issues.  I shall take one, child care, which predominantly affects women as they are still more likely to have the responsibility of rearing a child in the home.  Although a crèche facility is provided in Leinster House, the sitting hours of the House do not suit those with young children or families.  I include myself.  This can form a barrier for women in becoming involved in politics as often the arrangements and meeting times for branches and cumanns - Deputy Donnelly has the luxury of being an Independent in that respect - are often in out-of-hours situations.Maternity arrangements for Deputies is another issue which must be addressed.  Although statutory maternity leave is not available to women Members of the Oireachtas, as they are not employees, Deputies or Senators who give birth in office do not have an entitlement to survive or protect their domestic circumstances outside the Houses.This Bill, in both its aspects, will represent a significant improvement.  For that, I thank the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for his dedication and commitment and, above all, his action in this area.  On both counts the Bill represents a significant step on the road to another destination which we must reach.  No doubt more must be done on the two significant aspects of this legislation but I welcome the Bill for what it is and gladly support the Minister in his endeavours.

This is very welcome.  Many Members have alluded, as did Deputy Keaveney, to the fact that political systems seem to be debased and politicians seem to have lost the trust of the people.  Perhaps it is the same in other countries but in this one we are becoming nearly ungovernable.  There is a scattergun effect and people make their own ideals.Deputy Donnelly asked what we can do about this.  When I was in opposition, or at any other time, I never became personal.  If a Deputy or Minister made a good decision I applauded it; if they did not I did not become personal.  There is a Deputy in Deputy Donnelly's ranks who has taken away my good name in the past year.  Every politician is entitled to his name and his character.  This Deputy spoke on local and national radio stations, telling untruths, and has continued to do so in the past year.  I do not mind if somebody makes a mistake but when one continues to tell something that is untrue people will sometimes believe it.  When I brought this up and said, "This is untrue", the Deputy merely laughed it off.  In politics we need to have some backbone, whereby we tell the truth and do not debase a person's good name and good character.  Perhaps this is the game we are in and that is it, but I do not agree with it and I know that neither does Deputy Donnelly.  I am glad he brought up the issue.Regarding trust, we should look at the way in which political parties are funded.  I have stated before in the House that we should look at the way Independent Deputies are funded.  It is wrong that they get €42,000 tax-free into their hand, unvouched.  It is also wrong that political parties should get money but at least their accounts are transparent and open.  This is an area we must examine.

No one ever said that they elected me because I was a good-looking fellow on the poster or had a lovely pair of legs.  I got elected through hard work.  Perhaps the Minister will include in the Bill a provision for people like me, who represent aesthetically challenged politicians.

There are two categories of donations, the first of which is from those who have a desire to contribute to the democratic system.  It normally manifests itself in small donations from family or friends.  The second category is corporate donations to political parties, which are for influence or access.  I spoke to a member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the late 1990s who had attended many corporate events in the early 90s.  There was a change of government in the mid-90s and he was amazed to find the same corporate clients attended the fundraising events of the new Government.  The corporate donors did not change; the recipients changed the depending on who was in government.  I often hear Vincent Browne harp on about how Fine Gael cleared its debts in the mid-1990s.  I was not elected at the time but it is plain that the corporate donors who had been giving to the previous Government then gave to the new Government, which greatly assisted in clearing the debt.  I am dubious about corporate donations and the proposed requirement on those who wish to give more than €200,000 to register with the Standards in Public Office Commission will finish corporate donations.I welcome the fact that political parties must give a statement of account.  Deputy Donnelly said that it would save €10 million if political parties were on a par with Independent Members.  I thought political parties received less funding than that.  I believe it is approximately €5.5 million but I may be incorrect.  Irrespective of the figure, it is important that the money is audited.  However, if someone wants to be corrupt, these proposals do not matter because that person will hide it somehow.I would like to see a limit on the amount of spending between elections and a limit on the cumulative total of donations an individual or a party can receive.  There should be a cap on individuals and a limit on what candidates can spend between elections.  If applied correctly, money can buy entry to the Oireachtas.  Notwithstanding the fact that these measures go some way to controlling it, they do not prevent people buying their way into the House.  People can spend money ad nauseam between elections and that must be stopped.It is desirable to have more female representation in the Oireachtas.  The current system is not satisfactory.  I do not have the solution and I do not know that the current proposal is the solution.  Generally, I am uncomfortable with the concept of quotas.  The argument can be made that if we are going to dip our toes in the water of quotas, we should insist on a quota for membership of the Oireachtas rather than candidates.  I read an article recently about the percentage of women who stood as Independent candidates.  The argument was always made that large cumbersome political parties prohibited women from standing but the percentage of women who stood as Independent candidates was lower than the number who stood for political parties.  I have not carried out scientific research on it but I hear arguments for and against it.  Notwithstanding that, I will support legislation despite a certain unease about the tipping of the cap to female representation.  The Minister is going some way but I am not sure if it is the solution.If we were to bring the quota system to its logical conclusion across society, where should we stop?  I lament the lack of male primary teachers.  Some primary schools have only female teachers.  Equally, we could say the medical profession needs more women.  Where do we stop?  One can argue that we need to set an example but I have concerns about the approach.Deputy Donnelly spoke about a free vote on certain matters.  Deputy Colm Keaveney referred to voting times, which we should examine if we are trying to make the House more user-friendly.  The vote on Wednesday evening has moved from 8.30 p.m. to 9 p.m., which flies in the face of making the Dáil more user-friendly for women, and indeed for all Members.  I do not know why the time change was made.I have often been an advocate of a free vote on certain issues, particularly Private Members' business.  Those in opposition may question why the Government votes against a Private Members' motion or Bill but there is an onus on the Opposition, when introducing a proposal, to outline from where funding will come.  It is often a shortcoming in the Opposition argument, including when my party was in opposition.  There must be a certain discipline in government.  We would all like a free vote and many politicians verbalise ad nauseam in a free manner before taking the opposite approach at the vote.  We should examine the concept of allowing a free vote on Private Members’ business or certain other social issues.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to this informative debate.  It is interesting to listen to the observations made by Government Members, and Independent and political party Members of the Opposition.  When talking about the electoral and political system, individual observations or analysis offered by Deputies reflect their position as Independents or members of parties.  Deputy Colm Keaveney referred to public trust in politicians and the fact that it is at a low ebb.  Perhaps it is opportune for the Government to allow all political parties to have a no holds barred debate in the House on public trust and what politicians need to do to rebuild the trust of the public.It has been suggested that there are too many Members of the House at a time when our population is increasing.  Constituencies on the eastern seaboard are filling out and the number of people represented in certain constituencies has grown by comparison to others throughout the country.  Should we have fewer Members?  Should we consider the multiseat constituency?  Is there a problem with Members in the same political party expending too much effort and time on the competitive element within the party?  It is a problem Fianna Fáil had in the past although not to the same extent today.  It will be a problem for the two parties in Government, the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  When election time comes around, the competitive consideration in constituencies will be manifest.The question of payment and level of salary and allowances paid to Members raises the matter of whether we should consider a part-time arrangement for Members without frontbench responsibilities, those who are not Ministers or Ministers of State.  Should we consider a part-time arrangement for the sitting of the Dáil to allow Members to work as teachers, or to operate pubs, farms or IT companies?Many speakers have remarked on the perception that career politicians live in a bubble and we do not know what is happening in the wider economy and the wider world.  There is a grain of truth in this view and perhaps a person who also has another job as well as being a Member of this House would bring a different perspective to debates.  I will not hold my breath as I do not think the House will revert to such a system.  When I was first elected to this House quite a few Members attended on a part-time basis as they also worked in the Law Library or practised as solicitors or worked in other occupations compatible with membership of the House.  They could contribute to debates for a certain number of hours during the week and also continue with their jobs.  Whether the quality of contributions was the better I cannot say.There needs to be a fundamental examination of the electoral system in order to rebuild trust in the system.  The process of alienation of the public from the political system has become a cancer and it is not good.  When individual members of every party engage with the electorate, they must be perceived the same as people who work in other lines of public contribution.This Bill deals with the issue of donations and gender quotas.  The political history of the recent past and perhaps earlier will show that the issue of corporate donations has been at the heart of many of the problems which affect the political system and there clearly is a need to bring this practice under control.  I am sure other Members will agree that it costs money to survive in politics, to fight elections and to look after the constituency between elections, and there must be some system for financing the political system.  There is understandable resistance to the public purse contributing to the level it does, whether to Independent Members or to individual political parties.  However, this is a democracy and it is a question of how to fund politics if all sources of funding are cut off.  How will parties such as Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party, Sinn Féin or the Independents finance themselves?  These are the big questions.  However, I fully accept the principle that corporate donations must be controlled to ensure that such donations do not have a negative effect on the political system, that these are eliminated completely rather than minimised.  I acknowledge this Bill goes some distance in this regard.Last November, the Fianna Fáil Party brought forward proposals which are much more effective and will better address the issues.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to that Bill which was debated and voted down.  That Bill was a serious attempt on the part of Fianna Fáil to address this cancerous problem at the heart of the political system in Ireland.  It envisaged a greater empowerment of the Standards in Public Office Commission to audit and monitor the accounts of political parties, to extend the SIPO supervision to independent expenditure and referenda and to implement the recommendations of Mr. Justice Moriarty relating to extending provisions to Independent and non-party candidates.  The combination of these measures with the lobbyists Bill would restore public faith in the institutions of the State.  These measures will underpin the efforts to level the playing field for all stakeholders, strengthen the democratic principle of political equality and break the very unhealthy link between business and politics.The issue of gender balance is a perennial problem in politics and particularly as regards membership of the Oireachtas.  There are simply not enough female Members of the Oireachtas.  A greater number of female Members would have a marked impact on debates and on the subject of debates.  However, the greatest challenge for the system is how to ensure more people come into politics.  In an ideal world, candidates come through the ranks of political parties and are selected at convention, but it is clear this system has not worked.  The numbers we would like to see in the House are not turning in here after each general election.  An effective and strong quota system may be the solution, whereby 30% or 40% of candidates in a general election must be female but at the end of the day, it is the electorate which decides who comes in here.  At least, political parties would be fulfilling their obligation and making their contribution to ensuring more female Members.  The quota system proposal is to be welcomed and I hope that further efforts will be made to ensure a higher number of female Members.I refer to statistics on gender breakdown in the Dáil.  Only six out of 30 Ministers are women, 20% of the total.  Women account for only 13% of Cabinet membership, two out of 15 people.  This is similar to the 17% of women Ministers in the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Government of 1993, some 20% in the Rainbow coalition Government of 1994 and 16% in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government of 1997, when the country had its first female Tánaiste.  These statistics highlight the challenges facing the system and they compare very unfavourably with the position in the European Union generally and in stark contrast to the gender equality in countries such as Spain, Sweden and Iceland.  I hope the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will consider the genuine effort made by those who framed the Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill to address these two issues.  I ask the Minister to consider incorporating its provisions into future legislation in the best interests of the democratic system.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I wish to share my time with Deputy Tom Hayes.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the House.  I agree with Deputy Kirk that we are all faced with a challenge and that the people will decide who comes into this House and who will be elected as local councillors.  However, when I hear members of the Fianna Fáil Party and their supporters talking about political reform, I remind them that Fianna Fáil was the party in Government for the longest period of time and I ask where were the measures for political reform or an attempt to bring about real reform.  We have instead seen a liaison and a relationship between big business, a chosen few and political influence.  This is the reason for two tribunals in Dublin Castle .As regards the advancement of women in politics, Fianna Fáil was in Government for 14 years and we saw no such legislation coming forward.  However, I welcome the publication of this Bill.  I agree with the over-arching aim of the Bill which is to reform the political process, to restore the trust in us as practising politicians, in political parties and in the financing of political parties.Members of the Press Gallery who write about politics and social and political commentators must remember that politics is a part of democracy and democracy is not cheap and it comes at a price.  We must fund political participation in democracy either by means of private donations or through public funding.  There cannot be an opt-out clause - it is either one or the other, so there is a consequence to whatever we do.  That is why it is important to cast our minds across the Atlantic Ocean to America and look at the inordinate and absurd amounts of money being spent in the US primary elections, as well as the amount being gathered both by President Obama and former Governor Romney in pursuit of the office of President.  Even the amount of money being spent on congressional elections by both Democrats and Republicans is ridiculous.We should have a real debate about what it means to fund democracy in our country.  We cannot just be silent participants.  Democracy comes at a cost and that is the way it should be.  We either opt for one or the other, but we must make a decision.I am sorry that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has left the Chamber.  I want to make it clear to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, however, that under no circumstances can we allow politics to become the preserve of a chosen few.  We cannot allow those who have money to be the few who go forward for election.  The peann luaidhe, ballot paper and the ability to run must never be lost on the ordinary citizen.  Every person must be able to run for election if they so wish; we cannot allow a chosen few to run this country.  That is why this Bill, no matter how flawed or imperfect it may be, is an attempt to change the system where influence is continuing.I agree with Deputy Kirk that we must have a wider debate about politics and democracy.  If the amount of money one has is the benchmark for going forward then our democracy will be the poorer.  Deputy Timmins is correct in saying that we should examine the amount of money being spent between elections.  Senator Paul Bradford gave a fine speech in Seanad Éireann a few months ago - I would ask all Members of the House to read it - about the interaction between politicians and the public.I welcome the intent to limit political donations and the influence of donors.  The majority of us in the House are not governed by what we get or do not get, or by attempted influence.  When I was a city councillor on Cork City Council I made up my own mind.  I was not influenced by anybody else but chose what I thought was best for my community.  That should be the reality for all of us.If we want to remove political donations, however, then somebody must pay for democracy.  The Minister wants to promote greater gender balance and inclusion through the legislation, which I welcome.  As somebody who had a female colleague running as a candidate in the last general election, I know it is healthy to have competition.  It poses the question as to how best we can get more men and women involved in politics.  Is it by changing our electoral system to single seat constituencies or to a list system?  Do we want our politicians to be catch-all people who do everything, or parliamentarians engaging in legislation and committee work?  If we analysed what we do every day, we would find that a disproportionate amount of work is taken up with constituency matters, which is why people come to us.The beauty of our system is that as elected politicians we can walk down the streets of our constituency and engage with the public, unlike other democracies where constituents never see a politician.  In other jurisdictions, local politicians may not even live in their constituencies.  They may go there once a month or on a weekend jaunt.The regulation of donations is important and is to be welcomed.  Equally, should we allow a Deputy to have a golf classic?  If someone wants to donate to that event, should he or she be debarred from doing so?  If I want to have a lunch to raise funds for the local Fine Gael party, should I be stopped from doing so if the donations are €100 or €200?  Personally, I do not have a problem if a person wants to contribute to a candidate or a political party, but there must be a regulation to ensure that the person confirms they have contributed.We should have full State funding of political parties.  If I had my way, I would eliminate any corporate or private donations and make the State pay the price.  In that way there would be full openness, transparency and complete honesty on behalf of the party that is being funded.The trust between politicians and the people was breached not by many but by a few who must be made to pay the price.  The actions of a few have denigrated politics.  However, for all its flaws the system of politics in our country is a good one.  As my mother used to say, "The ballot box is a great leveller.  You know where you stand and who you are when people go in to cast their votes".The Minister's policy objective is to be commended.  He is trying to involve more women in politics and is also trying to limit the relationship between money and influence on political parties.  That is the way it should be.I hope the provisions of this Bill will encourage more women to get involved in politics.  This poses the question, however, as to why fewer women than men are involved in politics.  Deputy Kirk cited some statistics in that regard.  We are 23rd in Europe as regards the number of women in parliament.  Is the party political system wrong or is the selection process by party gate-keepers the problem?  Is it the fact that we have a lob-sided calendar and schedule?  Whatever the reason, the Minister's attempt at change is to be welcomed.The political system is being reported on by the media who I believe should also be examined.  In the Fr. Reynolds case, which was a fiasco, we have seen how RTE was left to go unchecked.  Similarly, the reporting of politics must be objective and fair.  I would question the intent, agenda and motivation of some periodicals.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I am pleased with the opportunity to speak on this legislation, which I welcome wholeheartedly.  The Bill addresses two of the biggest problems facing our electoral system, namely, how politics are funded and how representative politics, or politicians, are of our people.This legislation is important as it will go some way to addressing the scepticism and cynicism surrounding politics, particularly in the area of transparent party funding.  The Bill tackles two main areas in political life.  First, it introduces greater transparency where political donations are concerned.  Second, it reduces State funding for political parties who fail to ensure that at least 30% of candidates going forward for election are women, thus giving the electorate a more balanced choice in general elections.On the first point, transparency is an essential part of restoring trust in politics.  Reducing the financial links between private money, corporate money, vested interests' money and the political world is vital to rebuilding a greater faith in our political system.  The reduction of the maximum amount a political party can accept from any one donor to €2,500 is welcome.  It will mean that our own political funding laws are brought more in line with best international practice.For example, in the United States, a country where politicians are much more reliant on donations, the maximum any individual can donate to a general election candidate is $2,400.However, it is important that we do not simply reduce the amount political parties can accept.  We must also increase the transparency levels if we are to make a significant impact on public trust in our political funding.  That is why reducing the disclosure threshold for political parties from €5,078 to €1,500 is so important.  It is also important that the public are aware of their ability to review the annual donation reports for both parties and individual politicians on the Standards In Public Office, SIPO, Commission website.  It is important to have such transparency whereby people can log on to that site to see at first hand the amounts.The redefining of what constitutes a corporate donor will also mean severe restrictions are placed on companies and trade unions when it comes to political donations.  Any donor body that is not registered with SIPO will be prohibited from contributing any more than €200 to either a political party or an individual candidate.  I note that virtually all of these moves have been welcomed by Government and opposition Deputies alike.  It is good to see such a united and determined effort to prevent special interests from influencing what is, and should always remain, a purely democratic process.This Bill will mean that the future of political funding lies in smaller, more widespread donations from members of the public.  If anything, this change will mean that all public representatives will need to devote even far more time to the interests of their constituents, something which many people have been doing but it makes it more important for us all to do.Although nobody doubts the importance of regulating political donations, it has not been the most talked about or controversial element of the Bill.  That title falls to the second element of this legislation, that of gender balance.  Upon the passing of this legislation, all political parties will be required to meet a 30% quota when it comes to putting female candidates on the ticket.  We can debate whether this quota system is the most effective way of changing our system but we must all agree that something had to be done.  Where female representation in politics is concerned, the reality is that only 15% of the Members of the Dáil are women, which is the highest ever number to date.  Since the foundation of the State there have been a total of 4,700 male Deputies elected to Dáil Eireann and just 260 women.  That latter figure tells its own story.  That is one of the main reasons this legislation has to be brought in.  Women account for 50% of the population and having only 15% of those women represented in this House makes that democracy unbalanced.  This makes the need for these changes even more pressing.That brings me to a point we must discuss when dealing with this subject, that of the Dáil not being a family friendly place.  I have no doubt that when this legislation is passed and if we are all serious about changing the structure and the representations, which I believe we are, we must make sure that this is a more family friendly place.  Late sittings into the night several nights of the week is not family friendly.  That must change.  Being a politician is onerous and pressurised for many people.There has been a lack of respect, particularly in recent years, for politics and politicians.  Respect for politicians must start in this House.  We all owe it to ourselves to have more respect for each other as politicians.  We are not representing ourselves as individuals in here but are the representatives of the people of Ireland.  It is a great honour to be elected to this House and very few people get to be elected.  Many people would love to be in this House and to be representatives but they will not get that opportunity.  Being elected to this House is a great opportunity that we should respect.  Not alone us as politicians but the media and everybody associated with working in this House should have more respect for politicians because we are representing the people.  We are not representing ourselves as individuals, we are elected to this House to represent the people and we must never forget that.  It is a great honour for anyone to be elected to his or her national parliament.  People should be humble but also respectful about it.Unfortunately, change such as that I mentioned will not occur overnight.  Therefore, we need to come up with positive, workable solutions.  Electoral gender quotas have been successful in other countries such as France, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, Portugal and Poland.  There is no reason they cannot have the same effect here.  We do not want to dictate, as was said earlier, who should be a representative.  It is the people who cast their votes in the ballot box who should have that say.A number of international organisations have looked at the notion of gender-balance representation, and the results are clear.  A more equal distribution of men and women in politics results in better decision making, a very important point.  A United Nations study into the use of quotas concluded that there is evidence from around the world where quotas have had an immediate and direct effect on women's participation.  In the same study the United Nations highlights that in Argentina, where quotas were introduced, women's participation rose from 5% to 25%.  That is why I would support this Bill, support the Government introduction of it and look forward to our having better representation from the people of Ireland in this institution.

I am also pleased to follow my senior Deputy in the constituency, Deputy Tom Hayes.  I am sure many in his party, especially the female members of the county council in south Tipperary, will be delighted to hear that he is in favour of gender quotas.  He will look forward to the convention at the next election and if the numbers are not right in Limerick, they will have to made right in Tipperary South.  Some other councillors in Tipperary South will be disappointed with him but one wins some and one loses some.  I am saying that in jest.

My constituency colleague is very much pro-gender quota, which I am not and I will come to that.Democracy, as many speakers have said, is not cheap.  While it might have been denigrated by people to a large extent in recent years and I refer to the structure, the media and everything else, it is certainly something that it is worth preserving, fighting for and ensuring that it serves the people fairly, and that it is not prestigious or in the gift of any of any particular part, group or business people.  How much would we decide that we have to pay for it?  If we were to abolish all donations in this manner and ensure it is paid for - regardless of  the number of votes any candidate or party gets in any election, be it a council, local authority or whatever - by being funded from the State, even though the State coffers are poor enough, there would be total transparency.  I have great faith in the current system where the ordinary people can give one €50 for a ticket for dance, a golf classic or whatever.  If it is only a fiver if people want to give it in good faith and in all sincerity, they would not mind the donation being recorded.  The Standards in Public Office Commission should have a record of donations and that should be available for anybody to access.I now turn to the issue of gender quotas.  There is much talk about them which is meant to be dressed up to be nice and - I hate using the word - sexy, but it is meant as a political term.  To be fair, most women I speak to do not want them and do not want to be treated as a special designated group.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	358	Fair enough, the Deputy is correct that people are not interested in them.  They are interested in having a representative they believe in and who they can vote for, be that person male or female.  We are not playing party politics but we are tinkering to the media and everyone else trying to introduce gender balances.  Most housewives and ordinary women working and in business do not care about it.  If they want to seek election to the Dáil they want to do so in their own right as Mary or Angela and not to make up a gender balance.  I say this honestly and openly on my own behalf and on behalf of the people who have told me so and offered this view to me time and again.  They like politics and dealing with politics.  In some cases where we have had female candidates people have told me, and others I am sure, it is not straightforward that they vote for women candidates as they pick the candidate of their choice and on many occasions they bypass or give a low preference to the female candidate.  We need to get serious about this and have a real interest.The Government was elected with a huge majority more than a year ago.  We knew the state the economy was in and how serious and precarious the situation was.  The Government parties, which were then in opposition, made promises.  It diminished politics because there was no need to make any promises as the public was sick and tired of the previous Government which had grown arrogant after ten, 11 or 14 years in office and its members were going to be banished anyway.  However, offers and claims were made by Deputy Gilmore, who is now Tánaiste, that it would be the Labour Party's way or Frankfurt's way.  It is funny that he had a meeting with the President-elect of France over the weekend because he offered the same thing.  Do they share this around?  Will it be passed on to the next election, which will be in Greece if another one is held there?  Is it a left-wing socialist ideal that they pass around?  If they all come together we will have a mighty bonfire and the aeroplanes will not fly in the skies because of the heat from it.  We were promised all of this and the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, who has spent much time in this House and knows more about its workings than me and many others, promised a five point plan and this, that and the other.Lo and behold when they formed the coalition they left aside their party manifestoes and five point plans.  Everything was put into the tumble dryer and what came out was a pick and mix.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, called us a pick and mix group.  However, it was pick and mix because we got this and that and one could not have this or that because the others did not agree.  The public are incensed by the con job.  We now have a more educated electorate than we did 30 or 40 years ago and they are up to speed with everything.  We have a very intrusive media - I would say it is too powerful - and the public is aware and understands.  This is why the serious issue to be voted on by the public on 31 May could go down.  The people are incensed by what they were promised knowing the coffers were bare and there was nothing in the kitty.  They did not have to make any promise.  They had the experience of 1977 when Fianna Fáil offered no rates and no taxes on cars.  I canvassed for it and I admit it.  I was delighted as a young fellow.  The people were delighted and gave the party a huge majority.  How long did that last?  What happened?  Look where we are now.  Will we ever learn?  These are the real political issues.People want honesty, openness and transparency.  The previous Government ran amok establishing quangos.  The present Government promised to get rid of them all but instead I can see nothing but an increase in the number of quangos.  I do not want to hark back but the Minister for Justice and Equality appointed a quango, the chairman of which was a man who had given him a €1,000 donation during the election before last.  What message does this send out to the ordinary people?  It puts a sour taste in their mouth.I want to mention State boards, trade unions and big business organisations such as IBEC.  I read a story in today's Irish Independent about some members, former trade union leaders and representatives of IBEC, refusing to give up their generous allowances.  This is what happened to this country and what has us where we are.  The cosy cartel got together.  The trade unions clambered up along, I know they support the Labour Party, and got into cosy partnerships under the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in programmes such as better local government and the national pay agreements which had fancy names such as Towards 2016.  They existed only to put people’s friends on them, whether they were in trade unions or political or IBEC representatives.  They forgot they were representing the ordinary punter on the ground, the same as many people do in here and I can be guilty of it too.  They all sat around the high table and shared out the spoils.  They made the deals and bought power and industrial peace but at what cost?They negotiated stupid rates of pay.  I am not speaking about the minimum wage or anything like it.  I am speaking about the minimum rates they negotiated for their members.  I could name electricians and other such people who received €22 an hour during the boom.  They received money to get up in the morning and to travel to work.  What happened us?  We all borrowed money.  The problem we have is to untangle but it is very difficult to do so because they have their hands clasped around it.  For the life of me I cannot understand why the IMF and the EU have not seen this and broken it.  One might say I am straying from the Bill but this is where we need reform.  We should not be speaking about gender quotas.I remember sitting on the Government benches for four years and being attacked about the use of the guillotine.  What is happening now?  The guillotine is being used on Bills.  A total of 70% of Government legislation has been guillotined since the return of this Dáil.  It rings hollow with everybody.  We were protesting about it when I first came to the Dáil.  I thought it was strange but all that has happened is that we have changed seats.  Why do we do it?  Is it because we do not have enough time to discuss Bills?  Is it because the real people running the country are the officials who present the Bills and drive the agenda?  I think it is.  We do not have a Minister who is strong enough to stand up to official Ireland.  We saw how the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, put on a big show over the weekend about high noon or high dawn or an early dawn raid at RTE when he was going to bring two six guns and shoot the 12 of them and banish them.  He came back holier than thou and was grand with them.  A former Minister sacked the RTE board and more power to him.  He is retired now.  Why should they not be sacked?  There is no accountability.What happened to the priest was a disgrace.  I can say on the record of the House it is not the only incident where RTE, our public service broadcaster which we all want to admire, blackguarded decent people and companies in the country and used illegal tactics-----

However, very suspect tactics were used.  As far as I am concerned they will be proven right when it comes to it.What happened on this occasion has been proved and heads have rolled, but not many heads.  Tom Savage said it was a media invention that heads would be asked for because all of these people in powerful positions know that nobody is sacked any more.  They have to know this, otherwise how could he come out and publicly say it was a media invention?  We do not have Ministers and people in charge of Departments who will take them on.  Michael McDowell, the leader of the Minister of State's former party, the Progressive Democrats, was not afraid to take them on.  We need more of these people.  We are elected to govern and not to say "yes Minister", "aye Minister", "no Minister", "what Minister" or "what for Minister".  We need to bring back the power to this building and show we are in charge, and we then go back to the electorate who will decide whether we are right or wrong.  We must break the stranglehold that has taken over during the past 30, 40, 50 or 60 years whereby these people are all-powerful.  When one cannot do anything with them, when they know too much about what they should not know or one is afraid of what they may or may not know, one promotes them to Europe.Another issue I want to deal with which I could not see in the Bill is the holding of elections on weekdays.  This is the biggest disgrace of all.  We want people to vote and we encourage them to vote but we hold elections on Thursdays.  Workers and people in college cannot go home.  Every election should be on a Saturday or Sunday.  Again, we cannot take on the people running the elections because they want jobs for themselves and their friends.  They want to be presiding officers and clerks and they get overtime and double time counting the votes on Saturdays and Sundays.  In all fairness if we want to be true democrats we should allow most people the best opportunity to vote, and Sunday would be preferable for lorry drivers and everybody else.  It would give them a chance to vote.  Break the stranglehold whereby it can only be held on a Thursday.  We tried it on Friday once or twice, but we should provide for this.  It must be changed.  They are the things that should be dealt with in this Bill but are not.We must show leadership and show the public that when we campaign on an issue, we will not proceed to do the opposite.  That sells ourselves short.  I was involved in that in the past and I do not deny it, but it must change.  The public are sick and tired of it.  That is why people, when the very important vote is held in a few weeks, might just say, "To hell with all of you" and "To hell with Europe" and vote "Níl".  Where will that leave us?  The entire system must be reformed.

They must get important and clear messages about stimulation packages and so forth and clear commitments that they will get what they vote for, and that it will not be a case of voting for one thing and getting something else.  That must change.Deputy Hayes also referred to the system being family friendly.  Certainly, the Houses of the Oireachtas should be more family friendly.  People talk about what we do and what we waste but apart from the offices there are no decent services for ordinary Members.  I am not looking for a five star hotel, but there is no rest area.  There are very few areas where one can have a private space.  There is no sacred space for prayer.  There should be one, regardless of the god one wishes to worship.  There should be a sacred space in the House where Members can have five or ten minutes of solitude or to talk to their maker, whatever description that maker might have.  That uninterrupted and peaceful space should be available for both Members and staff.  I believe it is a shame and it beggars belief that it is not available.  There should be such a space in these buildings for everybody.Independent Deputies have been attacked by various Members since we were elected.  I receive a leader's allowance.  I never knew it existed until I left the party and became an Independent Member.  It is approximately €41,000; I do not know the exact figure.  However, if one analyses the party funding, it is a con job.  Jibes are thrown at us all the time.  We get the same staff as other Members but they also have party staff.  I have all the facts and figures.  I compliment Deputy Catherine Murphy on the parliamentary questions she put down and the replies she received from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  That money is constantly being thrown at us but other Members cannot see what I could not see for four years of the last Dáil, the amount of money the parties get on their behalf.

I told the House it is approximately €41,000, but I am not sure of the exact figure.  However, the political parties get €5 million, apart from the 19 Independent Members.  That is on top of the ordinary staff and the €126,000 per Member for Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin.  The Government parties get less now that they are in Government.

The Deputy is only listening to bits of what I am saying.  I was not aware of the leader's allowance until I came to this side of the House.  However, it is there.  It is shambolic to have such a con job.  We are being told we have €41,000, which we have, but we have sought some back-up staff.  I went back and forward to Ministers and the Ceann Comhairle on this for the Technical Group, to have the number of staff the other parties have.  It is crazy.  We talk about democracy but if the 19 Independent Members of the House cannot have the same system as Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin, that is apartheid.  Political apartheid is alive and well in this Chamber.  What hope is there in talking about this Bill without being honest?I have the figures.  A total of €5.456 million was paid out last year.  Fine Gael received €2,328,207, the Labour Party received €1,312,000, Fianna Fáil received €1,081,000 and Sinn Féin received €733,000.  The Technical Group got nothing.  Where is the fairness in that?  What is the point in talking about reform of the Dáil if all the Members cannot be treated equally?  There are three funds.  There is the fund for the leaders' allowance, which all parties receive including the Technical Group.  There is a €5 million fund from the Exchequer to pay the four political parties.  As our 19 Members get none of that, instead of it going back to the Exchequer or being given for something we need, it is divided up between the four parties.  Why are they talking about improving democracy when they treat their equals in the House, all elected by the people, in that way?  It is an outright disgrace and outrage.  It is disingenuous and dishonest.It behoves the Deputies on the other side of the House to cop on to themselves and not taunt Members on this side of the House about our €41,000.  I admit we get it.  What we get is in the public domain.  However, they share €5 million among themselves and the share of it that we do not get is also spread among them.  It is rotten to the core.  They can talk about change and introducing Bills to provide for gender quotas, but they are codding the people.Fine Gael has brought forward this Bill now but it held functions two weeks ago in Punchestown.  The tent was there.  There was much talk about the Fianna Fáil tent in Galway, which I was never in and which I never supported, but Fine Gael members have a tent as well.  What were they doing?  Were they getting a fighting fund for the next ten years before they introduced the legislation?  As for the big business associations, there is no point in talking about tribunals.  They were a waste of time, to be honest, but they did exist yet nobody was prosecuted.  They involved some of Fine Gael's members as well.  There is talk now of pillorying a colleague of theirs who is a Member of this House for €500.  That would not buy 50 dinners for campaign managers.  That is not to talk of the millions that have gone side ways, backwards and other ways on the wink and the nod.Politics must be cleaned up, and it must start in this House.  If Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, Fine Gael and the Labour Party cannot treat the 19 Independent Members equally, does that mean they are afraid of us?  Do they want us out?  What is the problem?  If they cannot treat us fairly, what hope have Seán citizen and Mary citizen of getting fair play from this Government?  I put that challenge to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and the leaders of all the political parties in the House.  The figures are in the public domain, thanks to Deputy Murphy and the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  They cannot treat us fairly.  We deserve better as we were all elected as equals on that day in February.  We can be thrown out at the next election but at least give us a fair chance and the same operating tools of the trade so we can serve the public and democracy by researching Bills and reforming legislation, which is what we are supposed to do.  We cannot do that without proper back-up.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I am sharing time with Deputy Áine Collins and Tony McLoughlin.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this reforming Bill, which deals with how parties are funded and how our democracy works.  We have been in a continuum of reform over the past ten years in terms of how democracy works and to modernise the transparency that is absolutely necessary.The objective of the Bill is to limit the potential for political donations to influence the actions of political parties by reducing the cap on donations and introducing more disclosure requirements to make political finances more transparent.  Everybody would welcome a more transparent approach.  There are many aspects to the Bill as it is a complicated and far-reaching measure, but I will dwell on just some of the issues dealt with in it.  The argument in favour of caps on contributions is that it deters unacceptable relationships between lobby groups and civil organisations including corporate bodies through influencing political parties.The essence of any human organisation is the human aspect of it.  While Members are clearly influenced by those they meet or who discuss matters with them, 95% of the time this is highly positive.  For example, today I engaged in detailed discussions with Amnesty International on the issue of mental health.  While that organisation would be perceived to be a lobby group in respect of human rights issues, it plays a highly positive role in this regard.  I cite this meeting as an example of how positive lobbying can be in informing and educating legislators on important aspects of Irish society.  I make the point that while there often is a question mark over the whole area of lobbying, many NGOs make a highly positive contribution, through their lobbying activities with legislators, to influence legislation and Government policy in a positive manner.The Bill itself introduces contribution limits to prevent the perversion of elections by quid pro quo exchanges or in other words, exchanges that privilege the donor’s interests over those of the  public.  Although the common good appears to be a phrase that is not entertained as much as was the case in the past, Members have a duty to respond to the common good and to deploy the information they receive from various aspects of society, including NGOs and lobby groups, to ensure they are contributing to that common good.  The donation caps prevent the economic inequality that exists in society from being translated directly into political inequity or at least play a role in preventing such a direct translation.  Caps deter big donor culture and even academics who are sceptical about the effectiveness of caps accept they can serve to deter very large donations, such as can be found in the United States in particular.  Such a big donor culture has been described as undesirable and it is suggested that caps play a role in deterring it.  Consequently, the issue of the control and transparency of donations is extremely important.In response to the previous speaker, the contribution of donations and the contribution of the State to the democratic system by funding political parties is vital to our democracy.  No matter what their views or how much one might disagree with some of the policies of other political parties, it is important that political parties and politicians have the wherewithal to communicate in a highly complex society.  Moreover, given the highly expensive communications process that currently obtains, it is important that the political parties have the ability and the resources to communicate their message in order that the electorate can objectively be as informed as possible.  The entire objective is for them to be fully informed of all the implications of the decisions they will make in the polling booth on the future governance of the country.  While some will decry any donations to political parties, this is a negative approach that evinces a lack of understanding on how the democratic system must operate and on the complexity of the communication system.  Members must recognise the need for political parties and politicians to communicate, which is a very expensive process.  In this context, I note the management of political parties in general has become very expensive.The Bill itself will change fundamentally the manner in which politics is funded and conducted in the State.  Corporate donations will be severely curtailed and the books of political parties will be opened up to public scrutiny.  Moreover, the maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation will be more than halved and there will be greater openness, with significant reductions in the threshold for the public declarations of political donations.  Other measures in the Bill provide for greater transparency by donors and those in receipt of political donations.  This transparency will be highly positive and the donors and those who wish to contribute to political parties should be proud of what they are doing in contributing to our highly-valued democracy.  Regardless of the flaws in our democratic system and the manner in which it has let us down in many economic and societal ways, it may be said of it to paraphrase Churchill, no better way of governing one's country has been found.  Consequently, those who contribute to the political system are contributing to the survival and support of the entire democratic system.In the remaining time, I wish to deal briefly with the subject of gender quotas.  While I accept the provisions of the Bill, I have concerns about the necessity for such an intervention.  Members should read the contribution of Deputy Tuffy in this regard because it was a highly revealing and informative approach that asked the reason any group of citizens should need a gender quota.  There is something basically wrong with a political system and a society that does not recognise the need for the involvement of women, their role and the positive approach they would have in the political system for the benefit of the aforementioned precious democracy.  Women have a crucial role in this regard and some previous contributors have discussed the reasons for the differences in representation.  Certainly, the involvement of women in politics is crucial and it is interesting to note that in the Scandinavian countries, gender quotas were never legalised.  It is not legally necessary in the Scandinavian countries, that is, Sweden, Norway and Denmark, to have gender quotas although I acknowledge there are party policies in this regard.  However, one should question the reason for the position in this democratic system and this society in general.  The introduction in the 1970s of the Equality Acts was seminal in respect of equality between genders.  However, in certain areas of society, we have not moved on in this regard and it is vital to so do.  If this intervention is needed in the short term, it will be welcome to so do.  It is unfortunate that such an intervention should be made because it should not be necessary.  Society should understand and recognise the crucial and positive involvement women can have in the political system.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which essentially tackles two main areas in Irish political life.  First, it introduces greater transparency in the relationship between politics and money.  Second, it introduces a greater degree of equality among those who decide to become involved in politics as a career.  There have been many examples of too close a relationship between politics and money in recent years.  The McCracken and Moriarty tribunals both investigated payments to politicians and the Mahon tribunal has reported at an enormous cost to the State.  These tribunals have tarnished the perception of politics and those involved therein.  There is deep distrust of the current political system among the public.  The Government is committed to implementing reform and this Bill is a much-needed step in the right direction.I also welcome the proposal to encourage a greater number of women to put their names on the ballot paper.  I was never sure about the necessity for gender quotas, as good arguments can be made on both sides.  However, one need only look at the reality of the present position, which is that only 15% of the Members of this House are women and that this is the highest number in Dáil Éireann to date.  I find astonishing that I am one of only 5% of women who, since the commencement of this State, have represented the people in Dáil Éireann.  These figures were recently brought to my attention at the launch of "Women for Election" on International Women's Day, at which time Ms Olivia O'Leary recalled that on the day the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, was elected the late Garret FitzGerald had commented that while women accounted for 40% of those in the Press Gallery they comprised only 15% of the membership of the Dáil.Gender quotas have been successful in other countries, including France, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, Portugal, Poland and Canada.  Gender quotas were in operation in Canada for a number of years and are now no longer required.  It is hoped this will also be the case in Ireland.  The issue of representation of women is not confined to politics alone or to Ireland.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed across a number of platforms.  The EU recently voted in favour of mandatory quotas to boost female representation on corporate boards.  Interestingly, it is calling for a 30% quota which will be raised to 40% by 2020, which is similar to what is proposed in this legislation.  The EU Justice Commissioner, Ms Viviane Reding said that it would take another 40 years for women to achieve equal representation on boards throughout Europe, which is far too slow for much needed change.I was struck when listening to Ms Olivia O'Leary in the Mansion House by a story she told about her husband encouraging her to argue from the economic point of view, saying that economics is about the efficient use of scarce resources and that the lack of women in public life in this country is an inexcusable waste of scarce resources.  I like the phrase "An inexcusable waste of scarce resources".  It is true and sums up the situation perfectly.I support the Bill which promotes much needed transparency with regard to the relationship between politics and political contributions.  It also promotes the greater inclusion of women in public life, which can only be good for greater balance in our democratic system.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which seeks to incentivise and encourage the selection of a greater number of female candidates, which is a welcome proposal, one that has provided much debate inside and outside this House.Being a politician is more suited to the male gender than the female gender, which is wrong.  I welcome that this is being addressed by the Minister in this Bill.  The burden of home and domestic duties, even in this modern changing society, appears to lie with the woman of the house, which in essence has stifled the progress of many women climbing the political ladder.  The recent movie "The Iron Lady", which documented in a brief way the political career of former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, illustrated the 1950s era in Britain when she first tried to win a Conservative Party nomination and how this male dominated profession tried to intimidate her into not contesting.  Only for her resilience and tenacity she would never have secured her party's nomination and Britain would never have had its first and only female Prime Minister.Society has come a long way, when in the Ireland of 2012, we are introducing legislation which includes the provision that political parties will have their State political funding halved if in the next general election at least 30% of their candidates are not female and 30% are not male.  This will increase to 40% after a further seven years.  The Government must in any future legislation consider an improvement in conditions to allow women to enter politics.  I will give an example.  Currently, all elected county and city councillors pay a small PRSI contribution which bestows little or no entitlements.  A female councillor who must absent herself from council meetings or business for a period of time due to maternity has no recourse to benefits.  Surely this is not right and does not send out the right signal if we are to attract women to contest local elections in 2014.  The Government must look again at the provision of proper child support for active female politicians so as to make it easy to be a politician and a woman.  I suggest that as part of local government reform research be undertaken of the reason so few women are attracted to local government.  This should, perhaps, be done in conjunction with LAMA, AMAI and the ACCA, the councillors representative bodies.  I urge the Minister to engage with these organisations on the provision of incentives around child care and home supports which would lift the bar and attract more women into local politics.  A survey of women politicians in 2004 carried out by Knight Consultants found that the long hours culture of Leinster House was unfriendly to women with young children.  Some 69%, 16 of 23, of female Members in the previous Dáil were located in the Dublin-Leinster area, which suggests that this disincentive may be exacerbated for women who would be required to be away from home from Tuesday to Thursday.  While there is a crèche in Leinster House it is of no benefit to such women.  Also, as female Members of the Dáil and Seanad are not employees, they are not, if they become pregnant while in office, entitled to statutory maternity.   Some 86 of the 566 candidates - 15.19% - who sought election in the 2011 general election were female.  As a society that wants more women in politics, we must, if we are to attract them in the first instance, present to them an environment in which they can work and flourish as decision makers.Reform of political funding has been promised for years.  Despite that the Government has been in office for only 14 months it is introducing this far-reaching and progressive piece of political reform legislation which will significantly enhance the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland.  This legislation will address issues of serious public concern in terms of the operation of political funding arrangements in Ireland.  Corporate donations will be restricted, political party accounts will be published, the maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation will be more than halved and the transparency of such donations is being significantly enhanced.  Payments made to political parties under the electoral Acts are linked to performance at a general election.  These new requirements will, therefore, apply in respect of candidates of political parties at a general election.While this Bill is not intended to deal with individual candidates and their code of ethics, given we are dealing with political funding, regard should be had to candidates that are being funded.  I urge the Minister to consider in any future electoral Bill the disqualification of persons who have been convicted of defrauding a local authority, the State or a semi-state body, from taking a seat on a local authority or in the Oireachtas.  Such people are not fit persons to be public representatives as they may, as local or national legislators making decisions, have a bearing on many of the aforementioned State agencies.  Current legislation deals with persons subject to bankruptcy.  Given the current insolvency levels across Ireland among citizens, it is incredible that people who become bankrupt perhaps for having been over ambitious in their business would be debarred from being a Member of this House or a local authority while a person convicted of defrauding a State body is not debarred.  This area needs to be reviewed without delay.I warmly welcome this Bill as a positive step in political reform.  It is hoped that in time the Government will consider introducing in future legislative measures that will take on board the points I have made in regard to the type of people who contest elections to serve in our national and local assemblies.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation, which provides us with an opportunity to deal with the urgent need for reform and radical change in our political system.  It must be accepted that we need a complete change in Irish politics if we are to break out of the current mindset, which is conservative, stale and lacks energy.  As a Member of this House for the past ten years, I welcomed the many new Members of Dáil Éireann following the last general election, which added a freshness and energy to this House.On funding, I am sure most of my colleagues in this House would agree that corruption has damaged the political system in this country.  In politics, we are not all the same, an issue that concerns me from a democratic point of view.  Approximately 30% to 35% of the electorate believe all politicians are the same and that they are all on the take, which is totally untrue.  What is sad also is that many among that cohort of the population do not bother to vote.  This debate must be part of the broader debate on Dáil reform.  In this regard there is a need for media diversity to enhance the political system.  I have concerns about what is going on in the debate about broadcasting in this country.Whether people like it or not, a high percentage of the population is voting for independent candidates.  The recent opinion poll put us in the region of 18%.  In some constituencies, some Independent Deputies are even higher than that.  We need to change the mindset and reflect the reality that 18% to 20% of people are voting independent and thinking independent.  We need to deal with that.Part of the problem in regard to the conservative Establishment in this country is that there seems to a kind of intellectual snobbery about particular kinds or brands of Deputies.  If anybody has the honour of being elected to Dáil Éireann or to Seanad Éireann, his or her mandate should be respected.  I want to see a major change in the mindset.  There is a broad spectrum of views in this House, with Members putting forward different policies and different views on legislation.There seems to be a kind of nanny state brigade in broader society.  I take, for example, the attempt today in Seanad Éireann to ban smoking in cars with children.  The vast majority of smokers I know would never dream of smoking in a car with children.  The vast majority of people who smoke will go along with the legislation but do not want to be treated like lepers.  I raise this issue in the context of respecting different values and enjoying diversity.The Bill comprises 30 sections.  The purpose of its provision is to significantly reform political funding arrangements and to bring about a more equal gender balance among candidates at general elections.  The Bill will give effect to these reforms by way of amendments to the Electoral Act 1997, the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 and the Electoral Act 1992.  These will provide for a ban on the acceptance of donations of more than €200 for political purposes from a corporate donor unless the donor has registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I welcome that section and the fact the Minister is in the House to hear my views.  I also welcome the establishment of a register of corporate donors which shall be published and the reduction in the maximum amount that can be accepted as a donation by a political party, an accounting unit of a political party or a third party from €6,348.69, or £5,000 as it currently appears in legislation, to €2,500.  That is a welcome development in this legislation.There is a reduction in the maximum amount that can be accepted as a donation by an individual - an elected represented or an election candidate - from €2,539.40, or £2,000, to €1,000.  There is an attempt here to try to reform the system and to give everybody a fair chance.  We must understand that many people want to come into public life but they are often bullied or frightened from doing so for a number of reasons.  There are personal reasons in that they feel their private lives will be hammered in our national media and across the board.  Another reason is that many good quality candidates are frightened about the money.  When I stood for election to the Dáil in 2002, I had to borrow from the credit union to part fund my campaign because I did not get any big donations from big sponsors or people in the background.  If we want to encourage democracy and inclusivity, we must have a level playing pitch for all.The legislation provides for a reduction in the threshold at which donations must be declared by a political party to the Standards in Public Office Commission from €5,078.95, or £4,000, to €1,500 and to an individual from €634.87, or £500, to €600.  There is also a reduction in the threshold at which donations must be reported by companies, trade unions, societies and building societies in their annual accounts from €5,078.95 to €200.Broadening this out, we also need political reform.  This must be part of an overall strategy to deal with political reform.  All of us who banged on doors at the last general election were told to try to change the system to make it relevant, so I am putting forward proposals in regard to Dáil reform.  I would like us to create a real democracy with accountability at every level.  We need to cut the fat.  I am in a minority but we should try to transform the Seanad rather than abolish it and turn it into a genuine forum for civic society.  We should stop the use of the guillotine in the Dáil to pass laws which have not been scrutinised.  We should give Dáil committees the powers to examine the proposals for spending before it happens and to hold real inquiries by giving them the power to compel witnesses and documents.  We should make senior public servants responsible for their decisions and actions.  We should bring real transparency to the funding of political parties, and this is partly covered in this legislation.I feel strongly that parties should publish their annual accounts.  There should be a register and control of lobbyists and whistleblowers' legislation, which I believe is in the pipeline.  We should make all appointments to State and public bodies and the Judiciary open to public competition and Dáil scrutiny.  It should be done on the basis of meritocracy and people's ability to do the job.  Whether one is a good garda, a good judge or a good school teacher, one should be promoted, enhanced and developed based on ability.  We should ban any individual from being a director of more than three major companies or public bodies.  I put forward these proposals for discussion.  We need to conduct an urgent review of company law to ensure white collar criminals are brought to justice and I feel very strongly that we should bring back the original Freedom of Information Act.  When I knocked on the doors of Dublin North-Central at the last general election, these were the issues on which people elected me and on which they gave me a mandate.  They were on page 4 of my election leaflet.  There is no limit to what can be achieved if we all work together in the national interest.  Part of that must be Dáil reform.There is a debate about the funding of political parties which is linked to this debate on funding.  A number of my colleagues raised this issue because there is much misinformation in regard to the famous Independents leader's allowance.  I am honoured to chairperson of the Technical Group, which represents 16 Deputies.  Independent politicians have always called for reform of a system which sees the political parties receive €10.7 million in political funding.  We have harshly criticised the political party funding system which sees a whopping €10.7 million of public funds going to the main parties and yet they have a go at us about our leader's allowance.  Currently, Fine Gael receives €58,735.79 for its 75 Deputies while the Labour Party receives €63,317.54 for its 37 Deputies.  At the same time, the €41,000 received by Independent Deputies is all over the media.In regard to best practice, many of us put the spending of our leader's allowance on our websites for everyone to judge.  We use it directly for political purposes and there is a record of that on our websites.  We also use it to hire extra staff, which is very important.  I say this because it is related to the funding issue.We need to ensure all funding allowances paid to politicians are fully vouched.  The group of Independent Deputies have publicly called on the Minister to do this in the context of the funding of political parties in this State.  That is very important.  The people demand that we are accountable and they want to see an end to the kind of carry on that went on for too long.When one looks at the detail of the Bill, it proposes changes to the political finance system with a view of achieving two central policy aims.  The Minister is trying to limit the potential for political donations to influence the actions of political parties, especially when they are in government, by reducing the cap on donations and by introducing more disclosure requirement to make political finance more transparent.  It is a positive objective and it is in line with much of the Dáil reform.  It is important that we have a debate.I have different opinions on a second issue, namely, the use of political parties' public funding under the Electoral Acts to promote a gender balance in the Dáil.  I believe strongly in a meritocracy.  Someone should not get to be a Minister of State, senior Cabinet Minister or Taoiseach based on his or her sex.  Appointments should be based on merit.We must facilitate the entrance of people into public life but I would broaden the scope to include, for example, people from disadvantaged backgrounds and people who are not directly involved in the political system.  We must recognise the reality, in that many people will not enter public life because of fears that their personal lives will be exposed on the front page or page 3 of the daily newspapers.  The children of some of my colleagues in the Independent group have been written about by newspapers despite having nothing to do with politics.  This is unacceptable.  A number of my friends have had their personal issues publicised.  Have a go at me about my political ability any time but anyone who goes near a friend or family member is crossing a dangerous line.  Although we should never accept such activity, the sad reality is that it is part of the so-called political debate.  Politicians from all parties should unite on this issue.  What people do in their private lives is their own business.  People can have a go at us for what we do in the Chamber or in our constituency clinics, but our decisions have nothing to do with our children, partners or extended family members.  We need responsible reporting, diversity in the media and so on.  There is no point in discussing the reform of political life if the people involved will not go along with it.Section 6 amends section 23A of the Electoral Act 1997 to reduce the cap on donations to political parties, accounting units of political parties or third parties from €6,348.69 to €2,500.  Under section 9, any donation in excess of €1,500 to a political party or €600 to an individual must be disclosed by the recipient to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  This is a positive measure.  We need to know from where people are getting their money.  If one is doing gigs for a political party or for one's own election, that is one's own business.  One can sell tickets, hold table quizzes, run sing-songs or so on as long as one keeps those efforts within the guidelines.  One should also be conscious of the fact that some people assume they can use money to gain clout over a person who gets into office.It is well established that Ireland's Parliament has one of the poorest gender balance records of European OECD countries.  This fact was documented in a 2009 joint Oireachtas committee report on women's participation in politics.  That report contained a number of interesting statistics.  Of the 166 Dáil seats, only 25 are currently held by women, some 15.25% compared with 13.3% in the Thirtieth and Twenty-ninth Dáileanna.  These figures compare with a European average of 24%.  It is important that we consider examples of good practice.  We must ensure that people make it in politics because of their ability, constituency work rates and public service.I will target the phrase "public service".  Some sections of society seem to believe that all politicians are not interested in the public good.  I am not moaning about the job, as I love it, but it can be difficult at times.  In the current economic climate, it is easy to be cynical about politicians and Ministers.  We need to reintroduce the sense of public service.  Most councillors, Senators, Deputies and Ministers are in their jobs for the right reasons - they love their country and want to be credible public servants.The same approach should be taken to the gender issue.  We must consider why not enough women put themselves forward for election.  Only 91 women have served in Dáil Éireann since the beginning of the State.  This low figure is reflected at Government level, in that only 7% of the 181 people who have served in Cabinets since 1922 have been women.  We must take this matter seriously.Women are under-represented at local level, accounting for only 16% of local councillors and 12% of regional authority members.  Women's representation on councils has been consistently low for decades, reaching a modest 15% for the first time in 1999.  At the 2004 local elections, women filled 152 city council seats, amounting to 17% in total.  The position worsened at the 2009 local elections, when women only won 16% of the seats available.Compare these figures with those of the organisations on the ground.  A large number of women have been involved in my election teams.  They are outstanding canvassers and workers and are all involved in their local communities, be it in the form of parents councils in schools, groups representing disabled children or helping the elderly.  A large percentage of volunteers are women.  I have asked many members of my election team to go forward at local elections, but they do not want to enter into public live because of two major issues that have not yet been addressed during this debate.  If they join Dublin City Council or Dáil Éireann, they believe their privacy and families will be threatened.  These issues must be examined.In the 2002 general election, 18.1% of all candidates were women.  In the 2007 general election, 17.4% were women.  In the 2011 general election, 15.2% were women, representing 86 candidates.  There is an issue.We must also address the question of family issues, although this is not a concern for women alone.  It is a question of equality.  If the Dáil works unsocial hours, we must examine the reasons.  Many Members have young children.  I am not too bad, as my two children are reared and I have a bit more free time.  For young parents, however, being a Member is difficult, as it is for rural Deputies who must travel to Dublin for three or four nights every week.  We must be radical and sensible when considering ideas on how to deal with this issue.I welcome this debate.  I also welcome the Bill as a starting point for a real discussion on the future of Irish politics.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I commend the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on introducing this progressive and reforming Bill.  During my contribution, I will mention the gender parity measures contained in the legislation.Overwhelmingly, political decisions that affect women are made by men, nowhere more so than in this Parliament.  For this reason, that the Government is set to introduce legislation to bring a gender balance to general elections is a significant development.  Such legislation is badly needed.  The statistics on female Irish parliamentarians are a cause for concern.  For example, there are eight men for every woman in the Dáil.  In total, there are 25 female Deputies out of a possible 166.  Regrettably and embarrassingly, this is one of the lowest percentages in any European parliament.  Outside of the European Union, the average for women's participation in the parliaments of sub-Saharan countries is 19%, which is ahead of Ireland.  We have made limited progress on our UN commitment to achieve a female participation rate of 30%.  At the rate we are going it will take at least 370 years for the proportion of women in the Dáil to reach 50%.  The lack of female politicians at the level of policy and law making is a reflection of the difficulties women in Ireland face in accessing employment in general.  The hours that our Parliament observes are unsocial and not conducive to family life, which disadvantages women with young children.  I am sure this is an issue to which all working women can relate.I recently attended a debate organised in Cork city by the 50:50 group.  Despite being held on a Monday night during what could be described as unsociable hours, the hall was packed.  This demonstrates that females participate in political campaigns when they are relevant to them.  The participation of women in decision making and policy is crucial in order to secure and highlight their position in society generally.  Inclusion of women's perspectives in Government policies and programmes would allow issues such as child care, equality in the workplace, social welfare, pension reform, retirement security, home care, long-term care, housing and domestic violence to be properly addressed.The influence of women on Irish politics far outweighs their small numbers.  Dr. Mary Robinson revolutionised the role of the President and raised not only the profile of mná na hÉireann, but also Ireland's reputation internationally.  She was subsequently appointed to a position at the UN thanks to her achievements during her short time as President.  A more recent President, Mrs. Mary McAleese, provided a model for what women can achieve as politicians.  A former Labour Party Deputy from my constituency of Cork South-Central, Eileen Desmond, will always be remembered as one of the outstanding women Members produced by our Parliament.  She was the first women since Countess Markievicz to be appointed to a senior Cabinet position and thousands of unemployed people in the Cork region and elsewhere remember her for her compassion even though she only served for a brief period.One third of the Oireachtas Members of my party are female.  While that is not something I can be boastful about given that it is short of the targets set down in this Bill, it is a beginning.  The achievement of gender balance is a policy which the Labour Party has advocated for over the years.  A proposal to increase female participation in politics was set out in our 2007 election manifesto and repeated in our 2011 manifesto before finding its way into the programme for Government and this legislation.  In 2008 I introduced a Private Members' Bill which contained similar provisions to what we are now debating.  My Bill sought to increase female participation through a candidate selection process which ensured that a specific number of female candidates were included on the ballot sheet.  Commentators at the time argued this could not be achieved and some even went so far as to assert it should not be attempted.I am glad the Minister has achieved the goals that a modern democracy demands.  The changes proposed in the Bill include cuts to State funding for political parties that do not ensure a minimum of 30% of their candidates at the next general election are female.  This ratio will increase to 40% after seven years.  My only regret is that the provision applies solely to general elections.  The Minister has taken account of the suggestions made in this and the other House to extend the provision to local elections but he has indicated that a number of difficulties arise in this regard because funding for political parties is based on the outcome of general elections.  I am sure he will give further consideration to this issue on Committee Stage.  Most Members have come through the local government system.  If these reforms are not put in place at local government level we will not see a sufficient increase in the number of women elected to local authorities.  If this legislation is to be successful, it will have to facilitate the transition of women from local government to the Oireachtas.The Government is committed to creating a more transparent and equal political system.  This Bill reflects the changes we have advocated over the years.  It deals comprehensively with the funding of political parties and it begins a journey which will bring Ireland in line with our European neighbours by moving us from the bottom of the class in terms of female participation in parliamentary politics.  It will also make us compliant with the resolution of the European Parliament that member states should increase gender balance among electoral candidates.  However, the ultimate aim of the Bill is not to establish gender quotas but to ensure sufficient female candidates are on the ballot.  Gender parity is not a gender issue; it is a societal issue.  This Bill corrects the gender imbalance that has existed in Irish politics since the foundation of the State.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	380	My colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, concentrated on the gender balance provisions contained in this Bill.  I commend the Minister on these provisions, which are profoundly progressive and extremely welcome.  They will bring Ireland into line with best practice and, in many cases, allow us to be even more progressive than many countries.It is understandable that debates on women in politics tend to revolve around ideas about culture.  I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath that many of these cultural factors mitigate against women's participation in politics.  However, as politicians we can play a role not only in discussing ways of changing culture and asking how people can be persuaded to think differently about politics, but also by introducing measures that bring about this change.  Instead of holding a sometimes vague debate about changing culture, we can legislate for change.  The measures on gender balance set out in this Bill are progressive and ingenious.  In time they will be successfully directed to bring about the change that would not otherwise happen.That brings me to my second main point about the Bill.  It is an earnest of the Government's intention and good faith in respect of the overall reform programme to which the programme for Government is committed.  Earlier Deputy Mattie McGrath from Tipperary South made a speech, which I have heard him make previously here, about myriads of promises made before general elections with the suggestion that none of them had been kept, which of course, is not true.  Ministers and Deputies on the Government side of the House are often so busy concentrating on doing the work that they do not make the point in the House often enough that the area of reform in the programme for Government is being pursued and legislation is being introduced.We are putting our legislative money where our mouth is, if that is not an unfortunate metaphor in this debate.  We are debating a Bill to reform the electoral system, which represents actual progressive change in our political system which will have a real impact on how Irish politics is managed and functions in our democracy.  The heads of a Bill on whistle blowing have already been produced and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, of which I have the honour of being Chairman, has already begun a discussion on it to assist the Minister.  The Government has already been involved in an early scoping exercise to report on how legislation on lobbyists might appear, and that legislation will happen.  The Government is also considering legislation on Executive responsibility and Civil Service responsibility, which I believe will be pursued.  There is a real commitment by the Government to introduce changes on the Freedom of Information Act and to roll back some of the unacceptable curtailments that were introduced.  This is a Government that is being true to the undertakings in the programme for Government, which was agreed just over a year ago.Let us consider the recommendations from the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals.  The recent Mahon tribunal recommendations were summarised under seven different sections.  The Government is already moving on five of those seven areas: whistle-blowers legislation; limits on the amounts that can be given in political donations; the requirement in respect of transparency of donations; the register of lobbyists; and - perhaps this remains to be addressed - the expansion of disclosure requirements for public officials to include areas of conflict of interest.  The Government is alive to all these issues.  Sometimes those of us on the backbenches can be frustrated at the pace of change.  That is natural and understandable because part of our job is to continue to advocate and agitate for these changes.  I am very happy that most of the headline reform issues are being pursued by the Government.  This Bill is an important example not of broken promises, but of promises actually being fulfilled.I particularly welcome the provisions in the Bill on the source of election funding.  As a practising politician, I have been through a number of elections - although not as many as some of my colleagues in the House at the moment.  Leaving aside the source of funding for a moment, we need to ask ourselves if the overall aggregate amount of money spent on elections is excessive.  There is an element of self-criticism in this.  I have driven for two or three miles along roads on the south side of Dublin and put up a poster along every second lamppost - sometimes every lamppost.  We then congratulate ourselves on how well it looks with a sweep of posters continuing for a few miles.  What in the name of God are we doing, trying to festoon every lamppost across miles of roads whether in suburban, urban or rural areas?  Is it absolutely necessary?  Perhaps curtailing the source of funding will have a consequence on the overall amount of hardware out there.  I am not against posters and believe their presence at election time is part of the process of an election.  However, I wonder whether there are too many of them and whether we could consider a way to curtail the number - not the fact - of posters that appear at election time.Last night I was out campaigning in favour of the stability treaty and I heard opposite views by people who lived two or three doors apart.  One complained of not having received enough information even though I was standing ready to hand over a leaflet.  Other people complained they received too much and effectively regarded it as junk mail which they did not want it in the letterbox at all.  It is not always easy to strike the right balance regarding the amount of material that is distributed, bit it is a matter that should give us cause for thought.I very much welcome the proposals to reduce the limits on the amounts that can be donated.  I welcome even more the additional transparency that will be introduced, which is progressive and correct.  I believe I understand the legal background as to why an absolute ban on corporate donations would fall foul of the Constitution.  Perhaps during the course of the passage of this legislation we could have a more extensive debate on why that is so.  There is considerable jurisprudence in the United States on freedom of expression suggesting that making a financial donation is essentially a form of freedom of expression and to curtail that in absolute terms would offend against the American constitution.  I hope we would be absolutely clear in monitoring this in the future.I ask the Minister to address this in his closing remarks if he has an opportunity.  I understand that donations of up to €200 can be given by corporate entities in the previous manner in which they were given, but anything above that would require the corporate body making the donation to be registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission and ensure a resolution was passed by its general meeting authorising that donation.  Even in circumstances where a corporate body registers with the Standards in Public Office Commission and passes a motion at its general meeting, is there still a restriction on the amount that such registered entities can give?I raise this matter for the purpose of it being shot down, which I hope it will be.  Is there any concern that in the future, given what we have seen in the US, corporate entities could possibly be set up just for the purposes of donating to political parties?  It is hard to imagine that happening in our current situation.  However, in the future could a new body - let us call it "Builders' Friends Ireland Limited" be set up?  It could register with the Standards in Public Office Commission and pass motions to make donations - perhaps large ones - to political parties.  That kind of thing has happened in the US where such entities are interposing themselves into the political system.  It may be that the architecture of this legislation would not allow that to happen, but it is important that we would guard against that occurring.  There is little or no likelihood of it happening at the moment, but when we pass legislation we should think about the future.I welcome the legislation and am grateful for the opportunity to speak.

We must make strong efforts to bring about improvements in these two areas because of their importance to the system as a whole.  The Bill is a blunt instrument in achieving gender balance.  Any reasonable measure to improve gender balance is right and proper.  However, we need to look behind the numbers at the reason so few women offer themselves for election in the first instance.  We must also scenario-test the 30% figure.  What happens if a political party does not have the required 30% of women offering themselves for selection?

Táim i gcoinne an leasaithe atá curtha os comhair na Dála ag an Rialtas ar an cheist seo mar measaim nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag glacadh leis go bhfuil botún á dhéanamh agus go bhfuil an córas, mar atá sé faoi láthair, maidir le domiciliary care allowance míchothrom.To prevent some Government Deputies from putting words in my mouth, as they have done in the past, I will begin by acknowledging that the Department does need to employ control measures, including assessment and review procedures, to ensure domiciliary care payments are made only for eligible children.  I would say the same for any other social welfare payment.  A certain degree of control is required to ensure nobody is in receipt of a payment he or she should not receive.  However, the current application, assessment and review processes are not fair.  They place parents under undue stress that could and should be avoided, particularly given the circumstances.  As my colleague Deputy Sandra McLellan indicated last night, Sinn Féin welcomes the spirit behind the Technical Group motion, although we do not agree with all of the specific proposals.The domiciliary care allowance scheme requires significant reform and Sinn Féin has proposals of its own in that regard.  I have put some of those suggestions to the Minister, Deputy Burton, and last week I put some of them to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  In the past weeks and months I have highlighted these issues and I am happy to be able to say that some of my suggestions have been taken on board by the Minister and the Department.  Notably, I recommended during debate on Priority Questions recently that the notice period for the review needed to be significantly extended.  I am glad she has now arranged for that.I note from the Minister's speech last night that from now on, claimants are to be informed of any scheduled review date at the commencement of their claim.  This is welcome.  In future, when people's claim is accepted, they will be told whether to expect a review and given an approximate date for the review.  However, the Bill does not address the fears growing among the 24,000 parents already in receipt of the payment.  As I said to the Minister of State last week during a Topical Issue debate on this issue, I took some time to peruse the on-line discussion forums for parents of children with special needs.  I strongly suggest that Ministers, backbenchers and Deputies should do likewise.  The issues of domiciliary care allowance applications, reviews and appeals are hot topics on forums like MagicMum.com,
rollercoaster.ie and various other Facebook causes pages.  The level of both confusion and fear to which these reviews give rise is something of which the Minister should take heed and to which she should respond.  The fear is fed by the unfairness and the lack of transparency in the system currently.  It is also fed by confusion.  Some people seem to think everybody will be reviewed imminently and assume that every review will result in the withdrawal of payment.  This incorrect assumption requires a response, but it has arisen due to the fact that the system is not as transparent as it should be.I suggest the Minister should arrange for a letter to be sent to all domiciliary care allowance recipients, informing them whether a review has been recommended by a medical doctor who decided their cases.  If so, they should be informed when that review is scheduled to arise.  The letter should also include advice on what supporting evidence, letters or reports should be gathered in advance of the review and advice on writing a diary of the extra care needs of their children.  This is a simple message to go out in 24,000 letters and it is not beyond the Department to do that in order to allay the fears of the many parents who have contacted me and many other Deputies.The Government amendment to the motion and the Minister's speech last night seem to suggest the Government thinks the domiciliary care scheme and the procedures around it are fine as they are and that the small steps that have been taken with regard to notice period and the like are all that are required in terms of review.  The Government states that the application and assessment process are equitable and fair, but the tone suggests that the review the Minister suggested in her contribution may not be as genuine a review as suggested and may not be a genuine effort to ensure the scheme is fair and transparent to all.  Her conclusions appear to be pre-drawn, which would be wrong.  Is her review just another fig leaf to cover another government failure.  Hopefully not.The amendment and the Minister's speech also fail to address a point I raised last week with regard to domiciliary care allowance being cut off while individual reviews are still in progress.  It has been brought to my attention that due to a backlog of reviews, a number of domiciliary care payments have been cut off before the Department reviews have been completed.  That is a scandal.  The parents had been written to and told the review was to take place and they were asked to submit their forms and supporting documentation.  They complied with this, but when the notice period concluded, their payment was cut off, although the Department had not yet fully assessed their documents.  This is a serious concern and indicates that the overriding concern of the Department may be the need to reduce costs or spending on this scheme and as a result fair procedures and the needs of the disabled children are falling second to this.  Surely, any Minister or government would agree that no payment should be in advance of the completion of a review.  This is a simple request to which I hope the Minister will agree.In addition, I strongly urge the Minister to ensure that no domiciliary claim in payment is stopped without the Department first meeting the claimant and affording him or her an oral hearing.  When I suggested this to the Minister previously, she - purposely I suspect - misunderstood my meaning.  I do not suggest that the Department's medical officers should take on direct responsibility for diagnosing or clinically assessing the children.  Rather, I suggest that no claim should be cut off without the parent being offered an oral hearing with a deciding officer and given the opportunity to explain in person the additional care needs of his or her child.The guidelines for deciding officers are a problem and need to be changed.  First, the normal age of attainment lists do not go beyond four years and this is something to which I will return at a later dater.  Second, the two lists in appendix 8 of diagnoses that are more or less likely to give rise to eligibility seem to create unfair presumptions in the minds of deciding officers.  This means that parents of children with certain diagnoses, including most forms of autism, have a higher barrier to jump to prove eligibility than a child with an equivalent level of care needs but a different diagnosis.  The Minister denied, in response to parliamentary questions I put, that appendix 8 is unfair.  However, subsequently classic autism was shifted from one list to another, a tacit acknowledgement that the list is unfair.  It is only a matter of time before somebody successfully convinces the courts to make the Minister eat her words on this.  Therefore, I implore her to save these families the heartache and to reform the system now of her own volition because it is the right thing to do.As mentioned, Sinn Féin does not fully agree with a number of proposals in the motion moved by the Technical Group.  I do not have the time to go into these now, but I will inform Deputy Murphy so that she understands my concerns.  Given the Minister's speech last night, I cannot support the Government amendment.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I ask the Chair to indicate to me when I have a minute of my time remaining.  I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  I understand the tremendous frustration and upset it has caused to many parents of children with disability.  Many constituents who have been in touch with me and my office are experiencing great difficulty in regard to the domiciliary care allowance.  Some of the core problems relate to the time since it transferred to the Department of Social Protection and also to the fact that reviews are being carried out more frequently.  To my best knowledge, neither the Department of Health and Children nor the HSE used to carry out reviews once the allowance had been granted.A situation, suggested by some, whereby there is a 52% success rate upon appeal would be a cause of great concern and, if it is the case, cannot be allowed to continue.  It is a clear indication that the original decision-making process contains flaws and difficulties.  I would also be very concerned about the expense families must occur in having to pay private facilities large sums of money to have assessments carried out in the timeline required by the Department, if these services are not available in the public system.  Any review of the system must take cognisance of this.An important point to be made in respect of disability is that it covers a wide range.  Taking the autism spectrum disorder in particular, this is written into its definition.  It is a spectrum, a range of disability, that goes from being so severe that, sadly, the only real option is institutional care, to being so mild that many children are in their 20s by the time they are diagnosed and the condition picked up.  In a situation where we have limited budgets and an economic downturn we have to ensure the resources are focused on those who need them most.  The point has been made that the total fund for the domiciliary care allowance has not only been maintained, but has increased.There is also an issue around support for disability, in particular for children.  I believe we have been looking at this in isolation.  There is funding going through the Departments of Education and Skills, Health, Social Protection and Children and Youth Affairs.  Perhaps we need more joined-up thinking in order to ensure the funding goes to those children who have the greatest need.  On the side of the Department of Health, we have taken a number of initiatives.  In regard to autism we have initiated a review of services so that the current scenario of very uneven delivery of service can be addressed from within our existing budget.  We also seek to examine new ways of delivering the services in order that children's needs can be met in a more cost-effective fashion.  Another initiative we have taken is that we now have a named person, at principal officer level, across the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Children and Youth Affairs with the aim of ensuring proper cohesion between the services for children with autism and other communications disorders.  Next year, Ireland will have the EU Presidency.  My Department has made the issue of autism and children with communications difficulty a priority for our Presidency.The great work parents do with children with disability is certainly recognised by me and the Government and we seek to support it.  I have had meetings with the Minister for Social Protection on a number of occasions and am very pleased her Department is undertaking a policy review of the DCA in order to clarify whether legislative change is required and, in particular, to examine whether the current administrative process needs further refinement.  Part of this review will also examine the regularity with which reviews are carried out, taking into account the impact on families in regard to the need for fresh reports, which are often made at great personal expense.Two years ago, the Department of Social Protection took over the administration of the scheme - which I believe to be proper.  It is consistent with Government policy on having a person-centred approach to the delivery of services income and other supports to people with a disability.  The DCA scheme is now a statutory scheme with primary legislation provided for in the Social Welfare Act and the Pensions Act 2008.I wish to place on the record of the House my acknowledgment of the extraordinary commitment of parents to their children, especially those with disability.  All they seek is that their child is allowed to reach his or her full potential.  I want to support them, as does this Government.  I welcome the review by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, of the domiciliary care allowance.  I hope it will clarify the administrative process and address the difficulties being experienced by many parents who are struggling to provide for their children.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and also welcome the comments of the Minister in regard to the joined-up thinking that needs to happen in dealing with and meeting the needs of children, an approach for which I have long advocated.  With the publication of child protection legislation we see that each Department now has a role and responsibility in this regard.  This is the kind of different thinking and service-led approach we must endeavour to pursue in order to meet the needs of children, in particular those with special needs.The statistics from the Department of Social Protection show that throughout the island of Ireland the domiciliary care allowance supports 24,000 families and 26,000 children at a cost of more than €100 million a year.  Since the Department of Social Protection took over the scheme from the HSE in April of 2009, as mentioned by the Minister, this move takes children with special needs out of a medicalised model and treats them as individuals with individual needs.  The Department of Social Protection is best-placed to continue to administer this payment, rather than transferring the responsibility back to the Department of Health.It is worth remembering that in spite of reductions in expenditure on social protection there have been no cuts in the level of spending on domiciliary care allowance although savings have had to be made across a wide range of other areas in order to meet with the cost savings required as a result of the legacy of destruction left by the Fianna Fáil-led Administration.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, mentioned this last night, but it is important to point it out again because it was raised in the House by a number of Deputies.Every Deputy present is fully aware of the situation because of the kind of work that comes across our desks in our constituencies.  It concerns reviews, the time they take and the short window parents have in their engagement with the Department.  Reviews are an unfortunate if necessary evil but we must allow adequate time for a review to take place.  To this end the Department of Social Protection has taken a number of steps to improve communication with parents and guardians.  Every Member, across the House, will welcome this as we know the criticism often levelled against big bureaucracy, namely, its inability to  access accurate and timely information.  For example, the parents and guardians concerned are now being told by the Department of Social Protection the review date that will apply in their case after their claim is initially awarded.  They are also given 60 days in which to find and return evidence for the review.  This will address some of the concerns about the timeframe allowed and will provide extra time to gather supporting documentation and medical reports they wish to submit in advance of the review.The Minister for Social Protection has instructed her Department to work with all the other relevant Departments, Health, Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs, each of which has a role in providing supports and services for families and children with special needs.  These Departments are to work together to map the availability of services and examine the scope for greater linkage and consistency in the assessment for such supports and services.  This is a much overdue reform, one that will give us a working integrated Government that does not work in independent silos and allow children's needs to fall between the cracks.  This is a welcome development.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this subject.  Although I understand the Minister intends to make much needed changes to the DCA and its processes, which I truly welcome, I wish to make some points about which I feel very strongly.I am a representative of the people of Meath-East but my involvement in the political process started with the special needs division of the National Parents Council.  Involvement in politics is the way most people seek to influence decision makers, through dialogue, negotiation and by debating on the floor of the Dáil, something we all do on a daily basis.  We must examine our society in terms of the human rights of children and families with disabilities.  These are children who cannot live independent lives.  While sitting in the Chamber, I often look at the flag and think about what it means.  The same flag must cherish all children to be equal, to have equal living conditions and full participation in community life.  I have fundamental problems with the delivery of services to our sick children.  The responsibility to make changes to services rests with the Minister and the officials.  Some of our children are very sick and need 24-hour care, seven days a week.  The vast majority live at home with their families and some of them will never play soccer, Gaelic football or rugby.  Most of them will never write a letter of complaint to a Minister.  Some of the children will never work and some will never attend a mainstream school yet the flag in this Chamber says there must be equality for all our children.  We are not talking about people who make fraudulent claims for social welfare, those who fake disabled parking permits or exaggerate mild injuries to claim benefits.  We are talking about sick and vulnerable children.On behalf of the children, I ask the Minister to make two changes to the process.  The first concerns the review, particularly the language in the documentation and the questions asked during the review process.  I welcome the parents in the Visitors Gallery.  Those involved with children, particularly those with special needs or particular family circumstances, understand the stress of everyday life.  At times of total chaos, any little hope of an improvement in the child is a huge milestone.  To sit in front of an administrator in a review process and to be asked flippant questions, although not deliberate, is extremely hurtful and disingenuous in respect of the efforts and enormous stress most of those parents go through.  I want the review process to examine the language in the paperwork and the approach of the people behind the interview and the review process.I welcome the review to which the Minister agreed last night.  In any review, we will draw on medical professionals and departmental officials who have been, and will continue to be, trained to conduct reviews but the process must involve parents.  Parents know what they go through on a daily basis and can relay information.  More important, they can relay how the slightest change to services, domiciliary care payments or access to respite has a major impact on families and children.  Direct experiences enrich the review process and make it valuable.  I urge the Minister to ensure parents are involved.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	387	While I do not agree with everything in the motion, I welcome the debate.  I read some but not all the speeches on this topic.  We can all agree on a number of key areas.  What families go through when applying to the domiciliary care allowance is something for which they can never be rewarded sufficiently.  The carers, loved ones and the person they are minding need all the help they can get.  We must constantly try to improve the system of dealing with applications and what we can offer.  There is an issue with trying to maximise the use of budgets but we must strive to improve the system.  I accept, as does the Minister, that we must try to improve elements in this motion.  We can never do enough for any family that needs extra help and attention.  In opposition and in government, I always said that I wish we could do more.  We cannot do enough but we must try to improve it.We can certainly try to improve how it is administered.  I was struck by the comments of Deputy Pringle, who said that families should not have to wait weeks or months for the appeal process.  Deputy Pringle also said that it is vital the system quickly recognises the children and the family.  Deputy Pringle is correct that the system does not do so at present and we must recognise when parents and children need more help and additional support.  This must apply to the Departments of Health, Social Protection and Education and Skills.  It cannot always be a fight and the earlier we make intervention, the better.I agree it should not always involve massive cost.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, touched on this issue.  I do not accept an application or appeal should involve massive cost although it does.  There is an onus on everyone involved - the Department and especially GPs - to step up to the mark and do more.  Constituents come to Deputies' offices on a daily basis looking for help with applications.  On many occasions, it is an application for domiciliary care allowance.  I am disappointed with the effort made by GPs on behalf of patients.  Their word is better than any Deputy's word to convince people in the Department that someone needs extra help.  Hopefully we can make progress on the point.  Perhaps this issue will be dealt with in the review process referred to by the Minister last night, so we have better engagement between those who are supposed to know best and the patients.I am happy the Minister agreed to the 60-day period.  It is something we had to move to and I commend the Minister on the change.  Families have 60 days to provide information, which should be ample time.  It is important everyone retains the payment when the review is finished but this does not always happen.  We work must work on it.  People will now be told the date of the review if the claim is successful.  We would rather there were no reviews but there must be control measures.  During the meeting of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education we had a debate on the need for reviews and control measures.  In this area, it is obvious in some cases that the child does not need review.  We need more cases where decisions are made that no review is required and the case is put to one side.  That can be dealt with in the Minister's review of the system.Some people talked about transferring this function to the Department of Health.  With no offence to the Minister, who has just left the Chamber, that would be a retrograde step.  We must give credit to the Department of Social Protection.  In opposition and as a member of the Government party, I will say when things are wrong.  Not everything is perfect but many positive changes have been made in the Department, which has taken steps in the right direction.  If we switch the function to another Department, we will delay the process of change without achieving anything.  While I accept some element of the motion, I could not agree with the proposal to return the function to the Department of Health.  It is unfair to the Department of Social Protection, which is doing a good job.I am happy that there is a standard system even though the application form must be changed.  There must be room for the family to tell a story.  I urge parents to write out the full story over four or five pages, to get across exactly what happens in the house on a daily basis to the decision maker.  The application form does not allow for that.  I am happy the process is standard throughout the country.  My colleagues in County Meath agree that, previously, an address decided the service or grant one received.  That is unacceptable because people need to know if they are entitled to something, irrespective of where they are.  This is a grey area and we must improve on it and try to get some standards.  We must do better in this area and I hope the Minister's review will be timely so that we can make progress.  Let us not pick on the wrong staff; this issue concerns volume and the fact that we can never do enough.  Let us work together.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy and Members of the Technical Group for tabling the motion and affording us the opportunity to debate the issue of the domiciliary care allowance in the House.  More important, it provides parents with an opportunity to tell their stories in the AV room of Leinster House and through the media.  Some of them are in the Visitors Gallery.I particularly want to acknowledge the parents who are here tonight from all around the country.  No parent of a child with special needs is a natural protester; they simply do not have the time to be a protester and raising a child with special needs does not lend itself to finding that time.  Therefore the fact that they are here in the Visitors Gallery tonight says more than any of us ever can about how much this issue means to them and how determined they are that their voices are heard but more important, perhaps, the voices of their children.  I thank those parents in the Visitors Gallery and I acknowledge that although they are here in large numbers, it is probably a small representation of the concerns of many families throughout the country.Collectively, parents of children with special needs are owed an apology by this institution, by my party, by other parties, by people of no party, because even in the years of plenty, even in the years when the Celtic tiger roared, many of the issues and the challenges that families of children with special needs are facing now, they were facing then.  Admittedly, while the recession has posed additional challenges, this idea that everything was rosy in the years of economic well-being, is a myth and this says much about how this institution, these Houses of Parliament, treated people and children with disabilities and their families.  As a Member of this institution, I want to record my regret and my apology that this has happened.There is no doubt in my mind that we need an urgent review of the domiciliary care allowance scheme and how it operates.  The delays are unacceptable, the inconsistencies in decisions are unfair and the system of reviewing cases can, at times, be cold, illogical and ill-timed.  I welcome the fact that the Government has now undertaken to carry out this urgent review.  This in itself has moved the matter on because it has dispelled the myth that everything is all right with the scheme and that has been the response we have been getting from this Government and from previous Governments in response to parliamentary questions and Topical Issue matters in this House that everything is fine with the system.  Last night, the Minister shifted that position in a very welcome direction by conceding that all is not well and that there is a need for an urgent review and this is to be welcomed.  As my colleague, Deputy Regina Doherty said, it is vital that any such review has a way for parents and carers to input into that review.  It cannot simply be some form of technocratic, bureaucratic, Civil Service review, with all due respect to all of those individuals under those terms.  It has to involve parents because so much of what goes on in the life of a child with special needs happens behind closed doors.  Parents are the experts.I wish to address an issue with which I am very familiar and with which I have worked closely with others, the issue of autism.  The current system is not addressing the needs of children on the autistic spectrum in an adequate manner.  It is almost impossible for parents to explain to the Department the needs of their child.  It is almost impossible for parents to be able to put across the needs of their child in the current application system.  This needs to be addressed.  In addition, autism does not go away; there is no cure.  Parents, teachers and families can work with children with autism.  Progress can be made, coping skills can be developed.  I have seen it in my own relatives.  However, the autism is still there, it does not go away.  If one goes into the home of any child with autism, in addition to the many gifts that child has and the joy and the love he or she brings to the family, the challenges remain.  The pressures on families remain and all too often, the support systems are not there.  We need people in the Department, regardless of political affiliations, to understand this.While I appreciate that cases need to be reviewed - as do many parents - this needs to be done in a much more structured manner.  Parents need to be given ample time and I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Murphy's motion in this regard.  The reviews need to take place at a sensible time in the child's life.  It is not right to put the family through the stress of a review at a pivotal moment in that child's life, for example, at the transition from one school to another.  There need to be compassion and common sense needs to be evident throughout the Department.I received an e-mail from a constituent family today who told me they were informed in November 2010 that an oral hearing would take place at a date yet undecided.  In summer 2011, they were given the date for that oral hearing.  They went to the oral hearing not knowing what to expect.This review cannot be open-ended, it has to be meaningful and it has to involve parents and there has to be an implementation.  On a final point, it is totally unacceptable that any Department sends out a letter with the anonymous signature, "DCA Section".  The very least families of children with disabilities deserve is that if a civil servant sends out a letter on behalf of a Department, that letter is signed by a named person and that somebody is accountable for that file.  There are people behind these decisions and we need to know them.I welcome the review but we must deliver on it and I thank Deputy Murphy for the opportunity.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The issue of domiciliary care allowance has attracted much attention in recent weeks and I welcome the opportunity to highlight aspects of the current situation which have been deliberately misrepresented.  I unequivocally reject the charges made in this House that the Government is targeting children with autism.  It is a tasteless and cheap charge designed to whip up people's fears and it ignores the positive progress made in this area since we entered office one year ago.Some of these progressive measures include a commitment by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly recently to allocate €2 million in additional funding for early detection and treatment services for people with autism over the next two years; Ireland's first ever international conference on autism took place in Galway in January; the opening of the State's first dedicated research centre into autism in February; the publication of the HSE's national review of autism services in February, the recommendations of which will be implemented shortly.Earlier today I raised a Topical Issue matter in the House about the need to introduce autism-specific laws in this country.  I was pleased to be informed that some positive moves are afoot in this regard.  Therefore, the charge that the this Government is not steadfastly committed to assisting children with autism is disingenuous.The protection of children is a critical issue for this Administration.  The motion expresses a concern for children's needs and welfare and in that context it is to be welcomed.  There is no doubt that all parties in this House agree that there is a need to ensure that State services, such as the social welfare system, adequately respond to children's needs.  Lest anyone question the Government's broader commitment to the protection of children in the State, I remind the House that the children's rights referendum which will take place later this year in order to change the current situation whereby the Constitution does not contain an explicit reference to children's rights, which in the view of experts, works against the welfare of vulnerable young people.  Unlike successive Governments who dragged their feet on this issue, this Government is taking the matter firmly in hand and is taking decisive action.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that many parents of children with autism, children who require extra care, supervision and attention, feel they are being confronted with an increasing amount of obstacles in their efforts to receive or to retain domiciliary care allowance.  It is never pleasant to have to reject any appeal but we are operating within an extremely strained climate of limited public finances and unfortunately, for every entitlement there is a rigorous evaluation process.Critically, the number of domiciliary care allowance payments has steadily increased over the years as the claim system has made the transition from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Protection.  In 2001, over  11,000 claims for payment were made and this had risen to over 23,000 in 2009, at the time the Minister's Department took over the scheme.  The number of payments has since increased further to the current position whereby 26,000 claims are in payment.  From the outset, there have been no cuts made to the domiciliary care allowance scheme in recent budgets and the rate of payments remain at €309.50 per month.On the anniversary of 100 days in office, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste gave a commitment that the budget for 2012 would not see a reduction in basic rates of social welfare.  The efforts made by this Government to ensure that basic rates of social welfare were maintained need to be acknowledged.The window for returning a medical review form has been extended under the Minister's remit from 21 to 60 days, in response to concerns from parents.  Last year, 46% of the 2,420 appeals against rejection were successful.  I welcome the Minister's ongoing review into the scheme which is considering whether the current system is appropriate in terms of processing applications and medical guidelines.  It illustrates how the Minister and the Government are willing to listen to the concerns, be they from civic society groups, people on the ground or political parties.  The policy review intends to clarify its objectives, consider whether legislative change is required and consider whether the current administrative and medical processes need further refinement.  Along with my colleagues I will be supporting the Government amendment to the motion.  It is essential that we recognise this Government's commitment to children with special needs or otherwise.  It is a commitment dear to the hearts of members of this Administration.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	393	It is quite humbling for us to be here in the presence of so many parents and warriors who have done an enormous service to this issue by putting a spotlight in recent days and weeks on the lives of parents and families who care for children with serious disabilities.  It should mean the appalling negligence that has been perpetrated on some of our most vulnerable citizens has to stop.  These people have exposed it and now the knowledge is there to be seen.  These parents and families do not want a pat on the back.  All they want is that to which they are entitled.  They want something that is not too much to ask for - the right to raise their children with dignity and support.  We are a long way from that type of society, however.The individual stories people have told are important, although it is not possible to address them all in this debate.  The parents and families have told us loudly and clearly about their stress, exhaustion and despair.  They have also demonstrated the constant battle, isolation and the 24-7 commitment, 365 days a year.  It is something that was never planned for or expected but has been dealt with by loving parents.  The least they expect is a bit of support in that battle.  We have failed in that and we must be honest about it.I acknowledge the Government did not cause the problem, which predates it.  If it does not address it urgently now, however, the Government will be just as guilty as the last lot.  Today's message is that the ball is in the Government's court.  It must answer the fear of those who wait for the postman.  They feel that if they incorrectly fill out forms or do not provide enough information, their allowances for domiciliary and respite care will be cut.The Government must take on board the significance of the information in the motion.  The facts highlighted confirm the problem in the system.  The numbers being refused on initial application compared with the numbers eventually approved months or even a year later can lead to no other conclusion than they are being excluded deliberately.  They are being forced to jump some sort of convoluted obstacle course at enormous additional financial and emotional cost.  That is simply not acceptable and it has to stop.I accept the point made by the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, that there is a responsibility to mind public money.  The implication is that by refusing some people there will somehow be a bigger pot for everybody else, but that is not the case.  There is no justification for the current system of refusals.  Neither is there any justification for letters telling parents their children did not require any more care or attention than a child of the same age who did not have that diagnosis.  What an absolute insult that is to people like the parents of Danielle.  She is six years of age with the verbal skills of a two year old.  In addition, she has needs such as developmental verbal dyspraxia, hypermobile joint symptoms, hypersensitivity syndrome and 50% hearing.  All of this requires massive intervention under the care of a special needs consultant, but her parents have been told her IQ is too high which means she attends a mainstream school.  As a result, she will be refused the necessary allowances.The reality is that the domiciliary care allowance is not much - not even €100 a week - to access the vital supports and treatments these families need.  I respect the title "warriors" that many of these people have given themselves because they have shown from day one they must fight for diagnosis, access to resources and back-up.  The system is the wrong way around.I am glad the Minister is committed to a policy review.  Unless parents and the organisations are involved in this review, however, to ensure a proper and transparent system, it will not work.  The Minister has the opportunity to do that now and I hope he does so.  We should be talking about changing the entire culture and moving towards a system where we support children and their families rather than excluding them from vital early intervention which would enable them to develop towards independent living and reducing their long-term care needs.I can honestly say that these people have begun to organise.  The lid has been lifted, they are not going got go back into their box, and the Government would do well to heed them now.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I have no hesitation in saying this Government and its predecessor have been playing with the lives of already marginalised families in their attitude towards the application review and the appeals process for the domiciliary care allowance.  I know times are hard but it says a lot for a country when vulnerable people are being treated like this.  For a few short gains, the Government is creating a situation whereby children with disabilities will be more dependent on the State in the long term.  We should be focusing on the strength of a disabled child to help him or her become a productive member of society.  The entire application review system for the DCA payment is fundamentally flawed and should be overhauled.  In addition, full administration should be returned to the Department of Health.  There are a shocking number of anomalies in the system, with allowances being withdrawn without a face-to-face evaluation.  Parents are being reviewed for the payment just 12 months after their initial qualification.I addressed a meeting in a Waterford hotel last week which was attended by more than 70 parents.  One of their arguments was that after being approved, they were brought back into the system 12 months later to be humiliated.  I use the word "humiliated" because that is exactly how they felt.Parents whose child has been diagnosed with autism or Asperger's syndrome are dealing with one of the biggest crises of their lives.  It is a confusing and highly anxious time for a family.  On top of this emotional roller-coaster, they are facing a child's diagnosis.  It is very difficult for a family.  They also have the frustration and disillusionment of being made to feel they are defrauding the system.  It is despicable that many such parents are made to feel that way when they go through the system.There are inherent flaws in the application form that contribute to an unnecessarily low success rate.  The medical section of the form, for example, does not allow for a full description of the care needs of a child with autism that has to be met by parents.  Is the Department of Health or the Department of Social Protection aware of that?  The Minister should look at the form because parents argue there is nothing in it to allow them to explain their child's problem.The average rate of successful first applications across all disabilities is shockingly low at 38%.  One third of all those who go for review are allowed.  These are significantly high numbers.  A norm is emerging whereby many people are refused the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, on first application, but may be successful following an oral hearing.  The current waiting time for an oral hearing, following a rejection of the initial DCA application, is on average 38 weeks.  This adds insult to injury.  The persistent failure to inform families of the specific reasons a child does not qualify for the DCA means a parent is prohibited from appealing the decision on specific grounds.  The lengthy and costly review of the entire process is a ridiculous waste of time and resources.  We must examine that.Within the review process, the Department clearly lacks the appropriate level of expertise to assess the eligibility of claimants.  The Minister has said previously that if a DCA payment is stopped on medical grounds, the applicant is able to submit additional information in support of the case.  Why is it, however, that many who have been reviewed have long-term disabilities?  That question needs to be answered by the Government.  This is a disgraceful waste of State resources not to mention the unnecessary stress of a lengthy process being imposed upon families who are already struggling to provide round-the-clock monitoring for their children.  Can somebody explain why a person who has been diagnosed with a long-term disability by a specialist and a doctor still has to go through a review process?  It is absurd and outrageous.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	399	It was good to hear the Minister for Health admit that the application and assessment process leaves too much to be desired and that change will have to happen.  It is shocking to think that 52% of appeals are successful.  One would wonder how in God's name that can be the case.  The Minister said there is limited funding available, and we know that.  He said the money must go to those who need it most.  I would like to think that it should go to those who need it, not just those who need it most, and that everyone who needs it would get it.  We know money is scarce but decisions are made on a daily basis.  The Government spends money every day and it makes choices as to how it spends it.I have heard many stories from people caught in this situation and I do not know how they cope.  The level of self-sacrifice involved is mind-boggling.  Most of the points on this issue have been made by different speakers.  My time will best be used by putting some of the experiences of these heroic people on the record, as others have also done.A girl called Linda from Wexford wrote to me.  She is currently appealing the Department's decisions to refuse her domiciliary care allowance.  She wrote:I gave up my full-time job last August to be at home to care and help my little boy who is four years old and who has only started becoming verbal in the last six months.  He is on a waiting list for Occupational Therapy .. and Speech and Language Therapy ... since last March and it will be at least another two years before he will be seen.  It is €110 per month for private ... [speech and language therapy] and the nearest SLT qualified [to care for] ... Autism Spectrum Disorder children to Wexford is in Dublin.  It is heart-breaking that ...[the Government] is making us beg to get and then keep an allowance of €309 per month to help us provide services that the State isn't providing to our special needs children.Two parents, Rod and Jane, who have two children with autism outlined to me the daily realities of protecting and supporting their two boys.  They wrote:Like many parents of special needs children, we are in a situation that we neither asked for, or bargained for.  An 18 hour day is typical for us and this applies 365 days per year.  The children can present with extreme behaviours or engage in acts that are very dangerous which could result in injury or worse.They also wrote:We deal with situations like this every day and the DCA at least acts as an acknowledgement from the State for the work we do and the work we have no choice but to devote the rest of our lives to.  This we do out of love for our children and all we ask is for the continuation of the supports we receive to help us to facilitate this.Parents of special needs kids are currently under attack from this Government on two fronts.  Not only is DCA under review for many families, but SNA support in our schools has been and will be cut again.  We find it astounding that any Government in this day and age could even contemplate victimising one of the most vulnerable sectors in society in order to save money and enhance their reputation abroad at the expense of its own young citizens.This situation is the cause of extreme concern for parents who are already under immeasurable strain.  DCA is well earned by those who qualify for it and we ask the Government this; are our children not worth 309 Euro per month, or based on a typical 18 hour day, 55 cents an hour!They further wrote that they challenge autism on a daily basis in their home and they support their boys in every way they can in order for them to eventually become the best that they can be.  They wrote that for the majority of the time they do not even think of the boys in terms of their disability; to them they are simply Evan and Daniel who, far from being the stereotypical socially withdrawn children, are affectionate and interactive and they and their big sister, Ciara, are the centre of their world, but their boys are a labour of love and they work hard every day for their very survival as a family.They also wrote that their lives are not like other people's lives, they are among the families who live in semi-isolation, spending endless hours with children who need their constant care and attention.  They further wrote that they ask only that they be left alone to do the job that nobody imagines that they will have to do.  They wrote that they are already exhausted from just getting through the day, yet they find themselves constantly having to find the energy to fight in order to maintain the support which they worked so hard to receive.They also wrote that the ongoing reviews on DCA and SNA support for their children represent an attack on their family and families like theirs all over the country.  They further wrote they had no part to play in the economic crisis.  They wrote that the Celtic tiger never knocked on their door.  They also wrote that they worked hard then as they do now and they only ask that the Government maintain their rights and entitlements.  They further wrote that they are now at their most vulnerable and any further cuts to them in terms of social protection or education might just be too much.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	400	When I was 23 years old I broke my back - I snapped my coccyx clean off.  I was out of work for quite a while and I was in a lot of pain.  One day I had to get a form from the Department of Social Welfare in Summerhill.  As I did not have the money for a taxi, I walked there and the journey that would have taken me ten minutes normally took an hour.  By the time I got there I was in agony.  I said to the guy behind the counter that "I need this form" and he said: "that is fine; we give out the forms between 10 a.m. and 12 a.m; come back tomorrow and you can have one".  I said: "do you have them there" to which he replied "yes" and put his finger on a pile of them and said: "This is them."  I explained to him that I had just walked there with a fractured spine, that it would take me an hour to walk home, another hour to walk back and the same again tomorrow.  I asked him would he please just give me one of the forms.  He said he would between 10 a.m. and 12 a.m. the next day.  I walked out onto the street, rang the Department and spoke to a very nice lady who said she was appalled.  She said: "I will ring him; go back inside and get the form."  I went back inside and said: "Did somebody call you?" to which he replied "Yes".  I said: "did they tell you to give me the form" to which he replied "Yes".  I said "can I have the form?" and he said: "you can - tomorrow, between and 10 a.m. and 12 a.m."  The pain that I was in for both journeys had me in bed for about two weeks.Yesterday evening we heard from four mothers who have children with special needs.  What struck me was the parallel in dealing with the system.  When people are in pain like I was, or exhausted like they are, or broke like so many people are dealing with the system, they are disempowered and vulnerable and need the system to work for them.  The system is not charity.  It is an insurance policy into which every single one of us pays.  It is our right, and it is our right to be treated with dignity.What was clear to me last night from those parents and from the parents I have met during the past year is that they are not being treated with dignity.  They are not being treated with respect and the system is not working for them.  One parent spoke of an ongoing battle with a community or public health nurse who refused to recognise that her child was autistic.  Several years later a new health nurse arrived and instantly agreed that the child was autistic and after years the parent got the support she had needed right from the start.We heard another example of identical twins born with the same condition.  For some administrative reason, one child went through the HSE and the other child went through the Department of Social Welfare.  The HSE said that the child had a problem and gave the parent a package of support but the Department said that the other child did not have any problem and that the parent was not getting any support.The Minister took exception to members of the Technical Group criticising officials in the Department.  Deputy English said here a few minutes ago that it is not their fault.  It is their fault.  It is the fault of the people who work in the Department.  The 52% appeal ratio is their fault.  The ridiculous decisions that are being made are their fault.  In the case of the mother who was asked by an official if her child still had autism, that is the fault of the officials.  We should not shy away from criticising them when they fail in their duty.I imagine the officials were involved in drafting, with respect, the drivel that is the Government's counter amendment.  The Members opposite should read it.  It says everything is fine, look at all the good work we have done and that there will be a review.  Not a single word in the Government amendment recognises the difficulties with which the parents of these children are dealing.    It is not acceptable.  We in opposition cannot hold these officials to account but were I the Minister, I would be asking a number of questions.  Why do some health professionals or officials give different diagnoses to the same children?  Why do identical twins get different diagnoses from different State departments?  What audit system is in place?  What management information system is in place?  How are these officials being held to account for their decisions?  The Technical Group's motion does not ask for extra money; it asks, on behalf of the children and their parents, for a process which is fair, transparent, quick and which treats them with dignity.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I congratulate Deputy Donnelly on his phenomenal speech, I do not know how one follows it.  As the Deputy said, the State is there if needs be when one is on one's knees and needs help.  My experience when I needed help was not that great either.  Many people who come to my office express the same feeling, particularly with regard to domiciliary care allowance and similar allowances.  When I was a local authority member a mother asked me why she had to go to a hospital to prove her son's arm had not grown back in order to continue to claim the allowance she was receiving.  This sounds daft but apparently it was normal.  When one hears a story such as this, particularly with regard to domiciliary care allowance, and one hears about delays and the inability of officials to put together a form on which one can explain what one wants, one feels useless because having dealt with umpteen similar other issues over the past year one wonders whether anyone cares.  This is why this Private Members' motion is brilliant; it gives me a chance to express my frustrations about the fact there is no way to deal with this issue as this is a way of dealing with it.The Minister stated there would be a review.  This is great if there really is a proper review and things change and it does not take forever.  However, at this stage I must say the cynicism has been beaten into me.  I look forward to the day it disappears and I hope the Government will be the one to do it.  I keep hearing about reviews on everything and usually the review is about kicking the can down the road and delaying doing something about an issue.  Certain aspects such as the form will be reviewed as it is fairly obvious it must be changed and it should take only a millisecond.  Why does one need to review the 38 week waiting period?  It is fairly obvious it is too long.The only reason that 52% of applicants successfully appeal is because the attitude of the State is that one is considered some type of a con artist and one is guilty until one is proven innocent.  This is not the way to treat people.  It is not the way to treat people who are in the fullest of health and full of energy and who do not have all of these burdens and problems.  I have two children and they are a challenge, but they do not face the same challenges as the children about whom we are speaking.  Parents worry, probably to the extent it hurts them physically and mentally, about anything going wrong or happening to their children.  I find it very hard to get my head around what it would do to me if my child was in the situation these people's children are in and I went to the State to be kicked around the place.  It is astonishing.  One does not need to review this; one needs to get rid of it.One can blame the system all one wants, but people in the system who obviously do not care, and have a bit of a prejudice against those who might be getting something off the State because they pick up their pay packet and think their money is going to them, need to be kicked out of the system.  I met them when I was on the dole.  I was dirt when I went to sign on.  This needs to be got rid of from the system.  The review needs to happen ASAP and it is fairly obvious what should come out of it.  All of this needs to be changed and everything in the motion needs to be done.  The State needs to be fair to the people involved because they are the best people in the country.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	402	Parents play a crucial, selfless and devoted role in raising children afflicted with disabilities.  It is very obvious that since the Department of Social Protection took over the administration of the domiciliary care allowance from the HSE three years ago the number of children whose applications are rejected has soared dramatically.  It is ironic that statistics show that of the 2,420 appeals against rejection 52% succeeded, which is a ridiculous reflection on the system.  The statistics also place a huge question mark over the credibility and validity of the adjudication of these applications.  The success of approximately half of the appeals demonstrates the extremely harsh attitude to a category of people in society who are severely disadvantaged, and the intolerance and insensitivity to their rights and needs is of great concern.I seriously request the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is in the Chamber and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to urgently review the system of processing applications and examine how appropriate the medical guidelines are.  The parents of these vulnerable children make huge sacrifices and give constant care and support to their affected children.  They do their utmost 24 hours a day to ensure their children's well-being, quality of life, safety and security and they assist them with their educational needs to give them an equal opportunity in life.  In almost all cases these parents endeavour to make up for the deficiencies in support and professional services which are or should be the responsibility of the State.The Government needs to focus on the health and social care provision for children and families, and welfare entitlements are paramount for their daily needs.  Intellectual and physical disability services are completely inadequate with a lack of speech and language therapists, occupational therapy, physiotherapists and psychology.  Most of the parents of domiciliary care allowance recipients use the €309 a month to access and pay for these services privately.  This should be a matter of priority to be provided by the HSE.  Many of these disciplines have waiting times of up to six or 12 months which is completely unacceptable.There are clear indications of indiscriminate targeting of these vulnerable children.  As a double blow, when the domiciliary care allowance is stopped the carer's allowance and the respite care grant are also automatically stopped.  The parents and guardians must still cope with their responsibilities and must give full attention and care to their children around the clock.  It is crazy that in many cases this happens without rhyme or reason and they are left high and dry, cut off from all their financial supports and therefore not in a position to buy the intervention or supports to which I referred earlier.  Imposing further hardship on these people is totally unacceptable and at least while they are awaiting adjudication on appeals an emergency fund should be provided to enable the family to maintain the services they may be receiving in the public service for their afflicted children.  The other matter is the extremely long waiting time, which can be up to 12 months.  This must also be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Nobody should be put through the current regime of huge waiting times.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue, in which I have a particular interest even though it is now the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection.  I, along with my Government colleagues, fully recognise that the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, scheme represents a very important support to parents and guardians who live with and care for children with disability.  As the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, said, the State pays the domiciliary care allowance to parents or guardians to recognise the heroic and selfless role they play in raising children who are experiencing some form of disability.The DCA is a monthly payment to the parent or guardian of a child with a disability so severe that the child requires care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of what another child of the same age might need.  The allowance is paid at the rate of €309.50 per month.  This rate has been specifically protected by the Government from any reduction over recent budgets.  This is against the backdrop of significant reductions in expenditure generally.  The Department now pays DCA for 26,000 children, an increase of over 3,000 since the Department took over responsibility for the scheme from the HSE in April 2009.  Spending on the scheme and the respite care grant, which is automatically paid to all recipients, has increased from €138 million to €145 million between 2010 and 2011.  Expenditure on both payments in 2012 is expected to be approximately €146 million.Reviews are an integral part of all social welfare schemes and are necessary to ensure that payments continue to be made only to people who meet the qualifying conditions.  In this context, DCA cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that all the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  I fully accept that children have particular conditions which mean the child will never progress.  We all accept that and when that is the case we need to consider that the type of review expected by the Department should not occur.  There are certain conditions that will never disappear and the child will not progress.I believe that the operation of the scheme on a statutory basis ensures consistency of approach to all claims.  The medical criteria, as set out in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008 is almost identical to that in use when the scheme was operated by the HSE, requiring that "the child has a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention substantially in excess of the care and attention normally required by a child of the same age".  It is worth recalling that prior to taking over responsibility for the scheme in 2009, the Department of Social Protection convened an expert medical group to draw up a set of consistent and objective guidelines for use in determining the medical eligibility of children for the scheme.  The group was chaired by that Department's chief medical adviser and comprised senior medical personnel from the HSE as well as eminent professionals in the areas of physical disabilities which affect children and child psychiatry and psychology.  I can confirm that the Department of Health and the HSE had an active involvement in the preparation for the transfer of the scheme to the Department of Social Protection and that both are of the view that the DC A scheme is best placed within that Department.I understand that very effort is made to process claims as quickly as possible and the Department's target is to process DCA claims within seven weeks.  I recognise that the target is often not met.  Currently, the average time frame to process a DCA application is eight weeks, and again I recognise that this is not often met.  It is impractical and not in the best interest of either the child or the service to place a limit on the time to be allowed to process claims, particularly in the case of appeals.  The Minister has agreed to an extension of the time in that regard.I understand that a number of changes have been made to the operation of the scheme in recent times with a view to providing more time for parents to prepare for reviews of their claims.  Parents are now being informed by the Department of the review date that will apply in their case when their claim is initially awarded.  They are also being afforded 60 days in which to obtain and return evidence following the notification of review.Before concluding, I remind the House that two key developments in the scheme were outlined by the Minister last night.  Officials in her Department will be liaising with colleagues in the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills who have a role in providing supports and services to children with disabilities to map the availability of services.  This is with a view to seeing if there is any opportunity for greater linkage and consistency in the assessment for such supports and services.  I am very keen to see the outcome of that work.It is fully recognised that the strains on the family of a child with a disability are enormously greater than those on a family that does not have such difficulties.  We will have to examine the scheme.  Since I have taken office and taken responsibility for disability issues, one of the things I have found most difficult to deal with is the inconsistency in the application of different services and schemes.  It is important that there is consistency.  Whether one lives in Donegal or Dingle, there must be the same criteria.  The only way to provide for that is to locate it in a single Department.  The type of linkages that are needed for dealing with disability are entirely different, but with regard to assessment there must be a single assessment tool.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I am sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett.  My view is very simple.  The needs of people with mental health issues and disabilities, and their loved ones, should be sacrosanct when formulating budgets.  The word "cuts" should never be used for people who have a disability or a mental health issue.  They have enough stress to deal with in their lives without having the additional stress of wondering about their income.  Government Departments and services should be making life easier for those people, not more difficult.  However, it is clear from the calls we have received and the meetings we have attended that life has become much more difficult since the transfer of assessment, review and appeals to the Department of Social Protection.I acknowledge the work of Deputies Catherine Murphy, Richard Boyd Barrett, Thomas Pringle and Finian McGrath in bringing this very serious matter before the Dáil.  Life has been made more difficult for these people because assessments are being carried out by people who do not have specialised knowledge of disability.  It is also more difficult due to the appeals process and the extra expense parents must undertake to get medical evidence.  It is also more difficult due to the waiting period of 38 weeks for an oral appeal.Our motion refers to the number of successful appeals, which amounts to 52%.  I am delighted those appeals were successful but one must ask why those applications were turned down in the first instance.  I am sure the 52% are also delighted with their successful appeals but consider the cost to them emotionally, psychologically and even physically of having to go through that process and the extra stress and burden it imposed on them.  The initial refusal must have been devastating for them.  That was followed by the appeals process and the wait.  I also wonder about the other 48% and how their lives are now.  What were the grounds for turning down their appeals?  The motion calls for decisions on applications not qualifying to state the specific reasons.  Another part of the motion calls for the details of decisions, while preserving the anonymity of the applicants, to be complaint with Article 34.1 of the Constitution, which states that "justice shall be administered in public".The Minister acknowledged that the domiciliary care allowance is an important support for people who live with and care for children with a disability.  The amendment refers to the extra 2,000 recipients, the €100 million cost and the respite care grant.  They sound like considerable amounts, but they are not when one looks at the overall budget for social protection.  If the scheme was working as well as the Government's amendment suggests, we would not be having this debate.  However, we have been hearing the opposite from the groups and the parents.  They tell a very different tale.Every expectant parent hopes for the arrival of a healthy baby but, unfortunately, life does not always turn out that way.  Babies are born with a variety of disabilities, physical, mental and sometimes both.  When one listens to the parents, it brings home the implications of supporting and rearing a child with a disability.  There are Members of the Dáil and Seanad, as well as parents in the Visitors Gallery this evening, who have children with special needs.  They know it is a 24-hour-day, 365-days-a-year task and they are lucky if they get some respite.  They deal with children who have no communication skills, no concept of danger awareness, sensory deprivation and compulsive behaviours.  It is interesting to listen to parents refer to themselves as warriors and stating it is like going into battle for one's child because the services are not adequate.  One must fight for everything, including resource hours, special needs assistants, occupational therapy and speech and language supports.  Life definitely is not being made easier for such people.  I met parents yesterday for whom the story was the same.  They were obliged to fight and struggle strenuously to get the resources their children needed.  Members see the flaws in the system, including the diagnostic codes, the sheer bureaucracy and the delays.On the call for the review, I add my voice to those who state the voices which must be listened to are those of the parents and groups who are actively involved with such children.  In the case of a child with autism, dyspraxia or Asperger's syndrome, there is no cure and consequently their lives will not change.  While they might be provided with strategies to help them to cope with life, the needs will always remain.  A particular issue in this regard is that for parents who have a child with Down's syndrome or a physical disability, the condition is visible but this is not the case for autistic children and not sufficient cognisance is given to this aspect.  I support the call by the Autism Rights and Equality Alliance for the Government to develop a comprehensive autism lifespan strategy for those concerned, which would eliminate the need for crisis interventions or the obligation to telephone one's public representative to get one's entitlements, because one's needs would be addressed.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	405	First, this issue is not being debated in the House this evening because of the actions of the Technical Group, Independent Members or the United Left Alliance.  It is being debated because of the tremendous commitment, bravery and determination of the families themselves and their concern to vindicate the rights and needs of their children.  The Technical Group Members are merely acting as their agents in bringing forward these issues.  I pay tribute to the DCA Warriors and all the other families of children with disability and special needs who have forced this issue onto the agenda.  Above all, I urge them to keep going, to keep protesting and to keep fighting.I was extremely disappointed both by the Minister's speech last night and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, this evening because there has been virtually no acknowledgement of the desperation, frustration and anger being felt by the families of children with disability and special needs, which have forced this issue onto the agenda.  As Deputy Donnelly noted, the Government amendment is disappointing and frankly disingenuous in the extreme.  It implies there really is not a problem, more money is being spent, more people are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, DCA, and while everything really is fine, the Government will have a review and will have a look at the issue.  This is not good enough and it is particularly disappointing that the Government quoted figures on the absolute numbers of people in receipt of DCA and the absolute quantum of money that is spent.  That is the oldest trick in the book, namely, covering up something of which the Minister of State is well aware.  Moreover, it leads me to believe the Government is being disingenuous on the issue because the reason more people are in receipt of DCA and more has been spent is that each year, 10,000 additional children reach school age.  As Ireland has a demographic bubble of young people coming online, therefore the demand for DCA and other supports for children with disability and special needs is increasing.However, this simply is not the issue Members on this side have raised.  The issue is whether there is a bureaucratic and cost-cutting approach to dealing with people who make applications for DCA and other supports for their children.  Members, and most importantly the parents, are asking whether a stealth cut has been instructed politically from the top but which has not been announced.  I refer to a bureaucratic cost-cutting measure in which people who make applications for DCA are being treated in a callous, brutal, humiliating and inhuman way when they seek supports they need, deserve and should have.  Is it the case they are being put unnecessarily through further hardship, stress and humiliation because of a political decision to tighten up, cut back or to have a bureaucratic and cost-cutting approach to dealing with human beings and families who have special needs, are vulnerable and who need support, not hardship?  Moreover, the figures bear this out.  The point being made is that in 2009, only 25% of those who applied felt the need to appeal while in 2011, some 50% did so.  The number of people who were forced to appeal has doubled in two years and has increased significantly since this Administration came to office.  When one then discovers that 50% of those who then go through the arduous and difficult process of appealing actually succeed, this means that huge numbers of families are being put through such hardship unnecessarily.  They should not have been forced to appeal in the first place.  They needed the support but did not get it because they were dealt with badly.  This is the issue and it is not addressed or acknowledged in any way by the Government amendment.  As a result, families are being put through this additional hardship and humiliation, as well as the additional expense of being obliged to gather evidence to make the appeal.  Moreover, people are being contacted in the context of reviews and are being asked questions like whether their child is cured even when the child in question has permanent disabilities.  This is an unbelievable situation.I will turn to what is being sought in the motion, by Members on this side and, most importantly, by the parents and families.  While the Government should carry out a review, for which there is an urgent need, it should be real and the stakeholders, that is, the families themselves and the organisations representing them, must be absolutely central to such a review.  However, there is no need to await the outcome of such a review to take action.  Nothing in the Technical Group's motion could not be acted upon immediately by the Government, while still carrying out its review to improve the position even further.  The Government could take action right now to alleviate the unnecessary hardship and suffering that vulnerable families and their children are being put through.  I disagree slightly with Deputy Donnelly on the question of who is responsible.  There is an old saying that the fish rots from the head and the buck stops with those at the top, namely, the Ministers and Government.  I believe this is part of cost-cutting by tightening up instructions.  In addition, instructions appear to have been issued either formally or informally to those working in the public health services that they no longer are allowed explicitly to recommend that people get DCA and other such supports.  This appears to me like pressure for cutbacks in order to justify them.  In addition, the savage staff cuts in the public service must explain the dramatic increase in outstanding appeals.  Why has the number of outstanding appeals risen from one in 2009 to 900 in 2011?  This unquestionably pertains to cutbacks.  The Technical Group's request is very simple and the Minister of State should accede to it.  If there is serious evidence from social workers or GPs that a child has needs over and above those of a child of the same age without a disability, this simply should be accepted.  One can decide immediately there will be no reviews of those who have permanent disabilities, for whom no such review ever would be necessary.The Government can also ensure that people do not have to wait 38 weeks for appeals and that resources are provided to ensure this do not happen.  It can do this immediately, following which it can have its review to make the situation even better.  I appeal to the Minister to do so.

In 2010, the Road Safety Authority reviewed the policy options available for the mandatory introduction of Daytime Running Lights or DRL whereby driving lights are switched on automatically once the engine is started. That review concluded that DRL should not be made obligatory for the time-being, because the experience in other countries shows that mandatory DRL works best where all vehicles are fitted with dedicated DRL and where there has been intensive promotion and awareness campaigns prior to DRL being made mandatory.  The Road Safety Authority  encourages the use of DRL on a voluntary basis, in particular during the period of September to March and in wet or poor conditions at any time.  Earlier this year the Authority launched an awareness campaign promoting the use of DRL on national radio.In Ireland most vehicles do not have dedicated DRL and the Road Safety Authority analysis has shown that the costs of retrofitting DRL at the current time outweighs the benefits.  However, EC Directive 2008/89/EC requires dedicated DRL be standard on all new passenger cars and small vans from February 2011 onwards and on HGVs and buses from August 2012 onwards. Therefore, as the national fleet is renewed over time all vehicles will have DRL.  The Road Safety Authority has recommended that the position be reviewed in around 3 years by which time vehicles on our roads with dedicated DRL will have become more prevalent. In the meantime, the Authority will intensify the promotion of using DRL with a view to significantly increasing the use of DRL.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	407	Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) in December 2009, responsibility for the delivery of public transport infrastructure, including the provision of cycle lanes in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) is a matter for the NTA. Under its Sustainable Transport Management Grants (STMG) Scheme the NTA provides funding to local authorities for a range of schemes to benefit cyclists including cycle paths and cycle corridors. I recognise that the development of safe cycle routes is a key factor in encouraging more people to cycle and encouraging those who already cycle to use their bikes for more journeys. The Government will therefore continue to provide funding either directly or through the NTA to local authorities for the development of urban cycle lanes, greenway cycling trails and progressing the development of a national cycle network.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 19 together.Following a Government decision in January I announced plans on 28 February to achieve greater levels of transport integration and coordinated delivery across a range of Exchequer funded local and rural transport services incorporating the RTP, HSE non-acute transport, school transport and voluntary transport services. This followed a value for money review into the rural transport sector and a commitment in the programme for government to extend and integrate some of these services.The National Transport Authority, who have been allocated responsibility for RTP will, in conjunction with a national committee made up of key stakeholders, develop proposals for future integration based on a series of model areas which will trial how services in rural areas can be further enhanced and optimised whilst achieving necessary efficiencies.  Senior officials from the Department of Education and the HSE are members of the Committee and are working together on this issue with both my Department and the National Transport Authority.Given the cost to the Exchequer of providing the necessary non-acute health and education transport services in rural areas it is vital that these two areas are included in the consideration at a national level of future integration plans for rural transport . This process has been approved by Government and agreed by the relevant Ministers.  However, while my Department has responsibility for the integration of local and rural transport, strategy and policy relating to the various types of transport provision, including school transport and non-acute HSE transport, remain the responsibility of the parent Departments.There are challenges and complexities in this endeavour but the Committee will examine these and, where possible, suggest solutions.  I understand that at its meeting last Friday the Committee established sub groups to examine the issues regarding future integration for schools transport and HSE non-acute transport.  These will report back quickly to the Committee and I am confident progress can be made this year.

Such training is often supported by the Road Safety Authority also. Objective 11 of the National Cycling Policy recognises the need to improve cycling standards and cyclist's behaviour on the road including development of national cycle training programmes and a curriculum for the training of cycle instructors. A group has been examining the development of a National Cycle Training Programme for school children.  This process has involved An Taisce, Cycling Ireland, The Department of Education and Skills, Donegal Co Council, Dublin City Council, the RSA, the NTA and my Department. Part of this process will be the introduction of a national standard for cycle instructors. I expect to receive proposals from my Department arising from this work in the coming months.

Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) on 1 December 2009, the provision of infrastructure projects in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), such as LUAS BXD, now comes under the remit of the NTA. The capital funding provided to the NTA to fulfil its statutory role is allocated in line with the policy objectives and priorities outlined in the various capital development plans as revised from time to time, most recently the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016 — Medium Term Exchequer Framework   which was published in November 2011. Since BXD is a priority project under this 5-year plan funding has been included in my Department’s capital allocation to cover the cost of commencing the main construction works in 2015 and pre-construction enabling works in 2013 and 2014.  Construction is expected to take 4 years. The  NTA has been given an  overall capital allocation for 2012 of €130.24m. The NTA has since provided a breakdown of their proposals based on this allocation which includes an indicative amount of €8m in respect of Luas BXD for 2012. However this is a provisional estimate as  key decisions and actions which will determine the precise budget requirements and spending profile for BXD  must await the outcome of the planning process which is currently ongoing. My Department has provided no current expenditure in relation to this project.

However, my Department has an active role in this area, and my officials, along with the Department of Justice and Equality, the RSA, the Courts Service and An Garda Síochána, have been engaging in discussions about possible alternative sentencing methods.There is general agreement on the need to explore new ways of tackling the problem of people who are repeatedly involved in road traffic offences.  International experience provides a range of alternatives, such as requiring repeat offenders to take certain courses, to resit tests, or to have particular types of device fitted to their vehicles. Courses could focus on skills or on attitude, while devices under consideration include alcolocks and intelligent speed adaptors.  No decisions have yet been made on which measures would be most appropriate or would work best in an Irish context.The RSA is currently conducting a study of the technological options available and I understand that this study is due be completed at the end of this month.  This will feed into the wider consideration of the best sentencing options.  I anticipate that concrete proposals will develop out of these discussions during the summer. I can confirm that any change to sentencing options will indeed necessitate primary legislation.

I have met with the Federation of Irish Sports and had discussions on the importance of sport to Ireland in an international context.I want to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive location for international sporting events. The Programme for Government includes a commitment that event tourism will be prioritised in order to continue to bring major events to Ireland. The hosting of sports events provides an opportunity to show that a country like Ireland can host major sporting events, such as the Ryder Cup, the Tall Ships Race, Volvo Ocean Race and the Solheim Cup, in an efficient and professional manner. It also provides a great showcase for Ireland and the media coverage of sports tourism events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination.  Fáilte Ireland continues to support the sports tourism sector and in 2012 the Volvo Ocean Race will return to Ireland with its finale in Galway while Dún Laoghaire will host the ISAF Youth World Sailing Championship.

Responsibility to develop, procure, implement, operate and maintain the integrated ticketing system in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) became the function of the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 30th September 2010 in accordance with section 58 of the Dublin Transport Authority (DTA) Act 2008. In addition, section 63 of the DTA Act 2008 extends the Authority's remit in relation to integrated ticketing to the rest of the State.As part of the next phase of the scheme, the Leap Card will be rolled out  to Bus Éireann services in the Eastern region.  In addition, a number of private operators that provide commuter services into Dublin or to Dublin Airport are also likely to join the scheme.  Further extensions will be kept under review having regard to funding availability and other priorities.

As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. Matters relating to bus lanes and other traffic management issues come under the remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA) in liaison with relevant local authorities and I have no function in such matters.I am advised, however, that recent bus network changes, which involved a realignment of a number of bus routes, has meant that there is no longer a requirement for a number of bus lanes.  In such cases, it is a matter for the local authorities to determine the most appropriate traffic arrangements to put in place for the particular road.  Within the Greater Dublin Area, the relevant local authority should liaise with the NTA in relation to proposals for revised road layouts in these cases, and funding may be provided by the NTA for the implementation of appropriate proposals in certain cases.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 33 together.The National Transport Authority (NTA) is the lead agency with responsibility for the implementation of the recommended actions contained in the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011. Work is progressing on all 46 Actions proposed and eight of the short-term actions have been implemented to date.  The timetable for implementation of the remaining actions is set out in the Review Report with short-term actions to be implemented this year and medium-term actions to be implemented after 2012. The NTA makes quarterly reports on progress to the Taxi Advisory Committee which includes representation from the key stakeholder groups including representatives of consumer interests and the taxi industry. I understand the NTA will also be making direct contact with drivers by email and issuing updates on the work so far.Some of the actions proposed in the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011 will require supporting legislation. Where possible, the NTA will make the necessary regulations under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  My Department is currently preparing amending legislation which will address some of the key enforcement recommendations contained in the Review Report. In particular, the proposed legislation will address the necessary amendment to Section 36 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 concerning mandatory disqualification for holding a licence upon conviction of certain offences.  I will shortly be submitting a General Scheme setting out my legislative proposals to Government for approval.

The implementation of individual national road schemes, including Public Private Partnership projects, is a matter for the National Roads Authority in accordance with the Roads Acts 1993-2007.In particular, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007).The contracts for the privately operated toll schemes are commercial agreements between the NRA and the Public Private Partnership (PPP) concessionaires concerned. There are eight toll based PPP schemes.  Two PPP contracts, the M3 Clonee-Kells PPP and Limerick Tunnel PPP incorporate a traffic guarantee mechanism, the purpose of which within the overall financial package for the project was to enhance the fundability of these projects and obtain competitive funding terms to the benefit of the taxpayer over the life of the PPP scheme.  The level of payments under the traffic guarantee provisions will depend on future traffic volumes.As the Deputy will appreciate there are two sides to all contracts, and seeking to reduce the State's liability on any contract will necessarily involve some other form of compensation being offered. It is not simply a matter of dictating terms.  In the case of the other toll based schemes, the traffic risk remains with the operator.  The PPP contracts also include provision for revenue sharing with the NRA where traffic levels exceed specified thresholds.

Transport demand on the other hand is primarily derived from the outputs of the other economic sectors.  In addition to directly generated jobs on transport projects, increased employment in the transport sector will flow from increased economic activity generally.The main actions relating to these sectors in the Plan and in the Government's earlier 2011 Jobs Initiative are:The targeting by Fáilte Ireland of capital grants from the €21 million fund available to it in 2012 to develop new and to upgrade existing tourism attractions and to support training and building business capability;Important initiatives to stimulate visitor numbers, including the reduced VAT rate of 9% on certain tourism and hospitality services;Preparations for "The Gathering Ireland 2013" initiative  which aims to attract an additional 325,000 visitors to Ireland in 2013;Use of the €40 million Tourism Marketing Fund available in 2012 to focus on the four core source markets of Great Britain, the United States, Germany and France;Participation in key trade missions overseas to promote tourism;The development of niche tourism activities and products where Ireland has a comparative advantage;Funding for two new rounds of Sports Capital funding with the first in 2012 to enhance modest sporting facilities throughout the country;Approval of a strategy for the incremental development of the National Sports Campus;Selected road and public transport projects with a clear impact on economic development, competitiveness and market access which include the linking of the two LUAS lines, investing in new buses and the maintenance of the road network;Review of public transport regulation to identify the potential to reduce costs; andThe continuing offer to abolish the remaining €3 travel tax subject to acceptable commitments from the carriers to additional inbound flights to Ireland.Statistics relating to employment levels in the Transport and Tourism sectors can be found on the CSO website http://www.cso.ie/en/statistics/labourmarket/principalstatistics/.

The audit is designed to examine and improve, where necessary and appropriate, the application by local authorities of speed limits and speed limit signage throughout the country, in accordance with my Department's "Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits" which issued to all road authorities last year.I recently announced that a review of speed limits would be undertaken and my Department is in the process of establishing a stakeholder Working Group to carry out this review. The Automobile Association, An Garda Síochána, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority, representatives of local authorities and the National Transport Authority have accepted my invitation to participate in the Working Group.It is planned that the first meeting of the Group will take place in the coming weeks and that substantial progress will have been made by the end of 2012.

Following a positive review of its impact, my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality decided in March to extend the Programme for a further four years.Tourism Ireland, the agency responsible for promoting Ireland overseas, has been working hard to maximise the benefits of the Visa Waiver Programme, promoting it to travel trade contacts, industry partners and consumers through extensive marketing activity and media relations in relevant markets.  Since the Programme was first introduced, there has been a noted increase in demand from tour operators for visits to Ireland.  24 new tour operators and travel agents who already programme the UK are programming the Republic of Ireland in 2012 for the first time on the back of the new visa arrangements and further growth is anticipated for 2013.  There is also evidence of increased interest in Ireland from individual travellers from these markets and, since seventy-two per cent of wealthy Chinese people are now opting for an individual, high-end travel experience, Tourism Ireland is also targeting this demographic by highlighting the new short-stay visa.  With additional tours and other visitors availing of the waiver, the Irish tourist industry is clearly benefitting from this extra business.I am committed to attracting tourists from beyond our traditional markets and to exploiting the long-term opportunities presented by developing markets such as the countries covered by the Visa Waiver.  Tourism Ireland continues to target potential holidaymakers in these markets by working closely with airlines and tour operators to increase exposure and demand for holidays to Ireland, and to highlight the improved access to Ireland from Asia and the Middle East.

No decision has been taken yet by the EU to send an Election Observer Mission to Angola. Ireland would give favourable consideration to the organisation and deployment of an Election Observation Mission to Angola. The issue will need to be considered by EU Member States in the overall context of elections taking place this year in Africa and indeed elsewhere, and the availability of resources. In a recent positive development, European Commission President Barroso visited Angola last month and, in a meeting with President José Eduardo dos Santos, stated that the EU will consider the deployment of a team of experts to assist Angola in its electoral endeavours, if so requested by the Angolan Government. Should this request be received from the Angolan authorities prior to the legislative elections, Ireland will consider contributing experts through the established EU channels.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	426	In recent years approximately 80% of Ireland's Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget has been allocated to Vote 27 — International Cooperation which is managed by my Department through its external delivery vehicle, Irish Aid.  The remaining 20% is accounted for through ODA eligible contributions by other Government Departments and Ireland's share of the EU Development Cooperation budget.Total ODA for 2010 was €676 million of which €522 million was expended by my Department. Total ODA for 2011 was €651 million of which €521 million was expended by my Department. Total estimated ODA for 2012 is €639 million and I expect that approximately €514 million will be expended by my Department.  I would additionally note that total ODA expenditure dropped by approximately 30% between 2008 and 2011.  Current expenditure levels equate to approximately 0.5% of GNP and the Programme for Government commits us to reaching the UN target of 0.7%.  We will seek to achieve this by 2015.Ireland's aid programme prioritises the fight against global poverty and hunger, focusing on the world poorest countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  It has an enviable international reputation and is recognised as one of the best and most effective aid programmes in the world.The programme reflects the core values of the Irish people and continues to enjoy very strong public support, even in the current very difficult economic circumstances.  As recently as last week an independent poll showed that almost 90% of people are proud and supportive of their aid programme.The Government is ambitious for, and committed to, the aid programme.  We are determined that it will maintain and build on its high international reputation, and continue to build the foundations for real change, future prosperity and well being in the lives of many of the world's poorest people.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 to 41, inclusive, 45, 47 and 48 together.The Deputies will be aware that I met with representatives of the IRHA last February and that a working group was set up involving officials of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, the IRHA and members of the Oireachtas to examine a number of issues of concern to the haulage industry.  I am sure the Deputies will understand that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of those discussions which are ongoing.Among the issues being examined by the group is an essential user's rebate system. I should point out that a system such as that sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licensed hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes. In addition, the rebate would have to include the carriage of passengers by a motor vehicle of category M2 or category M3 as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC. Under Council Directive 2003/96/EC, any such rebate would have to be within the confines of the minimum EU excise rates so a 20c rebate as suggested by Deputy Doherty would not be possible.  The maximum rebate possible would be in the order of 15c.Given the wide range of users to which a rebate might be available, it would be difficult to cost such a rebate system.  On the matter of fuel consumption lost to the continent, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not have such data.On the matter of fuel prices in general, the excise rates (including the carbon charge) in Ireland on motor fuels are 58.8 cent per litre of petrol and 47.9 cent per litre of auto-diesel. However, our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners and significantly lower than our nearest neighbour the UK.Any proposals around temporary taxation adjustments could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. The issue of rising fuel prices was discussed by EU Finance Ministers at an ECOFIN meeting last year where they reconfirmed the approach taken in 2005 and again in 2008, when oil prices were very high, which endorsed a coordinated approach towards not making distortionary fiscal adjustments.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	428	Constant with its overriding commercial mandate as set out in Section 10 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, NAMA has demonstrated its commitment and contribution to the achievement of wider social and economic policy objectives in line with Section 2 of the Act. This includes NAMA's policy to give first option to public bodies on the purchase of property which may be suitable for their purposes.  The Agency also works to facilitate engagement between interested parties, including community and sporting organisations, and its debtors/receivers/sales agents and this has led to a number of positive outcomes for both parties.I am advised by NAMA that in the first instance community groups themselves are best positioned to identify specific properties related to a NAMA loan that may be suitable for their purposes. Such groups are therefore encouraged to make contact with the owners of property and to inform NAMA of their interest. It should be noted that, while NAMA is prohibited by its legislation and by the normal rules of banking confidentiality from disclosing the identity of debtors or details of their properties, the Agency ensures that debtors are aware of interest in their properties and encourages them to engage with potential purchasers.

The Director for Consumer Protection in the Central Bank indicated that, arising from this initial review there were concerns in relation to providers of payment protection insurance.  The Bank committed to examining these concerns in more detail and announced a "2012 Programme of Themed Reviews and Inspections" for consumer protection to be undertaken by the Bank. Copy of the Press Release is available on the Central Bank's website.I have been informed by the Central Bank that they will provide an update on the progress of the payment protection insurance review at mid-year.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	430	Access to funds under the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) can be granted following an application to the EFSF for financial assistance. This assistance will be granted on the basis of a Financial Assistance Facility Agreement. Such an agreement, will be conditional upon the relevant euro-area Member States entering into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the European Commission, acting on behalf of the euro-area Member States. Any MoU entered into will be subject to conditionality, such as budgetary discipline, economic policy guidelines and their compliance with the terms of such an MoU.   The EFSF has been created as a temporary institution. The EFSF Framework agreement as amended provides that "Euro-area Member States which are potential borrowers may only request and enter into Loan Facility Agreements up to 30 June 2013 (provided that loans may be disbursed after this date under Loan Facility Agreements entered into prior to this date)."It also provides that EFSF guarantors shall only be required to issue a guarantee to facilitate the financing under Loan Facility Agreements entered into on or prior to 30 June 2013.In accordance with its Articles of Association, the EFSF will be liquidated on the earliest date after 30 June 2013 on which there are no longer loans outstanding to a euro-area Member State and all Funding Instruments issued by EFSF and any reimbursement amounts due to Guarantors have been repaid in full.This means that after June 2013, EFSF would not enter into any new programmes but will continue the management and repayment of any outstanding debt and will close down once all outstanding debt has been repaid.The Eurogroup's statement of 30 March 2012, provides that the ESM will be the main instrument to finance new programmes as from July 2012. It's lending capacity will be €500 billion. The EFSF will, as a rule, only remain active in financing programmes that have started before that date. For a transitional period until mid-2013, it may engage in new programmes in order to ensure a full fresh lending capacity of EUR 500 billion for the ESM during the initial set up period.These arrangements form part of a number of initiatives. All these initiatives were made to improve the governance of the euro area through enhancements of the Stability and Growth Pact, the new macro-economic imbalances procedure, the Euro Plus Pact and the Fiscal Compact enshrined in the new Treaty on Stability, Cooperation and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. Finally, robust firewalls have been established. This comprehensive strategy has paid off and led to a significant improvement of market conditions.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	431	The engagement and remuneration of staff of semi-State companies is a matter for those companies.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is long established in tax legislation that the remuneration arising from employments under any public institution, any public foundation or under any public corporation or local authority is fully chargeable to income tax and fully within the scope of deductions at source under the PAYE and Universal Social Charge systems with the necessary PRSI regime applying.On a wider note, I am further informed that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has previously written to all Secretaries General of Government Departments as regards a range of tax issues including the need to ensure that individuals engaged by such Departments or engaged by State bodies/agencies under the aegis of those Departments are correctly classified for tax purposes and that the correct tax, etc. is deducted from emoluments paid.   I understand that the Chairman will shortly be writing to Secretaries General again as regard the obligations of their Departments (and of State bodies/agencies under their aegis) to be fully tax compliant.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	432	Ireland, as with other countries, has experienced an increase in the cost of petrol and auto-diesel. This is an international phenomenon driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions. The excise rates (including the carbon charge) in Ireland on motor fuels are 58.8 cent per litre of petrol and 47.9 cent per litre of auto-diesel. However, our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners and significantly lower than our nearest neighbour the UK. The rates for petrol and auto-diesel were increased with effect from 7 December 2011, arising from an increase in the carbon charge for those fuels from €15 to €20 per tonne of CO2 emitted. This represented an increase of less than 1.5 cent per litre in the case of petrol and just over 1.5 cent per litre in the case of diesel, when VAT is included. The rate of VAT that applies to those fuels increased from 21% to 23% with effect from 1 January 2012.The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase. However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol can not be deducted/reclaimed.There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so, could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. The issue of rising fuel prices was discussed by EU Finance Ministers at an ECOFIN meeting last year where they reconfirmed the approach taken in 2005 and again in 2008, when oil prices were very high, which endorsed a coordinated approach towards not making distortionary fiscal adjustments.

The Central Bank quarterly residential mortgage data for end December 2011 showed that 82 mortgage holders were participating in Deferred Interest Schemes (DIS) offered by lenders. It should be noted that the DIS is a voluntary scheme directed towards extending forbearance to mortgage holders in difficulty.The latest Central Bank mortgage data shows that there are approximately 75,000 restructured mortgage accounts which demonstrates that lenders are offering a range of forbearance options to mortgage holders in difficulty.The approach of Government to the mortgage arrears problem has been clear and measures being implemented to assist mortgage holders in difficulty include personal insolvency reform, the implementation of the "mortgage to rent" initiative, direct engagement with individual mortgage lenders on their mortgage arrears resolution strategies, the development by lenders of realistic options for their customers that are experiencing mortgage difficulty and the provision of a mortgage advisory function.In addition, the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears remains a key framework that governs the relationship between lenders and mortgage holders who are in arrears or facing arrears. This continues to provide very important and much needed protections to such mortgage holders.

However, I am advised by NAMA that it has exposure to 121 of the over 900 operating hotels in Ireland and has exposure to 20 golf courses, mainly attached to the aforementioned hotels, of which there are over 400 in the country. These figures show that despite perception to the contrary NAMA debtors have relatively small exposures to the hospitality sector and it could therefore be argued that the Agency's impact on the overall viability of the sector tends to be exaggerated. Furthermore, I am advised that complaints about NAMA loans which have hotels as security have been received by the Competition Authority. NAMA engaged openly with the Authority in its investigations of these complaints and I understand that as a result of the information it received from NAMA, the Competition Authority chose not to pursue these complaints further.

Any issues arising from the review in relation to the entry process will be for the medical schools to address.It is understood that the medical schools did consider the possibility of making the test available in both Irish and English but this was found to be impractical as when dealing with an internationally-standardised aptitude test such as HPAT the medium of language is a significant factor and tests in different languages are not directly comparable.

In his reply, the Taoiseach did not give a commitment to review the decision to end the modern languages in primary school initiative.  He did however state that the primary curriculum is being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the national literacy and numeracy strategy.This Government does not plan to review the decision to end the modern languages in primary schools initiative.As the Deputy is aware the decision to end the scheme took account of a 2008 Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  The report identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level. The NCCA's advice recommended for the present modern languages should not be part of the Primary School Curriculum as an additional and separate subject.  The advice in relation to curriculum overload predated the wake up call on literacy and numeracy triggered by the PISA results.  I am taking that advice on board and with particular regard to the demands on time in school that will result from a heightened focus on literacy and numeracy.The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy.  The €2.5million in savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy.  The 17% of primary schools at present in the Initiative, who have had even more time demands than others in a crowded curricular space, should as a result be better placed to deliver under the strategy.Given the priority of literacy and numeracy, I have acted on the 2008 advice about overload and could not justify either the continuation of the initiative in the existing schools or its expansion to all schools even if funding was not an issue.

Accordingly, whereas I provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor the Department have legal powers to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regards to individual complaint cases, or to investigate individual complaints except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.In dealing with parental complaints, my Department's role is to clarify for parents how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed.  If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities.  The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies.  Where a parent feels that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children.The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative affect on a child.

To date 682 students have accepted places or are enrolled on these programmes countrywide.  A preliminary evaluation of applicant data shows that there has been strong demand for these programmes from high quality applicants.  More than 80% of participants have degree level or postgraduate qualifications.  A quarter of participants were previously employed in the construction sector.  A preliminary analysis of qualifications responses show that approximately 8% have qualifications in Architecture, architectural technology or Built Environment and a further 15% have qualifications in Engineering (mostly civil and mechanical engineering) with others qualified in mathematics, science, accountancy, commerce and other disciplines.  None of the programmes have completed yet but there will be ongoing monitoring of the programmes and an evaluation of the outcomes as graduates emerge early next year.Other actions provided for in the Plan are also under way including the establishment of a new high level Academic Industry Foresight Group.  The publication of the Plan has also contributed to raised awareness of the employment opportunities for graduates from these disciplines.  While it is too early to assess increased numbers onto undergraduate ICT programmes, early indications from CAO application data are very promising.  The number of students expressing a first preference for Science courses (including Computing) at honours degree level (level 8) increased by 18.47% this year and over the five year period 2008-12, this figure has increased by a total of 63.5%.  It is expected that this will feed through into increased enrolments in September 2012.

The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.The staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process.  As part of the new staffing arrangements my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small primary schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure. Such schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.The Primary Staffing Appeals Board met on 18th and 19th April. A total of 367 schools submitted appeals to the Appeals Board. These appeals were considered in accordance with the appeals criteria set out in Department Staffing Circular 0007/2012.  205 schools had their appeals upheld by the Staffing Appeals Board.  A summary outcome of the appeals is now published on my Department's website. Individual schools have been notified of the outcome of their appeals.The next meeting of Staffing Appeals Board is due to be held on 14 June 2012.  The latest date for other schools to submit appeals is 1 June 2012.  The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.

A key part of the reforms of the allocation process was to facilitate a long overdue updating of the GAM (learning support) allocation for all schools. The criteria for the allocation of GAM hours by school type including DEIS schools are outlined in circular 007/2012. The reform inevitably involves changes to existing clustering arrangements whereby a teacher is shared between schools. A further change is that schools in any locality are being empowered to cluster and arrange their GAM resources in a manner that best suits their local needs.The staffing arrangements include provision for an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal and the Board upheld this appeal at its meeting on the 18th and 19th April 2012. The school has been notified accordingly.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	450	The work of the Valuation Office is underpinned by The Valuation Act 2001 which provides for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property. The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations for local authority rating is his sole prerogative. The statute does not accord me, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, any function in this regard.  In accordance with the 2001 Act, which came into force on 2nd May, 2002, a national programme is being rolled out progressively for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in the State.The revaluation programme aims to provide up-to-date valuations for individual properties across all economic sectors that are subject to local authority rates. The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists for rates purposes and in individual ratepayers' rates liabilities. It is an important programme, especially given the significant changes in values and rents following the economic downturn of recent years.The purpose of a revaluation is to redistribute commercial rates liabilities among ratepayers based on up-to-date values. Following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability. Even though property values have fallen generally, some ratepayers will gain while others will lose from the process of redistribution but, overall, revaluation results in a fairer distribution of the rates burden.The revaluation programme, which has been completed in three County Council areas in Dublin, began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010.  The revaluation of Dublin City Council area began in May 2011 and will be completed in 2013. The Commissioner signed valuation orders for Waterford on 12th December, 2011 and Limerick on 29th March, 2012. The Waterford and Limerick revaluations will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively. It is intended to extend the revaluation programme to further local authority areas as soon as it is practicable to do so but it is not possible at present to say where these areas will be.While the extension of the project to Dublin City is the major current focus and represents an important advance, the Commissioner has expressed his concern that the present rate of progress may not allow the Office to complete the job nationally within the ten years from 2008 which the Office previously indicated.Accordingly, the Valuation Office is actively pursuing ways to accelerate the revaluation programme. The Commissioner has indicated that following detailed examination of various possibilities over the past year the Office has concluded that it may be feasible to introduce a Self-assessment approach, accompanied by appropriate controls, and that it might be possible also to outsource some of the work. The enabling provisions to allow for these changes are included in proposals for amending legislation currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Draftsman and, subject to the enactment of this legislation, I understand that the intention would be to initiate pilot revaluations in two local authority areas using the new methodologies.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	453	As stated in my previous reply, Directive 2006/123/EC [the Services Directive] on services in the internal market was transposed into Irish law by way of S.I. No. 533 of 2010, (European Communities (Provision of Services) Regulations 2010) and S.I. No. 555, (European Communities (Court Orders for the Protection of Consumer Interests) Regulations, 2010).  The Directive is not concerned specifically with casual trading but with the provision of services in general.  The service in the context of the Deputy's question is the regulation of casual trading by local authorities which results in the provision of casual trading licences to traders to sell goods in public places.On the 17th December 2009 my Department issued a detailed Notice to all 88 local authorities entitled to make bye laws under the Casual Trading Act 1995 outlining the obligations arising for them under the Services Directive.  This Notice was drawn up in my Department following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General.  Arising from this Notice, local authorities and others raised issues in respect of the obligations under the Services Directive.  Regulation 14(2) of S.I. No. 533 of 2010 transposes Article 13(2) of the Services Directive.  This Regulation states that competent authorities (in this case local authorities) shall ensure that the fees charged "are reasonable and proportionate to the cost of administering the scheme".  The question arises as to how this provision interacts with the provision for fees in the Casual Trading Act 1995 [section 6(4)].Consultations between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General are still ongoing in this matter.  When these consultations have concluded, I can assure the Deputy that my Department will write to all local authorities, informing them of the position with regard to this issue and any other issues arising from how the Services Directive affects casual trading regulation.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21605	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Industrial action by 110 workers at the Irish Cement production plants at Platin, Co Meath and Castlemungret, Co Limerick began on 3rd April last.  I understand that the Labour Court's most recent Recommendation of January 2012 in relation to this dispute was the culmination of a protracted dialogue between the company and the group of unions representing the workers on restructuring issues that had already involved three successive Labour Court Recommendations.  The Labour Court noted in its Recommendation of last January that it was not in a position, on the basis of the information provided through a report of a Financial Assessor undertaken following agreement between the parties, to make a definitive recommendation on an adjustment of pay rates and pay structures for the future.  The Labour Court had, accordingly, urged the parties to engage with each other regarding the total cost base of the company.The Labour Relations Commission was subsequently closely involved in facilitating talks between the company and the group of unions which were aimed at finding an agreed solution to the matters in dispute.  That process of dialogue proceeded to the stage at which proposals for a settlement of the dispute were rejected by the trade unions concerned and a work stoppage commenced.  I understand that the parties are currently engaged in direct discussions in an effort to resolve the dispute, with the assistance of an independent facilitator jointly appointed by ICTU and IBEC.I would urge the parties involved in this dispute to work together to break the current impasse and to approach the process in good faith.  The industrial relations dispute resolution bodies also remain available, if requested, to assist in seeking a resolution.

For this reason, eligibility is confined to those in receipt of a job seekers payment from the Department of Social Protection.  These provisions are to ensure a highly targeted approach on those at danger of falling into long term unemployment.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  In the interests of fairness and equity applications are processed, as far as possible, in order of the date on which they were received in the Department.A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to address the large increase in the claim-load and to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme. This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times.  This essential focus of certain staff resources will continue until the completion of the modernisation project in June of this year when all existing carer's allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.Accurate processing time figures are not available at present as applications are still being processed on both the old and the new computer systems. The average time to award an application at present is estimated at around 28 weeks. There are currently approximately 7,800 new applications registered and awaiting a decision and approximately 330 new applications are received each week.  I acknowledge that this is unsatisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking all steps available to it to resolve the issue.In addition to the deployment of new systems which should address service levels in the medium term, the Department is allocating additional resources in the form of overtime working to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  In addition, approval has recently been  given for the assignment of temporary staff to expedite the reduction of the backlogs. However, it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on an application, they may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.

The scheme, which is means tested, is available to people whose homes were damaged in the flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair as a result of the flooding damage.The humanitarian assistance scheme is a non-statutory scheme and is not covered under social welfare legislation.  It is one of a number of social welfare schemes which operates on an administrative basis. Administrative schemes are not appealable under social welfare legislation. However, where a person is dissatisfied with a decision they can request to have their case reviewed by another officer.  This review will be carried out by an officer not involved in the original decision.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	470	Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than €356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%).Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits, to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  Among the issues that the Advisory Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which is due to be completed in mid-2012, will examine this matter.Self-employed individuals who fall on hard times or are without work for some time may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments.  Those who have been previously self-employed can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for assistance-based payments, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.

Further medical evidence was submitted on 17th January 2011 and 2nd February 2011 in support of her case. However, this information did not alter the opinion of the medical assessor and consequently the deciding officer's decision remained unchanged.  On 16 March 2011, she was notified accordingly. There is no record of an appeal against that decision.On 15 February 2012, you submitted further medical evidence on behalf of the second care recipient's medical condition.In view of the lapse of time since the initial decision, this medical evidence is being taken as an indication of a wish to make a new application for an increase in carer's allowance in respect of a second care recipient.Accordingly a fresh application form and return envelope issued to her on 5 May 2012.On receipt of the form, duly completed, the application will be assessed as soon as possible and the person in question will be notified directly of the outcome.

The spouse of the person concerned is employed in the United Kingdom. She herself is not employed.  Therefore, the  United Kingdom is the competent state to award family benefits and this Department considers entitlement to a Family Benefit Supplement payment.  A supplement payment is the difference in the total amount of family benefits payable in the UK (Child Benefit + Child Tax Credit) and Ireland (Child Benefit).  In order to establish entitlement to a Family Benefit supplement payment, UK Child Tax Credit Notices are required for the tax years 2011/2012 and 2012/2013.

It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, at all skills levels. The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.  The Scheme has made significant progress to-date. 6,840 jobseekers have commenced their internship since 1st July 2011.  Please see breakdown of starters to-date in Table 1.My Department has recently selected Indecon International Economic Consultants to conduct an independent evaluation of the Scheme.  This Project needs to be undertaken to assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge scheme on the unemployed.

The claim may be based on the insurance record of the deceased, or their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.All adults are treated equally under the bereavement grant scheme and must satisfy the same PRSI conditions.On preliminary inspection, based upon the information provided by the Deputy, it appears that the person concerned was a single man who did not have any reckonable contributions paid and that, consequently, a bereavement grant would not be payable in this case.  However, it is open to the person's next of kin to make a claim for bereavement grant in order for the case to be fully assessed and a formal decision made.  In this case, a completed application form should be sent to the bereavement grant section in the Social Welfare Services Office in Longford.Alternatively, to assist with burial costs, the claimant may qualify for a means tested exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare scheme administered by the local Community Welfare Service.

In a small number of cases where customers have not returned information or made contact with the Department, their payments have been suspended.  Payments have been restored in these cases when the customers concerned contacted the Department and they remain in payment until the review process is completed.This information provided on review is assessed by a Departmental Medical Advisor and a decision is made based on the medical opinion they provide.  Where payment is stopped as a result of a review, the customer is invited to submit any further information they may wish to have considered and that information is further examined and they may appeal the decision directly to the Social Welfare appeals Office.Reviews of the Scheme commenced in 2010 with a total of 134 reviews carried out.  Eighty of these customers were found to have a continuing eligibility.  Fifty four customers were found to be no longer eligible for the allowance.  In 2011, a total of 403 reviews were carried out with 176 customers found to have a continuing entitlement.  Of the overall number, 224 customers were found to be no longer eligible with 3 cases yet to be finalised.  Payment has been stopped where the customer has been found to be no longer eligible for the allowance.There is no provision in Social Welfare legislation to allow the Department to continue to making payments once a decision has been made that the customer no longer fulfils the conditions for receipt of a payment.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	487	The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1st July 2011.  It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, at all skills levels.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.The Scheme has made significant progress to-date.  6,842 jobseekers have commenced their internship since 1st July 2011.  There are currently 4,670 jobseekers undertaking internship opportunities.  In addition, there are 1,876 internship opportunities available across a wide number of occupational sectors and geographic areas being hosted on the JobBridge website www.jobbridge.ie.
The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register.  It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register.Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of jobseekers allowance/benefit payments or signing for credits for 78 days of the last 6 months.  Time spent of certain government sponsored training may also be taken into account when calculating eligibility.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources to those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.Provided that an individual can fulfil all Jobbridge eligibility criteria regarding jobseekers allowance/benefit, persons in part-time employment can participate in JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme provided that their employer is not the provider of the internship.  The intern must advise their local Social Welfare office of their continued part-time employment while undertaking an internship.A standard Internship working week will range from 30-40 hours per week.  Therefore an intern will be required to participate on the scheme for a minimum of 30 hours and a maximum of 40 hours per week.  Hence, an additional requirement is that the part-time employment does not interfere with the minimum weekly hours (thirty) of the internship.My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	490	The Government's EV Grant Scheme for certain vehicles with CO2 emissions of less than 75 g/km was launched in April 2011.  The objective of the 2-year scheme is to incentivise and support, through grants of up to €5,000, the early deployment of electric and other low emission vehicles in Ireland in order to provide an early critical mass of such vehicles and to encourage the growth of a stable and robust market for these vehicles.The ESB is currently rolling out smart charge points on a nationwide pilot basis.  These charge points can interact with electric vehicles and can provide features such as real time electricity prices as well as being able to collect useful data that will be used to inform future decisions relating to the deployment of charging infrastructure.  The ESB are also involved in a number of research projects such as Ecars trial and Green eMotion, which is a major EU electric vehicle project.  More details on these projects can be found at www.esb.ie/electric-cars/electric-car-charging/electric-car-research-trials.jsp.
In addition, in January 2011, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) along with the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs launched a pilot programme to investigate the potential for Electric Vehicles to store and manage available wind and ocean power.  The project involves the deployment of eight Electric Vehicles on the Aran Islands which are being monitored over a three year period.SEAI have also supported 8 Commercial EV demonstration projects.  The vehicles have completed 1 year of service and the results of these trials will be communicated to prospective EV customers via SEAI's website and industry networks.  There are also a number of other research projects on electric transport, involving Irish academic institutions and industry, which are being part funded by the European Union under the FP7 programme.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	491	Ireland's telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and thus the delivery of broadband services is a matter, in the first instance, for private sector commercial operators which are licensed and regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).Decisions by private operators relating to investment in infrastructure to provide broadband services, including the upgrading of an exchange, are taken purely on commercial grounds, having regard to the cost of service provision and the anticipated revenue returns from any such investment.  You will appreciate therefore, that I do not have a statutory authority to direct commercial companies in this regard.The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  In the case of one such intervention, namely the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), services are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, 3, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in each of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.A detailed mapping exercise was carried out prior to the roll-out of the NBS to determine which parts of rural Ireland could be included and which parts, by virtue of already having access to commercial broadband services, had to be excluded.  That mapping exercise found that a number of commercial providers were active in the area referred to in the Deputy's Question and consequently it was not included in the NBS.The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  This Scheme, which is being rolled out this year, is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual unserved premises in rural non-NBS areas who wish to avail of such services.The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I convened last summer, has had an important role to play in this regard.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Taskforce report has now been published.  The report notes that by 2015, over 50% of the population will have access to high speed broadband services with speeds in excess of 70 Mbps.  The report also highlights areas where Government and industry can work together to facilitate the roll out of high speed services across Ireland, and particularly in areas where the case for commercial investment is marginal.Following on the publication of the Taskforce report, I have also launched a 4 week consultation process.  The purpose of this consultation is to provide further input to this important policy area.  Thereafter, it is my intention to bring proposals to Government for a National Broadband Plan for Ireland.  This plan will build on the recent excellent progress made and be informed by the findings of the Taskforce and subsequent consultations.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I am very much aware of the challenges digital switchover brings, in particular for households that are reliant on the existing free to air analogue TV network.  The necessary assistance and support for everyone but in particular for those households who need to make the switch to digital is being provided through a substantial national information campaign.  In addition there is a community outreach programme aimed at providing local assistance to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in society.  As I have stated in reply to previous questions, I do not propose to introduce grant schemes for this purpose.Experience from other European countries indicates that the cost of set top boxes and other digital receivers reduces as the date for digital switchover approaches, and as competition increases in the market.  There is clear evidence that this is now happening in Ireland with affordable set top boxes that meet the SAORVIEW standard on the market, as well as a wide range of suitable digital televisions.  A small SAORVIEW TV costs approximately €120 and set top boxes are now retailing from €70 or less.  Experience from other European countries however shows that the availability of accurate and reliable information and the provision of practical assistance is the most effective approach towards assisting people in making the switch to digital television.In this regard, therefore, to overcome the challenges that digital switchover brings, I have undertaken to deliver a substantial information campaign providing households with information on the digital switchover, the 24 October date for analogue switch off and on their options for going digital.  This information campaign commenced in quarter four 2011 and includes a dedicated telephone helpline, 1890 840 980, a website  www.goingdigital.ie, information booklets, TV and radio ads and a PR campaign.  An information booklet will also be delivered to every house in the country in the coming months.In conjunction with this, my Department has been working to address the particular information and assistance needs of vulnerable households as they prepare to go digital.  On January 10th   2012, I signed an agreement with a national voluntary organisation, the Wheel, to develop and operate a nationwide community outreach digital switchover programme (Outreach Programme).The Wheel, in conjunction with other voluntary and community organisations throughout the country, has now begun to roll out the countrywide Outreach Programme through a network of recently appointed county-based local Champions.  The aim of the Outreach Programme, which will provide additional assistance and advice at community level to those who may find the move to digital TV difficult, is to ensure that everybody is made aware of the switchover and that no TV viewers are left without a TV service once the national analogue TV service switches off in October.A press release issued on the Outreach Programme and is available on the dedicated digital switchover website www.goingdigital.ie, as is the list of local champions referred to above.

These Regulations were further amended by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 which expanded the definition of "a proper state of structural repair" to allow for all aspects of the internal and external appearance of a dwelling to be taken into account for the purposes of the Regulations.All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these Regulations.  Responsibility for enforcing the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide the specific details of its enforcement strategy and inspection arrangements.  However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rental sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to the Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which make a range of recommendations on relevant issues, including targeting inspection activities.Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened, updated legislative and regulatory framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations under the regulations, and fines for continuing non-compliance with the Regulations have also been significantly increased.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	501	The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations provide the legislative basis for the household charge.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.Tax clearance certificates are issued by the Revenue Commissioners under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  That Act is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  My Department has had no discussions with the Revenue Commissioners on the issue.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 131 together.The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, set out the legislation underpinning the household charge and the charge on non-principal private residences respectively.Under the legislation, it is a function of a local authority to collect household charges and charges on non-principal private residences and associated late payment penalties due to it and all such charges and late payment penalties imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.I have recently issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the "care and management" provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 in the context of individual situations where genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.  In such cases, the guidelines set out the modalities for local authorities in entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.  I also intend to issue guidance shortly to local authorities on hardship in the context of the operation of the "care and management" provisions of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011.

This change will further assist in addressing the difficulties being experienced in accessing credit in the current economic climate and will provide an increased level of support for rural entrepreneurs in Ireland.  This is in line with commitments to enterprise supports in both the Programme for Government and the Action Plan for Jobs.The change is still undergoing a formal process of programme amendment at EU level and subject to final approval from the European Commission.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	505	The Programme for Government includes a commitment to take further steps to address noise pollution, inter alia, through the introduction of fixed payment notices (also known as on-the-spot fines) and provision for mediation procedures between neighbours.  The development of new noise legislation by my Department will be considered in the context of this commitment, however, as indicated in the Government Legislation Programme published on 17 April 2012, it is not possible at this time to indicate when the legislation will be published, having regard to other priorities in the area concerned and the broader range of legislative priorities to be progressed across my Department’s remit.Currently, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.

The Attorney General has confirmed that all provisions are in place and the necessary administrative work is now underway to ratify the Convention.  Ratification of the Aarhus Convention is a high priority and my Department is working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with a view to finalising this process as soon as possible.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	507	Sections 34(4)(g) and 180(2)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provide respectively that a planning authority may attach conditions to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a proposed development and, if a development is not subsequently completed satisfactorily, may apply a security, given under section 34, for the satisfactory completion of that development.  My Department has consistently advised planning authorities that it is essential that planning permissions for residential developments are subject to conditions under which an acceptable security is provided by way of bond, cash deposit or otherwise so as to secure the satisfactory completion of those developments. Planning conditions must require the giving of sufficient security prior to commencement of development and planning authorities should ensure that they are in a position to draw down the security in cases where a developer fails satisfactorily to complete a residential development, or phase of a development, within the specified period.It is a matter for the planning authority to determine both the level of the security, the duration and the type of security (e.g. the lodgement of a bond from a financial institution such as a bank, insurance company or building society, a cash lodgement or a letter of guarantee from the Construction Industry Federation) that will be required for each residential development. The amount of the security, the duration and the terms on which it is required to be given, must enable the planning authority, without cost to itself, to complete the necessary services (including roads, footpaths, water mains, sewers, lighting and open space) to a satisfactory standard in the event of default by the developer. Similarly, the enforcement of planning conditions, including conditions in relation to bonds, is a matter for the relevant planning authority.The Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments considered that the issue of securities and bonds merits further examination, including the use of more liquid securities such as cash deposits coupled to careful phasing of developments in a sequential manner to minimise the working capital impact. The matter remains under active consideration by the National Coordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments, which I chair.

Local authorities were then required to draw up implementation plans setting out a programme of works to address any issues identified through the audit process.In 2005 the multi-annual Disability Services programme to assist delivery of the National Disability Strategy by the Department, local authorities and bodies under the Department's aegis was commenced. The multi-annual programme was completed in 2009 with one year's extra funding provided by the Department in 2010.In total my Department provided over €77 million, between 2005 and 2010, to assist local authorities in improving access to public spaces, buildings and services for people with disabilities.   Funding was allocated annually, for purposes of Disability Services, to local authorities, on the basis of priority areas identified by them in implementation plans.The funding provided to Kerry County Council from 2005 to 2010 inclusive is set out in the table:YearCurrentCapitalTotal200515,00035,00050,000200674,638446,023520,661200775,088350,000425,088200828,516340,000368,516200926,809303,688330,49720107,500226,106233,606

I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I share the Deputy's concern at the incidence of burglaries and I am conscious of the deep distress which this type of crime can cause to householders, and to the broader impact it can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities.All crime trends are monitored closely by Garda management, with intelligence-led initiatives put in place to target burglary and other criminality.  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has recently announced the introduction of a wide range of measures aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries. These measures are encompassed in Operation Fiacla, which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts. Specific burglary related initiatives are being implemented in each Garda Region in support of Operation Fiacla.
In terms of prevention, the National Crime Prevention Unit (NCPU) and Crime Prevention Officers at divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary crime and the opportunity to commit burglary. These specially trained officers are skilled at identifying environmental design risks and advise on ways to reduce opportunities to commit burglary and other property crime. During 2012, the national ‘Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign' will continue to highlight key issues, in particular burglary prevention. The first such campaign was launched by the Garda Commissioner on 2 May and a second campaign will take place in September.Insofar as developments with respect to Ashbourne Garda District are concerned, the Garda Commissioner's Policing Plan for 2012, which I laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 5 December 2011, sets out, among other things, plans for the amalgamation of Garda Districts.  In this context the Garda Districts in Laytown and Ashbourne in the Meath Garda Division were amalgamated and form the new Ashbourne Garda District.I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Ashbourne Garda Station on 31 March 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 45.  The personnel strength of the overall Meath Garda Division, on the same date was 296. There are also 30 Garda Reserves and 22 Civilians attached to the Meath Garda Division. These resources are augmented, when appropriate, by gardaí from national units such as the Garda National Drug Unit and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.The Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation. The allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. The priority is, and will remain, that an effective and professional policing service is provided to every part of the community.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	513	The Community Return Programme is an incentivised scheme introduced in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group which provides for earned temporary release under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service.The scheme, which was introduced on a pilot basis last October, is applicable to suitably assessed prisoners who are serving sentences of more than one and less than eight years. Those participating are granted renewable temporary release having served at, or after, the 50% stage of their sentence with a condition of their release to undertake supervised community service.The following factors are taken into account in considering the suitability of a prisoner for temporary release to participate in the scheme:the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates;the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed;the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released;the person's previous criminal record;the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release;the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release;the extent of the prisoner's engagement with therapeutic services while in custody and the likelihood of period of temporary release enhancing his/her reintegration prospects; andconduct while in custody.As announced with the launch of its new three year strategic plan, the Prison Service, in conjunction with the Probation Service, intends to increase the number of prisoners benefitting from this structured form of release over the course of the next three years. The Prison Service will work towards the placement of 400 prisoners per annum serving sentences of 1 to 8 years.  It is envisaged that there would be no more than 150 prisoners participating in this scheme at any one time and all prisoners will be carefully assessed before being approved for the scheme.Between 3 October 2011 and 31 March 2012, there were 137 participants in the pilot scheme. The scheme has continued and on 1 May 2012 there were 85 offenders taking part in the Community Return Programme. A total of 161 offenders have participated in the scheme and 56 offenders have completed the programme successfully.I will write to the Deputy shortly with a detailed breakdown of the offences.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	514	The 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons provides a mechanism whereby prisoners can be repatriated to their home state in order to serve prison sentences they have incurred abroad. The Convention is provided for in legislation in this State by virtue of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts, 1995 and 1997 and the process is administered by my Department.The process requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between the relevant jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered.  Three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned.  On receipt of those consents (assuming they will be forthcoming), an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and their continued detention here.I understand that an expression of interest in repatriation was received from the person referred to, in 2002. On foot of this, the US authorities were asked to commence processing the application. However the US authorities refused to consider the transfer and consequently the case was closed. Should the prisoner wish to re-apply for a transfer he must do so via his Prison Governor in the US.  I can inform the Deputy that the issue of consular assistance is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and this case has been brought to their attention by my officials.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that valid applications for a certificate of naturalisation were received from the persons referred to by the Deputy in May, 2011.The applications are currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. While good progress continues to be made in reducing the large volume of cases on hands, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process. It is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. I can, however, inform the Deputy that enormous progress has been made in dealing with the backlog and steps are being taken to process all outstanding applications and to have made significant inroads into them by the end of this year.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I can inform the Deputy that the provision of legal aid falls within two separate categories, i.e criminal legal aid and civil legal aid.  Details in respect of each category are as follows:
Criminal Legal Aid
The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings. Under the Act, the grant of legal aid entitles the applicant to the services of a solicitor and , in certain circumstances, up to two counsel, in the preparation and conduct of their defence or appeal. The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary.While records and information on expenditure under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme provide details of fees paid to individual solicitors, they do not provide separate details of the names of their particular firms, if any.  The ten highest earning solicitors under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme for the seven year period 2005 to 2011 (figures for earlier years are not readily available and the retrieval of relevant records would require a disproportionate use of resources) and the amount each solicitor was paid are as follows:2011€Frank Buttimer889,659Yvonne Bambury789,364Michael Hanahoe776,168Cahir O’Higgins762,510John Feaheny710,316John Quinn580,282Edmund Burke507,993Aine Flynn475,368Kevin Tunney462,926Michael Staines452,3472010€Yvonne Bambury920,529Frank Buttimer866,005Michael Hanahoe813,469Cahir O’Higgins796,778Michael Staines784,920John Feaheny752,727John Quinn714,034Aine Flynn482,329Michael Hannon476,455Michael Kelleher474,3902009€Michael J.

Civil Legal Aid
The Legal Aid Board (LAB) is the statutory body which provides legal aid and advice in civil law matters.  All Board services are governed by the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations.Again, the Deputy might wish to note that the relevant information in respect of civil legal aid is only readily available for the years 2007 to 2011 inclusive and that retrieval of earlier records would require a disproportionate use of resources.  In the case of civil legal aid, records and information on expenditure under the Civil Legal Aid Scheme provide details of fees paid to both individual solicitors and to firms and in the case of the former details of their particular firms, if any, are not on record.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I wish to inform the Deputy that the provision of legal aid falls within two categories, i.e criminal legal aid and civil legal aid.  The following is the position in respect of each category:
Criminal Legal Aid
Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the Courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the Court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation him/herself.  The Court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the gravity of the charge or exceptional circumstances, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.I am informed that the number of applications and details of cases in which legal aid is refused is not readily available and the necessary search of records would require a disproportionate use of resources.  The expenditure for each of the past 10 years is set out in the table below along with the number of legal aid certificates granted by the District CourtYearExpenditureNumber of certificates Granted2002€28.880m27,2412003€37.353m30,0602004€34.140mfigure unavailable2005€40.208m36,4232006€42.093m41,5822007€46.365m46,6202008€55.297m55,2652009€60.338m55,6642010€56.544m55,4122011€56.116m54,092
Civil Legal Aid
The Legal Aid Board (LAB) is the independent statutory body which provides legal aid in civil cases.  I should however point out that civil legal aid is not free and clients of the Board are required to pay a contribution to avail of legal services and may be liable to pay the Board's costs in certain cases.  The criteria for determining if a person qualifies for civil legal aid are set out in the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, and accompanying Regulations.  The two main criteria are the financial eligibility test and the merits test.  In order to be financially eligible for legal services a person's disposable income cannot be over €18,000 and disposable capital cannot be over €320,000.  The reckonable allowances to calculate disposable income and disposable capital are set out in the Regulations.  The qualifying allowances are set out in detail on the Board's website, www.legalaidboard.ie.In addition, the Act also specifies certain criteria to be met in respect of the merits and nature of the case.  In brief, a person can only receive legal aid for a case that (s)he would be likely to pay for if (s)he had the means; the person must have grounds to institute/defend or be a party to the case; the person must have reasonable prospects of success in the case and the granting of legal aid must be reasonable in all of the circumstances of the case.  In addition, certain types of cases are excluded under the Act.  These merits criteria are set out in detail in Sections 24-28 of the Act, as amended.Whilst I have made enquiries with the Board in respect of the statistical information requested, I am informed that it is not possible for the Board to provide all of the information sought in the format requested.  Information which can be made available to the Deputy without placing an undue administrative burden on the Board is set out below.  This includes the overall number of applications, the number of legal aid and advice cases handled in each year, the number of refusals and the cost to the Exchequer of providing the service.  Applications on a county basis for 2010 and 2011 are also set out.  The Deputy should note that this information does not include asylum cases.In addition, I should point out to the Deputy that the Board's Annual Reports and Accounts are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year and these reports contain a significant amount of information in respect of the services provided by the Board.YearApplicationsLegal Aid CasesLegal Advice CasesRefusalsExchequer grant in aid (million)2002n/a10,0703,530251€17.6362003n/a9,4393,504219€18.38920049,5099,0653,462117€18.38820059,1538,8963,336125€21.36220069,6889,4713,683114€21.913200710,1649,3904,525198€24.288200811,8889,0175,900282€26.310200914,0739,0327,138245€26.310201017,1759,3447,288288€24.225201118,6579,4928,333316€24.125Note: Legal aid and advice cases do not constitute new cases in each year, but the total number of cases dealt with.

As the processing requirements and time taken to complete necessary checks vary from case to case, it is not possible to provide a specific date for determination of an individual application. I can inform the Deputy that good progress continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process the generality of applications.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	527	I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.As the Deputy is aware four barracks, including Columb Barracks Mullingar, closed on 30th March 2012. Military personnel occupied on security and support functions within the four barracks have been released for operational duties leading to an efficiency gain of around €5 million per annum.  In addition, there are direct cash savings of approximately €1.3m per annum arising from utilities, maintenance and security duties allowances in the four barracks.When the Government took the decision to close the barracks, I asked my Department to enter into discussions with other Government Departments, Local Authorities, State Agencies and community groups regarding the possible purchase of the properties to benefit the local community as a whole but with particular emphasis on job creation measures. In this regard officials from my Department have met with officials from the various agencies and the relevant local authorities. These discussions are ongoing. I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to dispose of Mullingar Barracks so as to maximise the benefits to the local community.As a result of the closures there is a requirement to provide alternative accommodation for the local Reserve Defence Force Units. In this regard my Department placed advertisements in the relevant local newspapers seeking tenders for the provision of suitable accommodation.  This is a normal arrangement for Reserve Units in other locations around the country.  At present my Department has 10 permanent rentals and 30 part time rentals in place including part time use of parish and community halls as well as some commercial premises.  The total annual cost is less than €100,000 for all forty premises.Given the savings from the barrack closures you will appreciate that the renting locally of alternative accommodation for the Reserve Defence Force Units is the most appropriate course of action and there is no economic argument for keeping a full barracks open to cater for a Reserve Unit that may only train for a few hours once or twice a week when alternative rented accommodation can be provided for a small fraction of the cost.Following receipt of the tenders and their evaluation I am pleased to say that suitable alternative accommodation for the local Reserve Unit has been identified in Mullingar and the necessary documentation (Tax Clearance Certs, etc.) has been requested from the owner of the property. When the documentation is received a formal lease agreement will be entered into and the local Reserve Unit can then take possession of their new training accommodation.

My Department has however recently conducted a review of the 2003 Order and a draft new Rates and Charges Order, the first proposed changes to the fee schedule for almost a decade, has been prepared on foot of that review.The new draft Order was the subject of a public consultation process that closed on 20th April last, and I am pleased to note that my Department has received a total of 85 submissions in relation to the revised charges, from a wide range of stakeholders in the Fishery Harbour Centres.  These submissions are being given careful consideration at present, and when the examination is complete I will, if necessary, make any appropriate amendments to the draft new Rates and Charges Order before it is finalised.

Accordingly, grant applications which were received under the Scheme after that date were not processed by my Department on the basis of strict compliance with the terms of the decision.In the two cases in question, applicants who had lodged applications on 17 and 22 October 2008 respectively submitted appeals to the Agriculture Appeals Office in relation to the failure by the Department to process their applications. In two separate decisions taken by that Office, which were subsequently confirmed by the Acting Director of that Office following requests for a review, that Office considered that the Department was obliged to process the two applications concerned notwithstanding the fact that they had been received after the date of suspension of the Scheme. As the grounds for the decisions are quite detailed and lengthy, I will forward copies of the Appeals Office decisions to the Deputy with the personal details of the applicants concerned removed.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	532	The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs sets out a range of actions which will be progressed throughout 2012; the first quarter progress report was produced last month. One of the actions relevant to my Department is to implement the incentives and measures to improve skills, farm structures and scale set out in Budget 2012.In relation to upskilling at farm level, the main drivers are the Dairy Efficiency Programme (DEP) and the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP). Both programmes are designed to equip farmers with the knowledge and skills necessary to improve the productivity and profitability of their dairy and beef enterprises. Utilising a discussion group format, these programmes are designed to upskill participants by introducing them to peer best practice and improved technology using the BETTER farms system and key profit drivers such as financial and grassland management, animal breeding, herd health and producing to market specifications. In 2011, around 6,000 participants were involved in the DEP, while over 7,000 farmers have applied to participate in BTAP, which was launched last February.On Farm Structures, The Minister for Finance introduced a number of measures in Budget 2012 to both stimulate land sales and transfers and to incentivise farm partnerships so as to increase productivity and scale at farm level.  These include an enhanced 50% stock relief tax relief for all registered farm partnerships and a 100% stock relief for certain young trained farmers forming such partnerships, up until 31st December 2015.  There was also a reduction on the stamp duty rate from 6% to 2%, on agricultural land to promote inter-generational transfer and the transfer to more active producers.  In addition, the Capital Gains Tax retirement relief was restructured in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. Limited exemption from income tax on the net rental profits from long term farmland leasing is available to encourage long term leasing which gives leasees the time frame necessary to invest in and improve the land.In addition Teagasc and my Department have planned a major promotional campaign, to take place over the next few months, directed at encouraging a range of collaborative farming arrangements including partnerships.  Steps are also being taken to overcome the administrative and legal hurdles which may exist to the formation of formal farm partnerships outside the dairy sector.

The application is currently being assessed by my Department in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	534	The background to the changes which I introduced earlier this year is that, now that the main constraint to the eradication of TB, the presence of the disease in badgers, is being addressed in a very effective manner, we need to move on to address some of the other constraints such as the movement of high risk animals and animals from high risk herds. Accordingly, my Department is paying increased attention to detecting the disease and preventing its spread to other herds and greater stress is being laid on ensuring that all herds test on time and on reducing movement opportunities for potentially infected cattle so as to provide increased protection for clear herds.These measures are underpinned by research which indicates that movement of animals from the herds in question represents a significant risk to other herdowners who would otherwise buy these animals. For example, Department statistics show that, in 2011, the risk of herds which are contiguous to a high risk breakdown disclosing TB is almost 3 times greater than the risk in the case of herds tested on a round test. In view of the fact that contiguous tests were conducted on some 8,000 herds in 2011, involving almost 800,000 animals and resulting in the disclosure of 2,256 reactors, the risk of TB spreading from herds which are contiguous to high risk breakdowns is very significant.With regard to the changes to the contiguous testing arrangements, the position is that herds which are contiguous to a high risk breakdown were already required to undergo an additional testing regime under the previous arrangements. The contiguous testing programme only applies to those herds contiguous to a high risk breakdown (approximately one third of all restrictions) which, after a risk based epidemiological investigation, are considered to be relevant to the breakdown. In relation to holdings that have not held livestock in the previous four months or more, assuming that those holdings now have cattle, the testing regime to be deployed in such cases is dependant on an epidemiological investigation, including into the timing of the spread of infection relative to the usage of the land in question and whether the herd has had a clear test since the last time the land was used.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	536	In very broad terms, the challenge for the current round of CAP reform is to deliver, in good time, a Common Agricultural Policy that is fit for purpose, that is coherent with the Europe 2020 strategy for recovery and growth, and that supports the twin goals of competitiveness and sustainability. These requirements in turn create further challenges in the form of crucial questions about how much money will be made available for the CAP in the period up to 2020, how these funds will be allocated both between and within Member States, and how the policy content will help to shape and serve the development of European agriculture.It is important to note that, in addition to the European Parliament having an enhanced role in the process, key CAP issues are, in fact, being discussed in two parallel tracks, namely:in the CAP reform negotiations in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and at official level in the Special Committee on Agriculture and four separate working groups, andin the negotiations on a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) setting the EU budget for the period 2014 to 2020, which take place in the General Affairs Council and, ultimately, in the European Council.Ireland is, of course, committed to playing an active and constructive role in securing agreement on the reform of the CAP. However, to do this, three things need to be happen:there must be progress and, ultimately, agreement on the MFF,there must be substantial progress during the Danish and Cypriot presidencies, at least on technical issues, andall three institutions — the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission — need to engage actively in the negotiating process, with a commitment to seeking workable compromise.Ireland's priorities, which are informed by the need to achieve the targets outlined in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, are the sustainable intensification of production, environmental stewardship and the maintenance of a vibrant rural economy. Our key concerns as regards the reform proposals arise in four areas.  These are the overall CAP funding, the method for distributing CAP funds between Member States, the method for distributing direct payment funds within Member States and the overarching need for simplification in the reformed CAP.It is my view that a strong Common Agricultural Policy will make an important contribution to European economic recovery in the years ahead.  In order to guarantee a strong CAP, commensurate resources need to be devoted to it. From an Irish perspective, the Commission's Budget proposals represent a reasonable starting point, given the pressure from some Member States to cut CAP expenditure. However, the pressure for further cuts to the CAP is still very real, and must continue to be resisted.The key priority for Ireland is to retain our levels of funding for both direct payments and for rural development. Current proposals for redistributing direct payments between Member States on a pragmatic basis (convergence towards, but not all the way to, a uniform rate) are broadly satisfactory but I still have concerns about the method proposed for the allocation of rural development funds. I am therefore pressing for direct payments and rural development funds to be considered together, and for the pragmatic approach being employed for direct payments to be used for rural development also. The bottom line is that Ireland receives lower than average payments per hectare for direct payment and rural development funds combined, and I see no justification for any reduction.My priority is to obtain as much flexibility as possible for Member States with regard to payment models and transitional arrangements. I recognise that we cannot continue to base our payments on outdated historic production references, but I have major difficulties with the pace and extent of convergence in the Commission's proposal. Analysis carried out by my Department indicates that the move to flat national or regional rates will cause large transfers from the more productive farms to more marginal and less productive land, and that much of this movement is proposed to be front-loaded.I believe that Member States should therefore be allowed to implement the payment model best suited to their conditions and to the development of their farming systems, over a lengthy transitional period. The ‘approximation' approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average, is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard.I believe that the entire reform process should be informed by the need to keep the CAP as simple and as effective as possible. That means the lowest possible cost and administrative burden for both farmers and for Member State administrative systems.I have assured Commissioner Ciolos and my Member State colleagues that Ireland will play a full and constructive role, both before and during our presidency, in seeking agreement on this vital dossier, both for the EU and for Ireland.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	537	My Department, in the context of delivering the Direct Payment Schemes, is required to carry out on-the-spot inspections on a number of farms covering such issues as eligibility, compliance with EU legislation in the areas of the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health and ensuring that the farm is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition.A minimum of 5% of applicants are required to be inspected under the eligibility rule. The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance, is 1% of those farmers to whom the Statutory Management Requirements or GAEC apply. However 3% of farmers must be inspected for compliance with bovine identification and registration while 3% of sheep/goat farmers must be inspected representing 5% of the flock.Since 2010 my Department has carried out some 1,500 additional Nitrates inspections annually on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. The implementation of these inspections has already seen an amalgamation of information and expertise that has resulted in a reduction in the duplication of inspections across both Departments and more efficient use of resources.My Department is committed to ensuring the maximum level of integration of inspections and will continue to review inspection programmes in all areas with the aim of increasing integration where this is a feasible option.

I am aware that 12 of the 16 sites form part of the Coillte forest estate.As announced by the Government in February, consideration will be given to the possible sale of some assets of Coillte excluding the sale of land.  A valuation of Coillte assets is currently being undertaken by the NTMA (NewERA unit) in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. No decision on the possible sale of Coillte assets will be taken until the valuation process is completed.  The protection of the People's Millennium Forests is one of the issues to be considered in the decision-making process in relation to the possible sale of Coillte assets.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	540	Adoptions from Ethiopia, effected  under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined,  and  recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2012. The Adoption Act 2010 also contains provision for a one year extension to declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which may lead to a one year extension to this date.  Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. In these circumstances, adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State  ."  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.A delegation from the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) visited Ethiopia in April and held exploratory meetings with the Ethiopian authorities regarding the system of adoption which operates in that country. The delegation, in the course of its visit, held preliminary discussions with the Ethiopian authorities around the potential for a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption.  The AAI is currently preparing a report for me on its assessment of the situation which will inform the next steps to be taken.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 169 together.The Hague Convention  is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process. It sets out minimum standards regarding intercountry adoption and covers issues such as subsidiarity, consent and financial considerations. It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) performs the function of a Central Authority under the Adoption Act, 2010, in accordance with the Convention. In choosing to deal primarily with Hague countries, the AAI has the mechanism to work collaboratively with equivalent structures in that country. Each Central Authority has the responsibility to oversee standards in respect of those parts of the process taking place within their respective jurisdictions. This mutual arrangement is designed to give the AAI, the Government and, most importantly, those involved in the adoption process assurance as to the standards being set and the oversight of the system.A limited number of adoptions from Russia are currently being processed under transitional arrangements as provided for in the Adoption Act, 2010. Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2012, with the possibility of the Adoption Authority granting approval for an extension of up to one year. Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  In the circumstances, adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bilateral agreement developed to the standards of the Hague Convention.An official delegation from Ireland recently visited Russia and held preliminary discussions regarding the potential for a bilateral agreement. I have received an initial assessment from the Adoption Authority which will inform the next steps to be taken in relation to this matter. My Department is in discussions with the Adoption Authority on this assessment and other issues which will influence any policy decisions to be taken in this regard. I am aware of the need to bring clarity to the situation in respect of Russia and I hope to be in a position to do so shortly.The immediate priority of the Adoption Authority  is the development of administrative arrangements with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention.  Any future bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would also be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Convention.

However, adoptions between Ireland and Belarus cannot take place due to compatibility issues between the laws of Ireland and Belarus, in particular in relation to the Belarussian requirement for legislative underpinning of post placement reporting.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	544	The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) is an independent statutory body charged with implementing the Adoption Act, 2010. The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy.In November 2011 the AAI commenced a review of the adoption law(s) of Panama, which has ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The general review process followed by the AAI in such instances is detailed on the Authority's website. Owing to the variable nature of the process in respect of each individual country, and the need to engage with legal experts in the country being assessed, there is no definitive or set timescale for the completion of such reviews. The AAI will provide all relevant information relating to reviews on its website at the appropriate time.The Hague Convention is a formal state-to-state agreement between countries developed on a multilateral basis. If a country has ratified the Hague Convention then the Adoption Authority of Ireland may establish administrative arrangements, as provided for in Section 72 of the Adoption Act, 2010. Administrative agreements are designed to underpin the Hague process and are related to the sequence and process arrangements in place to support the safeguards already agreed between states. The Adoption Authority of Ireland works with central authority counterparts in the establishment of administrative agreements.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	550	I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 to 177, inclusive, together.The Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for the appointment of its employees including the setting of qualification requirements for particular posts.I am advised that the use of positron emission tomography — computed tomography (PET/CT) instrumentation/Nuclear Medicine is one of a range of functions performed by the profession of radiography within the HSE.  The qualification requirement for radiographer — basic grade- is possession of the Diploma of the College of Radiographers, London or the B.Sc. (Hons) in Radiography from University College Dublin or an equivalent qualification.  Qualifications in nuclear medicine or PET/CT would not be recognised for the purpose of recruitment to the HSE as a radiographer because the range of professional practice required of a radiographer within the HSE is much broader than provided through professional training in nuclear medicine or PET/CT alone.The HSE grade of Clinical Specialist Radiographer in the specialities of CT/MRI/Ultrasound/Nuclear Medicine/PET/CT and Mammography is a career grade within the profession of radiography and qualification prerequisites are the qualification requirements for radiographer — basic grade, post-qualification clinical experience  and a post-graduate course in the relevant speciality.Directive 2005/36/EC provides a mechanism for the recognition of non-Irish professional qualifications and the determination of their equivalence to the prescribed Irish qualification.  Under Statutory Instruments Nos. 139 and 166 of 2008, which transpose the Directive into Irish law, the Minister for Health is the Competent Authority for the assessment of Radiography qualifications and is advised by the Irish Institute of Radiography and Radiation Therapy (IIRRT).  The National Validation Office, Health Service Executive, Galway administers the process on behalf of the Department of Health.The Directive applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EEA State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications. The processes of the Directive are also applied in Ireland to persons with certain health profession qualifications which are outside the scope of the Directive i.e. EEA nationals with non-EEA qualifications and all non-EEA nationals.  This includes qualifications from Australia.Under the Directive, the applicant must be eligible to practise the profession in the country where the professional qualification was obtained  and the professional activities covered by the profession  in the home and the host country must be the same.  Persons with qualifications in nuclear medicine or PET/CT would not be recognised as radiographers in Ireland under the Directive because the range of professional practice required of a radiographer is much broader.In relation to statutory registration which will apply to both the publicly-funded and the private sector, the Radiographers' Registration Board of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council (CORU) was established in December 2011.  The Board is expected to be in a position to establish the register of radiographers later this year.  Under the 2005 Act, the process known as grand parenting or grand fathering is to enable existing practitioners who hold specific qualifications listed in the Act (but who may not meet current qualification criteria to be set by the Registration Board)  to register during the two year transition period.  Following this transition period, the use of the title of radiographer will be restricted to persons on the Register of the Radiographers.  It would then be open to an individual with the qualifications specified to seek employment using PET/CT provided the title of radiographer is not used. However, such employment options are not currently available within the HSE.

The purpose of the Programme is to define the way diabetic Clinical Services should be delivered, resourced and measured.It is widely recognised that secondary or acute care alone cannot cope with the current and increasing burden of disease.  Reorganising systems into more integrated models presents opportunities for a more efficient and effective approach to the management of diabetes care.In this regard, Diabetes Service Implementation Groups were established country-wide, with the priority at national level to progress an Integrated Care model of care.Approval has now been granted for the recruitment of diabetes nurse specialists and dieticians for the provision of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes who are under five years of age.The model of care and the job descriptions for these roles are currently under review.  I am advised by the HSE that  recruitment will take place once the model of care and job descriptions have been finalised and implementation plans have been approved.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	565	The development of the Unit is a key part of my plans to radically reform the health system in Ireland.  In 2011 I identified two key priorities for the SDU, namely addressing trolley waiting times and reducing the maximum waiting time for elective surgery.  I am happy to say that the SDU has delivered improvements on both objectives.At that time I instructed all hospitals to ensure that they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for inpatient or day case treatment by the end of 2011.  All except 2 hospitals achieved this target for their patients.  In order to achieve this, the NTPF supported the treatment of 1,159 cases in the later half of the year.  Over 60% of these cases were supported within public hospitals.This year I have set a target that, by year end, no adult will be waiting longer than 9 months and no child longer than 20 weeks for in-patient or day case treatment.  Also no person should be waiting longer than 13 weeks for a routine GI endoscopy.  Currently the NTPF/SDU is intensely engaged with public hospitals supporting their planning processes that will underpin the delivery of these targets.The NTPF has not been abolished.  In July 2011 I announced changes to the remit of the NTPF — namely its role would be changed to support the mission of the SDU.  The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and incentivising hospitals to manage their waiting times proactively.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account.There are a number of initiatives which will contribute to the overall improvement of hospital services in Ireland.  The organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the HSE's Clinical Programmes, which have been developed and implemented by the HSE, and by the work on the framework for the development of smaller hospitals.  These inter-related programmes aim to improve service quality, effectiveness and patient access and to ensure that patient care is provided in the service setting most appropriate to individuals' needs.The introduction of hospital groups will provide further opportunities for inter site cooperation.  Smaller hospitals can assist larger hospitals in the group by taking on more elective work.I can assure the Deputy that I am keenly aware of the length of the waiting lists and the continued reduction of these waiting lists is a key priority for me and my Department.

It should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of doctors with expertise in using the product and with a full understanding of the risks of therapy and the monitoring requirements.There are some types of patients who should not be prescribed or use Roaccutane:women who are pregnant or breastfeeding;women of childbearing potential unless all of the conditions of the pregnancy prevention programme are met;patients with liver disease;patients with high levels of blood fats;patients with very high levels of vitamin A;patients being treated with medicines called tetracyclines.The information for patients and for their doctors includes detailed advice on the risks associated with use of Roaccutane and recommendations to minimise their occurrence.Roaccutane has been closely monitored at national and EU level since it was first authorised and its benefits and risks were reviewed at EU level in April 2011.  The benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the risks, when the product is used in accordance with the approved product information.

Every citizen will have a choice of insurer and will have equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services.There are a number of key stepping stones that will play a critical role in paving the way for the introduction of universal health insurance.  Significant work has already been undertaken to progress these.  They include:the strengthening of the primary care sector to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier.  The Government has established a Universal Primary Care Project Team to oversee the introduction of universal primary care.  In addition, the Government has given its approval to the preparation of Heads of a Bill to progress the phased introduction of  free GP care in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  It is envisaged that the first phase in the Programme will provide for the extension of access to GP services without fees to persons with illnesses or disabilities to be prescribed by regulations under the new legislation.reform of the acute hospital sector, including the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) which has been tasked with unblocking access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  An important part of the Programme for Government is the establishment of independent not-for-profit trusts.  As a first step, non-statutory hospital groups will be set up which will have a single clinical governance model, one budget and one employment ceiling.  The hospital groups will be established on the clear understanding that the groupings and their governance arrangements will be reviewed prior to 2015 to ensure an appropriate environment for the introduction of UHI.the introduction of the more transparent and efficient "Money Follows the Patient" funding mechanism for acute hospitals.  A number of initiatives are already underway including a patient level costing project and a pilot initiative in relation to prospective funding of certain elective orthopaedic procedures, at selected sites.In February, I established an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance.  The Group will assist in developing detailed implementation plans for universal health insurance and driving implementation of various elements of the health reform programme.  A project team comprised of senior Department of Health officials has also been established to support the work of the Implementation Group.The initial work of the Group will focus on overseeing reform work in relation to the following work streams:—Hospital Financing (e.g. Money-follows-the-patient, Hospital Care Purchase Agency),Hospital Structures (e.g. Hospital Trusts),Regulation of the Hospital Sector (e.g. Patient Safety Authority, Licensing),Private Health Insurance Market (e.g. Risk Equalisation, Minimum Benefits),Overarching UHI Design (e.g. detailed design of the UHI system, including the legislative framework and the package of services to be covered).The reform programme is a complex and major undertaking that requires careful sequencing over a number of years.  The Implementation Group will continue in existence throughout the health reform process and will oversee different elements of the reforms as they are being put in place.  It is also intended that it will consult widely as part of the reform implementation process.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 and 207 together.In recognition that the population of Ireland is projected to age rapidly within a relatively short time, the Programme for Government has committed to completing and implementing the National Positive Aging so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives.  Traditionally, policy relating to older people has tended to deal almost exclusively with health and personal social services.It is acknowledged that a wide range of policies, programmes and services impact directly on the lives of older people and a cross departmental group comprised of officials from 11 Government Departments, the Central Statistics Office and An Garda Síochána, and chaired by the Director of the Office for Older People was established in 2008 to oversee the development of the Strategy.In keeping with the commitment to develop the Strategy in conjunction with the recognised voluntary groups, an NGO Liaison Group comprising representatives of twelve national level non-governmental organisations with an interest in older people's issues was established in 2009 under an independent Chair.An internal Department of Health group with representatives of all relevant service areas and the HSE has also been established.The Strategy will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.  It will set out a common framework for the development of operational plans by a number of Government Departments which will clearly set out each Department's objectives relating to older people.  Mechanisms designed to monitor the implementation of measures contained in operational plans will also be included in the Strategy.  However, I do not envisage that the Strategy will propose new service developments.  Rather it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.A considerable amount of preparatory work has already been completed.  The drafting of the Strategy will proceed within the Department within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  At this stage I envisage the Strategy will be completed and published as soon as possible within these constraints.

Early in 2011, I indicated that the issues raised by the case of Michael Shine, former Consultant at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda would be the subject of an inquiry by an Oireachtas Committee. This was dependent on the powers that had been proposed under the 30th Amendment of the Constitution. As it was not possible to proceed as proposed, I am giving consideration as to how best to deal with the issues involved. My Department is currently exploring the options in this regard particularly in the light of investigations by the Garda and various civil court actions. In these circumstances it would be premature to meet with Dignity 4 Patients, however, I would be open to a meeting with that organisation at a later date when my Department's deliberations are at a more advanced stage.Dignity 4 Patients has also been in contact with my Department in the past three months concerning funding issues. One of those requests relates to ongoing funding and as ongoing funding for any service is a matter for the HSE,  I  previously asked the HSE to liaise with Dignity 4 Patients on the issue. I understand that the HSE  has recently met with Dignity 4 Patients and signed a Grant Aid Agreement with them for €22,500 for one year's office supplies and voluntary support.  The HSE also advised Dignity 4 Patients that they would not be in a position to provide any funding towards staffing costs as the current time and suggested that they consider establishing synergies with other similar agencies, in order to continue to provide support to their client group.  My Department is also in receipt of an application for Lottery funding from Dignity 4 Patients and this is currently being considered.

The HSE is working to ensure that patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs are prioritised for treatment. In addition, free emergency dental treatment and a free oral examination every 12 months are available to all eligible patients.

Scandinavian countries, Germany and the UK Health Systems, in particular, have led the way in terms of chronic diseases being delivered in primary care settings.  Here in Ireland, the HSE is developing chronic disease programmes to improve patient access and to manage patient care in an integrated manner across service settings.  The programmes will be multidisciplinary in nature and will involve GPs, nursing staff, allied health professionals and other members of the primary care team, who will deliver appropriate care in the primary care setting.  The programmes aim to deliver better health outcomes, enhanced clinical decision making and more effective use of resources.Work is ongoing on the development of the following programmes which are particularly relevant to primary care:  Diabetes; Stroke; Heart Failure; Asthma; and COPD.  The Diabetes programme is due to commence in Quarter 4 of 2012.  The model of care for the Integrated Care Diabetes Package prescribes that:1. Uncomplicated Type 2 Diabetes patients will be managed in Primary Care only.2. Patients with complicated Type 2 Diabetes, as defined by the National Model of Diabetes Care, will be managed by both primary and secondary care.3. All patients with Type 1 Diabetes, genetic causes of Diabetes (MODY Diabetes), secondary causes of Diabetes, post-transplant Diabetes and pregnancy and Diabetes, will be managed in secondary care only.The integrated model of care for diabetes is to be rolled out on a phased basis as resources permit.  Work is also continuing on progressing initiatives introduced in 2011, including the national multidisciplinary foot care programme and the national retinopathy screening programme.A National Steering Committee has been set up to oversee implementation of the Diabetes programme and the key work streams are:Alignment of 10 pilot diabetes initiatives with nationally agreed model of care;Selection of Phase 1 sites;Recruitment of Integrated Care Diabetes Nurse Specialists;Progression of ICT Development;Discussions with Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) and other relevant parties;Identification of Drug Savings.The roll-out of the national Diabetes programme is to be phased over 4 years (2012-2015) as follows—In 2012, it is aimed to cover up to 1 million of the population;2013 targeted to cover additional population of 1.7 million;2014 targeted to cover further additional population of 1.7 million;2015 targeted to cover final population of 0.45 million.€2 million is required for the Diabetes programme in 2012 and this has been identified from within existing HSE resources.  Funding for implementation in 2013 to 2015 is dependent on the identification of savings within the health system which will be re-invested in diabetes care.

As part of this, the Government is committed to introducing Universal GP Care within its first term of office.Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment.  The Department of Health is currently drafting legislation to provide for the phased introduction of a universal GP service without fees in line with the commitment set out in the Programme for Government.  Initially it is intended to extend GP cover without fees to persons with certain long-term illness.  It is my intention to have the Bill published and enacted before the summer recess.

However, my understanding is that a final decision has not been made with regard to changes to the design and layout of the lighthouses referred to in the correspondence submitted by the Deputy. CIL should be in a position to provide further information on this to the Deputy.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The Deputy's question relates to the operation of Public Service Obligation bus services and the future of such services.The Action Plan for Jobs includes a commitment to examine the bus market with a view to considering the options for public service obligation or PSO bus services post 2014. This is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to explore the benefit to the public transport passenger of more diverse bus service provision.  In accordance with these commitments I will be consulting with my Ministerial colleagues soon on the future options for procurement of such services.Under EU law and the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, as amended, existing PSO bus services can be procured by the National Transport Authority through direct award contracts and any other new subvented services must be procured by way of open tendering.At the expiry of the current 5 year direct award contracts for the provision of PSO services with Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann in 2014, the NTA has discretion to renew, modify or terminate the direct award provision of bus services following a consultation process with interested parties under which the NTA is obliged to justify its approach.PSO services are covered by Public Service Contracts and do not fall within the licensing system for commercial bus services.  Section 10 of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 makes provision for the licensing of commercial bus services.  Responsibility for licensing of commercial bus services was transferred from my Department to the National Transport Authority with effect from 1 December 2010.

Action 14 of the Review Report proposes the introduction of a prohibition on the transferability of taxi vehicle licences such that all taxi vehicle licences will be unique to the person to whom the licence has been issued and cannot be transferred or sold to another individual.All SPSV licences are granted to an individual and in making its recommendation concerning the non-transfer of vehicle licences the Review Group did not distinguish between single or multiple licence holders.

Therefore the figures for 2011 are not full year figures and are therefore not comparable with the 2012 figures.Both the private and constituency offices in my Department are staffed in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines.  As indicated in the tables below both I and Ministers Ring and Kelly currently employ three staff each in our constituency offices.  This is one less than allowed number of staff for constituency offices, which is four.  It should be noted that this marks a considerable reduction from the levels of staffing permitted under the previous government where there were a maximum of six staff in each Minister of Government's office.OfficeNo of persons employedSalary (2011 — March to Year End) €’0002012 annual salary €’000Private10 (incl 2 civilian drivers)384556Constituency3145146OfficeNo of persons employedSalary (2011 — March to Year End) €’0002012 annual salary €’000Private6 (incl 2 civilian drivers)169251Constituency3101157OfficeNo. of persons employedSalary (2011 — March to Year End) €’0002012 annual salary €’000Private5 (incl 2 civilian drivers)205186Constituency3105121

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	595	The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.In July of last year, the National Roads Authority (on behalf of the Department) sought applications, in respect of regional and local roads, for funding under the Low Cost Safety Improvement Grants Scheme in 2012.  Under this scheme of works, grant approval is based on accident data, inspection of sites and targeting locations showing demonstrable hazard which can be improved through engineering measures.  A total of €6.035 million has been allocated to local authorities under this scheme of grants in 2012 for works at 212 locations.The funding provided to each local authority and the individual schemes are listed in the 2012 Grant Allocations to Local Authorities for Regional and Local Roads which is available in the Dáil library.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	596	The Deputy's questions relate to the future of the Government's shareholding in Aer Lingus.It is important to point out that the State's shareholding does not allow it to interfere in any way in the day-to-day commercial operations of the company and while the State has three Directors on the board, these Directors have fiduciary responsibilities to act in the best interests of the company.In terms of State asset disposals, two Working Groups were established by the Government in 2011, one to consider the best approach in progressing the proposed part-sale of ESB and the other to undertake a similar analysis of a number of other State assets identified by Government as potential candidates for disposal.  The State's remaining 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus was considered as part of this group of assets.  Both of these Working Groups completed their work in 2011 and reported to Ministers in December 2011.  NewERA was centrally involved in this process together with all relevant Departments including my Department.  It was on the basis of the analysis undertaken by these two Working Groups that the Government agreed to the list of asset disposals announced on 22nd February.In relation to Aer Lingus, the Government considers that the State's remaining shareholding in the company is no longer a strategic asset as it does not enable the Government to determine Aer Lingus policy on issues such as the use of the airline's landing slots at Heathrow. Accordingly, the Government has decided that the State's remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus will be sold at an appropriate time, when market conditions are favourable and at an acceptable price that is agreed by Government.My Department along with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA is working to examine the potential options for the disposal of the State's stake and the issues that may need to be addressed in the context of the disposal of the stake.  The Minister for Public Enterprise and I will consider any and all expressions of interest that may be received for the stake.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I propose to take Questions Nos. 229, 230, 232 and 234 together.I am in regular contact with stakeholders in the tourism sector and in recent weeks I have addressed the Irish Hotels Federation, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland.Last year's Jobs Initiative and the Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2013 recognise the vital contribution of tourism to employment, economic activity and foreign revenue earnings.  The VAT reduction on a range of tourism services from 13.5% to 9% enhances the competitiveness of our tourism product.  The Visa Waiver Scheme is encouraging visitors from emerging markets to add Ireland to a trip to the UK and the halving of employers' PRSI for those on modest wages will significantly reduce the cost of employing people.During discussions with operators, many identified an urgent requirement for certainty regarding the extension of the lower VAT rate into 2013. Following discussions with the Minister for Finance, the lower rate of VAT will be maintained during 2013.  This will allow businesses, tour operators and customers to plan for the 2013 season.  In addition, "The Gathering 2013" will take place next year —  a major tourism initiative with the target of bringing an extra 325,000 visitors here.2011 saw a welcome recovery in overseas visitor numbers with year-on-year growth of 6%. According to preliminary results from the Fáilte Ireland Hotel Survey, for the first nine months of 2011, hotel room occupancy rates improved compared to 2009 and 2010, up to 61% from 58%.  Furthermore, according to Hotels.com, Ireland continues to have the most competitively priced hotel beds in Western Europe.While there was a marginal decrease in overseas visits in the first three months of this year, I understand that industry and trade partners are positive about prospects for the year, with reports of advance bookings and inquiries being up on this time last year. Industry representative groups are hopeful we can achieve our target of a 4.5% increase in visitor numbers for the year.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	598	The Programme for Government includes a commitment that event tourism will be prioritised in order to continue to bring major events to Ireland. The hosting of major sports events can provide a great showcase for Ireland, drive international visitor numbers and the media coverage of sports tourism events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination.Fáilte Ireland continues to support the sports tourism sector and in 2012 the Volvo Ocean Race will return to Ireland with its finale in Galway, Dún Laoghaire will host the ISAF Youth World Sailing Championship, the Tall Ships and the Bavaria Motor Racing Exhibition event will be on in Dublin as well as the Navy-Notre Dame American Football game in the Aviva Stadium.I am supportive of the efforts of the State Tourism Agencies and the National Governing Bodies of Sport to attract international events, subject, of course, to an assessment of the costs/benefits involved in any State financial support.The tourism and sports agencies are represented on the London 2012 Coordinating Group which I am chairing and which is looking at opportunities for Ireland from the proximity of this year's Olympic and Paralympic Games in London.  As part of this, Tourism Ireland has been rolling out a busy programme of promotional activity to target a wide range of potential visitors in the run-up to and during the 2012 Games.  On the sporting side, athletes from thirteen countries will train at the National Aquatic Centre and a number of other Olympic related events are also taking place in Ireland before the Games.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	599	The Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) regulates airport charges levied at Dublin Airport. Charges at Cork and Shannon Airports are set by the relevant airport authority while charges at the regional airports, which are owned and operated independently, are a matter for each airport concerned.A study of 2010 airport charges by the Airports Council  International (ACI) found that Dublin Airport's charges remain competitive and were amongst the lowest of comparable metropolitan airports in Europe.The Government is committed to delivering an expansion of routes, airlines and passenger numbers through Irish airports and to this end has developed a comprehensive three-pronged strategy to encourage in-bound tourism. Included in this strategy is a new growth incentive scheme which has been introduced by the Dublin Airport Authority and which applies to the three airports under its remit. The scheme provides for a rebate on charges for airlines, depending on passenger growth at the airports in question. Last year under the growth incentive scheme, the DAA rebated €1.5m to 30 airlines that increased their passenger traffic in Dublin.

In that context, I recognise that sport and physical activity have significant potential to contribute to the development of a healthier society.  There are huge social and health benefits accruing from sport.  It can make a major contribution to some of our most pressing social and health issues, including suicide prevention, mental health issues and obesity.  Sport needs to be better recognised for the major role it plays in this regard.  There are major benefits not just for individuals but also for our health system in maintaining and increasing participation levels in sport.  The World Health Organisation acknowledges that increasing levels of participation in physical activity can significantly reduce the costs to society.  One of the goals of my Department is to contribute to a healthier and more active society by promoting sports participation.  I want to ensure all people are encouraged and given opportunities to participate in sport and enjoy all the benefits sport can bring through developing a healthy lifestyle.  In that context, the Irish Sports Council, which is funded by my Department, received an allocation of almost €44.5 million in 2012.  I am pleased to say that provisional 2011 figures in relation to the level of participation in sport are encouraging.  New research by the Irish Sports Council shows that the upward trends seen in participation levels in 2009, when 33.5% of the population participated regularly compared to 29.8% in 2003, are continuing and might if anything be accelerating.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-09 00:00:00	Prelude	602	The tourism and sports agencies are represented on the London 2012 co-ordinating group which I am chairing and which is looking at opportunities for Ireland from the proximity of this year's Olympic and Paralympic Games in London.  Tourism Ireland is the North-South body established under the Good Friday Agreement with responsibility for the overseas promotion of the entire island of Ireland as a tourist destination.  The organisation has been rolling out a busy programme of promotional activity to target a wide range of potential visitors around the world in the run-up to and during the 2012 Games.  This includes targeting corporate sponsors, promoting holiday package extensions to Ireland, targeting displaced Londoners and promoting golf and Ireland as the home of major champions.  On the sporting side, athletes from 13 countries will train at the National Aquatic Centre in the lead up to the London games, including the US synchronised swimming team, the South Korean national squad, the UK Paralympic swimming squad and swimmers from the Cayman Islands, Poland, Venezuela and Surinam.   A pre-Olympic water polo tournament taking place in the NAC in July will involve participation by Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Germany, Great Britain and current Olympic champions Hungary.  A number of other Olympic-related events are also taking place in Ireland before the Games.  In March this year, a men's hockey Olympic qualifying tournament was hosted at the National Hockey Stadium in UCD.  In July, the World Youth Sailing Championships will take place in Dún Laoghaire and Morton Athletics Stadium in Santry will host a pre-games international athletics event.

The 1916 Rising was an important event in our history and is of great interest both domestically and internationally.  In this context, I have asked Fáilte Ireland to carry out an assessment of the potential interest from domestic and international visitors in the 1916 Rising and the possibility of developing a walking trail focused around the sites connected with the week of the Rising.  I expect the assessment will be completed in the coming months.
