#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	2	On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and the House I express sympathy at the recent death of Mr. George E. Russell, or Ted Russell, as he was known, who died in Limerick at the advanced age of 92, having been in good health until recently. All Members will know of Ted Russell. While I did not know him, I knew of him. He was elected to the Seanad in 1969 from the industrial and commercial panel. He contested the Seanad election on the administrative panel in 1965. Ted was an Independent Deputy for Limerick East. He contested the Dáil election in that constituency as an Independent in 1967 and as a Fine Gael candidate in the subsequent elections in 1968 and 1973. Earlier in his political career he had been a Clann na Poblachta candidate in Limerick East in the general elections of 1948 and 1951 and a by-election in 1952.He had considerable experience of public life having served in Clann na Poblachta, Fine Gael and as an Independent, including a number of years here in Seanad Éireann, where I understand he was a fine contributor to debates. His death occurred after a short illness at the age of 92. He was a freeman of the city of Limerick and was a leading businessman and public figure for half a century. He was mayor of the city of Limerick five times, an Independent Member of Dáil Éireann for one term and a Member of Seanad Éireann from 1969 to 1977, which was a considerable spell to have served. I understand he was a prolific contributor to various debates.He died peacefully and is survived by his wife, Derry, and children, Mary, Margaret, George and Derry. To his wife and family, I offer the sympathies of this House, where he served for so many years with distinction.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	3	On behalf of my party, I express my sympathy to Ted Russell's wife, Derry, and his son and daughters. In my capacity as chairman of the Port of Waterford, I had the pleasure of knowing Ted Russell when he was chairman of Limerick Harbour Commissioners. He held that post for 26 years and was a member of that body for more than 40 years. As the Leader stated, he played a very active role in the business and commercial life of his native city of Limerick.Representing Fine Gael he was elected to Seanad Éireann on the industrial and commercial panel and served from 1969 to 1977. He was also an Independent Member of the Dáil and stood as a Clann na Poblachta candidate in two general elections and a by-election. He took great pride in being appointed a freeman of his native city of Limerick. He was chairman of the Silvermines Group and was involved in many other companies during his life. As a Limerick man he was very interested in rugby and was a member of the Bohemians rugby football club in Limerick in whose achievements he took great pride. He was also a great follower of Munster rugby throughout the years. He will be sadly missed by our party in Limerick, where was a stalwart for many years.To Ted's wife, Derry, and his family we extend our deep and sincere sympathy. He was quite well and active until a few weeks ago and, following a short illness, died peacefully.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	4	We on the Independent benches wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy and extend our condolences to the family of the late former Senator Russell. None of us, unfortunately, served with him. I met him on one occasion but his name was so synonymous with Limerick over the years that even people outside the city recognise it immediately. As we always say on these occasions, his level of service to the public displayed his obvious commitment. His search for a place in politics, moving from Clann na Poblachta to Fine Gael to Independent and back, demonstrates that he was a man who thought long and hard about where his place was. He made a great contribution, going from citizen to mayor to freeman of the city, an extraordinary achievement.He would have been more than disappointed had he seen the one-sided, biased and partial view of his native city that was presented on RTE on Monday night. People like Ted Russell struggled over the years to give a good impression of the city of Limerick. He helped to turn that city around, building new shopping areas and extending it to become a fine city of culture, concert halls and sport. He would have been taken aback by the image of the city broadcast on television on Monday.We extend our sympathies to his wife, children and extended family.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	5	When we lose a colleague from politics who has served so long and in such a colourful manner, someone we identified with Limerick, it is difficult to think of an appropriate phrase. At this time, we should pay tribute to Senator Russell and to the service performed by him and by people like him. He was a man who spent all of his life in politics, giving service to society and we pay tribute to that as much as to the individual. His family will miss him, his city will miss him and once again we pay tribute to a person who chose to plough the furrow of public service where there is inevitably more grief than gratitude. At least we can always recognise the qualities in our colleagues.On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to be associated with the tributes paid here this morning.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	6	On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to be associated with this tribute to the late Ted Russell and extend our sympathy to his family and friends in Limerick.It is common on these occasions to remark on the service of former Members but his is a remarkable record by any standards. Mr. Russell was a member of Limerick City Council for 37 years, served as mayor on five occasions and was a Member of both the Dáil and the Seanad. He was also a long-standing member of the chamber of commerce in the city and he was a director of many prominent companies. He was a central figure to the life of Limerick and surrounding areas.He was an accomplished rugby player and a member of Bohemians rugby club from the 1930s. He got a final Irish trial and played for Munster before the Second World War. If it had not been for the intervention of the war, he would probably have gone on to greater representative honours. He donated land at Barrington's pier for a public park. From speaking to people over the past days, I understand he did a lot of charitable work in the city, much of it not recognised publicly but of benefit to people with very little.For all of those reasons we should mark his passing and extend our sympathies to his family.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	7	As a fellow Limerick man, I too want to join in the tributes. Mr. Russell's service to Limerick as a politician, employer and sportsman was second to none. Limerick docks are dedicated to Mr. Russell to mark his 26 year service to Limerick Harbour Commissioners. During his tenure as mayor in the 1950s he played a key role in re-activating the drive to establish a university in Limerick. As a businessman he oversaw the development of significant businesses such as the Silvermines Group, National Food Ingredients and Dan O'Connor Limited, a livestock feed supplier. Having been a dairy farmer myself, I was one of his valued customers.In recognition of the contribution he made to Limerick, he was made a freeman of the city, an honour he deserved. He had many and varied interests. He served as chairman of the Irish Cancer Society, he had a lifelong association with Bohemians rugby club, played for Munster and was capped for Ireland. He was captain of Bohemians rugby team in the 1936-7 season. He was a director and president of the chamber of commerce and was deeply involved in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.I had the pleasure of meeting Senator Russell often. I always looked forward to meeting him and chatting about politics or business life in the city. His company was first class. His family will mourn and Limerick will feel his loss.To his wife, Derry, and children, Mary, Margaret, George and Derry, I offer my sincerest sympathy on their sad loss.Members rose.

#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Yesterday in the other House, the Taoiseach responded to questions from Deputy Kenny on the case of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. In his reply, the Taoiseach indicated that the murderers of Detective Garda McCabe would be subject to early release. This statement has caused shock. The people in Adare were robbers and it is worth bearing in mind that the IRA and Sinn Féin stated at the time that they were not part of the patriotic movement, although they later admitted they were.The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform called to Mrs. McCabe and stated in writing that these people would not be eligible for the early release programme under the Good Friday Agreement or any other agreement. It has been postulated that this is a make or break issue for the talks at present but there is a perception that Sinn Féin is holding the Government to ransom on this issue. If words mean anything, this will be classified a monumental U-turn on the part of the Government.The GRA has stated today that there is a lack of honesty involved in this issue. In the context of what is happening in Northern Ireland I ask the Government to seriously consider this issue. It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to state, as he did yesterday, that he will have discussions with Mrs. McCabe and the representative bodies. It is a pity such discussions had not taken place before the Taoiseach made such a calculated statement in Leinster House yesterday. In that context, I am appalled, as are the people who have contacted me, at this decision of the Government.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I have great sympathy for the points raised. I have discussed this issue in the House before and said many times that we in the South also have to make our contribution and put up with the release of people we would prefer to remain incarcerated. I held that position strongly, so long as such people were part of the Good Friday Agreement. Then the people involved in this case went to court and as far as I can recall — I stand to be corrected — it was determined that they were not part of the Good Friday Agreement. A clear assurance was given by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that they would not be seen as part of the Good Friday Agreement and therefore would not qualify for early release on that basis.It now appears that there has been a new negotiation. I thoroughly object to that because it opens the floodgates. I defended the previous initiative, before the Supreme Court ruling that they did not qualify under the Good Friday Agreement but I considered that they would have to be released. However, since the Supreme Court ruling that is no longer the case. Assurances were given and the Government should not concede on this issue. It gives a bad impression and leaves the way open for this type of situation to be replicated in the future.On a different issue, I neglected to thank the Leader yesterday for arranging for the first time a debate on the budget in Government time. I very much appreciate it, as do other Members on this side of the House. It is good to get an opportunity to have our say on the budget so quickly. I would also like to thank Senator Leyden for getting funding for €500,000 for Donamon in his constituency in County Roscommon. Senator Ryan, who had distinguished and eminent connections with that same building years ago, may have had something to do with it as well. Perhaps, between the two of them, they managed to lobby successfully.I would imagine that the Labour Party feels a certain draught at the moment in that the socialist Taoiseach appears to be taking over its ground. We are quite confused on this side of the House. We do not know which way to look.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I do not propose to elaborate on my connection with Donamon but if any Member wants to buy me a pint later I will share the secret with him or her.I do not want to say much about Detective Garda McCabe. I simply want to quote, briefly, from a witness, as reported in  The Irish Times today: “They didn’t give them a chance, a caution or shag all. They started shooting into the Garda car through the windows, where the two plainclothes men were in the front seat.” In my political career I have been among the most vocal of those who have been critical of the Garda Síochána. In particular, I have often been critical of the Special Branch. However, it is an outrage that a political party in this State, as part of the condition for doing what it should have done years ago, would say to our Government, in effect: “We won’t observe the laws of democracy and give up our guns unless you release from prison people who were robbing a bank for personal gain, with whom we have denied all connection when it suited us.” I could be critical of the Government, but the fundamental question is about the nature of a political party, which is popular among our young people and which regards that as an acceptable demand to put to a sovereign government.I believe our sovereign Government is wrong and I could give out about it, but I will not do so. I am more concerned with the nature of a political party that thinks people who cold-bloodedly murder members of the Garda Síochána for personal gain, during a ceasefire, and with whom they originally denied all connection, should be classified somehow or other as among the heroes of Irish republicanism. I will never hand over — I hope Fianna Fáil never does either — the title of republican to the type of people who would do what I have just described. I am sorry that Fianna Fáil and the Government have been put in a position of having to make that compromise. I have nothing but contempt for a political party that has used its position to apparently extract such a concession from our Government.On other matters, as Senator O'Toole said, I gather that socialism, like Alice in Wonderland, is now whatever the Taoiseach calls it. It is somewhat akin to Louis XIV saying, "L’état, c’est moi”, socialism is also c’est moi now, so far as I can see.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	17	There was some controversy in the House about overseas development aid. We had a promise in 2000 that became a promise in 2002, which was withdrawn last week, to be replaced by a new promise to the effect that a revised target of 0.5% of GDP would be reached by 2007. It is now clear from the budget and from the Estimates for the future that this target will not be met. What is the real situation about promises such as this? Another one was made yesterday, that the super-rich who pay no tax had better watch out because next year the Taoiseach is coming to get them. Is this a real promise or is it like the one he made and broke twice to the poor of the world?
#MichaelBrennan	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I, too, spoke in this House on 20 October on the Detective Garda McCabe murder in Adare. We all appreciate the concerns and the matter of peace in our country. On that occasion I asked for clarification regarding a letter from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the previous Government to the McCabe family. As chairman of Limerick County Council I stood in Adare when many fine speeches and commitments were given as regards the killers of Detective Garda McCabe. While we deeply appreciate the peace initiatives and all the discussions that have taken place which have included so many people, it is hard to credit that there have been no talks with the McCabe family and Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan, despite the commitments that such discussions would take place.The commitment was given that the perpetrators did not qualify under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In that regard the peace of our country is a separate issue. I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to hold discussions with the McCabe family and Detective Garda O'Sullivan at this late stage before a decision is made and to take their views into consideration.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I support the calls from this side of the House asking the Taoiseach to immediately rethink his statements of yesterday. It is nothing short of revolting that we can see the Taoiseach saying nothing stands between a final settlement or none at all, apart from the question of the release of these murderers. He has also said that it is part of the package to restore powersharing in the North of Ireland. If we have to acknowledge those statements as the best that this Taoiseach can do for the family of Detective Garda McCabe and the Garda force throughout the land, especially given what it has been doing to protect ordinary citizens as well as themselves from murderers, we have reached a new low. It indicates that the desperation of the Taoiseach to get a settlement for his own ego is more important——

It was stated at the time by the then Government, and by the then Opposition which was ourselves, that those who committed the murder — nobody knew on the day who did it — would not be treated in the same way as other prisoners. That has happened. It is a nonsense to talk about early release. We are at least six years on. Everybody else from the Provisional IRA has been released and they have not.

If one accepts that membership of the IRA exonerates people of this crime, of what else does it exonerate them? Is it from activities that are not part of this organisation which most people did not support? It is time we had a debate on this issue. We are always told that intemperate language in the Seanad will cause problems and we have to be careful about what we say. I think we are too diffident. I would welcome the opportunity to say that somebody should have told Dr. Ian Paisley that he should be more circumspect. His recent statements indicate he may have talked himself out of an agreement. I do not believe that a proper relationship can start by the public humiliation of one party, however one may dislike that party.I seek a resumption of the debate on No. 15, statements on the Middle East. That would provide us with an opportunity and perhaps the Leader would be able to ask the Taoiseach how he feels about the praise publicly heaped upon him both last night in Trinity College and this morning on the airwaves by Senator John McCain for the support, assistance, help and co-operation given by this Government in the prosecution of the Gulf War. It is important to have this debate and we should have it continually. There was a Sherlock Holmes story in which they talked about the dog in the night.

It is the first budget in which there were no increases——
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	58	That is not in order on the Order of Business. The Senator congratulated the Minister last night in the debate and that is sufficient.

#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I support my colleague, Senator Finucane, on the issue of the McCabe murderers. In my political career to date I have never seen such an outpouring of horror and revulsion from members of the Garda community. The House will be aware I come from Templemore. They are aghast at this U-turn by the Taoiseach. Their families and the community in general are horrified. It is said that Senator Mansergh makes an attempt to minimise a dastardly act which was the cold-blooded murder of a member of the security forces of the State which uphold law and order. Like other speakers, I call on the Leader to make our feelings known to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform so that they will rethink this issue. This has nothing to do with the peace process. This was an act of cold-blooded murder. If we are to reach an agreement, sometimes we can go a step too far and to my way of thinking this is a step too far.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I too deplore murder wherever it takes place. I deeply sympathise with Mrs. McCabe. She should not have heard the news in the way she heard it on the public airwaves——
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Hear, hear.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	63	——but there may be reasons for that. I spoke about this before and people did not like it and they are not going to like it again. We are in severe danger of applying a different moral tariff to the murder of a policeman north of the Border and the murder of a policeman south of the Border. While I think of Mrs. McCabe I think also of the families of 307 members of the RUC who were murdered. They were not killed in glorious battle or shoot-outs. They were shot in the back, shot in front of their families, killed on their way back from the golf club, shot having a quiet drink in a pub. We want to think of those people too and they have paid a price. Senator Mansergh is right when he says there are things that have to be done. As Michael Longley said in his poem, Ceasefire:I get down on my knees and do what must be doneAnd kiss Achilles' hand, the killer of my son.It is hard, it is painful, it is terrible but I plead with Senators to think of those RUC widows and ask themselves what they would think if somehow their suffering was to be discounted because they lived on the wrong side of the Border or the wrong side of a struggle.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	64	After what Senator Maurice Hayes has said, everything has been said on this issue and it is time we stopped playing politics with it.I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on child care. I am aware it will not be possible to have such a debate before Christmas. It is an important issue which I raised in the context of the budget debate last night. The care and education of pre-school children is an urgent matter and I ask the Leader to arrange a debate as early as possible in the new year.

On the RTE programme entitled "Tale of Two Cities" which was shown recently, the man to whom tribute was paid today was a shining example of all that is good and predominant about the city of Limerick. We should not forget that the lawlessness which is highlighted is confined to 100 or 120 people. In view of the huge divergence between the State solicitor, Mr. Murray, and the views of the Minister for Defence, all sincerely held views on both sides, I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to this House to debate the growth of these criminal gangs.

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	73	——that we must make choices. I am confident that in next year's budget the cost of child care and the child care issue will be addressed as dramatically as the needs of people with disabilities. Senator O'Meara might not like to hear that.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Order, please. I call Senator Cummins.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I want to raise the issue of the Taoiseach's statement yesterday on the proposed release of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. I agree with Senator Brennan that the matter should have been handled in a different manner and his wife and family should have been consulted before any such statement was made. People quoted the previous Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Taoiseach. On 18 May, the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said he believed Mrs. McCabe should and would be in a position to trust the Government. Obviously that is water under the bridge. It is another broken commitment.While I respect the comments of Senator Hayes on the matter——
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I wish to point out that the only one who can reply to the Order of Business is the Leader of the House.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I will bow to that rule. On the comments of Senator Hayes, my party was always to the forefront in offering sympathy to the families of the policemen murdered in Northern Ireland, who came under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. The Taoiseach is on record saying that these murderers are not part of the Good Friday Agreement, which is why the distinction should be clarified.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I was surprised to hear Senator Leyden's congratulatory remarks.

I would like to point out that on the Order of Business Senators should not comment on contributions made by other Senators.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Yesterday was the day for giving, but from now until this time next year will be days of taking from the general public.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House for a debate on properly financing and resourcing local government. Budgets will be drawn up throughout the country over the next couple of months and many local authorities are starved of funding to deliver services to the public.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Order, please.

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I have never before spoken on Northern Ireland but I feel I must do so on this occasion. I am totally opposed to the possible release of the murderers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. The main difference is that this murder occurred during a so-called ceasefire. I recall Sinn Féin and Gerry Adams at the time distancing themselves from what happened and saying it had nothing to do with Sinn Féin-IRA. As usual, they backtracked subsequently and created a link. I am getting sick and tired of Sinn Féin adopting an à la carte approach to democracy. We have seen this recently in regard to associations by a certain Deputy in the other House where close associates of his were intercepted on the way to a proposed bank robbery. We cannot have this. In a democracy there is one law, one police force and one army, and there cannot be anything else.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I already ruled that there should not be statements on the Order of Business. Too many statements are being made today.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	89	It is time to have proper scrutiny. It is ironic that a certain Minister's personal life is being scrutinised while the national media did not pursue the IRA's association with a sitting Member of the other House, which is a dangerous precedent.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Acting Leader of the Opposition, Senator Finucane, raised the matter of the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and the Taoiseach's words in the other House yesterday. I note that he used the words "comprehensive settlement". I did not speak with the Taoiseach, but I know from his demeanour that it caused him great pain to say what he did. This is of no comfort to the widow of the murdered man and to Ben O'Sullivan. This is not something the Taoiseach entered into lightly or said off the top of his head. It was a deeply emotional moment for him and for everyone concerned. It is in the context of a "comprehensive settlement" that we echo the words of Senator Maurice Hayes. I understand the Acting Leader and many other Senators who raised the issue. It is one of significant poignancy and soul-searching for everyone involved.Senator O'Toole had great sympathy for the points raised. I thank him for the comment on the budget. One does not know where to look in the House to find a socialist. Perhaps one could look over here.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The PDs and the Labour Party might exchange places.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The Senator said something of great interest when commenting on the Detective Garda McCabe murder. He said that no party should ever hand over the title of republican to quasi-republicans. The Senator also asked for a debate on overseas development aid and condemned the fact that it will not be until next year's budget that the super-rich will be nabbed.Senator Brennan recounted his deep feelings regarding the murder of Detective Garda McCabe, particularly given that the Senator was chairman of Limerick County Council at the time it happened. Senator Ulick Burke asked what were the Taoiseach's priorities. I intend to speak to the Taoiseach today, if possible, to inform him of the views of this House. I accept the Senator withdrew what he said because everybody knows the Taoiseach's words were heartfelt but very difficult for him. Senator Mansergh stated that he, as do we all, abhors the murder of Detective Garda McCabe and the attempted murder of Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan. He stated that there are acts of completion in which we, in our various roles, have a part to play.Senator Norris asked for a debate on Northern Ireland. I will inquire. However, until there is an announcement or no announcement, or an announcement that there will be no announcement, we would not add to the fount of knowledge on the North. He referred to what the US Senator said in Trinity College. I too noted that.Senator Leyden raised the issue of the budget. As the Cathaoirleach said, the Senator had an opportunity to speak on it yesterday. He expressed his gratitude for the provision for the national centre for the Irish Wheelchair Association. Donamon is a very fine centre for wheelchair activity.Senator Coonan asked whether, regarding the murder of Detective Garda McCabe, I would make the views of the House known to Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I will do that. We are scheduled to have the Minister in attendance tomorrow, but I will try to see him before then. Senator Maurice Hayes stated that while he abhors and deplores murder, we cannot have a different moral standard in one part of the country than in another. We are all in agreement with that.Senator O'Meara asked for a debate on the care and education of pre-school children. That is a debate we must have, given that the report of the National Competitiveness Council states that children who benefit from pre-school care, be it Montessori or another, do better and do not drop out of school as much as others.Senator Hanafin agreed with Senator Maurice Hayes on the Detective Garda McCabe murder. Senator Coghlan asked that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be invited to the House to debate the issue of the increase in gangs of criminals on the streets.Senator White raised the issue of child care. She suggested that since the issue of disability was addressed this year the child care issue might be addressed next year.Senator Cummins also raised the issue of the Taoiseach's statement on the proposed release of the killers of Detective Garda McCabe and asked that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to discuss it. I found it difficult to hear what Senator Bannon said. He spoke on local government and the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House. Senator Browne also raised the issue of the murder of Detective Garda McCabe.
#MichaelBrennan	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	98	On a point of order, my request was that the Leader should request the Government to enter into discussions with the McCabe family and Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan before any decision is reached on the peace process and to take their views into consideration.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	99	That is noted.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I am pleased to have this opportunity to update the Seanad on developments in Aer Lingus. Before I outline the current position relating to Aer Lingus, let me refer briefly to past performance.Aer Lingus was for many years, and especially in its early days, the main provider of air access between Ireland and the rest of the world. It opened Ireland to the world and, through its efforts, it led the way in selling and promoting Ireland, making it the major tourism destination it is today. While that role is no longer exclusively filled by Aer Lingus, it is still a very important player in providing links to key destinations for business, tourism and trade. This is particularly so on the transatlantic routes. I understand that today there are more than 90 airlines providing services to Ireland. This clearly demonstrates the changes in the market over the years both in terms of overall capacity, range of services and the level of competition.Aer Lingus has survived a number of major crises in its history and has had a number of survival plans. All resulted in the airline surviving to fight another day, very narrowly in 2001 as the Leader of the House will vividly recall, and in 1981 and 1993 with help from the Exchequer. Survival was only possible through the combined efforts of board, management and staff.The history of Aer Lingus clearly demonstrates the massive challenges in the sector and the ongoing need to reposition and change in response to these changes. It is imperative that airlines try to anticipate and plan for those changes over which they have some element of control because, as has been clearly demonstrated, there will be many events impacting on performance such as terrorist attacks and global downturns over which airlines have no control.From an operational point of view, Aer Lingus has been performing well this year in a difficult climate for aviation. However, given that this is a sector where nothing can be taken for granted and a good year can quickly be followed by a disastrous one, it is vital that there is ongoing focus on ensuring the success of the airline.Globally, the aviation sector is in serious difficulty. Very few airlines are making profits. Aer Lingus is one of the few traditional airlines who will return a profit this year. The US industry is in turmoil with many of its largest airlines either bankrupt or close to it, despite significant Government assistance. In Europe, Olympic, Alitalia and Swiss Air are also in severe financial difficulty. Meanwhile, the competitive pressures grow with the ongoing growth of the low fares model and increasing oil prices. All this clearly demonstrates the myriad challenges facing airlines as they attempt to remain viable.Turning now to recent events, I want to refer to the resignation of the three senior managers in Aer Lingus — the chief executive, chief operations officer and chief financial officer — which will take effect from May 2005. I have already placed on record my thanks to the three executives, Mr. Walsh, Mr. Kearney and Mr. Dunne, for their work and commitment over the past three years in conjunction with the board and staff. That work has resulted in the profitable and successful airline we see today.Of course, the chairman and board of Aer Lingus are charged with ensuring the ongoing orderly management of the business and I have every confidence in them fulfilling this role, notwithstanding these resignations. Resignation of top management is nothing new in business, nor is it the first time this happened in Aer Lingus. Clearly, the board will ensure replacements for the top management team are recruited as quickly as possible. It would be preferable if such replacements could take office before next May.I met the acting chairman, Mr. John Sharman, on 18 November 2004 to discuss this matter and clarify the arrangements for the replacement of the three senior executives. In that context, the board of Aer Lingus at its meeting on Monday last, 29 November 2004, decided to commence the process of recruiting a new chief executive by establishing a sub-committee comprising the chairman and two other non-executive directors which is charged with identifying and recommending to the board the appointment of a replacement chief executive. In addition, all of the three resigning executives confirmed to the board their full commitment to working with the airline to ensure a smooth transition to their replacements.I make it clear on behalf of the Government that the recent developments will not deflect any of us from the necessary measures that need to be implemented in respect of Aer Lingus at both the operational and strategic levels. By the operational level, I mean that it will certainly be a matter for the board, management and trade unions to work through the implementation of the business plan by direct engagement with staff representatives and, where appropriate, with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery. It is therefore vital that the current engagement between management and staff continues to a successful conclusion.As I stated, it should be clear to all that in the airline business in particular, companies must be continually prepared to adapt to the rapid changes that are now a standard feature of the commercial aviation environment. Simply put, fares are continuing to fall in the aviation market and if the airline is to compete in this marketplace, its costs must also fall.This business plan, which covers the period 2004-07, was approved by the board of Aer Lingus last July. It is a growth plan and will deliver significant increases in passenger numbers based on average fares continuing to reduce year on year over the period of the plan. However, in order to support lower fares, it also involves a range of cost-cutting measures across the company including approximately 1,300 redundancies over the next three years. Approximately 1,600 staff have expressed interest in the scheme and I understand that, by the end of the year, approximately 500 will have left the company.Implementation of the plan is crucial so the airline can position itself to respond in a timely manner to changing marketing conditions and to take advantage of future growth opportunities so as to ensure its viability in the future. I understand that in addition to commencing the recruitment process for a new chief executive, the board reiterated the need for the complete and early implementation of the business plan to address competitive pressures and build on progress to date. In addition, it approved a challenging budget for 2005, consistent with the implementation of this plan.Turning to the strategic issues, I am determined to bring clarity as soon as possible on the key strategic issues which are unresolved at present. These are, essentially, the Government's perspective on the future ownership of the airline and the airline's ability to grow its services across the north Atlantic. This clarity is essential so that the airline has maximum freedom and flexibility to meet the challenges ahead and can grow and prosper into the future, thereby maximising its contribution to the economy. This can be done in terms of the sustainability of jobs in the airline itself and indirectly through the stimulation of the tourism and business sectors of the economy.It is important, therefore, that the Government clearly outlines its position on the future of Aer Lingus as soon as possible. In this regard, the House will be aware that my predecessor was in the process of finalising his position on the options for the future of the company when advised of a request by senior management in Aer Lingus last June for permission to develop an investment proposal for the company. Consent to that request was not given and the request was subsequently withdrawn on 4 October 2004.The Government subsequently established a Cabinet sub-committee to examine all the issues relating to the future of Aer Lingus and report back to Government as soon as possible. The Cabinet sub-committee decided that work on future options would continue with advisers, as necessary, and that the result of that work would be considered by the committee. Goldman Sachs was then engaged by my Department to provide advice and assistance regarding the future of Aer Lingus. This report, which was received on 6 October 2004, was considered by the Cabinet sub-committee at its meeting on 22 November following its review by relevant Ministers and Departments. It was recognised at that meeting that decisions on the future ownership should be made before Christmas in the interest of the airline and all its stakeholders. A further meeting of the committee will take place on 9 December 2004.Prior to any final Government decision, there will be engagement between the Department of Transport and the social partners on the future of the airline. The House will be aware that the Goldman Sachs report was published by my Department on Tuesday last, 23 November 2004, with copies of the report laid in the Oireachtas Library, as well as being made available on my Department's website.As those who have read the report will be aware, it summarises the global aviation market, the regulatory environment and Aer Lingus's history and current operation. It then moves on to Aer Lingus's funding requirement and capital structure. It identifies as a key issue the availability of capital in order to enable the airline to compete on an equal footing, pursue expansion plans and withstand external shocks. Moreover, Goldman Sachs stated that given the cyclical nature of the industry, access to equity capital is an important mitigant of financial risk. The report goes on to review the status quo, the implications of change with regard to strategic issues and the various ownership structure alternatives under complete or partial divestment.The issue of funding for future growth is a major factor for consideration in any decision on ownership. As stated, this is clear from the Goldman Sachs report. A major issue for any airline is the upgrading and replacement of aircraft. Aer Lingus is funding the upgrade of its short-haul fleet from within existing resources, but this is of course based on meeting performance and profit targets, as set out in the business plan. In addition, the airline is currently examining its long-haul fleet requirements and expects to complete a proposal in the coming months which will have to be approved by my Department and the Department of Finance. Pending the outcome, the company has confirmed to the Department that the airline will require equity funding to replace the existing long-haul fleet and to support future growth.I am aware of the arguments in the public arena in favour of the State investing in Aer Lingus and confusion over whether this would be allowed by the EU Commission. I want to clear up any misunderstanding on the subject. Under EU state aid rules, the Government could make a case under the market economy investor principle for an equity investment in Aer Lingus when the company is performing well and making profits. In all likelihood, however, there would be opposition from other airlines alleging state aid and a likely investigation by the European Commission before approval for such an investment would be forthcoming. On the other hand, the State cannot invest under EU state aid rules when the airline is in crisis, even if it was so disposed. Consideration of a State injection would have to take account of other competing demands such as in the areas of health, education and transport.It is undoubted that concerns exist in regard to strategic issues in the context of the State exiting from ownership of Aer Lingus. These concerns relate to issues such as the Aer Lingus brand, direct services to and from Ireland and the slots at Heathrow. I assure the House that all these issues will be addressed in the context of finalising the Government's position on the future ownership of Aer Lingus.I am also aware that increasing the commercial opportunities for Aer Lingus in terms of services between Ireland and the US is an important element in the overall strategic future for the airline. Aer Lingus has stated it could double traffic on US routes within a three to five-year period if the market is opened up. Currently, Aer Lingus can only operate scheduled services to five US points under the bilateral agreement, namely, New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Baltimore. This restriction, which has been in place for many years, is the response of the US authorities to the requirement in the bilateral agreement that all airlines serve Shannon as often as they serve Dublin.Addressing this issue involves making adjustments to the bilateral aviation agreement between Ireland and the US. In doing so, we must seek to secure the best outcome for Aer Lingus, our national tourism industry, Shannon Airport and the Shannon region. In particular I am conscious of the fact that the new board of Shannon Airport is now required to produce a business plan for the airport and that clarity on future transatlantic aviation policy would be very helpful to that business planning process. Expanding scheduled services across the Atlantic is of great importance to the growth of Irish airlines and Irish tourism, as well as for inward investment and trade generally.Negotiations between the EU and the US on an aviation agreement which would bring in open skies across the Atlantic are set to recommence early in the new year. However, it is by no means clear how long these multilateral negotiations will take. In these circumstances, officials from my Department will meet the US authorities in the coming weeks for exploratory discussions.My focus is on ensuring that Aer Lingus continues to have a viable future with the maximum number of sustainable jobs. It behoves all of us to work together to achieve this objective in this vulnerable and difficult global sector. The Government will endeavour to move forward in consultation with the social partners as soon as possible.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in bringing a speedy conclusion to the serious situation involving Aer Lingus. The Minister's speech can be summarised in his comments on two issues. He stated:A major issue for any airline is the upgrading and replacement of aircraft. Aer Lingus is funding the upgrade of its short-haul fleet, all from within existing resources, but this is of course based on meeting performance and profit targets as set out in the business plan. In addition, the airline is currently examining its long-haul fleet requirements and expects to complete a proposal in the coming months which will have to be approved by my Department and the Department of Finance. Pending the outcome, the company has confirmed to the Department that the airline will require equity funding to replace the existing long-haul fleet and to support future growth.The Minister went on to state:There is no doubt that there are concerns about strategic issues in the context of the State exiting from ownership of Aer Lingus. These concerns relate to issues such as the Aer Lingus brand, direct services to and from Ireland and the slots at Heathrow.The problems at Aer Lingus are summarised in those two paragraphs. However, the Government has caused many of the problems by its inactivity in this area and the future of Aer Lingus has been severely jeopardised by the Government's ineptitude and incompetence. I make no bones about laying the responsibility for endangering the future of Aer Lingus squarely at the door of the Government.Since this Government first took office in 1997 it has shifted from one position to another regarding Aer Lingus while steering clear of producing any viable proposals and development plans for the airline. All the current talk about the need for the Government to take a decision on whether the airline should be privatised is old hat. This has been announced at least three times since 2000 and nothing has happened.One can go back even further. I have a statement from the then Minister for Public Enterprise, now Leader of this House, Senator O'Rourke announcing in December 1999 that, "the Government has given approval for the flotation of shares in Aer Lingus". Even as recently as last year, the passing of the Aer Lingus Act 2003 provided for the private issuing of shares in the company in addition to allowing for workers to obtain 14.9% of shares in the airline once the company has moved towards privatisation. It would appear that the decision to privatise at least a portion of the airline has already been taken by the Government, yet in its now typical fashion it is creating the appearance of being proactive and seizing the initiative when in fact it is merely rehashing old announcements. The dithering of this Government over Aer Lingus has reached epidemic proportions.One of the worst outcomes of this inaction by the Government has been to lose our State airline its highly successful management team, headed by Mr. Willie Walsh. In co-operation with the staff and unions at Aer Lingus, the management team did a fantastic job in turning around the airline's fortunes from a company about to go under to an airline which is now one of the most successful carriers in Europe, the envy of many in the aviation sector.The management team worked tirelessly to achieve this feat. It is less than three years since Aer Lingus faced a debt of €150 million while today it is heading for a profit of over €100 million. This is an extraordinary achievement. However, it is clear that the management team got sick of requesting the Government to take a decision on the airline's future and became increasingly frustrated by the wall of silence it met from the coalition partners on every occasion. In the end, the Government's inaction appears to have become too much for the management team and eventually the members walked away. Their decision to leave is more than just about losing an excellent force for progress and change at the airline since the loss of the management team is estimated to have knocked up to €200 million off the value of the airline. That sum, money badly needed in other areas of Irish society, is lost to the ordinary taxpayers of this country.In addition to this significant loss in value to the airline it is likely that there will also be a long delay of up to two years in updating the airline. Time will be needed to acquire a new management team and allow it sufficient time to bed down before any outside investors would have confidence in the new management team and would be willing to invest in the airline. By driving out the successful management team, this Government has done what it had always intended to do, namely, to stall a decision on the future of Aer Lingus until after the next general election in 2007.The total funding required by the company is more than €1 billion. Even the Goldman Sachs report has pointed out that maintaining the status quo is not a viable option for the company. The extent of the finance required effectively rules out the possibility of the State providing it, particularly when one considers the need for increased investment in areas of greater priority such as our health and education services. Regardless of how greatly investment of this level would stretch Exchequer finances, I am far from convinced that the EU would even permit the State to invest in the company. We could still find ourselves coming under the scrutiny of EU competition rules, as is currently the case with the Italian state airline.The Goldman Sachs report, while setting out the range of options which could be availed of by the Government, and while not coming down conclusively in favour of any one option, appears to favour the IPO or initial public offering. Fine Gael supports such an option and will support a limited sell-off of the company to raise private funding for future growth, with the State retaining a significant stake in the company that would protect our national strategic interests yet remain attractive to outside investors. We remain confident that Ireland's strategic interests in terms of maintaining key routes into and out of Ireland, the transatlantic routes, the slots of Heathrow, the maintenance of key areas of importance to Ireland in terms of interconnectivity with the US and Europe, the needs of our business community and the continued success of our tourism sector can be retained. It is clear that mechanisms can be tied into any flotation, which will allow this to be the case. In addition, as the Goldman Sachs report notes, if the Government retains a shareholding of above 25%, the State can be assured of continuing to exert influence over the keeping to the fore of the national strategic interests.Time is of the essence if Aer Lingus is to retain its strategic and economic position of strength and if it is to continue to grow and expand. I call on the Government to fulfil its commitment and to announce a definite decision on Aer Lingus before Christmas, as promised. I hope the Minister will stick to the deadline he set in the past week or so. Once this decision is declared, the Government must move quickly to see it is carried through. If the Government fails to do this, its inaction will threaten the future of this company. This would not be acceptable to the travelling public or to the taxpayer.I was disappointed by the Taoiseach's comments about the chief executive, Mr. Walsh, and the management team of Aer Lingus to the effect that they were out to make a quick buck. I do not know how he could say that when he had not met or spoken to the management team of Aer Lingus. However, he used the privilege of the Dáil to say that this was all about the management team of Aer Lingus making a quick buck for itself.The management and the staff of Aer Lingus have done a wonderful job in turning the airline around. Each day we see airlines going under but Aer Lingus is a credit to the management and staff who have turned the company around. Costs have been cut and there have been redundancies but the airline has no other way to cut costs. For this company to survive, it must grow and expand and to do so, it needs an immediate input of cash, whether from the State or from a private source. That is of the essence.Mr. Walsh spoke about he would like to grow the transatlantic routes. It is very important for this country that there is competition on the transatlantic routes. I have no doubt if they were opened, they would bring a huge number of tourists from the United States. Considerable finance is required to do that, which is one of the problems. The chief executive of Aer Lingus, Mr. Walsh, recognises that but obviously his message did not get through to the Government. If it had got through, the Government would have acted sooner.This Government has dithered on the issue of Aer Lingus. I am very disappointed, as are the people in Aer Lingus, that the Government has not taken a decision on the future and stability of the airline. I call on the Minister to stick to the deadline he set. The airline is in crisis. It has no chairman, although it has a vice-chairman, and its management team has tendered its resignation. For investors to have confidence in a company, it needs a chairman and a management team. However, the Government has left the company without a chairman and with a management team which has tendered its resignation. It is now looking for investors. The position in which Aer Lingus finds itself is quite serious. The management and staff have played their part and it is now up to the Government to act. I call on the Minister to act with haste.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I welcome the Minister. It is tremendous that he is available to us at what is a very critical juncture in the life of Aer Lingus and that we have the opportunity to discuss the options and issues relevant to the company and to feed into the thought process of the Cabinet. From time to time, we are somewhat critical of Ministers for not listening to us enough and it is good the Minister is with us today.There is no doubt Aer Lingus is performing very well, despite Senator Paddy Burke's comments on the inaction of Government. As the Minister said, over the past three years, Aer Lingus has come back from the brink on a number of occasions. The most critical time Aer Lingus faced in its entire history was that following 11 September 2001. The actions of all concerned at the time to bring the company back to profitability were a true sign of the commitment of not only the management, the board and the workers, but of Government and of its policy to allow the management team to operate as it did in returning the company to profitability.The company has been doing particularly well. This year it will return a profit in excess of €90 million, which is exceptional when one considers that the aviation sector worldwide is in turmoil, as the Minister pointed out. Many of the major flag carriers and best known brands in the United States are operating under chapter 11. They are on the verge of bankruptcy and would be bankrupt were it not for the protection of the Government and the courts of the United States. It would be very wrong to castigate Aer Lingus and the Government for policies which have been pursued. In fact, the Government should be congratulated on the work it has done in this regard.It is important a review takes place on the future growth and development of Aer Lingus, on which the Minister is working. The business plan in place is aggressive in terms of its targets for the future. There is a requirement in regard to funding and the Minister has rightly taken a very cautious approach to making a decision. Senator Paddy Burke is right that it is important a decision is made but it is also important the right decision is made. The right decision cannot be based on a relatively quick analysis of the issues as there are some very strategic issues at hand about which the Minister has spoken. It is not only about looking at the asset value. A number of commentators over the past six to eight weeks made statements that the Government's inaction had written value off the airline. It is not about writing value off the airline, it is about protecting a strategic national asset.Aer Lingus is strategic for the most basic of reasons. This is an island nation and we need direct connections and access to markets for tourism, as the Minister said, for trade and for general business. That is critically important. It is a factor highlighted even more clearly by decisions taken by a previous Administration in regard to Irish Shipping. At present there is the potential for a crisis in the export of live cattle. It is a particularly difficult trade and later this month P & O Ferries will pull out of the Rosslare to Cherbourg route, making it virtually impossible to ship live cattle to the Continent. We can see the consequences of not having State involvement in shipping. It is abundantly clear from that example that there is a need for State control over Aer Lingus, particularly since so many other airlines are in financial trouble and there is a recognition worldwide that there will be some level of consolidation. If, at some stage in the future, Aer Lingus was totally privatised, none of us would want people in some boardroom in Chicago or Boston deciding it was no longer necessary to have direct flights to Ireland and that people should travel through London, Paris or wherever. For that reason, the strategic value of Aer Lingus is critical and should be maintained when the Government decides what the future ownership of the airline will be.The Goldman Sachs report set out a series of options and carries out a fairly decent analysis of the position of the airline sector and of Aer Lingus. From my reading of it, it did not seem to come down in favour of one option in a forceful way. It did not make it easy for the Minister or for the Cabinet sub-committee in terms of identifying one option. The critical option is for the State to retain an interest in the airline to protect a vital national interest. It will become an even more vital national interest if the expected consolidation in the aviation industry takes place. That will happen as sure as night follows day because no matter how much state support the American Government continues to give to its airlines, the crazy situation that exists cannot continue for very long and similar issues are arising for European airlines.At times, I have been critical of Aer Lingus and the way in which it has set about managing its business. To some extent it has neglected Shannon Airport, the mid-west and the entire western region by failing to recognise the existing key airport infrastructure. Ryanair has grasped that nettle and has shown tremendous vision and confidence in the region. That company has recognised that there is a capacity to use Shannon and the west generally as a low-fares base for bringing a large number of passengers from the UK and Europe to Ireland. That development is part of a tourism promotional programme. The importance of Ryanair in the market as a market maker has forced Aer Lingus to compete for business. Ryanair has sharpened the attitude of Aer Lingus by ensuring that it is competing to a best practice model throughout the world. Marketing Ireland is not the core work of Ryanair but the net result of increased competition in the domestic airline industry is that the level of tourism being generated for Ireland will increase dramatically. The kind of numbers Ryanair is projecting for the mid-west region as a result of the announcement of new routes on Monday this week will result in an additional 1 million passengers coming through Shannon in the next year. That figure will rise to 2 million within five years, which represents a tremendous increase in passengers compared to current figures.Shannon Airport's new board of directors must be congratulated on the work they have done in such a short period to encourage this new business. There is no exclusive deal with Ryanair; it is open to every airline, including Aer Lingus, that is prepared to make the commitment Ryanair has. I have been critical of Aer Lingus because deals like the one at Shannon could be availed of by Aer Lingus. In its past business plans, Aer Lingus set about halving its workers at Shannon Airport but there was absolutely no need for that. Ryanair is proving that the business is there so Aer Lingus will have to change its mindset which focuses on the east coast and the transatlantic routes.For far too long Aer Lingus has fished where the large concentration of business is, rather than doing what other airlines have done in trying to create and develop a market. Ryanair, easyJet and other low-cost carriers have proved that if one is serious about business, cutting costs and providing imaginative routes, the customers will follow. That is the kind of business Ireland needs. It is not just about keeping airports open but also about getting additional tourism. Ryanair is saying that 80% of passengers will be inward bound, which is of great importance for Ireland.Much has been said about the management's role in the survival of Aer Lingus, which is correct. There is no doubt about the tremendous work that has been carried out by Mr. Willie Walsh and his management team. It must be recognised, however, that the unions and staff generally have made a significant contribution to that survival plan not alone through accepting pay cuts, but also through changes in work practices. Many people might say it is their duty to do that but their efforts should be recognised along with their capacity to ensure the continued growth of the airline.I welcome the Minister's swift decision on the recruitment process. As soon as he realised the Aer Lingus management team was not for turning, he called in the acting chairman and insisted that the process should begin immediately. Some concern has been expressed, however, about the management team and the fact that they are continuing to run the company for the next six months. The Minister should consider appointing the acting chairman, or one of the directors of the board, to act in an executive role in the intervening period to protect the interests of the company. That is not to suggest that Mr. Walsh or his management team would in any way work against the company but it would give greater confidence if a member of the board sat in some kind of executive position as an acting chief executive officer until such time as a successor is found.Senator Paddy Burke said that Aer Lingus is rudderless at the moment but nothing could be further from the truth. The acting chairman is an exceptionally experienced individual in the aviation sector. He has tremendous knowledge and brings a great depth of international experience to the board at a time when international markets are critical to the future growth and development of Aer LingusThe Minister made some important points about the transatlantic business and the bilateral arrangement. There is considerable concern in Clare and the mid-west about the future of the bilateral arrangement. Most people accept that an open skies policy is coming but we are concerned about the rate of change. We have great confidence in the Minister and his negotiating team to put in place a package of measures to ensure the future growth and survival of the transatlantic business. That business is hugely important to the west of Ireland. Statistics show that where restrictions are removed, airlines that currently fly into a number of airports may ultimately re-route to one destination. I have more confidence than others, however, because County Clare, the mid-west and the west generally constitute a destination. Statistics from the US east coast show there is a critical demand for such services for eight to ten months per year. We are mainly concerned about the winter months. I hope that with some element of Aer Lingus being retained under State control, arrangements can be put in place to ensure we have direct access all year round. That is critical from the tourism viewpoint to some extent, but it is more critical for local business.Shannon has the biggest industrial park outside Dublin so it is crucial that business people who have invested there should have confidence that direct air connections to and from Shannon will continue. I have spoken about this matter to the Minister on a number of occasions and he is acutely aware of the issues involved. Hopefully a package of measures can be put in place in the short term on bilateral arrangements to allow Shannon Airport to move from being mainly a transatlantic destination. It now has the capacity to grow in other directions due to the European markets that are opening up through Ryanair and, hopefully, through other low-cost carriers, including Aer Lingus. An open skies arrangement will be foisted upon us at some stage through the negotiations between the US and the EU, but in return for the commitment of Aer Lingus, being controlled or owned to some extent by the Government, there should be an assurance that direct daily flights will continue to the mid-west region.The Shannon area comprises a tremendous piece of infrastructure for the aviation industry. Unfortunately, over the decades, roads in the region have suffered from a lack of investment by successive Governments. However, the construction of the Ennis bypass is a critical development in this regard. It is under way and is progressing well. Another key infrastructural element involves opening up access from Galway city to Shannon. The Minister is aware of the proposals for the N18 to ensure that Galway city is within one hour's journey of an international airport. Currently, people in Galway find it easier to travel to Dublin Airport than to Shannon Airport. That is a crazy situation when one considers we are trying to take pressure off the east coast. It is bad enough to have the M50 clogged up with people getting to or from work in Dublin or travelling to the airport, but people from the west and midlands should be facilitated to fly via Shannon Airport. If the N18 development can be opened up it would be very welcome.A rail spur would be another key infrastructural development of major benefit to Shannon's future growth. Proposals in this regard have been circulated to the Department which has asked Iarnród Éireann to examine the feasibility of such a project. We must be imaginative in this respect.Management at Ryanair recently announced that the airline envisages 2 million passengers travelling through Shannon within five years. Hopefully, other airlines will follow. In this context, the numbers already there are blown out the window. There is now a demand and a sustainable business case for a rail link to Shannon Airport. I thank the Minister for his efforts in meeting people from the region in his short time in the Department. This has been significant in bringing all players to the table and will ensure there is an effective outcome that keeps everybody on side.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I sometimes wonder whether Aer Lingus is in crisis. For a company that is earning more than €100 million per year and with prospective earnings of similar amounts next year, it is difficult to paint it as being in a critical situation. Financially, it is not in a critical situation. The crisis is of a different type, which could provoke a financial crisis quickly.I am not talking about the global aviation sector, to which several speakers have referred. I refer to the extraordinary propensity of employees, from top to bottom, to want to get out of Aer Lingus. Senator Dooley referred to the great strength, ability and talent of Mr. John Sharman, the acting chairman of Aer Lingus. Such a description is undoubtedly correct. However, Mr. Sharman does not want to stay in Aer Lingus. He wants out very quickly. Moreover, successive Ministers have been unable to find any suitable replacement for Mr. Sharman. According to reliable reports, Mr. Pat Molloy has turned down the post, as have Mr. Niall Fitzgerald and several others.The difficulty, therefore, is that there is a chairman who is very able but whose heart and soul is not in the job and who wishes to exit. It is also the case that at least 1,600 members of the workforce have expressed an interest in exiting. I am diluting the probable figure in this regard as far as I can. Likewise, the chief executive officer, chief operations officer and finance officer want to leave. Why do 1,600 members of the workforce and the three talented members of the top management want to go? Why does the chairman of a company that makes €100 million per annum want to go and nobody wishes to take his place?The three executives are tactful and do not wish to be undiplomatic because they will stay in their posts until May. They have a real commitment to the airline and will not do anything to damage it in that period. However, reading between the lines, it is obvious there is one obstacle to the progress of Aer Lingus. That obstacle is the State. This is the reason Mr. Walsh and his colleagues want to leave the airline. I find it difficult to listen to the great tributes paid to Mr. Walsh by those who have provoked his departure. We are good at this type of sentiment in Ireland. Such was evident yesterday in the Dáil where the greatest applause was reserved for the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. The loudest applause came from Members on the Fianna Fáil backbenches, the people who most wanted him out. Likewise, great plaudits are given to Mr. Walsh and his colleagues by those who have obstructed his path.The situation is difficult. We have three committed entrepreneurs who find the State an obstacle to their progress. They have made a significant amount of money and turned around the fortunes of Aer Lingus. However, they now find they will be unable to take the actions they wish in the future. Senator Dooley referred to the situation in Aer Lingus as State control while others have described it as political interference in the commercial process. The two are not compatible.What approach will we now take? The Minister claims he will make a decision by Christmas. I may be wrong but I feel confident in predicting what that decision will be. It was probably made a long time ago. The Government will decide to retain a majority stake in Aer Lingus but will seek external private investment. There is no mystery in the case. Such a decision has been inevitable for years. The Goldman Sachs report was published in October and it has taken two months for it to be properly considered. The report provided options and the Government will choose the option it was always going to take. It will try to find a chief executive officer who will accept those marching orders. That is a difficult position for any chief executive officer. It is a case of the State directing an entrepreneur from time to time to take actions in which commercial interests are not paramount. This is the reality.We must ask a question that has not been asked in this House but has been asked regularly elsewhere. Is the concept of a national airline still valid? A national airline is a sentimental and emotional concept that no longer has a place in the commercial world. I understand there is no national airline in the Unites States. I may be incorrect in this but I cannot think of one that qualifies as such. When one refers to a national airline, one is often thinking of a strategic airline. Those in favour of State control of the airline paint a subliminal picture whereby the loss of the national airline will cut us off from the world. There will no flights going out of Ireland for some reason, perhaps because of industrial troubles, a difficult management or bankruptcy of the airline. In this scenario, we will be marooned.We all know this is not going to happen. Other airlines will fly in and out. We will still be able to travel if Aer Lingus is removed from State ownership. We will not be stuck here together, unable to leave the country or transport goods, in some type of import-export paralysis. This is the nightmare scenario conjured by those who want a national airline to exist under State ownership for completely different reasons. State ownership is promoted because it suits politicians. It is a non-commercial decision. It serves politicians to use the State airline for local political purposes. Politicians play around with the situation of the State airports, the workforce in the airports and the airlines to protect constituency seats.What is happening at Aer Lingus is simple. The Taoiseach has got involved and is using the airline as a plaything. His purpose is to promote his new and successful agenda, the type of happy-clappy economics to which we have already referred in this House. The Taoiseach's only interest is to save the Fianna Fáil seats in north Dublin. He has established a Cabinet sub-committee, commissioned the Goldman Sachs report and taken various other initiatives. His sole objective, however, is to protect the seats of Deputies Wright, Glennon, Haughey and Callely. Any decisions regarding Aer Lingus will be based on the consideration of holding those Dáil seats in north Dublin. As a result, the commercial mandate given to people such as Mr. Willie Walsh is irrelevant.

We will have a chairman who is politically appointed and politically acceptable and who will put through the measures which a political party wants. We will have a chief executive who also fits that bill. Everyone knows the next chief executive will be politically approved and will be acceptable not to the board, which is also politically appointed, but to the Taoiseach. He must have the philosophy which will tie in with the current philosophy of Fianna Fáil. As a result, the commercial mandate of Aer Lingus will be diluted.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	113	When the news of the retirement of the three Aer Lingus executives broke, one would have thought only three people were working in Aer Lingus. It is all very well to say Mr. Walsh is a great entrepreneur, as Senator Ross has done, but Mr. Walsh received his training, career, future and everything he has from the public service. He has much to learn about the ethics of good governance. If he had acted as he did in a private sector company he would have been dismissed six months ago. Is it not appalling that the main stakeholder of a company — in this case the Taoiseach — should hear of a management buy-out proposal by his chief executive in the newspapers? This would not be accepted anywhere. Regulators would look very seriously at such a situation.It is unbelievable that the chief stakeholder should read in the newspapers of a huge redundancy plan which had not been discussed with the Minister or with the Taoiseach. The fact that the three executives announced their retirement in the newspapers before discussing it with their main stakeholders reflects badly on these three men. They might have great difficulty finding employment in the future if this is how they treat their board and their stakeholders. These are the realities of life. Such an operation would not be acceptable in a private company.The management team did a good job. However, they had the total support of their staff, the Government, the trade union movement and their board. This support was gained following tough negotiations but when given it was total. If one could not do a good job with that level of support one could never do a good job. What management team would have failed in such circumstances? The Minister's predecessors, including the Leader of the House, and previous governments have always been supportive of Aer Lingus.Seats in north Dublin will not be determined by the ownership of Aer Lingus but by its viability. The days of long principled arguments about whether an enterprise should be in private or public hands have gone. We want a good service where workers are treated well and the State also has its control.Icelandair is hoarding money at present and is looking for somewhere to spend it. The company has stakes in several FTSE 100 companies and more money than it can handle. Such an airline would look favourably at a possible investment in Aer Lingus. Iceland is a small country with much entrepreneurial zeal. I would not object if the Government attracts private investment in Aer Lingus. I am interested in the "hows" and not in "isms". The world has moved on from there.I was glad to hear the Minister deal with the question of the replacement of staff. I would also like to hear about the costing of fleet replacement. Like Senator Dooley, I welcomed what the Minister said about transatlantic routes. However, I would be happier to see Shannon opening links to western and eastern Europe. An open skies policy is dependent on the United States Government, which put billions of dollars into supporting its airlines in the last three years. The US Government is notoriously anti-competitive. It has not allowed Canadian airlines to have access to the United States and has brought down the shutters on the steel industry. No other large market in the world has such protectionism. The US Government cannot be trusted to do deals on an open skies policy. I would prefer to see us looking eastward and towards Europe.It is good that we have Aer Lingus and Ryanair. It should be noted that easyJet is opening new routes from Knock. In this regard I would like to know what deal Ryanair has done with Shannon. Can the Minister confirm that it would be utterly uncompetitive and against European regulation if a part of that deal prohibited easyJet for example, from getting a similar deal with Shannon?

We also need the easyJet service in Ireland.Aer Lingus is opening European routes on the basis of removing planes from UK routes. The company has a shortage of planes at present. Fleet replacement is crucially important and must happen. The pre-Christmas deadline is an important one and should be met.Every time Aer Lingus has been in trouble or needed support it has received it. As president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions I spent many hours negotiating with trade unions and with Government on this issue. I have never seen a time when trade unions, in particular, have not been prepared to take difficult decisions. Credit should be given to trade union leaders who, with great difficulty, convinced their members to accept hard deals. As many as six deals were signed in the past 15 years whereby workers accepted cutbacks, flexible work practices and competitiveness and productivity measures.I hope to see a bright future for Aer Lingus. The workers will give their total loyalty to the company, as they have always done. The three senior people who have walked away with six months' notice are not loyal to Aer Lingus. They were committed to creating a success, which is somewhat different from creating a success in Aer Lingus. They have not shown their commitment to the airline. They could not have walked away if they had put so much into it and cared so much for it.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I welcome the Minister to the House for this timely debate. It is timely because a decision must soon be made on where the Government stands on the issue.A comment recently made by Mr. Willie Walsh at the Joint Committee on Transport finds common sentiment with what the Minister said today. The Minister said the global aviation sector is in serious difficulty. That was Mr. Walsh's opening comment to the joint committee on 6 October last. While Aer Lingus itself may be doing very well, the aviation sector is not. If we look at North America we see the proof of that statement.The Progressive Democrats believe private equity should be brought into Aer Lingus and that the airline should be allowed seek that equity. This is not for any ideological reason but for strategic considerations. There was a time when the Government needed to become involved in setting up a national airline because others would not do so. There are now many investors who are willing to invest in airlines. They know how the business operates and they know, as Mr. Walsh and the Government have discovered, that it is brutally competitive. No shareholder involved in it can stand idly by or simply be a sleeping partner.The Government has been a sleeping partner for too long on this issue. We have looked at Aer Lingus in the past two years and felt it has been going very well. While some people believe the task is over, the task is only beginning, which signifies the differences in many of our contributions. While some people believe Aer Lingus has been saved already, it is necessary to continually work at it to ensure its success. To ensure its success, as with Ryanair, it needs a source of equity. In other words it needs money in the bank in the event of a downturn. No Government should give Aer Lingus money for such a purpose. Unlike other airlines, Ryanair has such money, which is why every few months it can forecast a bloodbath in the market safe in the knowledge that it will last longer than any other airline in such circumstances.Aer Lingus will have more flights through Cork Airport in 2004 than it had through Dublin Airport in 2001, which indicates the job it has done. As Willie Walsh has said, it also shows that Heathrow Airport is not as significant now as it was then because of the number of direct flights from Cork Airport to destinations other than Heathrow. This brings me around to the strategic value of the Heathrow slots. We believe the market will dictate the value of those slots. Those wanting to fly to Heathrow should recognise that a premium will apply and Aer Lingus should be able to charge for that. Passengers will pay one price for flying by Ryanair from Shannon to other regional airports and those wanting to fly to Heathrow should pay a different price, which is how the strategic value of the Heathrow slots will come into the equation.On the last occasion Willie Walsh appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport I asked him how long he would stay at Aer Lingus. I am not surprised that he departed given that Aer Lingus was crying out for a Government decision. He said he felt he had brought Aer Lingus as far as he could. That meeting only took place one month ago and while people's perceptions and perspectives may have changed in that time, Willie Walsh was getting no political support for the business plan he wanted implemented. Only 12 months ago the Labour Party representative on that committee, Deputy Shortall, asked Willie Walsh when he would have a recruitment drive given that Aer Lingus had been saved. His reply was that he would not be recruiting and would offer another model seeking additional redundancies.It is demonstrably clear that the old model under which Aer Lingus operated of a national airline to which some people wanted to cling is no longer feasible. Passengers now have a considerable choice of flights from this country and are more willing to fly mainly because of competition that has forced prices down, which is how it will continue. Reform of the aviation sector should not be couched in anti-worker terms. Many people automatically state the workforce must be protected and employment levels must be maintained. The first objective of any successful business is to create customers, from which employment can be created. It makes no sense to start the other way around which some people have effectively demanded. It cannot be a commercial success by starting with a pool of employment regardless of its market.While Aer Lingus has made huge savings in the past three years, only 20% of these savings came about as result of staff redundancies in that time with 80% coming from other efficiencies in the system. At a Progressive Democrats conference approximately two years ago, Willie Walsh said that Aer Lingus had ripped off its customers for decades because it could afford to do so owing to having no competition. I have asked the unions a simple question, but have been unable to get an answer. Now that Aer Lingus is operating with 3,000 fewer employees, what were those people doing?We cannot simply look at Aer Lingus from a north Dublin perspective and see it as an employment agency. It must be a service driven customer-focused supplier of aviation services. The management team must be allowed to let it be a commercially focused airline without one hand tied behind its back and Government looking to ensure it has a certain employment level. For too long some of our semi-State bodies have been over-manned and with the cold winds of competition those issues need to be addressed.The position of the Progressive Democrats is not one of ideology, rather we are pragmatic in determining the strategy we should adopt to ensure that Aer Lingus survives and is strengthened. It can only be strengthened if it has access to private capital. It should not need to go cap in hand to the Government and wait for a decision. Michael O'Leary certainly does not need to——

Ryanair does not need to wait long for a decision as to where it might invest as has been evidenced by its recent announcement with the authority at Shannon Airport. The unbundling of the airport authorities only took place three or four months ago against the wishes of many in this House. We have now seen what competition can do. Competition works and will ensure the survival of Shannon Airport. Competition will ensure that what Senator Dooley and other representatives from Clare want will happen. We will see a rail link and an improved road to Shannon Airport because the customers now exist and these facilities will need to be provided.

Aer Lingus will again need to refocus itself following this week's announcement. Nine additional flights out of Shannon will put further stress on Aer Lingus operating from Dublin. Such are the decisions the management team needs to confront on a daily basis. Until the Government makes a decision, management will be continually frustrated.The nature of the Government decision will define the types of candidates that will be attracted to replace the current management team. We will obviously have a different type of management team depending on whether it can, unhindered by requirements on employment levels, be a commercially focused airline or be required to work to the bidding of a Government, which can change from time to time and whose Ministers can also change. In a competitive sector where prices are coming down, costs must also come down. In such a situation, a Government by nature has a slower decision making process than a group of shareholders. That is the frustrating thing about Aer Lingus, it has gone so far but could go much further. I appeal to the Government and the Minister to ensure that the decision on attracting the right type of candidate to Aer Lingus is made before Christmas.The Goldman Sachs report listed options for how the Government should approach this issue. The report was based on the current management team being in place, a demonstration of how quickly things change in the sector. It even suggested that the current management team might be given a share incentive. Aer Lingus is already 15% privately owned by the workforce but people do not see that as privatisation. If 10% or 20% was floated for institutional investors or the public, it would be seen as privatisation. The only way the 15% currently privatised can grow is if the balance of Aer Lingus also grows. It cannot grow under the current model and, therefore, a decision is vital.The magazine Flight International last week contained an article on the departure of the Aer Lingus management trio. It stated that it has become clear that the trio’s future strategy was incompatible with the views of Ireland’s left-wing Government.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	123	We all agree there is a need for a decision. It is now five years since the Leader announced there would be an IPO of Aer Lingus, we have gone through a number of contortions since and we still do not have a final decision from the Government. All of us agree that the delay is damaging the company's market value and the morale of staff and management, who do not know where they or the company will be in a few years time.Senator Morrissey said that he and his party do not take an ideological approach, although it sounded ideological to me. I am not nervous about being described as having ideological views; I believe it is the role of the State to safeguard certain strategic interests of the State and its people. It is important that we define those strategic interests. I agree with the items mentioned by the Minister when he said that we have to look at connectivity, that we need as many direct flights to as many destinations as possible and serving as many destinations in Ireland as possible, something that is hugely important for business and tourism. We all agree on that. It is also important that we safeguard the Heathrow slots, although I agree with Senator Morrissey that it is less important than it once was.I do not know why the management team left. We can guess that a Government decision and the botched effort at the MBO had something to do with it. It is important that we get over this and put a new management team in place but we cannot do that until there is certainty about the future. The Goldman Sachs report clearly linked two issues — future capital requirements and ownership. That is fair. It is not so persuasive in suggesting that we need additional equity, that it should come from a private investor or that strategic interests can necessarily be guaranteed by retaining 25% or 25% plus one share of the company.The past two years were interesting. Previously, I was happy to allow the management of Aer Lingus to make commercial decisions based on the need to maintain connectivity. I was concerned, however, at the dumbing down of the company. Do we want Aer Lingus to be dumbed down? I am not sure we do. The brand commands a loyalty that is extremely unusual in this country, over and above any other State owned enterprise or private company. It evokes a certain pride and loyalty among Irish people that should not be easily discarded because it is of significant commercial value. That loyalty is likely to be diminished if Aer Lingus becomes another Ryanair. The reaction to the decision not to repatriate human remains a few months ago demonstrated it. People felt that it was an insensitive decision and that our national airline should do that sort of job. They also want courier, postal and cargo services to be maintained. There are some who feel there is a need to maintain business services too. Even issues such as the uniform have somehow taken on an almost symbolic importance which should not be disregarded.We have come to a stage where the low fare airlines, particularly Ryanair, co-exist with Aer Lingus, which is a lesser-frills airline. They do not compete to any great extent except to a few British airports, Paris and Brussels. They have developed niches in the market that satisfy most customers. The new management, however, has driven Aer Lingus into the same market as Ryanair, the low fares market, based on the assumption that customers are only interested in fares and getting from A to B as quickly as possible. That is not entirely the case. There are some customers who like frills such as designated seats and knowing their bags will get from A to B to C without having to pick them up themselves.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Passengers can never be sure of that.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	125	There are people who are prepared to pay for those frills. There are two distinct markets which are served adequately by Aer Lingus and Ryanair. I doubt there is room in this country for two directly competing low fare airlines that have no distinctions other than fare. That is what customers actually want, not that we would necessarily be any better off because of that.The issue of equity is very important. It was possible in 1992 and again in 2001 for Aer Lingus to get through its crises simply because people appreciated that is what they were. Demonstrably the airline was in serious financial difficulty on both occasions and could conceivably have closed.The problem now is there is not a general acceptance within Aer Lingus that a crisis exists. The workers do not actually see the company is in crisis and who can blame them? The airline has been quite profitable over the past three years and has made a profit every year since 1992, apart from 2001. The need for the dumbing down, redundancies and all of the various changes argued for by management is not clear and neither is the need for equity into the future. The case for this, as I understand it, has been made on three grounds. The first is that the long-haul fleet needs to be replaced. Even if it does need to be replaced, everyone accepts that this will not need to happen until 2008 to 2010 at the earliest. It is dependent, in any event, on a change in the bilateral arrangement with the United States. The immediate need, therefore, for money for fleet replacement is not clear. It is being spoken of as an obvious necessity, but it is not all that obvious.As I understand it the short-haul fleet, as per the report, is on average just three years old. The peer review highlighted in the report suggests that in fact it is newer than virtually any other fleet owned by the major airlines in Europe. There is no need to replace that in the near future, although it could perhaps be added to. In terms of aeroplanes, therefore, the equity need is not clear-cut. There are basically two capital structure models in play. One is the low fares model, where the requirement appears to be cash rich and perhaps more flexible in terms of responding to crises, different markets, etc. The other is the more traditional model. It is pointed out that if the  status quo is opted for and the traditional model for capital structure retained, Aer Lingus will surely have a debt in ten years time, but at a lower gearing level relative to other comparable European national airlines or former national airlines.The most persuasive reason suggested for equity being required is to confront the possibility of future financial crises. I do not have a crystal ball and cannot say there will be a financial crisis in the next ten years, but one cannot say there will not be either. On balance, I accept there is likely to be a requirement for equity. However, there is not a crisis here. It is not a need that screams out from the paper and is interesting that even Goldman Sachs accepts this is basically the case. If we accept, for the sake of argument, that there is a need for equity, there are a number of different ways it can be done. The one that gives me most concern, to which I am absolutely opposed, is essentially the sale of Aer Lingus to a competitor. If, for the sake of argument, we were to sell Aer Lingus to British Airways, I would bet any money that within ten years the number of directors in Dublin, Cork or Shannon will be greatly reduced and we will find ourselves being routed through some hub in the UK, whether Manchester, Prestwick, Heathrow or whatever. That certainly is not in our interests. A direct sale to a competitor should be excluded absolutely from the start.A second option, mentioned by Senators Ross and Morrissey, is to basically sell either a majority or minority by placing equity with a private investor. That would bring tensions to bear in terms of the role and the mandate of the company, with which I am uncomfortable. The company would have difficulty in working with such an arrangement as well, I believe. On the one hand are private investors, who might very well want to get out within a relatively short period of time, seeking to maximise their profit and wanting perhaps to strip assets out of the company. On the other hand there is the State, obviously seeking to maintain the country's strategic interests. I am not sure whether those two competing aims can sit comfortably side by side in a company for long. Goldman Sachs seems to anticipate that. If that were to happen, then the State should really only divest itself of part of the company, with a view to getting rid of the rest in good time.The third option is an IPO. I presume this was the one favoured by the Leader when she made that announcement a few years ago. On the face of it, to opt for a partial IPO has certain attractions if it were possible to attract a reasonably varied level of investment so that one does not end up with one particular company. One needs to have a number of investors, whether institutional, private or individuals. If it were possible to get that type of share ownership of a minority shareholding, I would not have any ideological problem. I have no real confidence, however, that it is. Senator Morrissey expressed confidence to the effect that if Aer Lingus were floated there would be no shortage of takers. I am not entirely sure that is so. The airline business is going through a difficult time and a pretty favourable coincidence is needed of good stock market conditions and timing in terms of global aviation, specifically as regards Aer Lingus. I am not sure we have reached that point currently.While I do not have a problem, in principle, with the notion of an IPO of a minority shareholding, there are real practical difficulties involved. This is something that should be approached with serious caution. This has been a useful debate. The Minister of State undertook in his contribution, earlier, that there would be "engagement", his word, between the Department of Transport and the social partners on the future of the airline, following the meeting on 9 December at which I assume the sub-committee will make some type of recommendation. I hope this will be meaningful engagement. It is important that the workforce, which has given so much over the past ten years, is brought into discussions in a serious way. While none of us wants to see a decision delayed for much longer, it is nonetheless important that there should be some type of meaningful consultation with the partners in Aer Lingus before the decision is taken or announced. I will leave it at that. I hope the Department makes the right decision, but for goodness sake, let it make a decision of some kind.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I want to ask the Leader and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Ahern, whom I welcome to the House, to bring to the attention of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources the need to ensure that the national broadcaster, RTE, will improve the quantity and quality of the subtitling service it provides on television programmes. Everybody in the House is aware of people, whether family members, neighbours or members of the community, who suffer from loss of hearing. The provision of subtitling allows such people a better quality of life and access to television programmes they can understand.I refer in particular to subtitling on current affairs and news programmes. I concede of course that news coverage and live broadcasts can be more difficult to rectify. However, the quality of subtitling on news programmes in particular is entirely inadequate. Presumably it is a question of resources, as regards provision of a better service. Given that RTE is the national broadcaster, however, in receipt of State funding via the licensing system, we should ask it to take on board the need to improve the subtitling of news and current affairs programmes. It would make a significant difference to the lives of many people and enable them to understand the content of programmes more readily. At present the subtitling on news bulletins is often 20 or 30 seconds out of synchronisation and that needs to be improved. I would be pleased if this matter were brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.

I welcome also his officials.Aer Lingus is an important Irish asset and a most important symbol for this country. Since 1936 Aer Lingus has served us well. As an island nation we need first-class air communications. People trust their national carriers all over the world and we are no different in Ireland. We cannot, however, be complacent. Aer Lingus must have a sound financial footing and be profitable. Great work has been done to turn the company around from being a financial basket case into a sound profitable company. Under the stewardship of Willie Walsh, Aer Lingus——

#DiarmuidWilson	unknown-#DiarmuidWilson-party	unknown-#DiarmuidWilson-dob	unknown-#DiarmuidWilson-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	132	That is understandable. Under the stewardship of the chief executive officer, Aer Lingus embarked on a radical restructuring of the company and the board, management, staff and unions at the airline should be complimented by all of us on the manner in which they have addressed the problems. Aer Lingus is expanding its role across Europe and has returned healthy profits in recent years. From being on the brink of bankruptcy in late 2001 when the company registered a loss of €52.1 million it had an operating profit of €63.8 million in 2002 and a profit of €78.5 million in 2003. As my colleague, Senator Dooley, said earlier, it is well on target to make a profit of €90 million this year. That is against the backdrop of the war in Iraq, the SARS scare and other difficulties. It is, therefore, good news for the company.The airline operates 42 routes as it did originally. A further nine routes have been established this year which must be welcomed by all of us. Senator Dooley outlined a concern that Aer Lingus may be bought by one of the larger airlines if floated. His fear that four or five of the bigger airline companies could act as a cartel is justified. It is conceivable that we in Ireland could end up with no direct access to North America and may have to fly to London or Paris to join a connecting flight. That is a genuine fear.In his contribution Senator Ross suggested that Aer Lingus is a company in crisis. I do not agree with him. As I have pointed out to him it is financially sound and viable. He said the acting chairman did not want to stay with the company. I do not believe that is correct. He said the Government was having a difficulty in appointing a chairman. I do not believe that is correct. He said 1,600 people would lose their jobs. That is incorrect. A voluntary redundancy package is on offer and is over-subscribed. He said the resignation of the chief executive officer and his two colleagues was a disaster. However, in this contribution the Minister stated:I make it clear on behalf of the Government that the recent developments will not deflect any of us from the necessary measures that need to be implemented in respect of Aer Lingus at both the operational and strategic levels. By the operational level, I mean that it will certainly be a matter for the board, management and trade unions to work through the implementation of the business plan by direct engagement with staff representatives and, where appropriate, with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery.He said the resignation of the chief executive officer and his colleagues is not unusual in any company. It is not unusual for Aer Lingus, it has happened before and, possibly, it will happen again. The main issue here is that Aer Lingus needs finance which it will have to get either from the private sector or the Government. The best place to get it is from the private sector but the Government should hold a major share in the company.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I thank Senator Wilson for affording me a brief opportunity to contribute to the debate. I welcome the Minister and thank him for the comprehensive statement he has made to the House which sets out the scene clearly. It is difficult to discuss in such a short time the future of Aer Lingus especially in the encircling gloom of the aviation business. While a decision before Christmas would be welcome I recommend strongly the Government takes some time because one cannot decide the future of Aer Lingus in isolation from some of the other issues. One cannot decide the future strategy for Aer Lingus in the absence of decisions on the open skies issue, which will be discussed in the new year, and in the absence of a clear indication as to how the new airport authorities and their costs will be managed during the next few years.While some Members have called for an early decision from the Cabinet sub-committee on the future strategy, ownership, direction and fly path of Aer Lingus, all of which are important, it is equally important to keep in mind that one cannot decide the future of the airline and its strategic way forward in isolation from some of the other issues. It needs further time to make the right decisions and it is important to take that time. I would not like to be in a situation where a decision had to be made before the end of the year.The Cathaoirleach is fully aware, as I am, of the involvement we have had in the mid-west with Aer Lingus in the past. I wish to put on record our appreciation of all the various managers and those involved with the company, including those who left recently. The airline has always been bigger than the staff involved. The whole effort is a combined one where all the workers from the ground handling staff in the various airports to the top management have had an important role to play and, in the main, are responsible for the success of the airline. This was at a time when many airlines in the United States and Europe, such as Italia, which I knew in my dealings with Shannon over 30 years, had severe financial difficulties.Not only does the success and future development of Aer Lingus have implications for management and staff but it has implications for other airport staff. Any change in the number of flights would have a drastic impact on staff of the airport authorities and the various people who provide services. In making a decision on the airline, one is not only making a decision for the staff, management and passengers of Aer Lingus but also for many others providing services, such as the airport authorities.The Government should take some time to consider the options fully. There is a general feeling that there is a public service element attached to the national carrier that must be protected. If such an element is to be attached to Aer Lingus in the future the public must pay for it. I have no hesitation in saying, and the Minister alluded to this in his contribution, the Government could invest in Aer Lingus. It should be possible in any new arrangement with Aer Lingus to maintain the public service element. The Government should be prepared to protect this interest without breaching EU regulations.I am pleased to have had an opportunity to contribute to the debate. I hope the Government will make a firm decision but I am not sure it should make a speedy decision. It should make a decision when it is fully au fait with the position regarding the future of the airline, in particular, the future of the bilateral arrangements.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I wish to share my time with Senator Quinn.First, I ask the Minister to make a clear decision on Aer Lingus and aviation policy. His predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, showed a sense of dynamism in trying to get movement in certain areas, including the new terminal at Dublin Airport. Anyone who goes on a continental holiday during the summer will witness absolute chaos at the airport. Ministers may be used to by-passing the normal terminal but, given the congestion that exists, the Minister should stop dithering and make a decision on the issue for the benefit of consumers who use Dublin Airport. Many proposals have been put forward because the debate has been going on for two years. The Minister should make a quick decision on the matter.It is not so long since we debated in this House the break up of Aer Rianta. If Shannon continued as it was, it would not be a viable entity. The new airport authority stated that it must encourage a low cost model in order to make Shannon sustainable. It is worth bearing in mind that Shannon is losing approximately €5 million a year. When the Minister was dismantling the different airport authorities, he stated that only voluntary redundancies would be involved. Shannon has been identified as having approximately 470 staff and 100 seasonal workers. The new airport authority will have to grapple with this issue because not only is it important for airlines such as Ryanair and other low cost airlines who may use Shannon in the future, it is important for the Shannon entity to be a viable proposition. The resources within Shannon must be examined.The recent decision by Ryanair to create 14 new routes and operate to different holiday destinations, and to have four aircraft based at Shannon, is extremely important. It is not just important for Shannon but for the west of Ireland, south of Ireland and the mid-west. It could be the gateway for tremendous tourism potential for these areas, which is why it was an important decision.The Minister might have a discussion with the National Roads Authority  vis-à-vis the Limerick-Galway route from Ennis to Galway. This is a deplorable road on a national primary route. Even though we are progressing, we need other components to fit into the jigsaw. It is important to have a decent road infrastructure. If we harness the potential of Shannon and attract low cost carriers, the beneficiaries will be the tourism outlets throughout the region. The road from Ennis to Galway is very important. The Ennis bypass is currently going ahead and I hope it is completed without delay.Aer Lingus has been debated at length and it is important for the Government to make a decision and remove the uncertainty that exists. I will not elaborate on the virtues of the chief executives and so on because I heard other speakers make contributions in that regard. It must be said that the current financial status of Aer Lingus is very credible but it does not mean that people can sit on their laurels. We must examine the future of Shannon and what happens in regard to the bilateral agreement.Senator O'Toole asked if the EU could examine whether Ryanair received a more favourable concession. Shannon Airport Authority made it quite clear that if other users come in the same financial arrangements will be made available to them. There is no problem in regard to the European Union. I decided to use most of my time to talk about Shannon because what has happened there is very beneficial. I welcome the direction the airport is taking.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I thank Senator Finucane for sharing his time with me. I congratulate the Government on publishing the Goldman Sachs report. However, I would like to focus on what the report does not contain. It does not contain any discussion on the merits or demerits of the State putting more equity capital into Aer Lingus. It does not refer to that matter because it was excluded specifically from its terms of reference. The report takes as its starting point the assumption that this is a closed issue because the State has already decided it will not invest more capital in Aer Lingus. The consultants worked on that basis but we should not consider it a closed issue, particularly in view of the report's conclusions. The question of the State investing more equity capital should be re-opened.This is an interesting report which considers the various options open to the Government in seeking new investors. It is clear that just one of the options is a runner on the basis that the State is excluded from investing money, namely, the sale of part of the Government's stake in the company through a flotation on the stock market. The report knocks on the head comprehensively any other approach. However, it makes it clear that the sale of a stake in the airline must be part of raising fresh capital for the company's expansion, which is interesting. In other words, the Government must be prepared to put whatever it gets from a sale back into the company, not into the national pensions reserve fund as happened with Eircom.The Goldman Sachs report pours cold water on the prospects of the Government being able to run the airline in the strategic interests of the country when the State is reduced to a level of 25%. I know 25% is not necessarily the correct figure, but if the State holds on to some stake in the airline, it opens up the prospect of the Heathrow slots being sold off or put to more profitable use than bringing people to Ireland. It also opens up the possibility that a future investor-owned airline would use its aircraft for routes that were more profitable than ones linking Ireland to its main tourism and commercial interests. It comes down to a single option — they did not have a choice — which is not particularly attractive and will be difficult to carry off with success, namely, the flotation.This brings me back to my original point that this issue cannot be properly considered if we exclude any possibility of the State investing more equity in the airline. Coming from my background, I tend to oppose the idea of the State running commercial businesses. I am even more against the idea of turning over essential parts of the national infrastructure to purely profit-driven businesses and enterprises, as we did so disastrously in the case of Eircom, which was a misjudgment. If we can spend many millions of euro building a road network throughout the country, is it all that mad to consider a few hundred million euro on building a transport network that will guarantee our links with the outside world?I found it difficult to come to this conclusion. When I started with the Goldman Sachs report, I started from a similar viewpoint to Senator Morrissey, which believes the State should not be involved in running businesses. I had the experience in the past of being chairman of An Post. I came to the conclusion at the time that the State must be involved in certain businesses. I do not think we have a choice in the case of Aer Lingus between a low cost airline or a different kind of airline. We have a choice between a low cost airline or no airline. When it comes to making a decision, it will be in management's hands, but directed by a Government stakeholder. I suggest that, if necessary, we go back to Goldman Sachs and include the option which was excluded in the first instance.We must re-examine this aspect because it is a worthwhile proposal. We are at a crossroads and a number of Senators spoke about the urgency of making a decision. We began from the wrong premise. We should re-examine this decision-making aspect but not exclude the possibility to which I referred. This may be an exception to what I as a business person would normally say. I know our colleagues and partners in Government would say that this is something in which the State should not be involved but the issue should be re-examined.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I thank the Minister for coming to the House and his officials with whom I worked closely in the past. As the Minister will know, he is very well served.This has been an interesting debate and people have not been afraid to state their points of view. Senator O'Toole said we did not give credit to the unions. I constantly spoke about the role of the unions in saving the airline whenever the opportunity presented itself, and I know the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, feels the same.There is no crisis now that compares to the crisis of September 2001 after the fateful events in New York. Aer Lingus was already on the decline, but when that happened the sky fell in for aviation. First, nobody wanted to travel. Second, there were concurrent difficulties because of the approach taken by Madam de Palacia who was Transport Commissioner at the time. I am sure the Minister has seen the files. We continually begged to be allowed to provide funding and came back with our tail between our legs. It seemed very odd that while other national airlines throughout Europe were somehow miraculously able to get permission to fund — maybe they dressed the issue up a bit — the Commissioner said "No" to Ireland far more often than former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ever did. The result was that we were faced with an airline that had no money, aviation in decline and the horror of September 2001. However, everybody pulled together and that is a lesson that should be learned.That was entirely different from the oil crisis of the early 1990s when a very fine chairman, Mr. Cahill, since deceased, pulled the airline around. On this occasion the chairman had taken up the position only three weeks earlier and found himself in the middle of a maelstrom. However, he worked amazingly hard. The three Aer Lingus executives who are retiring have given great service to the airline. They are very clever people and have worked very well with the airline. However, the Government has nothing to do with the appointment of CEOs or ancillary staff in management. That is the duty of the board and of the chairman.That brings me to my next point. I am sure the current chairman is an excellent person. However, a working chairman is necessary. Decisions must be made by the board and the chairman. I agree with Senator Quinn, but I would like to see a timetable for the commissioning of new planes. I was on a new Aer Lingus plane recently. It had all new shiny leather and so on and was built by Shorts. There should be a timetable of when the real money will be needed. If it is for planes, and we believe it is, the Government should consider an equity injection to achieve that.

Former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, once said that the advent of air transport was the single most liberating factor vis-à-vis Ireland in the 20th century. We are talking about elements of a vital strategic interest, although we might feel nostalgic for the old-style Aer Lingus in the same way as we feel nostalgic for Bewley’s. A series of crises was overcome and great tribute is due to the Leader who, as Minister, steered Aer Lingus through one of the most difficult crises of all in 2001 against the hostility of Commissioner de Palacio.There are three strategic interests we must protect. One is the retention of the Heathrow slots. The second is the international links. The third is the maintenance of adequate traffic through Shannon Airport for both industrial and tourism reasons.I remember, as would the Leader — I was an adviser at the time — a memorandum to Government in the late 1980s, when things were very tight, which nonetheless sought investment in Aer Lingus to buy planes for specific purposes. It was approved.This should not be approached in an ideological manner. We are talking about a vital strategic interest. The State should be free to invest in it, not to rescue or subsidise a lame duck but to keep a vital and important concern going. We should not approach this with ideological blinkers. If we are able to invest in buses and trains, we should also be able to invest in aircraft. I was very impressed by a representative in the House who comes very much from the free market viewpoint also expressing that point of view.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I thank all Senators in the House for the discussion this morning and for their very measured and well thought out contributions regarding all of the issues surrounding Aer Lingus and aviation in general. Aer Lingus is not in crisis at present. The difficulty is that the aviation industry globally is in serious crisis. The evidence of that is apparent, whether one looks to the US airlines which fly the north Atlantic, all of which are in very serious difficulties, or to airlines in other parts of the globe which are also in enormous difficulty. We are very mindful of that.The Government is very seriously and heavily engaged on this process. I assure the House that no discussion in which I have been involved has been driven by ideology. There is only one issue, that is the best interests of Aer Lingus and its staff and employees in developing a growing airline into the future. This is what this debate is about.I want to make two points in order that the House may understand this issue. Aer Lingus has achieved a tremendous turnaround since 2001, from losses of €140 million in that year to where it stands today with a profit of €90 million plus. However, the profit of €90 million plus is a bit dazzling. The net profit of Aer Lingus this year will be approximately €5 million. That must be understood. Nevertheless, I congratulate everybody involved in a tremendous achievement. Aer Lingus is far and away the best performing traditional national airline in the European sphere of operations today. It is clear that many other airlines will not exist in 12 months' time, never mind beyond that. It is a fragile market and within that market the issue is the ability of Aer Lingus not just to develop but to grow into the future.There is a very cogent, cohesive and important context regarding Shannon. Everybody understands the issues there. There was very good news this week. There will be more good news on Shannon because it is beginning to focus on the future, not the past, which is very important. I take on board the points made by my colleagues regarding the infrastructure deficit that must be addressed if we want to develop Shannon Airport, for example, the Galway connectivity to Shannon and passengers' accessibility not just to the European routes but to the transatlantic routes as well. No airline, and nobody in the aviation business, has said to me at any stage that there is a doubt over the demand for a sizeable Shannon market into the United States, and they see the potential for growth, new opportunities, new airports and new destinations.Nobody questions the necessity for investment in the airline. However, it is important to make the point — Senator O'Rourke as a former Minister with responsibility for this area will be very aware of it — that, while it is very important, the issue is not merely about putting equity into Aer Lingus today but about the ability of Aer Lingus to react in a cyclical market. Aer Lingus and everybody else knows that, given the cyclical nature of the market, there will be downturns as well as upturns. The State's input in the medium term will be very limited, no matter what choices it makes today.I stated in my earlier contribution that if the State were to invest funding or to decide to do this, it is inevitable the matter would go to the European Commission, and possibly the European Court, due to objections of many other airlines, of which some 90 fly into this country, a figure many forget. The issue concerns access to markets and the flexibility this brings with it because, inevitably, in a crisis, and there will be crises in this business, the State does not have options, whereas, with equity available there would be options for planning a better way forward. It would also mean that when finance was needed, one would have access to it.We must not think only of the present but must give this airline all the opportunities it requires. Strategic issues are clearly involved and have been discussed in this debate. That these issues form the backdrop to the decision-making process is crucially important. I do not agree with the school of thought that suggests Aer Lingus should be sold off as one would sell off an asset or bauble. I have no interest in such a foolish move because the State has strategic interests in the airline. However, these strategic interests must be balanced with interests in regard to tourism, trade and growth, our island nation status and the huge potential growth of the north Atlantic routes for the company. This also applies to other airlines but we want to give Aer Lingus the best opportunity to be the number one airline on those routes, as well as looking towards Europe, the east and Far East.Our airports and Aer Lingus have huge potential for the future and this is why the Government is so engaged at present in trying to have these decisions made and bring clarity to the process. We do not want to seem as if we are being rushed to make the decisions, but there is a sense that all sides need clarity. I thank my colleagues in Government for giving so much time to this issue and I assure all sides that the issue is not being jumped about. Time and thought has been given to this because we must make good decisions for the future.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Power, to the House and I thank the Leader for raising this matter again. It is important that Members are given an opportunity to put down markers and state their position with regard to the important report on alcohol which we had before us some time ago.I will speak in general about the problems associated with young people and alcohol. The issue may be highlighted as a result of Members speaking on it and some young people who are becoming deeply involved in the consumption of alcohol might think again and take a different view. Sometimes, when one wears a Pioneer pin and speaks about alcohol reports or about alcohol in general, there can be a tendency to simply see it as just another member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association speaking out.I will make a few points about the report and will appeal to people in general, as well as publicans. I am concerned with the manner in which young people can purchase alcohol in public houses. One appreciates the excellent job being done by some publicans in ensuring that only people entitled to purchase and consume alcohol actually do so. In support of publicans I must point out that at least the purchasing and consumption of alcohol in public houses is controlled to the point that people see what is happening and publicans have the opportunity to refuse alcohol to people whom they believe have already consumed alcohol to excess.One of the problems in this area relates to off-licences. Regularly at weekends and at particular times of celebration, whether it be the winning of matches or competitions, or the conclusion of exams, the alcohol consumption pattern leaves a lot to be desired. We must tighten the rules and regulations for off-licences. Recently I read that there will be further off-licence sales, with young and not so young people being able to purchase alcohol at filling stations. That is fine if the filling stations properly control such sales, but any premises moving into the off-licence business should do so only if permission has been secured to sell alcohol. The general public should be afforded the opportunity to object to a licence at a location such as a filling station. I do not agree with such licences being granted.Many problem drinkers are young people who are then led on to use drugs. We are aware of the drugs problem in this country. Licensed premises are doing well and expanding, often in close proximity to third level education centres. In any town where there are third level institutions one can see highly organised and extended public houses which afford opportunities for drinking to people who in many cases should be studying instead of being in such premises, consuming alcohol. Such situations lead to drug abuse and to people dropping out of their centres of education.Previous speakers mentioned alcohol abuse with regard to hospitals and accident and emergency departments. There are problems in accident and emergency departments most nights and not merely at weekends where people are unable to get beds. Half the beds are taken by people unable to stand, but many of them can walk out when they sober up the next day, having created pandemonium and problems for the hard working hospital staff. Those who work in accident and emergency departments face such problems, particularly at weekends, and they are pleading for something to be done. The public is asking why such people should not have to pay. People getting drunk and causing problems in accident and emergency departments should have to pay, whether they are on unemployment benefit or otherwise. The cost should be deducted from their payments, if necessary. I guarantee that would substantially reduce the numbers attending accident and emergency departments due to drink-related problems.Many young people have lost their lives because of alcohol which, in some cases, is mixed with drugs. Some have committed suicide while others have been involved in accidents which should not have happened. Many families have been left brokenhearted by the loss of a dear one.We have a responsibility to ensure young people have something to do other than go to a public house. There are schools and community colleges all over the country with well developed facilities such as gyms, yet they are closed at 5 p.m. Young people, who are walking the streets, should be given the opportunity to take part in sports or whatever activity in those gyms so that they stay out of pubs. I compliment the many people who give their time, whether to hurling, football, soccer, rugby or whatever, to ensure young people have an opportunity to play those games, to keep themselves fit, out of trouble and out of pubs.Parents have a major responsibility in regard to alcohol consumption among young people. They should know exactly where their children are and if they are in public houses when they should not be. In many cases, parents have not shouldered this major responsibility.Alcohol-related problems occur on our streets. The late opening hours of chippers and the like have caused major problems. There is the major problem of people going to work in the morning who are probably unable to do the work they should do. Many of them drive to work while under the influence of alcohol. Gardaí have much to do in that regard.We must recognise the outstanding work done by many organisations to try to get young people to take part in sports and stay away from alcohol. This is a subject close to my heart and it annoys and worries me to see so many young people consuming alcohol. From a financial and a health point of view, they would be better off if they decided not to drink. I have been able to enjoy myself without consuming alcohol and so could many of those people who create major problems in the home, for themselves and for their families by consuming alcohol. I have no problem with people taking a drink but the problem is over-consumption of alcohol.I wish the Minister of State well in his Department. I hope the contributions made by Senators on the last occasion and today will influence the Government in taking necessary steps to ensure there is a better environment for our young people.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. As it is coming up to Christmas, this is a timely opportunity for us to highlight the problems caused by alcohol which will probably be exacerbated in the next couple of weeks and perhaps into the new year. I welcome the report of the strategic task force on alcohol and the many fine recommendations therein. I find it difficult to see how implementation of any of those recommendations can be accelerated as alcohol-related problems cover so many areas of responsibility, including the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Arts, Sport and Tourism and many other interest groups. A Department or a Minister should take responsibility for this issue and co-ordinate a plan because the situation is impossible.The vested interests in the drinks industry are pulling in opposite directions. Many of us have come to accept that the vintners will call us in to tell us of the problems being caused by certain Departments and Ministers and of the dangers to them and their livelihoods as a result of new legislation restricting their activities.Work done by the Garda is the only tangible evidence that anything has been done in a co-ordinated way to rectify the problems caused by alcohol. We must all acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the Garda to alleviate or reduce the problems caused by alcohol. Apart from the initiatives on speeding and so on, I am sure there will be an announcement on drink driving within the next few days, which will be welcome. However, I have spoken to gardaí who find it frustrating that having arrested a person for being incapable of driving or for behaving in a certain manner and having done their work in an excellent manner, that person goes free on a technicality.Three weeks ago, a person was brought before the court for drink driving and was banned from driving but the ban was deferred for three months following an intercession by this person's legal team. The next day that person got drunk, was in charge of a car and killed an innocent man who was a husband and father, who had worked hard all his life. It must be very frustrating for the gardaí who made the initial contact and had to walk out of court that day realising that this person was, and still is, on the road. In all probability he will drink to excess again. Something must be done in such a situation. The day after the accident causing the death of another, this man should have been put off the road but it is not possible because he is innocent until proven guilty in another court. Something is wrong when he is allowed to go back on the road.The statistics prove that this country is one of the highest consumers of alcohol in Europe. This report identifies one factor causing a decrease in alcohol consumption in the past 12 months, namely, the increase in excise, tariffs and taxes in the 2003 budget. It is ironic that although Departments have different areas of responsibility, the Minister for Finance was probably aware yesterday of this finding but imposed no increase in duty on alcohol, which is recognised as contributing to a reduction in overall alcohol consumption.Many organisations have done great work in this area, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous whose members have identified the folly of their ways. This organisation has contributed significantly to the recovery of many people. Its groups meet every week and support people trying to abstain from alcohol. It is time to recognise the work of Alcoholics Anonymous and, perhaps, the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. They meet in halls and other venues such as the community centres mentioned by Senator Moylan.Many voluntary organisations have costly overheads for insurance, lighting, heating and other such expenses. There is no recognition or compensation for that expense. Some Government agency or Department should support genuine effort when it is seen to be made. This may not always take the form of financial support, it could be the availability of trained personnel to talk to young people outside school hours. There are pressures in school, such as peer pressure which is very serious in the context of alcohol consumption.As Senator Moylan said, very young people are on the streets at all hours which is the responsibility of us all as parents. Very few families have not been touched by the disastrous effects of drink, whether within the immediate or the extended group. That is a widespread national phenomenon which affects urban and rural areas. Some or all Departments need to recognise that while they can act tangibly on the issue they cannot do so in a determined, focused way. Someone must take absolute control of the problem and tackle it quickly.We must comply with the demands of tourists. Not so long ago we debated in this House the importance of allowing families to be in public houses until 10 p.m., when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform extended the time limit. When he introduced the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 he suggested an extra hour which, perhaps, was reasonable. Then people said the pubs, the focus of social activity in rural areas, towns and so on, would close.We responded to pressure from the vintners and the industry in general which, in some ways, was a shame. We are concerned to attract visitors from other parts of Europe and elsewhere but we have a culture of excessive drinking and must take responsibility for anything that leads to a continuation or expansion of that culture. We must draw a line, stand by it and accept our responsibilities in other ways.When we consider a lack of revenue in certain areas we must look at the other side of the problem and see the cost of drunkenness to the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the courts and the Garda, and look for some balance. Some responsible Minister and Department should be able to take up this point and lead with it.I hope that everyone in the country will support gardaí when they are out and about intensively campaigning against drink driving. People should not see it as a nuisance but acknowledge that gardaí are protecting them. Otherwise if they are driving and meet a drunken driver they are likely to be mowed down. Everyone must be seen to support gardaí in their efforts. It is important that the Minister makes a public announcement that he intends to provide whatever financial or manpower resources are needed to enable gardaí to do that work for as long as they think necessary from now until after Christmas, to take the scourge of drunken drivers off the roads. Perhaps young people will realise then that they cannot go down the road that so many of us have taken in the past.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this issue. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his appointment. I read the report which contains some startling figures regarding the ages of children who are drinking and the numbers of those under the age of 15 who drink regularly. One wonders where they get this drink. In defence of publicans who are generally demonised, many of those I know, some of whom are my friends, are responsible, hard-working people operating in a highly-regulated business environment. They have families and understand the problems connected with young people. They work extremely hard, seven days a week, 363 days a year to provide for their families, to educate them and so on. As in every walk of life there are rogues too and those caught making drink available to people who are under age should be dealt with severely because this causes a serious problem.The report also indicates that young adolescents are accessing alcohol in their family homes. This is where parental control becomes an issue. We all imagine our children are angels and will not indulge in certain behaviours. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. Parents should be made more aware of the dangers of having alcohol easily available in their homes. Such is the situation in my home and I am sure it is the case for most people. It is an issue we must consider.The drinks industry also made a submission to the task force and I agree with only some elements of that submission. Its contention that increases in taxation are not a deterrent is correct. We have reached the point where there is sufficient taxation on alcohol. It has been evident through the years that price is not a deterrent. If people want alcohol, they will manage to obtain it regardless of price.I disagree with the industry's submission that the blood alcohol level for motorists should be changed. It is a simple reality that one should not drive if one has had an alcoholic drink. This is the approach taken by 90% of people and we must continue to encourage that attitude.I welcome that the drinks industry has given a commitment in the report to support an advertising campaign to illustrate the dangers of alcohol and encourage people to abstain from its consumption. We should ensure the industry stands by that commitment.Garages as well as off-licences can now sell alcohol. Most of these sales are conducted using computerised tills and the bar code of the product is scanned. A system could be easily introduced whereby these sales are recorded. In this way, when a young person is found to have consumed alcohol, it should be possible to discover where the alcohol was purchased. This is an issue that must be examined. A friend of mine who owns a supermarket that operates an off-licence service was recently the object of a complaint by a parent whose 16 year old child had become drunk on alcohol purchased from that outlet. After checking with staff, the owner discovered that an 18 year old had purchased the alcohol and sold it to some under age acquaintances at a profit. This is what is happening and is the root of much of the problem. The actions of that 18 year old constitute a serious offence, regardless of whether he had gifted rather than sold the alcohol, and should be recognised as such.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to the House. I am glad to speak on an issue which I asked the Leader to put down for discussion. I have had meetings with a number of groups involved in this area, many of which I am sure the Minister of State has also met. One such meeting consisted of a long and detailed briefing from Ms Sinéad Shannon, policy officer for Alcohol Action Ireland, who informed me of the policies and objectives of that group. The first step in tackling this issue is to recognise that the work done by organisations such as Alcohol Action Ireland is deeply unpopular and unattractive to politicians. We talk the talk but are often not of a mind to make the changes that will impact on the issue.The problem is that changing our approach to alcohol is a quality of life and public health issue. I am beginning to change my attitude entirely on this issue. I have expressed the view many times in this House that there should be no licensing hours. I contended that if there are no limits on alcohol consumption, people will eventually grow up and take a mature view of the world. I accept I was wrong in this regard. The introduction of more flexible and liberal licensing hours has led to a significant increase in alcohol consumption. Simultaneous to the changes in the licensing laws was a major increase in the country's wealth and this may have also had an effect on drinking behaviour. However, my initial contention, which I articulated many times in this Houses, that removing the madness of early closing times and so on would lead to a more mature and gradualist approach to alcohol has not been borne out by subsequent developments.I have been examining material produced by Alcohol Action Ireland which reveals some significant findings. This is thoroughly researched material that will stand the test of scrutiny. It highlights the need for a proper implementation of the laws on drunkenness, an issue we can all recognise. I heard recently of the case of a young man from a reasonably well-off family who appeared in court after engaging in despicable and disgraceful behaviour while in a drunken state. Over the years, we have tended to ignore such behaviour. Gardaí often merely advised perpetrators to sober up and go home. It is years since we have heard of people being arrested for drunkenness. Such arrests happened long ago, perhaps on fair days. More recently, we have taken the view that gardaí have more important work to do and that such arrests would be a waste of their time.However, we are now encountering situations where people, including some from well-off families, find themselves in court answering charges of drunkenness and drunken behaviour. To have such behaviour described in the cold light of day in a courtroom with members of the media present is a necessary shock to the system that brings people to attention. There has been a change of attitude in regard to drunkenness. There was a time when it was macho for young people to prove they could hold their drink by not acting in a drunken fashion. The objective was to be able to take as many drinks as a seasoned, older drinker without appearing drunk. Without generalising too much, this has changed to a significant extent. In many cases, the objective for young drinkers is to get drunk as quickly as possible.The volume of drink that is consumed is amazing. Most of us have been students and I was no different from anybody else in my behaviour at that time of my life. We drank as much as we could afford, which was never enough to get one into the state induced by the current practice of downing 14 vodka shots before commencing the serious drinking. Our objectives must change to reflect these new realities. In terms of cultural attitudes, society must confront this issue and decide that drunkenness is unacceptable. It must be the norm that not only drink driving but drunkenness itself is societally unacceptable. This is not something the community wants to see and is not something about which one should boast. This is what we need to do and it will only happen through the application of the laws on drunkenness.Another issue that has had a marked effect on alcohol consumption is the availability of alcohol. Reduced availability, a reduction in opening hours, a restriction in locations from which alcohol can be purchased and the implementation of the age limit are all issues covered by law, which must be implemented. This will have an effect in reducing intake and I would welcome such a development. Above all, there must be a move to encourage people to discuss the problem as a public health and quality of life issue. As a society, we must determine that drunkennessis an unacceptable behaviour in "politesociety".I disagree with Senator Scanlon when he says price increases do not make a difference. They do. Alcohol Action Ireland has shown me figures which are available to all of us. In the 2001 budget, excise duty on cider was increased. As a consequence, excise receipts went up and sales went down. In the 2002 budget, excise duty on spirits was increased. Similarly, sales of spirits went down. There is a direct connection between the cost and consumption of alcohol. We are becoming more price sensitive and people are more aware of the importance of keeping prices under control. There is no better way to discourage the consumption of alcohol than to increase its price. It is the easiest way and it does work. I ask the Minister of State to keep that in mind.I do not understand why the Minister for Finance, in yesterday's budget statement, made a concession to micro breweries. I do not understand the need for this measure and I was not aware of a demand for it. Who gains by it? Perhaps the Minister of State can enlighten the House. I do not present this as a major issue but it sends out a questionable message.I have dealt with the issue of supply. The supply of drink can be affected by restricting access to drink, by limiting the hours or locations of drinking, by imposing age restrictions or by increasing price. What I must say now saddens me because it undermines the case I have been making for ten years. I have always thought that education could lead to reduced demand. I firmly believe that the only way to deal with abuse of drugs, drink or such substances is not to reduce the supply, because people will always get them eventually if they wish, but to reduce demand for them. I would have thought that education on the dangers of alcohol and on its proper use would be helpful but I cannot find a single piece of research to support my view. Can the Minister of State's Department look at ways of reducing the demand for drink? How can one stop people wanting a drink? We do not want to do that. We merely want to stop people wanting too much drink. If education is not working at the school level perhaps we need to attempt it at a societal or adult level.I urge the Minister of State to consider the advice of groups such as Alcohol Action Ireland and to try out its proposals. The research and experience of Alcohol Action Ireland throughout the world may work here. Some of the solutions are politically unattractive. There are no votes in putting up the price of the pint. However, with public acceptability and awareness of the dangers of over-drinking we could take the appropriate decisions. If that means taking unpopular decisions then that is what we must do. Meanwhile, I ask the Minister of State to give his best support, including budgetary supports, to groups working in this area. Some of these groups are working on a shoestring and they need financial support.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am delighted to contribute to this debate.I was shocked by the report of the strategic task force on alcohol. We are now the second highest country in Europe in terms of alcohol consumption. The report categorises the different styles of drinking. There are binge drinkers, those who drink until they cannot take any more and then there are simple heavy drinkers. I did not know such categorisation existed until I read this report. Our lifestyle has changed in the past decade and this is the outcome of that change. I welcome this report. It will make us think seriously about where we go from here.A section of the report deals with children and the drinking patterns of children aged between 15 and 18. It is shocking to think that children as young as 12 have no difficulty gaining access to all sorts of alcohol. This is a terrible indictment of our way of life.The report states that the number of outlets selling alcohol is increasing. I had thought it was difficult to get a licence to sell drink. It now appears that once an off-licence has been given, the licence holder does not need a certificate. The question of the availability of alcohol must be revisited. Outlets for the sale of alcohol must be scrutinised. At many new garages one can buy a bottle of wine with one's petrol. I do not like that way of life. Young people are being given considerable access to alcohol. We should not allow such a way of life to take root.Young people appear to have no shortage of money to spend on alcohol. Where do they get the money? We all know how much it costs for an evening out. How can young people from the age of 12 get money to buy drink? Many questions must be asked.The effect of alcohol on health is visible everywhere. We see it on the streets, in the workplace, in institutions and in accident and emergency units. The knock-on effect of alcohol is seen in real ill-health such as thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Alcohol also affects performance at work.Where do we go from here? Alcohol abuse has become a community and societal problem. The schools have failed. I say this although I am a teacher. Schools try to implement alcohol education programmes. These programmes work while the children are in school but once they leave the school environment their effectiveness ceases. We must devise a community policy which takes parents into account. Attitudes and values are vital. If a child's attitude is affected early in his or her home life a different style of life will take root. The community must take up this challenge.We have laws in this area, including the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. We have banned happy hours and children under 18 are not allowed in licensed premises after 9 p.m. However, they do not seem to have worked and awful tragedies continue to happen on the roads. Every day we see newspaper reports of accidents that occurred between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. involving young people and drink driving.We need to consider new options to prevent harm. How can we protect our children? How can we bring in a public health spirit? How can we create awareness? How can we link with the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science to bring about change? These are questions we must put again. Parents, the community and the Garda all need to do their bit. I recall the awful nightclub tragedy last year. The behaviour of the young men outside that nightclub says it all. Something has gone very wrong in our society when people, who should know better, cannot be responsible for their behaviour at a certain point in the night.We must ask how we can change attitudes. Teachers and parents in conjunction with the community and local gardaí need to be vigilant every night to see how best we can bring about a change in society to ensure that everybody has a safe journey on the roads this Christmas. Everybody is now taking their lives in their hands when getting onto their cars to drive for a long journey. Even the best driver in the world could come across a young drunk person driving at excessive speed. If we can bring about such a change we will make inroads into the problem. We must return to the traditional way that worked in the past with parents taking control of their young children to inculcate in them a value system that shows respect for themselves, their neighbours and the community. We must start with the parents, some of whom are here today listening to this debate. If we can get this right, we do not need laws, which only go so far. The parents can be the law.Local authorities have by-laws covering drinking in open spaces of which there is insufficient awareness. The parents of a young person drinking in an open space should be given a substantial on-the-spot fine within an hour of the incident. If it is not done in that way it will not penetrate into the system. How many people know about the report of the strategic task force on alcohol? If I were not a Member of the Seanad, I would not have known and I doubt if anybody else would have known about it. We need to start a major awareness programme among interested parties advising of the need for a change in society to bring about a different style of life and protect our values so that we can tell the world at large that we no longer have the highest consumption of alcohol in the world. We need to be able to show that we know how to respect ourselves, our families and our way of life. We must return to the traditional way of handling this problem by encouraging a community spirit. If we do this we have some hope of curbing the problem and bringing about a new way of life.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I welcome the Minister of State. I suggest to Senator Ormonde that the way to create awareness of the guidelines from the report on the strategic task force on alcohol is to implement them as Government policy. Perhaps she might get the opportunity to raise this matter at her next parliamentary party meeting. Two years ago an interim report made many of the same kinds of suggestions. These reports are excellent and comprehensive. If they were implemented as Government policy it would go along way towards addressing the problems of alcohol misuse.The North West Alcohol Forum chaired by Denis Bradley has been working very proactively on the ground in conjunction with the North Western Health Board. Last October representatives of this group met the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to discuss the possibility of using the work of the body as a pilot community mobilisation study based on its recommendations and guidelines in addressing alcohol problems. Many of the recommendations and guidelines of the North West Alcohol Forum came from the interim report of the strategic task force on alcohol. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to liase with the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to further the forum's request to implement a community pilot project in the north west. As the Minister of State is aware all politics is local. Starting to address such a major national problem at a local level might represent a way forward.Donegal Youth Council, established two years ago, is the first democratically elected all-county youth council for 16 to 20 year olds in the county. Elections take place through the schools with students electing their peers as opposed to representatives being appointed like the Taoiseach's nominations. They are not appointed by principals or boards of management. This year's elections have just been completed and 10,000 young people elected 42 or 46 youth councillors. That youth council is very effective given that young people who know what is happening on the ground represent their peers.While, as a 33 year old, I consider myself relatively young, I am completely out of touch with what is happening among 18 to 24 year olds. As Senator Ormonde has said, a completely new drinking culture and behaviour exists which is not akin to the lifestyle I led. It involves power drinking on one trip during the week perhaps on a Friday night, or on Friday and Saturday. The phrase used in Donegal is "flat to the mat drinking for the weekend" and can take place day and night involving very heavy drinking of alcopops and other drinks. Approximately a year ago a friend of mine told me he was going to go drinking on a Saturday saying "I'm going to go at it like a day's work". This type of compulsive drinking behaviour is the norm among that age group.The Government should seriously consider the Donegal Youth Council model. Two members of that council are represented on the North West Alcohol Forum. Honest and forward-looking recommendations are continually made through that conduit. The North West Alcohol Forum is holding a summit in the near future on which there should be a national focus.Alcohol is not an underlying cause of domestic violence but, having spoken with Women's Aid this morning, it was brought home how it can exacerbate domestic violence. Statistically, from 29 December onwards, there is a high incidence of domestic violence.I came into this debate to achieve one objective — for the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to consider using the North West Alcohol Forum as a five-year pilot scheme. The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and Deputy Keaveney are all aware of it — we met with the forum in October. It could act as a pilot project and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, will follow through on a commitment he gave on this project in which he has shown an interest.The North West Alcohol Forum has been working proactively. Following the first meeting, chairman Denis Bradley said that in addressing any type of drink-related problem we must start with the simple premise that Irish people like to drink. It has been that way for centuries, it is the way now and it will be the way in future. Irish people like to enjoy a few drinks, barring our representative from the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, Senator Moylan. It is a simple premise. We do not want a "say no to alcohol" flagship, we want people to enjoy their drink without going overboard and doing harm to themselves and the wider society. Senator O'Toole, however, is being realistic when he says that pubs cannot stay open all night long. We must accept that we do not know when to stop. We enjoy our few tipples but sometimes we have a problem knowing when to call it a night.It is in the Minister of State's hands to relay what has been said in this debate to the Minister. I hope she will recognise the North West Alcohol Forum as a five-year pilot programme from which we can learn.

There has been much common sense displayed in the House on this subject and the same common sense can be heard in any discussion around the country. If all the words of condemnation and exhortation were effective, we would all be walking models of sobriety. This is not a new problem so we must ask why there was a need for a strategic task force on alcohol. It is a recognition that this problem is now bordering on a crisis.When the rules of the Oireachtas were first drawn up, it was laid down that no Member could wear any emblem except the Pioneer pin. That was a message that even then we recognised the problem we have as a people.The Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, gave a speech at a function in County Clare recently that received extensive publicity. Several of her colleagues, and this surprised me, took up the same theme — it even went as far as The Sunday Times. She was frank and open in saying that there is something wrong in Irish society and that it is time for us to tip-toe back to reality. She put it that we must tip-toe back to the church but she meant it in a broader way, namely, that we must go back to a reality that provided us with a base for the decency, quality of life and understanding of other people’s rights and needs that have always been part of the Irish character. She could have developed that point in the context of alcohol abuse.The first excuse we gave for alcohol abuse in Ireland over the decades was that because we came from a deprived situation, we had to have relief from it. Today we argue that we need it because we are affluent. This is an absolute contradiction that demonstrates that we are seeking excuses instead of answers and that is part of the problem.As a people, we have been on the receiving end of the Punch cartoons, but we do not have to go back that far in journalism. Last week a journalist in Britain, writing about a particular situation referred to a room full of drunken Irishmen to explain it. I hope the Press Council takes him to task but the mere fact he did it shows the caricature of Irish people that still exists. Being fair, however, in many ways that caricature is deserved. When President McAleese spoke on this issue, she did not speak about it in Ireland, she did it in a speech abroad. I knew what she was trying to achieve. In the 12 hours following her speech there were people who tried to misrepresent her and said that she let down the home side. She was trying to give a message to the world that we are a race that does not deserve the general caricature presented of us, that in many ways things have changed. She was, however, admitting that there is a serious problem.We went through a period when we regarded it as funny to tell jokes about alcoholics. Almost all stand-up comedians did it, stuttering their way through what alcoholics do. It was not at all funny and I often reacted by asking people to go to O'Connell Street and look at a wino and see if there is anything funny about that person in the gutter. I have often stopped to engage them in conversation, as they lie there with a bottle in one hand, unwashed, unwanted and unloved, with no place in this great affluent society. There is no comedy in that, no more than there was in the blasphemy on "The Late Late Show" from a comedian recently. Thanks be to God that the public reacted in that case and an apology had to be offered for that blasphemy. I see nothing funny in making jokes about the crucifixion of Christ. Have we gone so low as a people that we stay silent, that we will not respond and tell people who use vulgarity that we will not accept it?It is the same with alcohol abuse. A survey was carried out three years ago in a particular part of Ireland. It showed that not alone had the vast majority of young people, aged 13, tasted alcohol, but they had virtually become victims of binge drinking. There is no hope for those young people unless something is done, because we know full well that alcohol and drugs are first cousins. Alcohol is a drug and is addictive. However, we will not take a stand and say, "No more advertising of alcohol". It should not be allowed, if it is an addictive drug and is ruining young lives. We have seen what has happened with cigarettes. There are court cases and litigation under way all over the world where people said that the manufacturers knew tobacco was addictive, but that the results were kept hidden. They have been held accountable, particularly in the courts of America, and retrospectively are now paying out millions. For ages we did not accept or believe that tobacco was addictive. It is addictive, in the same way that alcohol is. Would it not be in the interests of the brewers to become part of the partnership we are talking about here? I am an optimist by nature, but I do not care what legislation, rules, condemnation or exhortation are employed, I do not believe any of this will make much headway. The only way to change this is by taking two steps back from the society that we have today.That is what Ms Emily O'Reilly was aiming at. It took great courage because she was stepping out of line with her colleagues. However, I am sure she was encouraged when she found that instead of being condemned, there were many among her colleagues in that silent situation who felt exactly the same way. We have had the same approach from Ms Mary Kenny. We all know Ms Kenny had exceptionally liberal views and favoured kicking over the traces and letting young people do what they want. Every single week Ms Kenny now bemoans that same philosophy. We have many good people, but there is one other area from where we should be getting help, namely, the icons of the entertainment world.Most of us cannot hear the lyrics, but if one takes time to listen to the words in some of the pop songs, I guarantee one will not find any exhortation not to take drugs or alcohol but quite the opposite. These are the role models of today. Senator McHugh was gracious and generous in the context of his own particular age parameter, if I may put it that way. However, the people who have the influence — I will not mention names — are in the entertainment world. How come they will not become the leaders in this regard? We should appeal to them. If Ms Emily O'Reilly took a stand, let us see how many in the entertainment world will go on the Pat Kenny show or "The Late Late Show" and make exactly the same point. They have done great work for other causes such as the Third World, but there is a culture here in Ireland currently that is devastating young lives. Celebrities can help. Let them go in the positive direction. I welcome the report and praise the people who were involved. I have great regard for people who are persistent and consistent because there is a temptation to feel helpless as regards these issues, which require to be addressed by more than mere legislation.Even in the political world more of us should be willing to take a stand, while accepting that we will be regarded as old-fashioned and coming from another era. So what? Have Members ever met a young family which has lost a child as a result of drug abuse or one whose children were up in court as a result of alcohol abuse? One soon realises the difficulties we have in our society in those circumstances. I would much prefer to be called old-fashioned, if I thought I was going to prevent in some way other families being exposed to that same trauma as those which are being paraded through the courts every day and take up column inches in the newspapers.I do not know what message the Minister of State can take from here. I know there is much goodwill about this matter. I have no doubt the Government is determined to do something about it, but I genuinely believe that what is needed at the moment is a crusade. Into that crusade we must bring all the partners who have any influence in society. Senator Moylan touched on sports and other areas. We must all come together. There is no longer a problem, there is a crisis in society. The way we can emphasise that, I believe, is to admit what is causing it.

It may be discerned in Deputy Enright of Fine Gael.The second report of the strategic task force has presented us with a valuable and comprehensive review of alcohol trends, in terms of its use and consequences, in both an Irish and European context. The report's 78 recommendations are based on internationally proven measures which are evidence based and appropriate to Ireland's complex alcohol problems, as outlined in my opening address and, indeed, outlined very well by a number of Members today and previously. Several Members mentioned the previous report of the task force, which was published in 2002. I would like to take the opportunity to highlight the many successful initiatives which have taken place since that report's publication.In 2002 over €6 billion of personal income was spent on alcohol, representing just less than €2,000 or approximately €40 a week for every adult living in this country. An important statistic, that of overall consumption, fell last year for the first time in over 16 years. This change must be maintained and built upon and in tandem with the implementation of the recommendations we will in time see a reduction in alcohol-related harm. Progress has been made in a number of other areas arising from the implementation of measures recommended in the report of the first task force. A three-year alcohol awareness campaign was launched which proved effective in raising awareness of alcohol as a public health issue. The Road Traffic Act extended the grounds for requesting a breath specimen and a move to random breath testing is recommended. The recently published road safety strategy 2004-06 also calls for the introduction of random breath testing. The Government has strengthened the licensing laws through the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which contains measures to counter drunkenness and disorderly conduct and to combat under age drinking. These include the prohibition of "happy hours" and of persons under 18 from the bars of licensed premises after set times. The Act prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor to drunken persons on licensed premises and licensees may not permit drunkenness in the bars of licensed premises.Legislation is being drafted by the parliamentary draftsman which aims to reduce the exposure of alcohol to children, from advertising and marketing. A number of research projects have been undertaken to monitor and inform alcohol policy decision making. The Irish Sports Council's code of ethics and good practice for children's sport in Ireland has been instrumental in encouraging national sporting organisations to promote alcohol-free sporting environments. This code contains several recommendations as regards alcohol and to date 62 out of the 67 governing sports bodies have signed up to it and appointed national children's officers to implement the guidelines at local level. The health promotion unit produced a framework for the development of a college alcohol policy in association with the heads of colleges and the Union of Students of Ireland. The framework provides guidelines for a comprehensive approach which includes measures on controlling promotion, sponsorship and marketing on college campuses, providing education and support services as well as alternatives and limiting harm in the drinking environment. The responsible server training programme, developed by the Department of Health and Children and the drinks industry, is being delivered nationwide.Last year there was a substantial increase in the number of public order offences in Ireland and alcohol has been identified as a major factor. Excessive consumption of alcohol represents one of the most serious threats to public health. Despite all the figures and the evidence on a weekly basis, it is remarkable how tolerant as a nation we are of alcohol. That may be a state of mind or an attitude we have grown up with but it is an attitude we have to change. While there has been improvement I accept that much more needs to be done. This report of the task force must be used as our guideline for future actions. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children intends to bring this report to Government in the near future to seek approval for the implementation of its recommendations. The Government is committed to tackling the problem and I thank Members for their valuable contributions and the interest they have shown in this important public health issue, not only today but on many occasions in recent years.Members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children have also contributed greatly through their report on alcohol misuse by young people. While in the media young people are often painted as the real offenders when it comes to alcohol-related problems, the majority of alcohol-related harm takes place among the adult population. The same applies in the case of drink driving. It appears young drivers are much more responsible when it comes to not drinking and driving.The task force has produced a comprehensive robust report which I urge every public representative, public servant, medical expert and relevant organisation and institution to examine and to work towards the implementation of its recommendations. I accept the point made by Senator Ormonde that perhaps it has not been made available to the public or that we have not explained it to the public as well we could have done. That is an issue at which we will look.We have a very serious problem but we can take effective measures that will make the difference. While Ireland might like a drink, as Senator McHugh said in quoting another gentleman, the same could be said about smoke and smoking. We introduced some legislative changes recently which dealt with smoking in the workplace. This time last year one could have said that Ireland liked to smoke, today it could be said that Ireland is happy to be smokeless. Recent figures indicate that sales of tobacco have reduced by 17% since the introduction of the ban. We should not give up hope. We can reduce the number of people——

The provision of an Alzheimer's unit was provided for in the National Development Plan 2001-2006. According to a reply received from the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Dr. Moffatt, on 16 October 2001, it was indicated that it would be completed in the latter half of this development plan.Discussions regarding the provision of an Alzheimer's unit have been taking place for at least the past six years. During that time, St. Ita's Hospital has been visited by a succession of Ministers. When there is a ministerial visit to west Limerick it seems to be de rigueur to turn up at St. Ita’s Hospital and give one’s blessing to the Alzheimer’s unit. For example, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, when Minister for Health and Children, the Taoiseach prior to the last election and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, when Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, following one of the Government’s sojourns in Killarney, visited the hospital. They have all been made aware of the importance of the Alzheimer’s unit and it is time construction took place.I understand it is up to the Department of Health and Children to give approval to the Mid-Western Health Board to invite tenders. There has been enough delay in the provision of this essential building. I understand it is being included in the Department's capital investment framework for 2004-08 so the time is stretching out.St. Ita's Hospital was constructed in 1840 and renovated in 1975. Many parts of the hospital require constant refurbishment. St. Ita's Hospital urgently needs this dedicated unit because it is unfair to those patients in wards who do not have Alzheimer's disease and those visiting them because doors have to be locked in certain wards within the hospital. The staff at St. Ita's Hospital do great work and both they and the members of the community are bitterly disappointed that decisive action has not been taken. I call on the Minister for Health and Children to give a clear-cut commitment as to when this unit will be provided. There has been enough delay on this issue and urgent action is required. I look forward to the response of the Minister of State.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-02 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The Government has made services for older people a priority and is fully committed to the development of a comprehensive health service capable of responding quickly, fully and effectively to the health service needs of older people. In recent years, health and social services for older people have improved, both in hospitals and in the community. Since coming into office, the Government has increased substantially the level of funding, both capital and revenue, in respect of services for older people. For example, in excess of €280 million additional revenue has been allocated to these services from 1997 to date. I believe this serves to demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to improving services to our older population.Significant capital funding for the health sector has been provided since the commencement of the national development plan in 2000. The total expenditure for the years 2000-03 was approximately €1.7 billion. Considerable progress has been made in addressing the historical deficits in health infrastructure and improving the standards of facilities required for quality modern patient care. The national development plan provides considerable capital funding to services for older people. On a national basis, this will enable a comprehensive infrastructure of community nursing units and day-care facilities to be put in place, as well as the refurbishment of existing extended care facilities and the replacement of older accommodation. Older people deserve first-class facilities and we intend to provide such facilities in appropriate locations.On the new dementia unit at St. Ita's Hospital, Newcastle West, the provision of health services in County Limerick is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance. In 2000, as part of the national development plan, it was agreed that a project team be established for the development of a ten-bed elderly mentally infirm unit at St. Ita's Hospital, Newcastle West. The project team subsequently decided that the development should be increased to a 12-bed unit. The scope of this development is in keeping with the objectives laid down in the report, The Years Ahead — A Policy for the Elderly, and will comprise bed accommodation and ancillary facilities initially for 12 inpatients, including up to a maximum of four dedicated respite beds.Provision has been made for this development within the Department's capital investment framework 2004-2008. Planning permission for the proposed development has been obtained from the local planning authority. The Mid-Western Health Board has submitted documentation to my Department in regard to this project with a request for approval to seek tenders for construction of the unit.The next step in progressing the project to construction is to arrange for the submission of tenders. Any decision on progressing this project will be considered by my Department in the context of the significant additional revenue funding and staff which will be required by the board and its successor, the health services executive, to operate the new unit and having regard to the employment ceiling and funding available to my Department.
