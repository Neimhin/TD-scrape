Senator Morrissey may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Order of Business as proposed by the Leader today is completely unacceptable. For any degree of parliamentary scrutiny, to suggest that we can take all Stages of two vitally important Bill through the House by 10 o'clock this evening is stretching the limitations of credibility just too far. The Leader has proposed to take Second Stage contributions from leading spokespersons in all groups for ten minutes on a vitally important Bill concerning domestic violence and ten minutes on the National Development Finance Agency Bill which, I understand, has a total of 23 sections. We are then expected to proceed immediately to Committee and Report Stages. My colleague, Senator Feighan, has already proposed 20 substantive amendments and it seems unlikely they will be reached. That is not the way to do business. The Leader is ramming through some very important legislation just because we are one week from Christmas.If we have learnt anything from the Supreme Court decision in respect of the domestic violence legislation passed in 1996, it is that Bills should be considered line by line and word by word. I ask the Leader at this late stage to reconsider the order as proposed. On this side of the House, we want to do business in a serious way. The order, as proposed, does not take serious account of the contributions and amendments of my party colleagues and other Senators. I again ask the Leader to re-think the Order of Business.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I wish to propose a change in the Order of Business to take No. 20 first, namely a motion relating to licensing practices of the Dublin District Court system, especially in the light of the debate we had last week on alcohol consumption by young people. Although Dublin City Council and the Garda objected to the granting of an off-licence in respect of a shop in O'Connell Street, those objections were thrown out and I understand that Dublin City Council will not appeal that decision. This House ought to have an opportunity to express a view that this matter should be appealed, otherwise it will lead to terrible trouble in the city centre.I also request a statement from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the issue raised on the "Today with Pat Kenny" radio programme last week in relation to a school teacher who was wrongly accused of sexual abuse of a mildly handicapped child. This has been going on for six years. The case was eventually thrown out following a unanimous decision by a jury, but the man was suspended from his job. On several occasions he was held overnight in a Garda station and when he was brought to court, the public had advance knowledge of his appearance there. He was spat upon, kicked, pushed, beaten and abused, but he was innocent. For six years his children could not have birthday parties because the mother knew none of the neighbours would attend in light of the fact that he had been accused and stigmatised as a child abuser.We have had inquiries and tribunals about all kinds of issues, but it is only right that there should be an inquiry into this gross miscarriage of justice against a citizen of the State. We are entitled to know why this case was referred to a court by the Director of Public Prosecutions when there was apparently no significant evidence and certainly none that would stand up in court.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I agree with earlier speakers regarding the speed with which it is proposed to debate two Bills of major importance. My colleague, Senator Tuffy, will refer to this matter later.In recent weeks we have heard conflicting reports about the proposed abolition of the dual mandate by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Some people say the Minister will proceed with the abolition, while others say he will not. There is much uncertainty about the matter, although according to The Irish Times today it looks as if it is going to be introduced forthwith.I have a difficulty with the fact that the Minister can dictate, as he did yesterday, to Radio Kerry regarding his intentions for the dual mandate and wider local government reform. It was remiss him not to have informed the House, in the first instance, and, in particular, those Senators who hold seats on local authorities. Their views may differ from the Minister's proposals to abolish the dual mandate. Many reasonable people consider that local government reform goes much further than the abolition of the dual mandate. I would conditionally support such an abolition if it was accompanied by real reform of local government.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I wish to raise the case of the Nigerian woman, Amina Lawal, who has been condemned to death by stoning for alleged adultery. I unreservedly condemn the proposed use of the death penalty in this particular case. I ask the Leader to bring our views to the attention of the Nigerian Ambassador to Ireland. We should seek a presidential pardon for this woman who has been harshly treated. I commend Amnesty International on its stand on this issue. Ms Amina Lawal has been treated despicably by the Nigerian authorities and unless we and many others intervene, she will be stoned to death. The House should condemn such a penalty, which is outrageous in the third millennium. I call on the President of Nigeria to grant a presidential pardon in this case. If, however, the Nigerian authorities carry out this penalty, we should withdraw all support for Nigeria and break off diplomatic relations. Stern action must be taken because we have historical links with Nigeria and have supported the Nigerian Government in the past.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I wish to raise the matter of the consultancy fees for feasibility studies that have been commissioned by the Government. Yesterday, following a meeting with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, in Donegal, it came to light that many projects will not be implemented over the next two or three years. As everyone is aware, new feasibility studies will have to be commissioned after that period. A debate is needed on the issues of value for money and the basis on which projects are selected. Government expenditure must become more efficient because a great deal of money is being wasted.The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, has undertaken to contact the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his Department regarding the salvaging of the Downings Harbour development project in Donegal which has been halted. As it is imperative this project should go ahead, will the Leader also communicate to the Minister the support of this House for that project?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I support Senator Leyden. It is important to put on record our views regarding diplomatic relations with the Nigerian Government.Will the Leader introduce legislation on what is rather pompously known as corporate government executive pay? It would be particularly appropriate if she addressed herself to this matter on which she has great expertise. The Leader was instrumental in the privatisation of Eircom and, to her great credit, she prevented executives of that company, as she announced in this House she would, from stealing options from the Irish people. The problem is, however, that directors, such as those who received €3.8 million in the last day or two, are allowed to run riot in paying themselves vast sums of money.

The review of the Common Fisheries Policy will be regarded, if it goes wrong, as a doomsday scenario for the fishing industry. I am concerned about the retention of the Irish Box, the justifications for which have been well expounded. Various discussions are ongoing between the Spanish and Irish fisheries Ministers with regard to a phased reduction of the Irish Box. If the Government has received legal advice to the effect – and if it has never been published, I can understand why – that we have a legitimate claim to the current status quo in the Irish Box, it would be tantamount to disaster to concede on this vital aspect in the fisheries discussions which are taking place.

It is unsatisfactory that two important Bills are being dealt with in this manner.I welcome the Government's introduction of the Domestic Violence (Amendment) Bill, 2002 which addresses the issues raised by the Supreme Court. It is important that this timely legislation should not be rushed through the Oireachtas.There is a great deal of kite flying regarding the abolition of the dual mandate.

The company has served the country well and we would not be able to operate today without it. There have been difficulties with the organisation from time to time, but by and large it has done a marvellous job. ESB staff have gone abroad to help other countries which have encountered difficulties and it would be appropriate to offer them our congratulations on a job well done over the past 75 years.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Under the national spatial strategy Waterford is designated a gateway city and the importance of infrastructure and access has been deemed to be a very important part of that strategy. Given that the lone carrier at Waterford regional airport has decided to pull out from the airport at the end of January, and the consequent loss for the region, I ask the Minister for Transport to come to this House so that we can find out what finance will be made available to Waterford regional airport and why a PSO licence has not been granted to the airport, as has been the case in other regional airports. All we want is fair play in the region, which we are certainly not getting. I ask the Minister to come to this House to explain the position in regard to Waterford regional airport.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I ask the Leader of the House to raise with the Minister for Education and Science an issue which has been causing great concern in recent days, that is, the condemning of the building at Coláiste Mhuire in Parnell Square. Parents and teachers received letters in recent days notifying them that the building is unfit for habitation or use and that when the school year begins after Christmas students will not be allowed in. It is extremely serious for all the students, particularly those doing exams, that this should happen suddenly as they were promised by the Taoiseach a couple of years ago that they would get a replacement school.

Through the insistence and stubbornness of the previous Minister, this dispute has already cost €27 million which would have been a major bonus had it been available to deliver services at any level in education. It is essential that the Minister should take a hands-on approach in this regard to bring together the various parties to resolve the very minor issues, caused by misinterpretation or whatever, which are still outstanding. It is essential that this matter is resolved urgently.Has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform taken a new hard line in relation to immigrants? Will the Leader highlight to the Minister the issue of 19 Bangladesh people being refused visas?

Reform of local authorities is a very pressing and important issue for local authorities throughout the country. It is the first time in several years that local authorities have not been allocated their full budget, which means the estimates meetings will not be held until January or February.

An issue that arose at the council meeting is pertinent to the Seanad and I would like to mention it in the presence of the Leader. I am concerned about the standard of accommodation available to middle-aged and elderly single men. Many such people in Kilkenny and other parts of the country live in prefabs, which is completely unacceptable.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Senator Brian Hayes raised his objections to today's Order of Business. Without discussing the matter at great length, I should point out that I asked that the Domestic Violence (Amendment) Bill, 2002, should be introduced in the House and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform kindly agreed. If Senators pass the Bill this evening it is hoped the Dáil will pass it tomorrow, its final sitting day before Christmas. I put it to the House that the Bill is needed urgently because, if it is not put in place, suitable provisions will not be made until the end of January. It is likely that many sad cases of domestic violence will not be covered by legislation if we refuse to pass the Bill before Christmas. I agree that it is not proper that Bills are rushed and we have tried not to do so in this Seanad up to now, but the Bill I have mentioned, of all Bills—
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	75	What about the second Bill?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I referred specifically to the National Development Finance Agency Bill, 2002.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Senator mentioned both Bills. I am not prepared to let violence happen to women and know that I was Leader of a House which could have passed a Bill which would have helped but did not. I note the objections regarding the second Bill. The Dáil asked us to take all Stages of it and I agreed on behalf of my party, but the matter is always open and the Opposition has a right to vote on it.Senator Norris wants No.12, motion No. 20, to be debated in the House. I heard the programme which featured the teacher wrongly accused of sexual abuse who is now proved innocent. His wife spoke on the radio and told her story very movingly. Her children cannot leave the house. Although abuse is awful, it must also be awful to proved innocent and still be suffering. The DPP is independent. I do not know why he referred it to the courts but that is his business.

He said that many reforms were required in local authorities before we considered that one.Senator Leyden raised the case of the Nigerian woman, Amina Lawal, who has been sentenced to death by stoning. I thank the Senator for raising this very important human rights issue, a matter we discuss all of the time. Ms Lawal became pregnant, having been divorced, and is to be stoned to death. It is appalling and I will write to the Nigerian ambassador on behalf of the House.Does Senator Mc Hugh approve of doing away—

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	84	On a general principle Senator McHugh approves of the abolition of the dual mandate. It is interesting to hear both points of view. The National Development Finance Agency Bill would be an appropriate vehicle to raise the subject of the Downings project in Donegal. Senator McHugh mentioned the Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, and the value for money on projects which require a new feasibility project three years later.Senator Ross supported Senator Leyden on the matter of the Nigerian woman and has given me a good idea, a Private Member's Bill. I will work with him on that. On his other point, legislation is being brought in the UK, in January or February, which is concerned with preventing inordinate payments to executives and I would be glad to work on it.Senator Finucane mentioned the Irish Box. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is well aware of the difficulties. We sent word to him last week. He is working on behalf of the nation and I wish him success.Senator Tuffy is opposed to the abolition of the dual mandate and the rushed Order of Business. Senator Kenneally mentioned that today is the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the ESB. I will be glad to send a letter from the Seanad because it appears to have the approval of the whole House.Senator Cummins asked why Waterford Airport is not getting the money for PSO routes. It is because Irish taxpayers pay for them but we have to get permission from Europe to provide them. They are only from outlying areas to the capital city of the country and do not operate from a regional airport to destinations outside the country. There has not been a consistent Waterford to Dublin route. The flights were going to various parts of the UK and perhaps further.

Knock, Galway, Sligo, Donegal and Kerry have these routes to the capital city. The other airports do not.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Senator Terry mentioned the €30 million needed for Coláiste Mhuire. I heard the debate on the radio on this matter. I do not wish to dictate to the Senator, but it would be ideal for the Adjournment because she could ask a Minister to sort out the problem. For the sake of the children attending the school, I hope this can be achieved.Senator Ulick Burke asked about the deadlock between the Minister for Education and Science and the ASTI over supervision and substitution. I inquired about this myself out of interest – once a teacher, always a teacher. I understand that the impasse concerns the interpretation of "on call"– on call for a limited period or on call constantly. The TUI managed to resolve this and we should look to how the system is working in the community colleges and the community schools in which TUI members work. I agree with the Senator that it should be settled quickly. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be here at some time today and the Senator may address his other point to him then.Senator Bannon mentioned the ferrying of CIE drivers by taxi from Dublin to Longford. It would be useful to mention this to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, on the Adjournment because it is a discrete issue. Senator Browne also offered his congratulations to the ESB and wondered when something will be done about establishing a national driver testing agency. I regret that I did not reply to the Senator last week about the release of prisoners under the Good Friday Agreement. I do not know what kind of criminal background these people have but the release of prisoners was covered by legislation under the Agreement which must have been passed by this House.Senator Phelan asked about elderly single men living in prefabs. This was also covered on a particular programme on which I appeared. There appears to be a growing number of these men, who are very far down on local authority housing lists due to their single status. That is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and also for the local authorities themselves, who have a certain freedom as long as they allocate so many houses to the elderly, so many to families and so on.I recommend that the House accept the taking of all Stages of the Domestic Violence (Amendment) Bill, 2002, today, because otherwise it will not be passed for six weeks.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The purpose of this Bill is to remedy a defect in the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, which resulted in the Supreme Court on 9 October declaring section 4(3) of the Act unconstitutional. In doing this, the Bill restores to our courts the power to make interim barring orders ex parte.Section 4(1) of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, provides that the Circuit or District Court may, on the making of an application for a barring order, or between the making of such application and its determination, make an interim barring order if it is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is an immediate risk of significant harm to the applicant or any dependent person if the order is not made immediately, and the granting of a protection order would not be sufficient to protect the applicant or any dependent person.Section 4(3) of the Act provides that where the court, in exceptional cases, considers it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice, an interim barring order may be made ex parte or notwithstanding the fact that the originating document or other notice of the application required to be duly served on the respondent to the application has not been so served. The words “ex parte”signify that the order has been made in the absence of, and without notice to, the other party.Section 4(4) provides that an interim barring order shall cease to have effect on the determination by the court of the application for the barring order. The duration of such an interim barring order endured until the court made the final decision on the substantive application for a barring order.On 9 October last, the Supreme Court, in a case which arose out of the granting of an ex parte interim barring order which was in effect for almost three months, held that the provisions of section 4 as they relate to ex parte interim barring orders, in failing to prescribe a fixed period of relatively short duration during which such an order would continue in force, deprived the respondents to such applications of the protection of the principle of audi alteram partem, which means that the other side should be heard. The Supreme Court ruled that the invasion of the principle of natural justice was, in a manner and to an extent which was disproportionate, unreasonable and unnecessary.For those reasons, the court declared section 4(3) unconstitutional and said that it had not been demonstrated that the remedy of an interim order granted on an ex parte basis would be in some sense seriously weakened if the interim order thus obtained were to be of limited duration only. The applicant could be required at the earliest practicable opportunity to satisfy the court in the presence of the opposing party that the order was properly granted and should now be continued in force.It is important to note that the Supreme Court said it was beyond dispute that the Oireachtas had the power to abridge the rights of individual citizens, such as the right to be heard in proceedings taken against them, in order to deal with the social evil of domestic violence. The Supreme Court did not take issue with Oireachtas powers in that respect. The constitutional problem arose with the manner in which the abridgement of the right was effected in that the abridgement has to be proportionate.The principle of hearing the other side and of giving each side an opportunity to be heard before a determination can be made is the hallmark of a civilised jurisprudence in any jurisdiction. The Creator did not banish Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden without giving them a hearing.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	105	They got due notice.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	106	This is very important because the power to grant an interim barring order ex parte is essential in certain cases to protect innocent persons in their home. That is an important jurisdiction and, since the Supreme Court decision, the courts have not been in a position to exercise that jurisdiction because that power has not been available to them. In such circumstances, it will be important that the offending party will be ordered to leave the home and it is not practicable, in the circumstances of the case, to require that notice be given to him or her prior to the making of the order. However, as is indicated by the Supreme Court decision, when such an order is made there must be an early return date on which the applicant must show in proceedings, of which the respondent has notice, that the continuation of the interim order is justified in accordance with the statutory criteria. The period upon which we have fixed in the legislation is eight working days.I now turn to the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the substantive provision which substitutes a new subsection (3) for the existing section 4(3). Paragraph (a) of the proposed subsection has three features worthy of comment. These are: first, the provision that an interim order may be made ex parte and the jurisdiction is confirmed; second, the replacement of the phrase “in exceptional cases” in section 4(3) with a reference to “the circumstances of the particular case”; and, third, the stipulation that an interim order may be made ex parte“where the court considers this necessary or expedient in the interests of justice”.Section 4(3), in its present form and prior to the Supreme Court decision, permitted the making of an interim barring order ex parte or notwithstanding the fact that the originating document or other notice of the application required to be served on the respondent to the barring order application had not been so served. This was a reference not to notice of the application for the interim order but to notice of the application for the full barring order. I have been informed that, in the vast majority of cases, interim barring orders were issued where the notice of the barring order application had yet to be served on the respondent. Even where this notice had been served, it would be rare for the respondent to be aware that, in addition to a full barring order, an interim barring order was also being sought against him or her.The approach taken in this Bill is to dispense with reference to notice of the barring order application and provide simply that where, having regard to the circumstances of the particular case, the court considers it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice, an interim barring order can be granted ex parte; that is, in the absence of and without notice to the respondent. Where the court decides it is neither necessary nor expedient in the interests of justice to make the order ex parte, it can require notice to be served on the respondent of the application for the interim order.The approach taken in this Bill is to dispense with reference to notice of the barring order application and provide that where, having regard to the circumstances of the case, the court considers it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice, an interim barring order can be granted ex parte, that is, in the absence of, and without notice to, the respondent. Where the court decides that it is neither necessary nor expedient in the interests of justice to make the order ex parte, it can require notice to be served on the respondent of the application for the interim order. Paragraph (b) of section 1 of the Bill makes a largely similar amendment to section 5(4) of the Act dealing with protection orders. I will refer to that matter later.The second point about the proposed new subsection (3)(a) relates to the phrase, “having regard to the circumstances of the particular case.” The Supreme Court noted that section 4(3), as it stands, provides for the making of interim barring orders ex parte in “exceptional cases”, but contains no indication of the criteria by which the court is to decide whether a case is exceptional. The merit of the new wording is that it invites the court to assess the circumstances of the case before it. In that respect, it focuses on the individual case before the judge and does not require any determination that the case is exceptional which would imply comparison with other cases.As regards the phrase "necessary or expedient to do so in the interests of justice", Senators will note that this criterion is already in section 4(3). It also resembles section 17(3) of the Child Care Act, 1991, which was referred to with approval by the Supreme Court in the case to which I referred and which permits an interim care order in respect of a child to be made without notice to a parent where, having regard to the interests of justice or the welfare of the child, the judge so directs.I now move on to the proposed paragraphs (b) and (c) of the new subsection (3). Applications for interim barring orders, prior to the finding of the Supreme Court, were generally made on a sworn information. However, they were often supported by oral evidence given by the applicant to the judge. I understand that while the sworn information was frequently made available to the respondent, practice differed from court to court and sometimes the information was not made available. The oral evidence, however, was not recorded in a note or otherwise nor was it communicated to the respondent. This issue has been highlighted in a report of the Law Society law reform committee entitled, Domestic violence: The case for reform, published in May 1999. This report proposed that court rules be amended to require that ex parte applications for a protection order or an interim barring order be made on affidavit and that the respondent automatically be provided with a note of all the evidence given at the hearing.The effect of paragraphs (b) and (c) is that the application for an interim barring order must be made either on an affidavit or on a sworn information and, where an interim order is made ex parte, a note of any evidence given must be made and served, together with the order, and affidavit or sworn information, on the respondent as soon as practicable. In this way, the respondent will have full information on what has been alleged against him or her on the basis of which he or she has been barred from the home. Paragraph (c) provides that the note of the oral evidence shall be prepared by the judge, the applicant or the applicant's solicitor and approved by the judge or as otherwise directed by the judge. In the case of applicants for an ex parte interim barring order in the District Court, which represents the majority of cases, it would be unusual for such persons to be accompanied by a solicitor and they may not be fully in a position to make an adequate note of their evidence. To ensure that such cases are attended to, the judge may make the note or may direct that it be done in some other way, for example, by obtaining the services of a stenographer.Paragraph (d) of the proposed new subsection (3) addresses the main point in the Supreme Court's judgment, namely, that the court held that the provisions of section 4, as they relate to ex parte interim barring orders, in failing to prescribe a fixed period of relatively short duration during which such an order would continue in force, deprived the respondents to such applications of the protection of the principle of audi alteram partem, that is, that the other side should be heard, in a manner and to an extent which is disproportionate, unreasonable and unnecessary. Paragraph (d) provides that the ex parte order shall have effect for not more than eight working days unless, on application by the applicant for the barring order and on notice to the respondent, the order is confirmed within that period by order of the court. A time limit is placed on these orders by the legislation.Proposed paragraph (e) provides that the ex parte interim barring order shall contain a statement of the effect of paragraph (d), that is, the duration of the order and the possibility of its being confirmed as provided for in the paragraph. A working day for the purpose of paragraph (d) is defined in paragraph (f) as a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday within the meaning of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997. If the interim order is confirmed, it will continue in effect until the application for the barring order itself is determined, as provided for in section 5(4) of the 1996 Act.Section 1 (b) provides that a new subsection (4) will be substituted for section 5(4) of the 1996 Act. This provides that a protection order may be made ex parte. Section 5(4), as it stands, provides that a protection order may be made “notwithstanding the fact that the originating document or other notice of the application required to be duly served on the respondent to the application for a safety order or a barring order has not been so served”. As I have already explained with regard to section 4(3), this is a reference to the notice of the application for the final order – in this case a barring order or a safety order – not to any application for the interim relief. The proposed amendment to section 5(4) changes this by simply providing that a protection order may be made ex parte, that is, in the absence of and without notice to the respondent. Section 2 contains a standard provision for Short Title and collective citation.In bringing the Bill before the House I am conscious that we must look at these proposals in the context of the legislation on domestic violence as a whole, that is, the Domestic Violence Act, 1996. That Act was ground-breaking legislation, which built on existing remedies for the victims of violence in the home. The barring order remedy dates from 1976, when it was provided for in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act. The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, strengthened the law on barring orders. The main changes made were the extension of the District Court's time limit from three to 12 months, the granting of a statutory power of arrest without warrant to the Garda for breaches of orders and the creation of the remedy of a protection order. The 1996 Act repealed and re-enacted, with substantial amendments, the provisions of the preceding legislation.Among the changes introduced by the 1996 Act were that: remedies were no longer confined to interspousal violence in that cohabitees could, on certain conditions, avail of the remedies provided by the 1996 Act, as could parents against their adult children; a new type of long-term protection order called a safety order was introduced and this was made available to persons residing together in a relationship, the basis of which was not primarily contractual, in addition, of course, to the other categories who are eligible for barring orders; the maximum duration of a barring order granted by the District Court was increased from one to three years and; the Act, for the first time, provided that a health board, on certain conditions, could apply for a barring order or a safety order on behalf of a victim of domestic violence.According to the Courts Service report for 2001, in the region of 2,000 barring orders were granted each year since 1996. The number of interim barring orders made per annum has fluctuated over that period, the highest number being just over 1,000 in 2001. The number of safety orders has ranged from around 700 to 1,200 per annum while the number of protection orders has been in the region of 3,400 to 3,800.It is worth noting from the report of the Courts Service that while the average length of time from the date of issue of the summons to the date of hearing of barring and safety order applications was 12 weeks, barring order applications where an interim barring order had been made were dealt with within two to three weeks. This shows that the District Court had been giving priority already to cases in which an interim order had been made and that judges were generally conscious of the need to set early return dates where they had made such orders.These are just brief details of the operation of the system since the coming into force of the 1996 Act. Based on this experience, there have been a number of recommendations for reform of what are perceived to be deficiencies in the Act. In particular, there have been reports from Women's Aid and the Law Society's law reform committee. I have already referred to the latter report.Among the proposals which have come from various sources are the following: eligibility criteria for orders under the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, should be extended to include a person with a child in common; the residence requirement for eligibility for a barring order in the case of unmarried cohabitees should be reduced from its present level which is six months out of the previous nine; the residence requirement should be removed for cohabitees seeking a safety order and for cohabitees with sole ownership or tenancy rights in the home seeking a barring order; provisions should be introduced permitting parents or elderly relations to apply for protective orders against abusive relations or persons other than an adult child and such provisions should include safety or barring orders against such relations or persons residing in the home and safety orders against those residing elsewhere; there should be a category of associated persons who would be entitled to apply for a safety order and a non-exhaustive list of such persons should be provided; associated persons with sole ownership or tenancy rights in the home should be entitled to apply for a barring order; the case has been made that there should be either detailed statutory guidance or a list of standards to be considered by the courts in determining whether to grant protective orders; there should be statutory guidance with regard to welfare based applications; further statutory guidance should be provided regarding the standard of proof necessary to establish abuse; and the probation and welfare service should be given a clear statutory role in relation to domestic violence cases and an increased role in supervised access arrangements.There is also a commentary on the Law Society's report by AMEN, an organisation which speaks in defence of men who have been respondents in domestic violence cases, that there should be a category of "associated persons" who would be entitled to apply for a safety order and a non-exhaustive list of such persons should be provided. Another proposal is that "associated persons" with sole ownership or tenancy rights in the home should be entitled to apply for a barring order.A case has been made that there should be either detailed statutory guidance or a list of standards to be considered by the courts in determining whether to grant protective orders. Also, that there should be statutory guidance with regard to "welfare" based applications and that further statutory guidance should be provided regarding the standard of proof necessary to establish abuse. The probation and welfare service should be given a clear statutory role in relation to domestic violence cases and an increased role in supervised access arrangements. A commentary has also been made on the Law Society's report by AMEN, an organisation which speaks in defence of men who have been respondents in domestic violence cases.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to have these various recommendations further examined in consultation with interested parties and, to the extent that reform seems warranted, his intention is to introduce the necessary amendments as part of a family law Bill which he aims to bring forward in about a year or so.It would not have been feasible in the short time available since the Supreme Court decision to include any such measures in the present Bill which is aimed specifically at restoring the power to make interim barring orders ex parte in a way which conforms with the Constitution. I appreciate the patience of Senators as I have outlined the legal technicalities involved in the particular measure. To have attempted to go beyond that at this stage would have delayed the most urgent change of all which will provide a necessary remedy for the victims of domestic violence.This Bill represents a proportionate response to circumstances where an interim barring order has to be obtained urgently to save vulnerable persons who are faced with an immediate risk of significant harm to themselves or a dependent. I commend the Bill to the House.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to take part in this important debate. This matter has caused distress to many people and must be addressed. I agree with the Leader that we do not want to be responsible for any person being a victim over the Christmas period or not being free to seek the protection to which he or she is entitled under the Constitution.I am concerned, however, that we are rushing the Bill. We will go through all Stages today. This Bill should have been given more time. The Supreme Court made its decision on 9 October so we did have time available. I raised the matter at that time and on a second occasion in the House. I am annoyed that we are now dealing with it in this rushed fashion. The recommendations which have come before the Minister from the various bodies could have been dealt with earlier. Other issues on which I have proposed amendments need time for debate in the House but they will not get due process or the time they deserve if they are rushed through today.This Bill falls short of what is required. The amendments I propose address some of the issues. I am surprised at the timeframe of eight working days being used by the Minister of State. People in the legal field have suggested that eight days is sufficient. As the Minister of State said, this is a precedent set under the Child Care Act which was used as a model by the Supreme Court. I propose that we revert to the eight days. In regard to the Child Care Act, the time was extended at a later stage to 28 days. The Supreme Court decision, which seems to be unaware of that, should now have an effect on the Child Care Act and the extended 28 days should now revert to eight days following the Supreme Court decision.Another issue I would like to take up is the deletion of the words "exceptional circumstances" and their replacement by the words "having regard to the circumstances of the particular case." People are concerned by the removal of the phrase. It gave the respondent an opportunity to know for sure the case being taken against him or her. We should retain those words.I welcome the short timeframe. The Minister of State has said eight working days but I hope he accepts an eight day timeframe. Timing is all important and I have concerns about that. For example, if an application is made on a Monday and the respondent returns on Friday and says he or she did not have sufficient time to prepare a case and deserves to be heard, could we then be in a situation where the order would fall? Nothing in this Bill puts an onus on the judge to say where an adjournment could take place. There is no timeframe. If that is not corrected the system will fall and we will have applicants returning for renewable interim barring orders. We are back then at where we were before the Supreme Court decision. If an adjournment is called by the respondent while a judge is hearing the case the judge must set a date no longer than eight days from that adjournment. That needs to be written into the Bill or the adjournment could go on indefinitely.The Minister of State says in the memorandum that there are no financial implications. I believe there are because there will be more cases where time is of the essence. They have to be heard within the eight day frame. We know of the lack of resources available to the Legal Aid Board. It must be given resources to deal with the additional cases. If funds are not provided the system will not work. These are financial implications for this Bill.The Minister of State has left the issue of protection orders vague. Protection orders should be awarded the same security provisions as interim barring orders. If we do not deal with that we leave ourselves wide open to a Supreme Court decision deeming the Bill unconstitutional.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Seanad chun an ábhair seo a phlé. At various stages in my youth I was given coaching in hurling, soccer and tennis. I subsequently underwent training courses in relation to some aspects of my community work with the junior chamber. People involved in business or politics often undertake training courses or driving courses, which are quite topical. In contrast, when I got married there was no equivalent coaching or training in personal relationships – it was rather a matter of trial and error. Since the introduction of divorce and related changes, some of the churches have initiated pre-marriage courses and that is welcome. However, it often occurred to me how odd it is that in relation to probably the most important calling in one's life, one is left to find one's own way without any specific training. The same applies to parenthood.Should the State not have some role in ensuring proper training and counselling in that regard for people entering a very important stage of their lives, making commitments which they and society would wish to see as life-long commitments? The Bill before the House relates to breakdowns in relationships leading to extreme situations in which violence occurs in households. In relation to the stresses and strains of people who come to live together in adulthood, bringing their individual characteristics and personality traits, it may take time to reach compatibility. Guidance and support should be available and the State should be helpful and constructive in that regard.The Bill deals with the failure aspect. A balanced approach is needed. There are many societal benefits to be gained from good, sound relationships of a quality which will imbue the next generation with the same spirit, thereby renewing and strengthening society. There must be a role for the State in trying to promote that approach.I listened with interest to Senator Terry's comments, with which I have some sympathy. I am aware of correspondence and representations with regard to the insertion of "in exceptional circumstances" which, it appears, applied in the 1996 legislation but has been dropped from the Bill. Perhaps that was because of a Supreme Court finding that there was not a definition of that term or the cases to which it might apply. If we cannot provide for it now, we should set down criteria at the earliest opportunity. To debar a person from the family home is obviously a major step. A court decision of that nature may contribute to irretrievable breakdown of the relationship. Accordingly, it behoves us to try to ensure this will only happen in case of a really genuine threat. Clearly, partners and children cannot be exposed to real threat of injury or to their lives. Regrettably, there have been some traumatic situations of that nature in recent years.In the course of my research for this debate, I came across some interesting statistics in the Accord report to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Respondents to a questionnaire were asked if their partners had ever used force against them or if they had ever used force against their partners for any reason. The results indicated that, during the course of a marriage or a living together relationship, 53% of all couples responded "Yes" to that question and, in almost half of the replies, it was mutual. Obviously, there were varying degrees of domestic violence, including pushing, shoving and grabbing. A noteworthy finding, which may be disputed by other Members, was that, excluding cases of mutual perpetration, the incidence of perpetration by women only, at 36%, was slightly higher than perpetration by men only, at 28%. I expect the findings were influenced by when and where the survey was carried out.The Bill deals with ex parte applications. The Minister of State has acknowledged that the right to be heard is a fundamental principle in law. Any departure from that should be in very exceptional circumstances and where there is a real threat to the safety of an individual or individuals. The issue has to be considered against the background that in many instances where one only gets one side of the story, that will invariably be a subjective view.Following a breakdown of a relationship, much recrimination and point scoring may occur. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court should be welcomed and the remedy in that regard in the Bill is probably the right course of action, apart from the omission of the term "in exceptional circumstances,", to which I referred earlier. An eight day period seems reasonable. It has been suggested that, in an application of this nature with regard to an interim barring order, there should be very full exploration of the sufficiency of a protection order. When somebody is removed from the family home, that gives rise to its own difficulties in the relationship and otherwise. The position of children also has to be considered. The use of protection orders should be considered in any future amending legislation, if not in this Bill.The Supreme Court judgment found section 4 of the Act unconstitutional and required that the applicant should, as soon as possible, be able to satisfy the court, in the presence of the opposing party, that the order was properly granted. In that regard, and in the report to which I have referred, it was interesting that domestic violence did not feature as strongly – although the statistics indicated it was quite high at 53%, based on the criteria applied – in undermining relationships as criticism, insults and not listening, which tend to undermine the marriage relationship.The State has a role to play in ensuring that the facilities of the court are conducive to bringing the parties together if possible. I am aware that many judges try to do so. The circumstances must be taken into account. My local courthouse is located in the county hall. Local authority staff and legal personnel have commented on the fact that anybody attending the family law courts is on public view to everybody working in the county hall or visiting there. There is an onus on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to play its part in exercising sensitivity in this regard. People are entitled to reasonable privacy and nobody wishes to have their sins on public display. We should examine the possibility of defining the criteria to ensure the Bill is as finely honed as necessary to meet the requirements of safeguarding people on the one hand, while on the other hand respecting the absolute right of individuals not only to be heard but also to be protected by the State. When the legislation is implemented it should be closely monitored in the interests of all parties and of society as a whole.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	111	It is unfortunate to have to deal with such a Bill but following the ruling of the Supreme Court we all realised it was essential to amend the legislation at the earliest opportunity. The Leader was correct to ensure that all Stages of the Bill would come before the House today.It is sad to think that violence against women can be judicial as well as domestic. On the Order of Business earlier, we heard Senator Leyden refer to the case in Nigeria where a woman who had a child outside marriage has been sentenced to be stoned to death. There is a serious incidence of violence against women throughout the world.Domestic violence is particularly sad, of course, and apparently at this time of year it becomes worse than ever. As a doctor, I have often wondered if the medical profession could not do more to address the issue of domestic violence.I wish to place on the record of the House some details of the splendid work undertaken by a colleague of mine, Dr. Fiona Bradley, who, sadly, died recently at the age of 41. She carried out some incredible research on domestic violence in this country, with reference to hospital patients and general practice. Dr. Bradley collaborated on the research project with Mary Smith, research nurse, Jean Long, lecturer in international health and development, and Professor Tom O'Dowd, professor of general practice. Their work was published in the British Medical Journal of 2 February 2002 and won the JMS Doctor award in the category of general practice. Sadly, the award was presented at a ceremony on the day of Dr. Bradley's funeral. However, her work is a great memorial to her interest in domestic violence.We know that domestic violence is under-identified and there is considerable physical and psychological morbidity associated with it. Community surveys have indicated that up to one in four women in the United States experience domestic violence. However, according to various surveys carried out in the United States and Australia, some general practices are better at identifying domestic violence than others.Dr. Bradley set about studying the situation here and obtained the co-operation of 22 practices from all over the country. From March 1996 to May 1997, for two weeks in each practice, the receptionist was asked to hand female patients, over the age of 16, a pack comprising a consent form, a study briefing, a questionnaire for self-completion and a return envelope.The measure of domestic violence included in the questionnaire was adopted from various surveys on controlling behaviour, violent incidents and consequent injuries. The questionnaire also included questions as to whether general practitioners had ever asked if the women had suffered domestic violence, and if they felt it was right that a person's regular GP should ask such questions. Some 72% of patients responded to the survey, which is a good response rate, and the results were very interesting. The average age of the women who responded was 36.6 years. Some 75% of them were in a current sexual relationship and another 15% had been in such relationships formerly.Some 48% of the respondents said they had experienced domestic violence of some sort. Of those, 24% said they had experienced one form of violence, 25% said they had experienced two or three types of violence, 20% said they had experienced four to seven types of violence; and 31% of these women had experienced eight or more types of violence.The most commonly experienced behaviour was where a partner punched or kicked the walls or furniture, shouting at and threatening the children, and where the woman was pushed, grabbed or shoved. More serious violent incidents occurred as well. Some 10% of the women reported having been punched in the face; 10% were punched or kicked on the body, arms or legs; 9% were choked; and 9% were forced to have sex. These admissions are pretty shocking.Two of the most common controlling behaviours reported by the women who responded to the questionnaire were that their partners shouted or screamed at them, and also that they threatened violence against or were violent towards their children. It is not just the woman who is on the receiving end of domestic violence, it is the whole family. The effect on the children must be really dreadful.Many of these women did not present in the practice with injuries, but did present with anxiety and depression. A considerable number of them had received treatment for many years for anxiety and depression, and what is described as somatisation, which is where their mental anxiety causes them to have physical problems. The cost of this to the health service must be quite astonishing.Some 77% of the women who responded said they felt it would be right for the general practitioner whom they commonly attended to ask about domestic violence. In my own practice, I have only infrequently asked female patients about domestic violence. Only 5% of the respondents to Dr. Bradley's survey said they had ever been asked by their general practitioner if domestic violence could have been involved in their cases. The survey's findings provide much food for thought, particularly for those of my medical colleagues who are involved in general practice.Dr. Bradley carried out a similar survey in accident and emergency units where she or a nurse interviewed women who came in. In all such cases, a woman interviewed another woman and the survey was undertaken privately. It was found that a high percentage of the women who came in with bruising, broken noses or broken fingers had not suffered such injuries in falls but as a result of domestic violence. Hospital accident and emergency departments must ensure privacy for female patients so they can speak in confidence to medical and nursing staff who can then discover if domestic violence has caused them to attend the unit.It was not only young women who attended the accident and emergency units; women in their 60s and 70s frequently attended also. In these cases, the older women had not necessarily suffered violence as a result of their partner beating them up – in some cases their children were involved. We are not doing enough to address this serious issue.I wish to acknowledge the work that Dr. Bradley undertook. If only more of us in the medical profession were so concerned about examining the epidemiology of illness, perhaps we would not have such a serious situation in our casualty departments. I am quite sure that with counselling and investigation into family problems, a considerable amount of domestic violence could be addressed.The lack of privacy in family courts was raised by Senator Walsh. That is unacceptable. The family courts should sit in private. The Court Services has attempted to examine the issue of what happens in the family courts and I have raised it in this House also.Often we do not realise how serious these cases are. An attempt was made last year to appoint a barrister to the courts to compile a report in this regard. However, the then Attorney General felt the in camera rule would be breached if this were to happen. The barrister concerned is no longer employed by the Court Services as her contract expired in April. She was unable to produce reports even though they would have been anonymous and undertaken with people who had given consent for their cases to be addressed.We have to find some way of addressing this issue. I am sure the Minister is as concerned as I am – I see him nodding – about this matter. People do not understand just how serious these cases frequently are. Senator Terry's concerns regarding the eight days need to be taken into account in this regard also.Men are often injured in domestic violence incidents. They, too, feel threatened and abused in the home. I have worked in casualty departments and it is only in approximately one out of every seven cases that such incidents arise. The main reason women are abused is that they are physically smaller.

A heavily pregnant woman told me her arm was broken when her husband rolled over it in the bed. We need to make a greater effort to deal with these cases, not just in the courts but in accident and emergency units and within general practice. We should look closely at the work carried out by Dr. Bradley in this regard to see if we can prevent such incidents and thereby reduce the need for barring orders. We should also seek a satisfactory outcome within partnerships.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I, too, welcome the Minister to the House to introduce this timely and necessary Bill. Trends in recent years clearly indicate an increase in the incidence of domestic violence at this time of year. I agree with the Minister that the Bill is aimed specifically at restoring the power to put barring orders in place ex parte in a manner which conforms to constitutional requirements. Equally, it is a necessary and welcome Bill because we cannot continue as we are as a result of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard last October.We are legislators have a responsibility to protect the vulnerable in society. We must introduce whatever laws are necessary to ensure that protection. We have all heard the term, "street angel and house devil", something so apparent in the area of domestic violence. It is not just the two parties involved in domestic violence who are under threat during such incidents; the children and extended families also suffer the consequences. The effect on children is long term. There is evidence to suggest that children who come from violent backgrounds go on to become perpetrators of similar violence in their adult life. They do not conform to or play a full role in society because their upbringing was affected by domestic violence.Domestic violence is not confined to spouses or partners. The growing number of applications to District Courts for barring orders against adult children by elderly parents is alarming. We are faced with a situation where adult children, as a result of alcohol or drug abuse, are becoming violent in the home towards their elderly parents. That point is often missed in debates such as this. Elderly parents are being forced to seek barring orders against their adult children. We need to highlight this problem and remain conscious of it because there are enormous social implications for everyone. Our elderly people deserve to be protected in every way.A number of provisions contained in the Bill need to be put on the record if for no other reason than to alert Members to the facts and statistics surrounding domestic violence. It would be remiss to think domestic violence is confined to women; a percentage of men suffer it also. We need to acknowledge that fact and ensure we afford them similar protection.Women's groups warn that over one in five women will suffer domestic violence this Christmas season. That means that between 20% and 25% of women will be beaten by their spouses or partners. The National Network of Women's Refuge and Support Services say its 32 centres around the country will be full on St. Stephen's Day as a result of domestic violence incidents. There were 10,877 Garda call-outs to domestic violence incidents in 2000; in 1999 the number of such incidents reported to gardaí increased by 20% over 1998. Of the 4,578 barring orders applied for in the year 2000, 2,142 were granted. The safety and sanction research into domestic violence and enforcement of law in Ireland in 1999 conducted by Women's Aid indicated that children were present at and witnessed a significant amount of domestic violence incidents in the home.Ninety-six women were murdered by their spouses or partners in the past seven years. We are not alone in these statistics. Battering is the single biggest cause of injury to women in the USA with 4,000 women a year being beaten to death by their partner. In Sweden, every ten days a woman is beaten to death and its 115 refuge centres are constantly full. Twenty-five per cent of women in Britain suffer physical abuse from their partners. In Canada, 39% of women report having been assaulted at some stage.We, in Ireland, have a unique distinction in this area, the pervasive and wicked influence of alcohol in our society. Only last week we debated the consequences of alcohol abuse among young people. It is fair to correlate that abuse with young people if it is to continue into their adult life, thereby contributing to these statistics and, unfortunately, increasing them.Domestic violence and alcohol abuse are directly related. In discussing the legal framework within which to deal with domestic violence we must also look at what causes it. We have to be seen to take action by raising awareness through education campaigns to prevent alcohol abuse, a major factor in domestic violence. Christmas is a time of high emotion. It is, equally, a time when barring orders become necessary and are often breached. It is imperative that we, as legislators, enact this Bill to provide those vulnerable in society with the necessary protection of the courts at this time of year. The culture of taking alcohol to celebrate every occasion from birth to death is something we must consider seriously. We must get it right and this is an opportunity to do so.We must protect the vulnerable and emphasise the effect of domestic violence on children. At Christmas time, when children's expectation are so high, it is very worrying if households or family units are destroyed by domestic violence, particularly if we do not have in place the necessary legislation to provide protection for these children. That is one of the reasons I welcome this Bill. We must protect children, the guardian of these children and the parent who is responsible for them. We cannot allow victims to fall through legal loopholes. I commend the Minister for his timely action on this issue.The law as it stood was an accident waiting to happen. The two primary areas of justice are that no man should be a judge in his own case and, equally, one must hear the other side, which is true but not possible at all times. In the case of direct evidence, protection must be given and the court must act to restrain further violence, possibly fatal violence if the court does not act. For that reason I welcome the Bill. Given the rise in family law cases, there need to be dedicated judges or courts in the area of family law who can bring their expertise and wisdom to bear in this field.I wish to pay tribute to the many refuge centres, including Connolly House and Edel House in Cork city which provide such a valuable service. I acknowledge the contribution made by medical practitioners and pharmacists who at times are the first people to identify domestic violence. These people have an integral role to play in protecting the most vulnerable in our society. I commend the Bill to the House.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I thank the Minister of State for coming here for the debate. I welcome the Bill, subject to the amendments I have tabled and on which I will expand further on Committee Stage. I am pleased the Bill has come before the House so quickly because the limbo created by the result of the Supreme Court judgment needs to be dealt with as soon as possible. I reiterate that it is inappropriate to take all Stages together because the important issues raised by the Supreme Court must be carefully addressed.I recognise the need for this type of legislation, which is very important for dealing with emergencies and protecting the vulnerable and those at risk. On the other hand, I agree with the finding of the Supreme Court. My experience as a solicitor is that this measure could be subject to abuse. It is very important to have fair procedures in place so that both sides of the case are heard, subject to some emergency provisions. There are huge consequences from the issuing of an interim barring order, particularly if the case is not heard very rapidly. Many knock-on consequences could affect other decisions made by the family law courts or criminal courts. Therefore, it would not be right to prolong the matter without having a fair hearing of the issues involved. I will table amendments dealing with a return date for the hearing and a provision for undertakings to be given to the court, an issue raised by the Supreme Court.There should be a review of the whole family law area. Groups and individuals rightly raised the question of the need for men's rights to be addressed within the system. From my experience, I believe the system treats men unfairly and it treats women unfairly in other ways. It is important to ensure there are supports in place for families or individuals subjected to domestic violence.The Eastern Regional Health Authority statistics for 1999 indicated that two out of three people who sought refuge with the health board were refused places in refuge centres. People who are violent need to be punished but they also need help. We need to help families in general and to bring about a less adversarial family law system. It is very important to have counselling programmes in place and to recognise that violence takes many forms. Older people and children can be subjected to domestic violence.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill to the House. The Minister must be congratulated on the speed with which he has brought the Bill before us because the issue was the subject of a court judgment just two months ago. It indicates the necessity to deal with this horrible crime which is part of our daily life.When preparing for today, I was gobsmacked when I read some of the statistics. Senator Minihan referred to the fact that one in five will experience violence at some stage in their relationships. He also referred to the time of year which is now approaching. Another statistic I noted is that 83 women have been murdered in this country since the end of 1995, 54 of whom were murdered in their own homes, 37 by people they knew. As that is a horrendous statistic in anyone's language, it is essential to have tight legislation to deal with the problem. It is a problem we have been slow to come to terms with.I recall listening earlier this year to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, in his former capacity as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He posed a question to his audience which for me captured the indifference in our attitudes towards domestic violence. He asked people to imagine if today's newspapers or television carried a story that a new risk threatened people, and that risk would challenge between 10% and 20% of the population. He said a large number of those affected would require hospitalisation and some would even die. Most of those affected would suffer for the rest of their lives and in a large number of instances children would be affected. He asked what the audience thought the response would be. Would we as a society do nothing about it? Would everyone say it was not their problem, it was not a matter for legislation, it was somebody's else's problem? Would the media run the story for a day, week or month? If a year on we still had done nothing about it, would there be a public outcry? He asked if it was not a fact that the risk was already among us in its ugliest manifestation, namely, domestic violence.That captured for me the indifferent attitude we as a society have towards domestic violence. Thankfully, that attitude has been changing in recent times. Credit for that must go to the Taoiseach because when he went into office in 1997 one of the first things he initiated was the national steering committee. The focus of the national steering committee was to bring about a cohesive and multiagency approach to domestic violence. Eight regional committees were established to deal with the matter in a more cohesive and localised manner, which is a demonstration of the Government's changing attitude to this issue.It is right that we should acknowledge the fine work of non-governmental agencies such as the rape crisis centres and the women's refuges. Such organisations have given hope to those who have suffered from domestic violence. Their extremely important work is appreciated by those who have availed of it and by successive Governments. As someone who works in the voluntary sector, I can imagine the problems that are faced by the groups to which I have referred in terms of fundraising. They chase down benefactors and peddle boxes of flags to raise money to provide a service that the Government has not been providing to a sufficient extent. Many other bodies deserve the same credit as the two I mentioned for contributing in a meaningful way. It is good to note that, during its 1997 to 2002 term of office, the Government increased funding for the agencies from €3.8 million to €11.5 million.The importance of providing information for those who suffer domestic violence cannot be overstated. They need to know that information services are available. The national steering committee, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has run tremendous awareness campaigns and has sent out a great deal of information in relation to the services that are available. In the past, domestic violence was considered a private matter and not one for legislation. A family row in a rural area was kept indoors as there was a pride factor – it would be considered that one had let the family down if one reported one's experiences of domestic violence. I am sure that a great deal of hardship was endured by many women who were afraid, perhaps as a result of their pride, to let it be known that there was a problem in their homes.We need to educate the public to change its attitude to domestic violence. We have to ensure that the legal process is adequate and that those charged with the responsibility of dealing with this issue, including the Garda Síochána, have the relevant knowledge to deal with it effectively. Perceptions are beginning to change and rightly so. It is past time this happened. People other than the man or woman concerned suffer when instances of domestic violence take place because children are often involved. I recently read that a child is either present or in the next room during 80% of domestic violence incidents, a statistic that emerged from international research.One can only imagine the effect on a child of seeing his or her parents having a row that manifests itself in the form of physical violence. When such an incident is etched on the minds of children, they show it in different ways. Perhaps the worst thing they can do is to keep it bottled up and it is better if they externalise their feelings. We need to ensure that the necessary facilities and tools are available to those charged with recognising the symptoms of the problems I have mentioned, so they can put in place the mechanisms necessary to deal with the issues.We must create an ethos whereby sufferers of violence know that people care for them and their children. In the event of sufferers revealing the tragedy of domestic abuse, it is important that a caring and professional system is in place to assist them. It is important that GPs and the staff of accident and emergency departments are skilled in recognising what needs to be done to deal with domestic violence. Medical personnel should keep accurate and comprehensive records so that trends and patterns of violence can be recognised.I welcome the Bill and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for bringing it to the House so swiftly. I look forward to its quick passage.

It is good that he is in the House for this debate because he has an expert knowledge of these matters.Domestic violence is a serious matter and there is an urgent need for the Bill after the recent Supreme Court ruling. Irrespective of one's views on the matter, we cannot ignore the fact that the Supreme Court has determined that section 4(3) of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 – passed by the Oireachtas having been brought forward by the former Minister, Mr. Mervyn Taylor – is defective constitutionally. When the courts make such a determination, we have to take the matter very seriously under our constitutional procedures. The Oireachtas is obliged to respond to an absence of rights that has been in place in relation to section 4(3) for the last six years. The amendments that Senator Terry and I will propose later attempt to implement both the letter and the spirit of the Supreme Court ruling, as set out some weeks ago.The Minister of State is aware that some serious issues were raised in the ruling to which I refer. When the legislation was being discussed in these Houses in 1996, the former Minister, Mr. Taylor, said that the provision that one's home could be forfeited on the basis of an application that comes before the courts was a draconian power. Quite rightly in my view, the Supreme Court made two rulings in relation to interim barring orders. The court said, first, that a time limit should be imposed on the barring orders in question and, second, that respondents have a right to know all the evidence proffered against them. The Minister of State knows that it is a fundamental principle of justice and an aspect of any summons that goes before a court that a person has the right to defend himself against any charges to be proffered against him and has a right to know the evidence as set out in the courts. Having read it, the Supreme Court judgment seems to be a logical application of the jurisprudence that exists in this country. It was a considerable oversight on the part of the Oireachtas in 1996 that it did not foresee this problem.When I spoke on the Order of Business earlier, I was not speaking against the Bill but simply making the point that we need to take our time to ensure we get it right this time. As we do not want to make the same mistake again, it is important that this legislation is debated fully, as it has been so far today. I hope it will be thoroughly examined on Committee and Report Stages and that many of the issues to which I refer will be ironed out as part of the House's discourse with the Minister of State, who is an expert on these matters. I believe he will respond clearly to the amendments that will be proposed.Domestic violence is a tragedy for men, women and families and it is sad that the State has to intervene. There are circumstances in which it is necessary, for the benefit of children and the individuals involved, for the State to have the power to legislate for interim ex parte barring orders, particularly at this time of year.Many men are concerned, not with the law passed by the Oireachtas, but with the application of it in the courts. I was very struck when I entered elected politics, representing an ostensibly working class constituency in Dublin, at the number of men who complained to me about court rulings. They said they had been dealt with unfairly, that there was a presumption of guilt attached to them and that for them, at least, their experience of the courts, particularly of barring orders in the family law courts, was unfair. Much of that is perception – the courts have to decide these issues – but we must respond to it. The issue of domestic violence is greater than just the appalling circumstances for women.The Minister of State is involved in the Department of Health and Children and I ask him to put pressure on his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to publish a report on domestic violence which has been on his desk for the last three years. It is the most exhaustive study of domestic violence ever carried out in the State. We would be in a better position to judge much of the anecdotal and empirical evidence which has been heard in this debate if this report were published. As Senator Walsh pointed out, there are cases of domestic violence against men and we must ensure fairness and due process in the courts' deliberations on these sanctions.I ask the Minister to publish this report once and for all, to get it out into the public domain and ensure that the largest possible survey of domestic violence is published as soon as possible so that we know the evidence.I generally welcome the Bill but caution all Members to give it the respect and attention to detail that it requires. It is rare for a Bill to come before the House concerning legislation passed by the Oireachtas on which the Supreme Court has ruled so emphatically.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on his speedy response in bringing the Bill before the House. Only two months ago the Supreme Court ruled that section 3(4) of the Domestic Violence Act was unconstitutional. The general public, as well as politicians, have always been too ready to criticise Ministers and their Departments for being slow, particularly with legislation such as this. We seem to be painstakingly slow at times, but well done to the Minister on his speedy response in this instance.It is our duty as legislators to make sure we have laws which will protect and create a safe place for all of us. Many victims of abuse, believe, wrongly, that our laws do not protect them or their children. It is very difficult for any man, woman or child to be caught up in domestic violence. I agree with Senator Hayes that the whole area of domestic violence is a terrible tragedy. It is not just the domain of women and children. Men are also the victims of domestic violence. Perhaps we should think about how male victims feel. They are a small minority but they feel less a man. It is very difficult for them.I had lunch with five school friends last Saturday. One of them is a victim of a very unhappy marriage which she went into on the basis of what she thought was a very loving relationship. She experienced domestic violence on her honeymoon. Her husband used to kick her, bite her and pinch her, always on parts of her body which would not be noticed. She became pregnant with her first child after a year and the beatings continued. They became worse when the baby was born and she never thought of looking for help. She never shared it with any of us, her friends, because she thought it was not the type of thing that happened to people like her. Domestic violence happens across the board, regardless of socio-economic circumstances. She eventually looked for help when her baby was four. She was on the ground, unconscious, and woke up to the child screaming and crying, "Please don't die on me, Mummy". Her suffering continues today. She is still a victim. She is legally separated but the verbal abuse continues. Statistics show that 76% of separated couples still experience violence, whether it is verbal or physical. They still feel threatened.The way to deal with stigmas is to talk about them and I am glad we are having this debate. I wish it could go further than the Houses of the Oireachtas. We need to build an environment where victims will feel safe, protected and part of the system. There have been many figures given out today and I will not go back over them. However, I was surprised to read a survey recently carried out by the Rotunda. Out of 400 pregnant women surveyed, 12.5% of them experienced very severe domestic violence while they were pregnant.Another point to bear in mind, and Senator Minihan alluded to it, is that children are part of domestic violence. They are the innocent victims. Their parents could be in a bedroom, while they are in another listening to what is going on. Worse still, they might witness their father beating their mother or, in some cases, their mother being abusive to her husband.I welcome the Bill but I would like to see special family court sittings in high density areas. Perhaps there could be more family-friendly sittings where a mother could leave children to school or to a baby minder when she goes to court, rather than having to bring the children into the court with her.Senator Terry said earlier today she was rather sad that we were rushing the legislation through. The legislation has come at the right time and has not been rushed through. This is a very emotional time of year when we experience high levels of stress, alcohol consumption and debt. All of this, unfortunately, leads to people losing their heads. The fists are very much to the fore. A house which does not experience something like this is very lucky. Christmas should be a time of harmony and peace. It is a time when we reflect and think of people who are less well off. I welcome the Bill, which comes at the right time. I again compliment the Minister of State on his speedy response.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It is to be hoped that the Domestic Violence (Amendment) Bill, 2002, will copperfasten protection for victims of this insidious but extremely prevalent blot on family life. Concerns widely raised about the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, must be urgently addressed. Like other Members, I would like to have more time to debate this Bill but I see that it is important to get it passed before the Christmas recess.Domestic abuse is often shrouded in secrecy. Many couples, especially in rural areas, live their married lives in a more discreet and less open way than those in urban areas. They can be the silent victims of abuse as they feel hidden away from the world outside. In a sense they are the living affirmation of the hidden nature of abuse. They are unable to confide in outsiders or other members of their families. It is often the case that the true picture of a life of hell is not revealed until after the death of the bullying partner. This is sad but it is also unacceptable.The holding of domestic violence cases in camera is also contributing to the culture of secrecy surrounding such issues. A new approach of openness and accountability would enable victims to read about such cases, realise that they are not alone in their suffering and seek help. During the period of abuse the victims are often unaware of or afraid to tap into the range of confidential services available to them. Services such as the Rape Crisis Centre, Women's Aid and AMEN provide invaluable assistance to abuse sufferers. I compliment them on their work.The 2001 Garda annual report states that of all cases investigated that year, 10,000 related to domestic violence incidents. Last year more than a thousand callers to Women's Aid had endured an abusive relationship for more than 30 years. This represents a whole lifetime destroyed by abuse, whether physical, sexual or mental. The three types of abuse are not mutually exclusive and the abuser often uses mental abuse such as intimidation and bullying to prevent his or her abused partner from leaving. Although physical abuse is more evident to a neighbour or outsider, mental abuse is equally traumatic for the victim. Last year Women's Aid received a far greater number of calls reporting mental abuse than physical abuse. Disturbingly, in 2001 more than 60% of victims of sexual abuse had been abused by someone known to them, such as a relative, partner or a date. This confirms the domestic nature of abuse. Sadly, the person from whom help should be available is too often the person who has instigated the abuse.The amendments we are debating will provide greater protection to victims of domestic violence and the legislation will address last month's Supreme Court ruling on the unconstitutionality of interim barring orders because of the absence of time limits on the operation of such orders and other concerns raised by those working in this area with regard to the Domestic Violence Act, 1996. This Act allows one partner to go to the District Court and swear information to apply for an interim barring order against the other partner, who does not have to be notified. No time limit is set on the operation of the order, which can stay in place until a full hearing. In delivering the judgment of the court, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Keane, said that the Legislature's failure to impose any time limits on orders with such draconian consequences was inexplicable. In the resultant confusion, some perpetrators of abuse have moved back with their partners following the rescinding of interim barring orders, forcing women to take refuge in emergency accommodation.Interim barring orders were created to protect women where the court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is an immediate risk of significant harm to the applicant or any dependent person if the order is not made immediately, and the granting of a protection order would not be sufficient to protect the applicant or any dependent person. The rescinding of the interim barring order has created a vacuum in which women are without adequate recourse to legal protection and it is imperative that the current wait of ten to 12 days before a barring order hearing takes place is reduced to seven days. Senator Terry referred to an eight day period and that would also be acceptable.Victims of domestic violence, regardless of gender, must be protected by every means we have available, but in doing so we must not create new victims. Justice must be done and be seen to be done, fairly and equitably. This important legislation must leave no room for loopholes.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and promise him to try not to use the same lines as everybody else. Everybody is in agreement that this amendment to the legislation is necessary. The Supreme Court judgment implied strongly that the rights of all parties must be taken into consideration and I agree. As a woman – although I do not want to create a line – I feel we must talk only about violence, whether it is perpetrated against men or women. That is why I am here. We are trying to discover how best to eliminate the violence that is out there. This is a timely issue. Nobody is saying that the legislation was not useful and I congratulate the former Government and Taoiseach on it, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, who, with her interest in eliminating violence, spearheaded this legislation. We can have all the legislation in the world, but how can we be sure it will be effective on the ground? That is the fundamental question facing all of us. How do we know that violence is not taking place in some household at a particular point in time? How can we as a society face up to this serious problem?People have asked why domestic violence happens. Somebody once told me it was because we need to feel power and control and for some people, the only way to feel this is by beating and bullying. They feel they can only keep control and hold power if they adopt this approach. Domestic violence affects all social classes in all regions. Quality of life is destroyed for many families. The impact on children is very significant. In my former career I came across domestic violence many times. One would notice the children coming into school suffering from the effects of the night before. It affected their progress, demeanour and discipline, but they could not themselves identify what was wrong.We must do everything we can to break the cycle of violence. The national steering committee set up by the previous Government has gone a long way in that regard by putting in place directives on reaching out to health boards, NGOs and services for women experiencing violence. Information should now be available in libraries, Garda stations and hospitals. Such information is not always available. For example, I contacted a Garda station today and it was not available there. The steering committee has stated that its terms of reference would ensure information is available in schools, health boards and libraries. Even if it is available in these places, could a vulnerable woman look for it? We must create an effective national awareness campaign that is not just a once-off. It must be ongoing and make society face up to the fact that this is a real problem that cannot be swept under the carpet.Domestic violence is a crime, a social problem, and legislators should be fighting against it. We will never be rid of it entirely, but we must acknowledge and help those affected. We must let them know that there is a refuge for them, that they can get out, that local authorities can provide vital accommodation and that the health boards will help.If we increase funding, it must be reflected in better services. The training of hospital personnel for those who arrive in accident and emergency units as a result of domestic violence is important. Front-line personnel should know the difference between ordinary accidents and violent abuse. Schools should also receive funding for the physical and psychological needs of young people.I am glad this legislation is being amended, but the Minister of State must ensure it is implemented in a manner whereby the public can see that there is protection for those being abused. We must never stop talking about this issue and ensure it remains on the agenda.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I thank Senators for their contributions and the constructive way in which they have approached this measure. It is an important measure that has been necessitated by the decision of the Supreme Court. This debate has been wide-ranging, covering not only the legislation but exploring the implications of violence in family relationships and the resultant problems posed for our health services.I commend the work of the Garda in this area. Senator Ormonde mentioned that the legislation must be seen to be implemented. Much of its implementation falls squarely on the shoulders of gardaí who are called to deal with difficult and sensitive circumstances in many households and to administer and interpret this legislation in as fair a way as possible to the parties before it comes to judicial determination.Senators mentioned the technical aspects of the legislation and the legal formulations used. I would prefer to address those issues in committee. Senator Terry referred to the financial implications of the measure and the strains on the legal aid service and the courts system. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the implementation of the Bill will give rise to additional court hearings to decide whether or not to confirm interim barring orders made ex parte, but it does not have any necessary financial implications. Even under the arrangement condemned by the Supreme Court, the matter had to return to court at some stage so there is no increase in the volume of work of the courts, although this legislation means they will have to work at a faster pace. That is no bad thing.Senator Jim Walsh referred to our view of marriage. Initiatives by the health boards, such as the Springboard initiative, are funded by the Department of Health and Children and seek to intervene as early as possible to protect the welfare of children where there is a difficult parenting position and ensure those children get the chance to advance in life. Initiatives can be taken by Government agencies but the State cannot become a parent. We must have standards of parenting at a social level. The State cannot be expected to fund indefinitely the parenting of all children. We would not have the resources to do that no matter how great our prosperity. We must affirm the importance of parents in setting an example and taking responsibility for children.The Supreme Court was very critical of us for using the phrase "exceptional circumstances" in the initial legislation and I understand why Senators refer to the issue. It should be exceptional to remove anyone from a family home, but when the courts have to deal with this, they cannot make a judgment about how common this exceptional circumstance is as a social phenomenon. They have to view it in the light of immediate circumstances. The urgency, rather than the exceptional character of the circumstances, is what impresses itself upon a court.The Court Services Commission has done much in the area of court facilities and progress has been made in recent years compared to the circumstances that obtained when I commenced legal practice.Senator Henry gave an interesting account of the medical phenomenon of violence against women. As a medical practitioner, we must give weight to her opinion that the trend of the statistics is for far more violence against women than against any other group, while not denying that violence is perpetrated against many different family members.The Senator also raised the issue of the publicity of court proceedings in family matters. It is an important issue and we must be careful in this area. We must respect the privacy of family proceedings, but the standard of criticism that must take place in such cases is at issue. The Constitution is clear that justice must be administered in public save in such specially limited circumstances as are prescribed by law. The bulk of matrimonial and family law proceedings are way beyond the specially limited circumstance and amount to much of the business of the courts. The programme for Government contained a commitment to consider this area.The courts are not accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas or the Government. However, they are accountable to public opinion which cannot be formed if there is not some form of publicity about the decisions being made. There are no proposals in this measure to deal with that, but it must be examined and there is a commitment for that in the programme for Government.Senators referred to the fact that there are sensitive issues with regard to the necessary privacy which parties to these proceedings would wish to see obtain. There is an equal need to ensure that what the courts do is subject to public scrutiny. There is a difficult balance to be struck and the Government has made a commitment to address this issue, which was raised by Senator Hayes.Senator Minihan welcomed the legislation and stressed the need for social provision and refuge centres. He also commented on the social phenomenon of violence, a matter to which Senators Feeney, Bannon, Ormonde, Kett and Tuffy also referred. It is a phenomenon that has always been there, but one that must be openly addressed by the Oireachtas.The legislation has been introduced to respond to the concerns of the Supreme Court on the legal aspect of the problem. I hope I have dealt with most of the points of substance raised by Senators on Second Stage. If there are particular issues, I would prefer to deal with them in committee as they relate to the technical character of the legislation.

In page 3, line 11, to delete "having regard to the circumstances of the particular case," and substitute "in exceptional circumstances".I ask that the amendment be adopted. I agree with the Minister of State that every case is urgent, but the provision of the clause "in exceptional circumstances" is extremely important to groups representing people who find themselves in these situations. Those groups have asked me to impress strongly on the Minister of State the importance of having this phrase reinstated in the Bill. The Supreme Court decision did not require these words to be removed, which is important. It is mentioned in the court's decision that the criteria are not available to it. I suggest we put that clause, as provided for in the Act, in the Bill and that the criteria be drawn up. It would not take a lawyer long to draw up such criteria if the Minister of State accepts the amendment. It is important to the groups with a strong interest in the Bill that the words should be retained.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I second the amendment in the name of Senator Terry. From my understanding of the Supreme Court proceedings, the State, in the action it took in defending the 1996 legislation, referred to the exceptional cases provision as set out in that legislation. The Supreme Court ruling stated that:There is no indication of the criteria by which the District Court in the case of an ex parte application for an interim barring order is to decide whether it is an exceptional case in which it is necessary or expedient in the interests of justice to grant the application.The court has clearly stated that there are not, as Senator Terry pointed out, criteria established whereby these cases can be determined.Other Supreme Court rulings map out what the court believes the Legislature should follow. I would have thought with regard to this issue that the court has asked the Oireachtas to map out the circumstances by which interim ex parte barring orders can be established. That is why the amendment has been put in my name and that of Senator Terry. If we were to establish the character and criteria to be used in the District Court, it could be to the benefit of the courts in establishing the validity of these barring orders. Senator Terry and I are interested to hear the Minister's response.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The amendment promises much but fulfils little in the sense that it does not provide the desiderata or criteria which are to be operated on by the courts. This is the difficulty with the amendment, which I cannot accept. It is an important issue and I understand the motivation behind the amendment.The amendment says that the phrase "having regard to the circumstances of the particular case," should be deleted and replaced with the term "in exceptional circumstances". If that was done, no criteria at all would be provided.Senator Terry points out that we are not obliged to follow opinion on this matter, that the Supreme Court is not the Legislature and that the Oireachtas has a separate voice on this. Nonetheless, the court has expressed the opinion that the phrase "in exceptional circumstances" is meaningless. It would not do the House credit if the Bill was amended and that meaningless phrase restored. To give that phrase flesh and blood, an outline would have to be given in the legislation – a task that has eluded the Opposition Senators who have tabled this proposal.The Senators have not specified what exceptional circumstances are envisaged. This is not an easy task. The proposal before the House is that we simply use the phrase "having regard to the circumstances of the particular case". That leaves it to the courts to determine this issue and I accept that. The courts in general are entrusted with a lot of discretion in the area of family law provision and matrimonial law, whether on the division of property, the exclusion of parties from the family home or the determination of appropriate sums of maintenance. These matters are left to the discretion of the court in the particular circumstances of a case.As Members know from their work as public representatives, the variety of circumstances that can arise in family proceedings is extraordinary. To devise a legislative formula to cover all these circumstances would be a difficult task and, because of that, many of these matters are left to the court to determine in a particular case. By sending out a signal to the courts that this is now an order that can only have a finite duration, its temporary and provisional character is highlighted. I am not prepared to accept an amendment that would go beyond that and say that a phrase to which the Supreme Court took exception should be restored to the legislation.From reading the speech of the then Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, on Second Stage in this House on 31 January 1996, it is apparent that the ex parte interim barring order was seen as a remedy for what were, in Mr. Taylor's words, “extreme cases”. I refer here to cases where there is evidence that there is an immediate and serious risk of significant harm to an applicant or dependent person if the order is not made immediately and the court is satisfied that the granting of a protection order would not grant sufficient protection. It is known that the granting of interim orders ex parte rather than on notice became a more widespread practice rather than an exception, notwithstanding the existence of that express legislative provision. This happened because the criterion for the granting of an interim order in practice is that there would be an immediate risk of significant harm to an applicant or a dependant. Those are the circumstances that any court examining this matter would act upon and rely upon.Once such a provision is introduced, it is difficult to set a limit on it. The reason I suspect the Supreme Court did not find favour with the provision on exceptional cases is that it appears to relate to the sociology of the provision rather than giving any guidance on its legal interpretation. For those reasons, I am unable to accept the amendment, although I understand the motivation of those who moved it.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I am disappointed the Minister of State will not accept my amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I understand the Minister of State's reply. It is difficult to define an exceptional case in statute law. However, when the legislation was initially put through this House and the other House, a former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, referred to the fact that the granting of such orders was confined to extreme cases. He did not define what he meant by "extreme cases"; he left it to the application of the courts. The Supreme Court ruling on this matter seems to rap us across the knuckles for our failure to establish what we believe to be exceptional cases. We are not attempting to slow down the progress of this important Bill, but we must return to this issue. It is not always the case that the courts want to be the sole arbitrators in such matters. They want a set of circumstances under which they can determine, based on the evidence, what is in the interests of natural justice. This is one of the cases where our knuckles were rapped. We will not be able to devise new criteria between now and 6 p.m., given that we have failed to do so since the Supreme Court ruling.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	133	While I accept some of the arguments, the points made by the Minister of State are valid. It will probably be difficult and time consuming to draft criteria. It is desirable that such criteria should be drafted and enacted as soon as possible because there are time constraints. Many Senators said that this Bill must be placed on the Statute Book as soon as possible, particularly given the time of the year and the fact that alcohol is a factor in such cases. We must have regard for the serious decision taken by the court, namely, that someone will be barred from their home and will not be allowed to contact their children. Section 1(3)(a) states, “An interim barring order may be made ex parte where, having regard to the circumstances of the particular case, the court considers it necessary or expedient to do so in the interests of justice.” A lawyer may have a different interpretation of “expedient” from my interpretation of it. The phrase, “or expedient”, suggests a lower level of qualifying criteria on which a decision may be based. I have some concerns about that. Perhaps the Minister of State might consider that between now and Report Stage. The phrase, “necessary or expedient”, seems to dilute the necessity for a barring order. Perhaps my more legally qualified colleague, the Minister of State, will respond to that.

We must take into account the Supreme Court's pronouncement that these words are meaningless. I do not say that because half of them are constituents of mine, although that is part of the equation. While we are not run by them, it seems unusual to put back into the legislation wording which has been thus described.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	136	No one has a monopoly on legal expertise in this House. We are not the first with the best intentions to have created the worst, as Shakespeare once said. I agree that we must be careful about the words we use. The phrase "necessary or expedient" was mentioned. That was included in the original legislation. Expediency as well as necessity were imported as ideas from the original legislation. That is why they are included in this provision. We will examine the standards or criteria which should be applied in such cases in our review of family law legislation. Although there are many matters on which we have given a discretion to the courts, the exercise of a discretion in such a case raises far reaching questions. As regards the phrase, "in the interests of justice", the right of ownership and residence in a family home is a matter of justice as well as the protection of the spouse.It is a difficult balancing position and that is why we, as a Legislature, have tended to leave the difficult task of deciding that balance to the courts. The fact that we are complying with the judgment of the Supreme Court in this legislation and setting a definite time limit on such an order is the most important signal to send. If we lose sight of that, we will get lost in discussing the technicalities of certain phrases. We are saying to the courts that there is a time limit on this order which they must respect. That, in itself, imports the ideas about which Senators are concerned in this discussion.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 3, line 31, to delete "working".I wish to delete the word "working" so that the paragraph reads: "The order shall have effect for a period, not exceeding 8 days." If amendment No. 3 is accepted, amendment No. 7 will also be accepted. The Supreme Court described the Child Care Act, 1991, as a model which enabled the District Court, on the application of a health board, to make a care order in respect of a child without notice to the parent, where this is required, in the interests of justice or the welfare of the child. Such an order, unless the health board and the parent have custody consent, must not be for a period exceeding eight days. I want the same to apply in this case. Unless the Minister of State can give me a good reason why eight working days should be applied, I ask for it to be changed to eight days.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I can, but the Senator has raised an interesting point. The Senator's intention appears to be to have a return date of eight days rather than eight working days when an interim barring order has been granted ex parte. It is true that the Supreme Court referred with approval to that section of the Child Care Act, 1991, to which the Senator has referred. Section 17 of that Act provided for the making of an interim care order in respect of a child, including on an ex parte basis, effective for a period not exceeding eight days. However, the Supreme Court – and the Supreme Court can sometimes err too – did not advert to the fact that the eight day period had been amended to 28 days by section 267(1)(a) of the Children Act, 2001.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I said that earlier.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	149	The analogy begins to disintegrate because the Oireachtas has, in a more recent provision, provided for a period of 28 days. The provision in the Bill is closer to the 28 days than the Senator's amendment.In this Bill it has been decided to propose a period of eight working days rather than eight days, or indeed 28 days. Advice has been taken from the Attorney General on the constitutionality of this. A working day is defined as a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday, within the meaning of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997. Public holidays under this Act are Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter Monday, the first Monday in June, the first Monday in August, the last Monday in October and the first of January and, where relevant, the following weekday when a public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday.The provision for eight working days gives far greater flexibility to the courts than would be the case with eight days. For example, with eight working days an ex parte order granted on Monday, 23 December next would expire on Monday, 6 January next. If the period were eight days it would expire on 30 December and the court would have to sit on that day or earlier. It is, of course, true that this is a greater imposition on the respondent than eight days would be, but it is not an excessive period or a disproportionate abridgement of the rights of the respondent under the Constitution.For these reasons I cannot accept these amendments. I am concerned, in particular, when we took the advice of the Attorney General on a matter as sensitive as this that we should stay within that context.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Is the Minister saying that the difficulty arises from the number of days the courts are sitting? That difficulty can arise in certain circumstances, given the very lengthy holidays taken by our colleagues in the courts. It would be entirely inappropriate if that were the reasoning. Can the Minister confirm or deny that?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I deny it, of course. It has no connection with that matter, which is settled under rules of court and upon which Senators, I am sure, have their own views. As the Senator is aware, the District Court, where the bulk of these applications are made, does not enjoy the benefit of the extensive vacation enjoyed by the other courts. I gave that illustration not in reference to court vacations but because the courts do not sit on the particular holidays prescribed in the Organisation of Working Time Act, which the Oireachtas has prescribed for the nation at large. In those circumstances it seems appropriate to take those into account in legislation of this character, something that could not have been taken into account in the 1991 Act.

In page 4, line 2, after "court" to insert "and in specifying the date on which the order shall lapse, the court shall specify a date, on or before the first mentioned date, for the hearing of any application that may be brought by the applicant to confirm the order".One of the main reasons for this Bill is to ensure a speedy return date. The Bill goes part of the way to achieving this but it does not ensure a return date within eight days. This amendment would guarantee that.As the Bill stands an interim barring order could lapse and the applicant would have to re-apply for an interim barring order. Meanwhile the respondent will have an unresolved court order hanging over him or her. The order may have lapsed but the damage to the respondent's reputation will be ongoing. If there is no guarantee of a return date the respondent cannot put his or her side of the story to the court. This, surely, is the purpose of the Bill. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I support the amendment.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I support Senator Tuffy's amendment. It is important that we place an obligation on the court to fix a date for a return hearing within the eight day period. If we do not, an applicant could be at risk. A judge is in a better position to set the date rather than leaving the matter to the applicant or respondent. This amendment would guarantee that matters would be dealt with quickly, which is the principal purpose of the Bill. If the judge sets the date things are made easier for everybody.Outside Dublin it is more difficult because courts sit less frequently. This amendment will ensure that the judge will set a date and decide where the case will be heard.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I can understand the motivation for these amendments. However, there seems to be a misapprehension regarding the applicant at risk. The proposers appear to believe the applicant to be at risk from his or her own legal advisers. Any legal adviser will inquire of a judge when a case is to be returned to. In any application for an interim or interlocutory order a legal adviser who sees that the Oireachtas has now provided that the order will lapse in eight working days will inquire of the judge when the matter will next be in court. Otherwise the adviser has totally failed to attend to the requirements of his client by ensuring the matter is kept alive before the court.I am unable to accept these amendments, although I understand the motivation for them, because in entertaining an application of this type the court will, as a matter of practice, fix a return date. This is not a matter which requires legislation. This legislation will impose a limit of eight working days. A court which has made an order of this character will, clearly, at the same time make an order as to when the matter is to be returned to the court within that period.As Senator Terry mentioned, in some provincial locations the venue may have to change because the judge assigned to the district may not be sitting in the same venue within eight days. It is impossible within the judicial economy of Government to provide otherwise because the sittings are fixed for the various venues within the district and the judge will have to fix the return date for a different venue within his or her District Court area.The amendments are not necessary. They seem to be based on the premise that a court will wilfully allow an order to lapse for want of a hearing or that the matter will be lost sight of by the court under pressure of other business.I appreciate Senator Henry's intervention as well but often cases seem to get lost in the court. That the Oireachtas is now providing for a very definite time limit on these orders ensures they cannot be lost, because they are lost after eight days unless the necessary application is made. It is envisaged that the applicant, or his or her advisers, will at the time of the application fix a return date. Not all applicants have legal representation – some appear in person – but judges are always mindful of the fact that they have a duty to assist a litigant and will naturally advise the litigant that the order is of only eight days duration and that they must come back to court and serve the necessary documentation on the other side.What is at issue in this legislation and in the Supreme Court decision is the service of proceedings. It is common in civil proceedings for proceedings to be taken by one side and to obtain an order ex parte and the court always insists that the proceedings should be served as quickly as possible on the other side. Under the legislation I envisage a similar practice developing where the court will advise the applicant to serve his or her papers as soon as possible and, in the event of renewal of the order, he or she should be present at a sitting of the court within X number of working days.This matter refers back to the earlier amendment, which was pressed, about the working days. That is the reason we considered it necessary to provide this framework of at least eight working days and not let time be lost because of the incidence of public holidays, Saturdays or Sundays. There has to be a reasonable period for the applicant to serve the papers on the respondent and for the respondent to have an opportunity to turn up and contest the case.I appreciate in legislation of this character there is an anxiety to ensure every contingency is dealt with. The normal procedure for contingencies of this type is that if there is any particular difficulty it is dealt with by a rule of court, made under the relevant rules – the rules of the District Court or the Circuit Court where the rule making committees would draw up a specific procedure.The intention of the Oireachtas is made clear enough in the measure before the House. These orders lapse after eight working days. I am satisfied the courts will be mindful of their responsibilities to arrange their business in such a way that their orders do not lapse because a hearing within the period of validity is not fixed. With regret I cannot accept these amendments.

In page 4, line 8, after "1997)." to insert the following:"(g) If the interim barring order is made ex parte, the court may, if it thinks fit, require the applicant to give an undertaking as to damages in favour of the respondent in the event that the court subsequently determines that the order was wrongly applied for.”.This amendment seeks an undertaking in regard to damages, which is normal in any ex parte injunction. One of the reasons my colleagues and I tabled the amendment is that the absence of an undertaking was a matter of concern to the Supreme Court in the Keating v. Crowley case in October. The amendment requires an undertaking only where the court so orders; therefore it would apply only in exceptional circumstances. The consequences of an interim barring order being taken out against a person can be severe. Given that the Supreme Court has raised the issue, there may be cases where such an undertaking would be required.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	164	The Senator has raised an interesting point. The Supreme Court, in referring to this issue, was not advocating that we reform the law by insisting that applicants give an undertaking as to damages before they obtained a barring order or an interim barring order in this instance. What the Supreme Court did in its judgment was to contrast the arrangement in ordinary civil cases where frequently a plaintiff or a defendant seeking interlocutory relief has to give an undertaking as to damages with the peculiar nature of this remedy where no such undertaking is required.No doubt that was a factor that influenced the Supreme Court in arriving at the conclusion that there should be a strict time limit in the operation of this type of order. In ordinary civil proceedings a plaintiff can be required to say a particular activity shall cease on the proviso that the person trying to restrain the activity offers to compensate the party affected, if the person seeking the restraining order is proved wrong at the conclusion of the case. That is the undertaking with regard to damages.That has never been a feature of this particular remedy. Since its inception in 1976, this remedy has proceeded without any undertakings being required of the parties. It does not require a great leap of the imagination to see why, because undertakings by many of the parties to this particular litigation would not be of great value and would be inclined to give rise to more litigation subsequently and dispute over a pot of gold that does not exist. For that reason the undertaking has not been a feature of our legislation and the Oireachtas, when it provided for this remedy, never provided for undertakings as to damages. It provided a specific system of remedies for an unique problem of domestic violence.It would be a retrograde step if we accepted this amendment and put the clock back by saying that the previous law where one had to obtain an injunction, an undertaking as to damages was required. It would be impossible for a spouse of limited means to give such an undertaking. The Senator who moved the amendment rightly said that not all spouses are of limited means. There may be cases where spouses have substantial means. It would be a major innovation in the system of barring orders we have operated to invite the courts to consider whether undertakings as to damages should be offered by parties seeking these orders. It would not be appropriate to include such a measure in legislation of this scope and character. This legislation is essentially remedial in character and is designed to deal with the consequences of the Supreme Court judgment. There would be a danger that this amendment would place an ex parte interim barring order remedy out of reach for those who need it most.Let us consider the position of a woman of limited financial means who may be simultaneously trying to obtain maintenance from her spouse. How could she be expected to give an undertaking as to damages? She may be a victim of violence and hesitate about seeking an interim barring order ex parte because she may expose herself to a risk of damages. We must remember that when we invite the courts to exercise a particular option – we know from our experience with the existing legislation that this gave rise to the difficulty in the Supreme Court – they often exercise it. It would be dangerous to include a reference to an undertaking as to damages.What does the amendment mean? Does it refer to circumstances where the court refuses to confirm the interim barring order? Having heard and weighed the evidence of both parties, the court may conclude that it should not make the order. However, the application may not be without merit but merely fail to pass a particular threshold. If we introduce the undertaking as to damages we will actually change the nature of the discretion the court may exercise. Inevitably, once brought into the picture the courts will take it into account with regard to whether they should make the order in the first instance.Through this legislation, the Oireachtas has always provided that the safety and security of a spouse and her child are paramount in the exercise of the jurisdiction in the particular circumstances of a case. To introduce any requirement regarding the financial means of the parties would be to revolutionise the jurisdiction we have exercised in this area. That is not a step I am prepared to support at this stage.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	165	We should be grateful to Senator Tuffy for bringing this worthwhile amendment before the House. I agree with the Minister of State. I would be concerned that applicants might be deterred from proceeding with cases in circumstances where they should do so. People, particularly those of limited means, have to rely on legal advice.As a solicitor, Senator Tuffy would have more knowledge than I of the family courts. I am always concerned about the numbers urged to go forward with personal injury or medical cases. An enormous number of those cases are lost, but in many instances the legal adviser has not told the unfortunate applicant about the large amount of money he or she may have to pay. These people have often been encouraged to sign indemnities saying they will pay the fee if the case is lost. Whereas in such cases I would like the applicant to obtain more information about the financial penalties they might incur if they lose the case, I believe applicants could be deterred from bringing cases altogether.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Gratitude is owed to Senator Tuffy for the proposal of this novel amendment. It would certainly be an innovation. The Senator's point is valid in so far as it only deals with spouses with substantial means. Granting to the court the jurisdiction to determine whether a spouse in such a case could give such an undertaking is flexible. The Minister has said that this is a large step to take. I accept that, but it is an important fact that not everyone who comes before the court is of insignificant means. Could this provision be used to harm another party, particularly the respondent? In bringing forward the amendment, Senator Tuffy has highlighted this important issue.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	167	Senator Henry raised the matter of costs. In the District Court an order for costs could be made against an unmeritorious applicant but the amount of measured costs would be low. In the Circuit Court, they would be more substantial. That penalty already exists for an unsuccessful applicant and it is something any applicant has to consider before entering legal proceedings.What we are discussing here is a more radical requirement where an applicant for interim relief actually gives the court an indemnity against any loss the other party suffers in the event of the applicant being unsuccessful. That is a far reaching step to take and is a fundamental change to this jurisdiction, which is statutory in origin.Senator Brian Hayes made the point that a question of means might arise and that the applicant might be wealthy. In such circumstances the Oireachtas would have to legislate because, in the amendment, it is not proposed to discriminate against the person of means. The question of violence must also be considered. Irrespective of the person's means, what we are talking about is balancing the desideratum of stamping out domestic violence and the operation of penalty points in the case of a wealthy applicant who would have to pay money up front to deter an alleged case of violence. While I can see the interesting argument that can be made for this proposal, I am not convinced of its merits.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 4, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:"(f) Where an interim barring order obtained ex parte, pursuant to subsection (3)(d), is to be continued pending any adjournment of the application, so that the Respondent may be heard, that the period of adjournment should not exceed eight days.”I tabled this amendment because of concerns that within the eight day period when an application is being heard the respondent may request more time for preparation. I want to ensure that if a judge decides that additional time should be provided, it should be a period of no more than eight days. If that is not set down, the judge could allow a month or three weeks. To ensure the system works, I ask that the amendment be accepted. It would provide for a speedier resolution and at the same time protect the applicant.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I understand the spirit in which the amendment is being moved, but I am not certain it adds to the legislation. The legislation will provide that the order lapses after eight working days. That is a fundamental bar on the jurisdiction of the court. If the respondent appears within the eight days to contest the order, he can do it there and then. If he wishes further time to meet the case, then the applicant will have to apply for a fresh order. The applicant will have to apply afresh because the Oireachtas is providing in the legislation for the termination of the order after eight days. That is an absolute bar.The court is deprived of jurisdiction after eight days. It cannot look at the order and say that it was made for eight days but, because the respondent wants and adjournment, it will extend it for a further month. The court has no power to do that because the order lapses after eight working days. In such cases, a fresh application must be made by the applicant. The applicant will have to come into court and seek another eight days. At that stage, the respondent is present in court to meet the claimant.I am not trying to create difficulties for the Senator. I realise this is a very technical measure and I really appreciate the amendments which have been put down as they have allowed an elucidation of a very complex piece of legislation, short though it may appear.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I am concerned that the matter could go on and on, as we feared. When an applicant is granted an interim barring order, notice of the application has to be given to the respondent and a date is set for the hearing. The Minister of State has already said the judge will, of course, set the day. The applicant has to serve notice on the respondent as quickly as possible, even though those words are not now in this Bill and I tried earlier to provide for that.If it takes a few days for the applicant to find the respondent and the case is set down for a Friday, I am concerned that the order may lapse. The applicant would then have to seek another order and a further day would have to be set by the court. That process could go on and on. That is one of the defects in the Bill which I believe my amendment would resolve.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	171	The whole thrust of the provision, accepting the Minister of State's comments, is that it automatically dies after the eight day period and, therefore, the applicant would have to return to the court again. Obviously, there will have been a requirement in the interim to notify the respondent and provide a note of the evidence of the affidavit, as well as the other relevant provisions in this regard. I believe that covers the situation fairly satisfactorily. When the matter comes back to the court a second time it will be a new application, but at that stage the respondent may be present, in which event the order may well be challenged. I regard that as a relatively good mechanism for dealing with the matter.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	172	If the order lapses and there is even one day for which there is no interim barring order, the applicant is at risk from the offending party, the respondent. There should not be any interval whatsoever before another order is made. If an order lapses on a Friday, the applicant cannot go to court until the following Monday. That is a real problem. We cannot allow the applicant to be at risk, especially in a situation where relationships are liable to deteriorate because of the legal proceedings.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	173	So far, in this debate, the amendment was pressed in terms of the effect on the respondent. In dealing with that, I mentioned that the order would lapse but, of course, the order can be confirmed and I wish to emphasise that. Therefore, from the perspective of the respondent, once he or she is in court, he or she is in a position to meet. If the respondent wishes to have an adjournment – I will return to the Senator's point in a moment – that is clearly a factor which the judge will have to examine in the context of a confirmation application by the applicant. However, the Senator has now canvassed a different contingency entirely, namely the impact on the applicant of the fact that the order automatically lapses. That, of course, is the kernel of the legislation.If the applicant cannot locate the respondent and cannot effect service, the applicant will have to go to court again and seek an order. That is my understanding of the position. With regard to the law of service, the court can always deem service to be good in certain circumstances where the respondent cannot be traced. It is not the case that an applicant would have to return endlessly to court every eight days to obtain an order. However, under this scheme, where an order is about to lapse for one reason or another, the applicant will have to renew his or her application to the court before the operative last day. As Senator Terry has rightly pointed out, if the order lapses on a Friday, it will not be easy to find a district justice on Saturday, particularly one with jurisdiction. The Senator's point is well made but the applicant will have to come to court before the eight day period lapses. That is inescapable, given the purport of the legislation.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	174	This discussion goes to the heart of the legislation, as the Minister of State has said. According to section 1(A)(c)(ii), an interim barring order may be made ex parte. It provides that a copy of the order, affidavit or information shall be served on the respondent as soon as practicable. The legislation sets down an eight day timeframe in relation to a barring order but it does not set out the actual period of time in which the respondent is entitled to receive the order, affidavit or information. Was consideration given by the Minister of State and the Department to specifying the length of time within which that information would be sent to the respondent?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	175	No. The phrase "as soon as practicable" was chosen because in matters of service, as in matters of domestic violence, the circumstances vary enormously. To put a rigid time limit on it would be quite inappropriate, having regard to different locations at which potential parties to court actions may reside or carry on their business or be available for service in a transient or permanent way within the jurisdiction at a particular place. It would be quite impossible to specify a fixed period of time. That would be to introduce another cumbersome element to the legislation. As a result of the Supreme Court decision, we are already introducing a cumbersome element by having a fixed period. Whenever one interferes with judicial discretion in this way, one introduces a complexity into legislation. I believe it would make the legislation almost unworkable to introduce a further complexity specifying that the papers must be served on the respondent within three days.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I wish to refer back to the matter of adjournment. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the position in that regard. Is he saying that an adjournment cannot take place while still keeping a barring order alive, accepting the eight day period? Where a hearing takes place within the eight days, has the judge discretion to adjourn the hearing? If a respondent turns up and claims to be unprepared, what approach will the judge take? Will the case be thrown out and where does that leave the applicant? How will a judge decide on somebody's preparedness?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	177	What will happen under this legislation is not unusual. It happens in many court proceedings that an interim order is obtained, such as to restrain a manufacturer from operating a particular manufacturing process because it is a nuisance. There is no strict time limit but the case will normally return within five or six days. The manufacturer may say he is not in a position to meet the case on the day because he has to call a great deal of technical evidence and the court will generally adjourn the matter, but the order continues in force against the manufacturer until he can meet it. Under this Bill, the District or Circuit Court judge will be in the position that the Oireachtas has said the interim order can only endure for an eight day period. Accordingly, the order will be spent unless a fresh order is made at that stage. That is inescapable, having regard to the nature of the legislation.A respondent seeking an adjournment cannot use his or her right to apply for an adjournment – and to invoke the court's power of adjournment – for the purpose of defeating the intention of the Oireachtas. The effect cannot be to make the section lapse. That is clear. In that situation – and it is not for us to prescribe – I believe the court would look at the circumstances of the case, make some form of inquiry as to the nature of the defence the respondent wished to advance and decide, in that context, how to exercise its discretion in relation to confirmation. For example, the court might decide to confirm the order for a further seven days, after which time the respondent could meet the case.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	178	On a point of order, a Chathaoirligh, I wish to seek an extension of the sitting because the House made an order earlier to finish with this legislation at 6 o'clock. I suggest that an extra ten minutes be allowed for the debate.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Will the Minister explain whether or not a judge could confirm the order, extending it for another eight days? That would satisfy me. The Minister mentioned that a judge may decide on the day of the hearing to confirm the order for another eight days.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	181	The judge is not extending the interim order, because the respondent is present. Once the respondent is present there is power to make a confirming order. Therefore, in those circumstances the judge can make a confirming order of limited duration so that the respondent has the necessary time to prepare before making the case in court. That power is available within the discretion of the court. The fact that the Oireachtas has now prescribed this definite time limit for the interim order means that judges will take that course of action in the contingency the Senator outlined. Where a respondent seeks time to prepare a case the judge will ask, "How much time do you need? I will confirm the order until we can hear your case, unless you can show good reason now why I should not confirm the order." That is an approach that will be taken.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	182	Is the amendment being pressed?
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	183	What the Minister has outlined is an improvement which comes closer to my amendment. It is similar to an adjournment.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	184	We must allow some discretion to the Judiciary in these circumstances. If the applicant brings the case back to court – which is one of the points about which we were concerned – and the notes of the decision and the affidavits have not been served on the respondent, the judge will inquire into the reasons for that. That affords a certain protection for the respondent. On the other hand, if the expiry period of the notice is approaching and the respondent cannot be found, the applicant can renew the order, through a solicitor, by going back to court before the eight days have expired. If they do so subsequent to the expiry date, they will not be in a worse position than they were when seeking the first interim order because the circumstances are the same. In fact, the circumstances are probably better because if the respondent has respected the eight day barring order, presumably the risk has at least been diminished, if not removed.We should leave the discretion to the court. If we were to tie the hands of the court we could find that the legislation is less likely to work effectively than it will as currently constructed. Undoubtedly, the way in which it is now constructed relies upon judicial discretion, but I think we can depend on that.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Is the amendment being pressed?
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	186	Yes, it is. I feel this is something that an individual could contest. I would not be surprised if another Supreme Court decision is handed down saying that the matter is unconstitutional. It restricts both the applicant's and the respondent's ability to protect themselves and to have the protection of the court.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 4, line 11, after "ex parte.” to add:"The provisions of subsection (3)(d) shall apply to interim protection orders obtained ex parte as they apply to interim barring orders obtained ex parte.”.This amendment seeks to attach the same rights to protection orders obtained ex parte, as apply to interim barring orders obtained ex parte. The amendment would provide more protection for the individual. The Bill is seeking to afford such protection, particularly in light of the recent Supreme Court decision. I am asking the Minister to accept this amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I support Senator Terry's amendment. In his contribution on Second Stage, the Minister said that the number of protection orders is in the region of 3,400 to 3,800 a year. That is a substantial increase since the legislation was introduced in 1996. The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the same rules that apply in respect of interim barring orders ex parte would also apply to protection orders in this case.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I fully appreciate the reasons given by the Senators for tabling this amendment. I am prepared to examine the matter in the context of the promised family law legislation. The Supreme Court, however, did not rule that ex parte protection orders were unconstitutional.The legal advice available to me is that there are sufficient grounds to distinguish the two types of order. The orders are very different in character: one removes a spouse from the family home, while the other order seeks to protect spouses while they remain in the family home. There is a fundamental distinction, therefore, between both orders. A protection order does not bar a person from their residence but instead orders them "not to use or threaten violence against, molest, or put in fear" the applicant.I do not accept that the rigid scheme which the Supreme Court has now required us to apply to the interim barring order should be extended to the protection order. The protection order has always worked well but the difficulty with it was that it was not strong enough to deter the conduct about which Senators protested earlier in the day.I am certainly prepared to have the matter examined in the context of the review of family law legislation, but I am not prepared to accept the amendment if it is pressed now.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I withdraw the amendment in light of the Minister's remarks.

I appreciate the spirit in which Opposition Members have tabled their amendments but I am constrained by legal advice in this matter. The Bill flowed from a decision of the Supreme Court and we were anxious to ensure that everything complied with the law.

I thank the Minister for the manner in which he dealt with the various amendments. The debate was a most interesting one. The Bill arose as the result of a recent Supreme Court ruling and changes, which may or may not have some effect, have been made to the 1996 Act.It would be prudent to monitor the implementation of the legislation once it has been enacted, so that if any difficulties arise they can be rectified. The Minister has agreed that in such circumstances further amendments can be made, either to this legislation or that dealing with family law.I thank Opposition Members, in particular, for their co-operation in ensuring the passage of the Bill, which represents a good day's work. As many Members have said, the protection now exists to deal with such incidents over the Christmas season but hopefully they will be few and far between.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I am delighted to have the opportunity to present the National Development Finance Agency Bill, 2002 to the Seanad today.The proposed National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, will assist in providing cost effective finance for priority infrastructure projects. It is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of this country that the establishment of NDFA has been afforded top priority and that the legislation to give it statutory effect has been developed accordingly.I will begin by sketching out the background to the establishment of the agency. In January this year I wrote to all Ministers asking them to bring forward public private partnership, PPP, projects as a matter of priority, to tackle our infrastructure deficit in a way that offers value for money for the taxpayer. At the same time, I approached the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency to ask what contribution that body could make to the PPP programme, given its acknowledged expertise in the financial markets. A third development at that time was the clear lesson emerging from the early pilot PPP projects concerning the need for specific financial expertise and advice to assist State authorities to obtain the best financing packages for infrastructure projects. This need applies not just for PPPs but for all major public investment projects.The proposed National Development Finance Agency will meet this need. It will help to maximise value for money for the taxpayer, through the identification of the best financing packages and the application of commercial standards in terms of evaluating financial risks and costs for each project. NDFA will work through the NTMA. That agency will assign experts with relevant experience, for example in corporate finance and risk assessment, to carryout the necessary tasks.In relation to the provision of advice, PPP projects and major infrastructure projects are complex, requiring expert technical, legal and financial advice. A centrally resourced expert advisory service to all State authorities will be more economic than employing experts in each of these areas in every procuring authority, including the local authorities. This role will be filled by NDFA in respect of financial advice. In this way, significant cost savings may be achieved over time.The proposed agency will provide advice to State authorities in order to assist them in evaluating all available financial options for infrastructure projects. It will be part of the NDFA's role to advise State authorities, such as Government Departments and agencies, as to the appropriate financing structure and to evaluate proposals submitted by the private sector. As well as providing centralised expertise on financial proposals, NDFA will assist in identifying optimal financing arrangements for major infrastructural priorities. In certain circumstances NDFA will be able to raise finance for PPP projects where this would be more cost effective than private funding. NDFA may also raise finance for conventionally procured capital projects where there are clear benefits offsetting any increased cost of agency funding over Exchequer funding.Where NDFA is able to borrow at better rates than the private sector, less State subvention may be required for capital projects underpinning the PPP approach to the delivery of infrastructure. It is intended that NDFA financing will be backed by Government guarantee. In addition, the NDFA will be able to form special purpose companies under this legislation and will be able to receive funding and guarantees from the Minister. I am satisfied that this measure offers NDFA the necessary flexibility in discharging its functions. It is not envisaged that funding and guarantees will necessarily be given to all SPCs.The Minister for Finance will have powers to make advances from the central fund to the new agency or a special purpose company. In addition, NDFA may advance money to an SPC. State authorities will also have powers to convey, assign or transfer land or other property, not including equity holdings, to a special purpose company formed by NDFA. The purpose of these powers is to ensure that there is sufficient latitude in the arrangements to allow NDFA as wide a range of financing options as possible, including the option of exploiting the potential of land and other State assets to generate resources to finance priority infrastructural projects.In order to assess the optimal means of financing projects, NDFA will acquire the expertise to assess the relative merits of different project structures. Prospectuses and invitations to tender will make it clear that NDFA will be involved in assessing and advising on proposals and where appropriate will reserve the right of the relevant State authority to accept or reject any particular financing package or perhaps instead to utilise funds provided by NDFA. The objective will be to ensure overall best value for money and to encourage the maximum private sector involvement in financing projects. Continued private sector involvement will be a measure of success for NDFA.Private sector involvement has been crucial to the development of the public private partnership programme. Working with the private and public sectors, my Department has developed the market from a point only two years ago where there were no projects under way to the position now where there are more than 40 projects at various stages of procurement in a wide range of areas, such as roads, environmental services – waste and waste water – education, health and transport. These areas of infrastructure are vital to underpinning our economic development.A major achievement of the central PPP unit of my Department, working with the sectoral PPP units of other Departments, is the negotiation of refinancing clauses in PPP contracts. These clauses provide that where a private financing package is renegotiated after the contract has been signed, and savings achieved on the cost of finance, the savings will be shared with the public sector. When we first sought such provision in contracts, this was very unusual. Now other countries are trying to emulate the success of my Department in negotiating such facilities which I am sure will bring savings in years to come.I am confident that NDFA will in future be able to deliver on the opportunities for cost savings that these innovative arrangements present. The development of PPPs in Ireland is not happening in isolation. This is a growing trend across developed market economies. PPPs represent the coming together of public services and private business. It is also consistent with and supportive of policies directed towards greater integration of economies within the European Union and across the wider global economy.In Ireland, we have not had State monopolies in the provision of essential public services, such as health and education. These services have always been funded and provided by a mix of central and local government, private, voluntary and community-based organisations. Moreover, many local authority services have been delivered through contract arrangements with the private sector. PPPs are consistent with these longstanding practices.International experience clearly shows that real benefits can be gained from PPPs. They can give better value for money compared to traditional procurement by transferring risks from the public to the private sector, they can deliver improved efficiency in the adoption of whole life costing of services and innovation in the design, building and operation of assets, and they can also provide better quality services through increased competition, incentives to higher standards and performance and an enhanced focus on the customer.At the same time, PPPs can allow faster delivery of individual projects by linking the provision of the asset or service to payments, particularly in relation to more complex capital projects. A better utilisation of assets can be achieved through extended third party usage and can provide the context for better regulation as Government agencies focus on the role of regulator, planner and monitor rather than on day-to-day service provision.While all international experience points to these benefits of increased value for money, the crucial element of successful PPPs is optimal risk transfer. By this I mean that a good PPP will ensure project risks are allocated to the party best able to manage them at least cost. Effective risk identification, assessment and allocation are crucial to achieving increased value for money for the Exchequer and taxpayers. For the private sector, risk will be commensurate with reward. The PPP programme will be developed to achieve the optimum balance of risk and reward and, drawing on the expertise of the NDFA, optimal financing packages for all projects, including PPPs.The legislation provides that State authorities will be obliged to seek NDFA advice. However, it is most important to note that the final decision on the structure and financing of a project remains a matter for the appropriate Minister, or where there is delegated sanction, the appropriate accounting officer or equivalent. The legislation also provides that I will issue guidance on the circumstances in which NDFA advice should be sought, taking account of the type of project or programme of projects, stage of development of a project and any other relevant factors and the need to comply with procurement rules and avoid conflict of interest. This guidance will be drafted with input from a cross-departmental team which will include a representative of the Office of the Attorney General in an advisory, rather than an executive, capacity. The NDFA will also be consulted.While the Bill will be discussed in detail by Members on Committee Stage, I will now outline its main provisions.Section 1 is a standard provision which sets out the way in which the Bill and the terms used in it are to be interpreted.Section 2 provides for the establishment of the National Development Finance Agency – which is referred to in the Bill as "the Agency"– as a body corporate on a day to be appointed by order by the Minister for Finance.Section 3 sets out the functions of the agency which are to advise State authorities on the optimal means of financing major public investment projects in order to achieve value for money; to advance money and enter into other financial arrangements regarding projects approved by any State authority; to provide advice to State authorities on all aspects of the financing, including refinancing and insurance, of public investment projects; and to form companies, subject to section 5 of the Act, for the purpose of securing finance for public investment projects. It also provides that the agency will have any other powers necessary for the performance of its functions, including the power to engage consultants, advisers or other service providers. When carrying out its functions, the agency must comply with any guidelines or instructions the Minister for Finance may issue to it.Section 4 provides that the advice of the agency must take into account any policy directions issued by the Minister for Finance to State authorities regarding financing of public investment projects as well as any detailed policy guidance in relation to the process, procedures and regulation generally of PPPs. The Minister must send a copy of every policy direction and policy guidance to the agency. Advice given by the agency may include advice about consultancy services across the range of technical expertise required to undertake such projects. The agency and the NTMA must at all times exercise due care, skill, prudence and diligence and act in the utmost good faith in the discharge of functions under the Act.Section 5 provides that the agency can form special purpose companies, SPCs, in order to provide finance where this is necessary or expedient in order to discharge the agency's functions under the Act. The formation of any SPCs must have the prior written consent of the Minister in respect of each individual project.Section 6 provides that the agency can borrow money in any currency subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance. The combined net aggregate of the principal of money raised and outstanding by the agency and any companies formed under section 5, and/or guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, cannot exceed €5 billion. The section also provides that the agency can engage in transactions of a normal banking nature with the Minister and any other persons in order to perform any of its functions.Section 7 provides that the Minister for Finance may guarantee the due repayment, by the agency or any companies formed under section 5, of the principal of any money raised and/or the payment of interest on such money by the agency. The combined net aggregate of the principal of all money guaranteed and outstanding cannot exceed €5 billion. The Minister for Finance must give the Houses of the Oireachtas an annual statement with respect to each guarantee setting out particulars of the guarantee, payments made by him under the guarantee, the amount, if any, repaid to him on foot of such payments and the amount of the guarantee outstanding at the end of the year in question. Any money paid by the Minister for Finance under a guarantee must be repaid to the Minister by the agency or any company within two years from the date the money is advanced from the Central Fund.Section 8 provides that State authorities, in accordance with any guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance, either under this section or section 3(3), shall seek the advice of the agency as soon as is practicable before undertaking any public investment projects. The guidelines to be issued under this section can include issues relating to the type of project, the size of the project, the stage of development of the project, and other relevant factors which might determine whether the agency's advice should be sought on a project.Section 9 provides that a State authority can, subject to the consent of the Minister and the appropriate Minister, either for a consideration or not, transfer, convey or assign its interest in property owned or held by the State authority to a company formed under section 5. The purpose of this power is to allow the company to carry out its financing functions in relation to public investment projects. A State authority can attach terms and conditions as it considers appropriate to any such transfer, conveyance or assignment.Section 10 provides that the Minister can advance money from the Central Fund to the agency or a company formed under section 5, subject to such terms and conditions as the Minister may determine. The aggregate of advances outstanding at any time cannot exceed €250 million. The agency can advance money to a company formed under section 5 subject to such terms and conditions as it may determine. The money advanced either by the agency or the Minister can be used to make an equity investment in such a company.Section 11 provides that the agency shall perform its functions through the National Treasury Management Agency and that the National Treasury Management Act, 1990, be amended accordingly.Section 12 provides that the board of the agency, which will consist of a chairperson, who will be the chief executive officer of the National Treasury Management Agency, and four ordinary members, shall ensure that the functions of the agency are being performed effectively, set the objectives and targets to be met by the agency and ensure they are carried out. Ordinary members will be appointed by the Minister for Finance for a term of office of five years. The remuneration and allowances for expenses and terms relating to holding of office for members of the board will be determined by the Minister for Finance at the time of the member's appointment.The section also provides for the disqualification from becoming or continuing as a member of the board under certain specified circumstances and for the resignation or the removal from membership of the board in particular circumstances of an ordinary member of the board. It sets out how vacancies may be filled and allows for the re-appointment of an ordinary member of the board, subject to a maximum of two terms, if their membership expires by the passage of time. The Minister for Finance shall endeavour to ensure an equitable balance between men and women in the composition of the board where this is practicable and having regard to relevant experience.Section 13 provides for the appointment by the board of the chief executive officer of the agency.Section 14 provides for the holding of meetings by the board, the first of which will be on the establishment day of the agency. It also specifies details such as the quorum, who should chair meetings, voting rules and the procedure and business of meetings.Section 15 provides that the agency should provide itself with a seal and sets out who may authenticate the seal. Judicial notice will be taken of the seal. It also lists who may enter into and execute any contract or instrument not requiring to be under seal.Section 16 provides that a member of the board cannot be a a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament or a member of a local authority, vocational educational committee, health board, or the Eastern Regional Health Authority.Section 17 provides that a member of the board, staff of the National Treasury Management Agency, a consultant, adviser or other person engaged by the agency must disclose any interest in any matter in advance of any consideration of that matter by the board or agency and cannot influence a decision or take part in consideration of that matter. Any such disclosure is to be recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the board or otherwise recorded by the chief executive officer. The section also sets out in what situations a person can and cannot be regarded as having a beneficial interest.Section 18 provides for a prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of confidential information. A person who contravenes these provisions shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment or both.Section 19 provides for a prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of confidential information and a person who contravenes this shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine or imprisonment or both.Section 20 requires the agency to keep accounts in such form as may be determined by the Minister for Finance and specifies certain details in regard to borrowing and fundraising by the agency and its transfer to individual projects which must be included in the accounts. The accounts must be signed by the chief executive officer and the chairperson and be adopted by the board. They must be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit no later than four months after the end of the financial year to which they relate. The audited accounts must be copied to the Minister and laid before each House of the Oireachtas and must note a record of expenses incurred by the agency.The section also provides for an amendment to the National Treasury Management Act, 1990, to the effect that the audited accounts of the NTMA shall note a record of expenses incurred by it in the exercise of its functions under the Bill. The chief executive officer and the chairperson must, when required, give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts on specified matters. In the giving of evidence or the production or sending of documents to a committee, the chief executive officer and the chairperson cannot question or express an opinion on the merits or objectives of any policy of the board.Section 21 provides that the agency will report to the Minister for Finance, not later than six months after the end of the financial year, in relation to its activities during the year. It is open to the Minister to make directions on the form of these reports and the matters to be included in them.Section 22 provides for the amendment of the Schedule to the Act.Section 23 provides for the amendment of section 54 of the Finance Act, 1970, to allow the Minister for Finance to engage in transactions of a normal banking nature with the NDFA and others, in connection with the performance by the NDFA of its borrowing functions, and for the better management of the indebtedness of the NDFA.Section 24 provides for the amendment of the First Schedule to the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990. The amendment relates to section 5 of the 1990 Act, which provides that the Government may delegate to the NTMA, by order, functions specified in the First Schedule to that Act. The amendment provides for the delegation from the Minister for Finance to the NTMA of the power to enter into swaps, foreign exchange contracts, etc., for the purposes of managing the NDFA debt.Section 25 is a standard provision to the effect that expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.Section 26 provides that administrative expenses of the agency will be charged on the central fund, that expenses incurred in the performance of its financing functions will be recovered by repayments on loans advanced by the agency or out of any surplus accruing to the agency and that expenses incurred in relation to advisory functions will be recovered by a charge on the Vote of the appropriate Department.Section 27 provides for the Short Title to the Bill.I want to emphasise that the new agency will have a critical role in developing the best means of financing public investment. The NDFA will provide a top level source of financial advice for sponsoring agencies such as Departments, local authorities or statutory bodies on the optimal means of financing major infrastructure projects. The agency will also provide ongoing financial advice as projects are procured and, in certain circumstances, will raise finance for projects. Our aim is to create a means of ensuring the delivery of value for money for the Exchequer by facilitating the best financial arrangements for projects, which, in turn, will assist in the delivery of key elements of the national development plan and other infrastructure priorities.I commend the Bill to the House.

Senators could have expressed their views on all Stages of the Bill if the House's consideration of it had been spread out over a number of days. However, I am happy to discuss the National Development Finance Agency Bill, 2002.I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill, which shows that some of the promises made by the Government parties prior to the general election are being kept. Many other promises have been broken since the election. I agree that this is an important Bill, but it contains many flaws.It has been widely accepted that the national development plan is in disarray. The plan's problems do not involve finance, but the delivery of the projects it contains. In recent weeks, it seems that urgent planned capital projects have been delayed or shelved, particularly in primary schools and third level institutions. No definite dates have been given for the projects to continue. There seems to be a view among many people that the national development plan will cost about €80 billion, which is a substantial amount of money. The interrupted flow of funding to the NDP has led to many difficulties for project managers.The Minister has argued that the NDFA will become a centre of excellence for project financing, but I feel that we are tackling an aspect of the problem which should not be a priority. While the raising of finance is an issue, the real problem lies in the delivery on the ground, as demonstrated by the fact that projects are not being finished on time or are going way over their targeted budgets.The difficulties with the NDP are not necessarily to be found in the area of raising finance. The National Roads Authority, the Railway Procurement Agency and the Housing Finance Agency have been established to garner finance in their various fields of interest, and a national waste management agency will probably be established soon. Why has the Minister not considered giving more power to those agencies to raise funds, instead of establishing a new quango as a further layer of bureaucracy? These agencies are unable to generate the funds they need to carry out the work they wish to do.I emphasise that I agree with the laudable principle of public private partnerships. Many projects, however, do not have an income stream to attract private enterprise. A problem that is constantly mentioned by certain people in the context of PPPs and the NDP is that cheap public funding is being replaced by expensive private funding. It costs private businesses and individuals much more to deliver finance to a project than it costs the Government. This serious problem, which has not been addressed, places greater pressures on the private element of public private partnerships. The private sector may opt to fund public projects in limited circumstances only. Grave concerns have been expressed in relation to gathering evidence of the success, or otherwise, of PPPs. We have been told that about 40 PPP projects, including sewerage schemes, are in the pipeline, but we do not have any concrete evidence of how well they are working or will work in the future. We should not be asked to accept the new agency without being sure how PPPs are working.There is a case to be made for Ireland to seek to renegotiate the EU stability pact. As a country with a low borrowing ratio, Ireland could quite legitimately press its claims with Europe for increased borrowing to finance improvements in its infrastructure, which is generally acknowledged to be of a poor standard. We should consider this matter before the National Development Finance Agency comes into being.There are a number of other areas in the Bill about which I am concerned. It establishes State-owned companies which have the power to raise money without a State guarantee. Is this just a ploy to make the companies appear to be outside the public sector while will, in reality, remain within it? Is the Minister trying to fool the taxpayer? The Bill makes scant provision for either transparency or accountability within the SPCs. One thing about which we have learned in recent years is the demand for more transparency and accountability in the operation of Government agencies and State-sponsored companies.Is it correct to establish an agency which will action as an adviser and as an executor of finance deals? This is one of the key problems with the legislation. Surely there would be an in-built tendency to recommend financial deals in which the agency plays an important role. Are we not effectively giving the agency a monopoly in the area of financing projects and allowing it to block the entry of private finance providers who might offer more competitive deals?Why is it proposed to muzzle the agency from commenting on public policy which has only been half thought out? One area which comes to mind in this regard is the Taoiseach's pet project, Sports Campus Ireland. Will this slide in under the National Development Finance Agency? Why is the accountability of the new agency being circumscribed when we have suffered in the past from the lack of transparency and accountability?The Minister and his Department have been silent on the question of using some of the resources of the national pension fund to finance capital projects. This is important and has been widely discussed inside and outside of the Houses. I acknowledge that the Minister's decision to set aside money for the future in the pension reserve fund was correct. However, there are infrastructural deficiencies and large amounts of money, which could have been invested for a gain here, have been invested outside the country. Over €1 billion of borrowed money has been channelled into foreign stock markets under the pension reserve fund at a time when there are large infrastructural problems.While I agree with some parts of the Bill, it puts the cart before the horse to some extent. It has been poorly thought out. The Minister should reconsider it and come up with a more robust appraisal of the failure to deliver on the national development plan. It is for this that people are yearning. I oppose the Bill.

The Bill is a well thought out initiative. The Minister provided the Government or official pedigree of the Bill, I would like to fill out the picture by giving its political pedigree.The Bill was a major centrepiece of the Fianna Fáil manifesto in May of this year. The manifest proposed to establish, under the auspices of the NTMA, a new National Development Finance Agency to finance major public projects and evaluate all financing aspects of PPP projects. As Senator Phelan has already acknowledged, this is not an area in respect of which one talks about broken promises.

The Bill and the initiative reflect the importance that Fianna Fáil has attached for over 40 years to the development and improvement of our infrastructure. It reflects an interventionist and Government led approach, which refers back to the programme for economic expansion which began in the late ‘50s, the 1981 investment plan, The Way Forward – which was not implemented because we went into Opposition – and successive national development plans, of which the latest, dating from the year 2000, is by far the largest.One notes that in the period 1974 to 1997, Exchequer capital spending rose from £1.1 billion to £1.6 billion. Even with a slight cutback, this year it stands at €5.4 million or £4.2 billion.There was no Exchequer investment in railways until Fianna Fáil and the Leader, when she was Minister for Public Enterprise, changed the policy. This development must also be seen in the context of a long line of financial innovations. How many people were sceptical about the NTMA when it was established in 1990? Everyone now accepts that this body, which has cross-party support, has proved its worth. I recall sitting beside Charles Haughey as he explained the concept of the NTMA to journalists in the middle of the 1987 election. This initiative belongs with the IFSC, self-assessment, tax credits and a whole series of financial innovations.

It is not based on any starry-eyed approach to PPPs.I read the debate on the Bill in the Lower House and it appears Deputy Burton does not understands the Department of Finance if she believes that it operates under the mantra "private sector good, public sector bad". There is a difficulty with PPPs, but, unless there is real risk involved, the public sector can borrow more cheaply than the private sector. The PPP process is part of a panoply of instruments and shows a determination to drive forward the national development programme and capital investment projects.The Minister stressed the competitive aspect of the agency. He said that a good PPP would ensure that a project was allocated to the party best able to manage it at lowest cost and would be developed to achieve the optimum balance of risk and reward. One needs expertise and there have been many complaints, from all sides of the House, that the excessive use of consultants can be very expensive. The agency provides in-house expertise and the NTMA will act as a mentor.Senator John Paul Phelan referred to other agencies such as the waste management agency or the Rail Procurement Agency, but these have primarily technical expertise such as, in the case of the former, what is the best or most economic form of waste management. They do not necessarily possess finance project expertise.The Minister and the Government are being perfectly realistic. This is not a panacea and it will not get around the general Government borrowing requirement. As the Minister has stated, whether a particular project accepted will be a matter for assessment by EUROSTAT. Fortunately, the Government is not living dangerously or on the margins so a EUROSTAT decision on any project will not drive us over the limit.I am surprised to see the Fine Gael Party – in the form of Deputy Richard Bruton in the Lower House and Senator Feighan here – suggest that we should be lift the limits of the growth and stability pact. That would not be a good idea. We are nowhere near those limits; it is not as if we are pressed up against the ceiling. Any attempt by us to lift the limits would have a bad effect on confidence. I suspect that if Europe were to do it, confidence in the European economy – with some of the larger countries' economies in serious difficulties – would not be improved. We have an adequate margin for manoeuvre and we should retain it. The purpose of this is to enable us to accelerate economically and socially useful projects. I doubt the value of a massive increase in the Exchequer borrowing requirement at a time when we have 4% to 5% inflation.The National Development Finance Agency will be seen as another innovative and successful development initiative. Some people, particularly those in the Labour Party and perhaps for ideological reasons, do not seem to like the fudging of lines between private and public projects. I urge people not to be so conservative. This type of project has shown itself to be of real value. Some of the inspiration for this agency, which will be overseen by the Minister for Finance, comes from the social partners. During the term of office of the previous Government I had the pleasure of attending the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure, the major concern of which was, and remains, the driving forward of infrastructural investment. The agenda will now be enlarged by the national spatial strategy.One matter that caught my attention was a public private partnership in waiting, the Cork School of Music. We would all like Cork to enjoy success as European City of Culture in 2005, so anything the Minister can do to push that forward would be appreciated. I congratulate him on this important legislation, which is one of the centrepieces of the work of the Government.

When the plan for 2000-06 was launched, it seemed to herald a new dawn for infrastructural projects for the entire country. What has emerged has been a disappointment, probably because, as the Minister said, we are entering difficult financial times. Looking at the recent Estimates and the Minister's projections for different Departments, one can see that there has been an all-round cutting of capital expenditure. This agency and the public private partnership council will attempt to fill this vacuum.I would be interested in discovering the nature of the 40 public private partnerships in existence at present, in order that we might gain an idea of the spread of activity and the degree to which it can apply to "Ireland Inc.". While I am aware of successful projects involving second level education establishments being administered by a British company, Jarvis Projects, and the recent opening of a school in Tubbercurry, it would be interesting to see what the investor is getting out of it compared to what the State put in and the cost-benefit to the State on a long-term basis compared to what it would be if it had initiated the expenditure itself.The National Development Plan 2000-2006 suffered because the jigsaw was not fully in place. The national spatial strategy emerged only recently, but it should have been drawn up in tandem with the national development plan. In terms of spreading investment in the direction of gateways and hubs, we have lost much valuable time – potentially a few years – whereas many of those infrastructural projects could have been dovetailed into those areas. Waterford has been designated as a gateway town, while its regional airport is under threat and may close down. From a transport point of view, surely that should be a vital cog in the area.Infrastructural projects and public private partnership are buzzwords that have even been heard at county council meetings in recent times. It is regrettable that PPPs did not appear long ago. Every year, those of us who are members of local authorities see the same thing happening: a major sewerage scheme in the county, based on the national development plan, plus two small sewerage schemes. Lack of sewerage schemes is a major problem in rural Ireland. While a large amount of money is being spent on smaller communities in terms of landscaping them and building lovely stone walls and modern footpaths, the population is decreasing because of the lack of the essential component in the first instance, namely, a good sewerage scheme. As a result of a sewerage scheme being put in place, houses are built and the local school is then not under threat and the community knits together.If one travels through rural areas, one will see the scale of this problem. Yesterday our county council debated the concept of going in a different direction in the future with regard to public private partnerships. I am sure other councils have done the same. If a developer wants to build in a rural area, he should be responsible for the sewerage, etc. We must be innovative if we want to improve things.To a certain degree, the public private partnership is a concept from which many benefits can flow. The problem with the NDP in recent years has been the stop-go pace of development. I am glad we are analysing and scanning European Union directives, because the delay in important projects often seems crazy when the actual cost is quantified.The Kildare bypass was delayed because of a rare snail that possibly nobody has even seen. The same thing occurred near Doonbeg in County Clare. As Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts, I questioned the chairman of the National Roads Authority on the delay in the construction of the Kildare bypass. If I remember correctly, that delay increased costs by approximately €20 million. If directives such as this are a barrier to progress, we should be able to make the decision ourselves about whether a snail is rare.I do not know whether the National Development Finance Agency is an additional body as such, but after the national spatial strategy and the national development plan, it is not worth moving on to bodies such as this to finance projects. The National Treasury Management Agency was investing abroad and losing money, in many cases, because of currency differentials. We must be innovative if we want a return from future infrastructural projects. As the Minister said, the national purse is empty. The Celtic tiger is not roaring as much as he did heretofore. What is left to finance infrastructural projects so that Ireland may advance in the future?
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I welcome the Minister to the House. We have said for years that we suffer from an infrastructural deficit. We have failed to keep pace with the development of the economy, making ourselves less competitive and, in doing so, threatening the future of the economy. With that in mind, I welcome this initiative and the leadership the Government is showing in bringing it forward.This is a policy that was agreed and put forward in the programme for Government and the Progressive Democrats support and endorse it. Delivering projects in the national development plan is one of the most important challenges facing this Government. Ireland is a dynamic, modern economy but we lack the infrastructure appropriate for such an economy. Our transport system falls well short of the standard prevailing in other European countries. Our rail and road networks need to be improved and those improvements will cost money. The Government is providing substantial funds to upgrade our rail and road systems and has done so over the last five years. If it were not for the forward thinking decisions made by Senator O'Rourke when Minister for Public Enterprise, our rail network would be crumbling into decay. Massive funding has also been poured into the national roads programme. Work is now under way in the development of a major network of inter-urban motorways linking Dublin with the major population centres around the State.Our infrastructural needs are great and the funding required to meet them is massive. The Exchequer alone will be unable to bear the huge financial burden involved. We must explore other avenues, look at alternative sources of finance and examine new ways of doing business. That is where the National Development Finance Agency comes in. It is an initiative that will enable the Government to tap into new sources of finance, to involve the private sector in a very direct way in the provision of public infrastructure and it will enable the Government to deliver the projects contained in the national development plan much quicker than if it were to rely on Exchequer funding.We have already seen how the private sector can contribute to the development of the national transport infrastructure. The Westlink and Eastlink bridges in Dublin were both developed as public private partnership projects several years ago. It is a pity so little has been done since then to involve the private sector in infrastructural development. A great opportunity was missed in the last ten years to bring private sector finance and expertise into the roads programme but it is better late than never.The creation of the NDFA is a welcome development that provides for the first time a formal mechanism whereby the private sector can contribute to our national infrastructure. The very existence of the NDFA will send a signal to the private sector companies throughout Europe and the rest of the world that we are open for business and that we are looking for imaginative and innovative ways to finance a programme of infrastructural development.Bringing the private sector into the provision of roads will involve the introduction of tolls on certain stretches of motorway and this has been politically controversial in the past. Motorists, however, will not object to paying a reasonable levy of tolls in return for the provision of a new motorway network. Tolling is widespread in Europe and there is no reason why Ireland should not follow best European practice.We have come to realise that an infrastructural deficit not only affects quality of life but our economic future. We are willing to play our part in providing the proper development of infrastructure. For that reason alone we should support this initiative and not be afraid to bring the expertise of the private sector into the public stewardship of the State and our conducting business.This process must not slow down the progress we have to make. When people ask for advice from the NDFA, it must offer it in a constructive manner and not delay projects that are so badly needed. When there is an infrastructural deficit and a need for investment in health and education, we should welcome the initiative. Public private partnerships have already worked in health and education. With this new way of thinking we should see the future development of the Cork School of Music, currently the subject of a public private partnership. The Minister must free any blockages to the partnership to make sure the project is complete when Cork becomes European City of Culture in 2005.All sides of the House should welcome this Bill and this initiative if we are to address the deficit and fund projects in the most economic manner possible.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I welcome the Minister to the House. My life has not been the same for the past six months without our regular jousting in the other House but I am sure he is doing splendidly with my successor, Deputy Burton.I do not see the need for this Bill. I read the Official Report of the debate in the other House and listened to Committee Stage but I am still not clear about its purpose. Either it is an effort to remove a serious amount of borrowing from balance sheets in an unaccountable way or it adds another layer of bureaucracy to the already extensive layers of bureaucracy we have. Either way, the Bill is wrong in principle or unnecessary in practice.The genesis of the Bill is to be found in the Fianna Fáil manifesto. I was interested to hear the Minister say that he wrote to his colleagues earlier this year inviting their proposals for PPPs. He did not tell us the response of his colleagues. I suspect it was less positive than he might have wished. The NDFA is not the appropriate response.At least part of this must lie in the Minister's well-known aversion to borrowing. He came into power in 1997 with a manifesto commitment to curtailing capital spending to increases of 5% per annum, a commitment he thankfully never met. It would have been wholly inappropriate in the circumstances but, as an indication of his thinking, it is instructive. Senator Mansergh was probably also involved.The experience in Ireland of borrowing for capital purposes has, in fact, been positive. We have got into serious difficulty on occasion, not least between 1977 and 1981, when we borrowed extensively for current purposes. Most of our borrowing, however, for infrastructural investment has been quite positive. Evaluations carried out for EU co-financed projects indicate we got good value for money. My party does not, therefore, share the Minister's and the Government's aversion to borrowing and we have no difficulty with borrowing for the delivery of NDP projects into the future.The difficulty with the national development plan has not been with funding, or even the question of whether it should be a mix of public and private. The difficulty has been with delivery. The Minister will be familiar with the FGS report which specifically focused on the roads projects. It makes interesting reading because it points up a variety of defects in the way we go about managing major infrastructural, particularly roads. Throughout the system, we have been slow in design, planning, route selection and particularly in cost management. The only way in which the likely cost of the motorway projects were guesstimated – with the benefit of hindsight it seems to have been a guesstimate – was by taking an average, per kilometre cost of roadway and simply multiplying it by the likely length of any given stretch of motorway. To put it another way, no realistic effort was made to estimate the likely cost of projects and it is hardly surprising there was a cost over-run. It is not sufficient to say, as the Taoiseach has said and the Minister has implied, that it all comes down to construction price inflation – it does not. There is a real deficit in terms of our ability to manage the cost of major infrastructure projects. I am not convinced that setting up the NDFA will improve matters.I was interested in Senator Mansergh's comments on the Stability and Growth Pact, which probably reflect the Minister's thinking. I am opposed to the specific terms of what is simply a political agreement, as it has been since the start. It makes no sense, in the context of a developing economy such as Ireland's, that investment should be curtailed in the way currently prescribed by the pact. The faults of the pact are well known. It does not distinguish between current and capital spending or between countries that have an existing high level of debt and those that do not, and it should.Ireland should be to the fore in welcoming Commissioner Solbes's comments of recent weeks. He has in mind a refinement of the pact rather than an abandonment of it, and that would not lead to any loss of confidence such as Senator Mansergh describes. Relatively few countries will be able to benefit – if that is the right word – from a refinement of the rules governing the currency, on the lines suggested by the Commissioner. Ireland is clearly one of those countries and it is common sense that we be allowed to borrow for capital purposes and not be required to fund a national development plan or major investments in infrastructure out of current revenues. We should have been saying this for several years past, when we did not need to borrow, but to say it now is to simply state the obvious. To state it in simple terms as President Prodi did, the Stability and Growth Pact is stupid and needs to be re-negotiated. It is just a political agreement, not a matter of sovereign commitment as the Minister has described it on occasion. It can and should be changed when it does not make sense.My party is not opposed in principle to public private partnerships though it has been more sceptical than other parties, and rightly so. It has drawn on the experience of PFI in Britain to justify its scepticism. To cut to the bottom line, PPPs should not be used in areas where it would be inappropriate to introduce a profit motive and where there is not, as Senator Phelan rightly put it, an appropriate income stream. However, I have no problem with hard tolls, for example. They might not be appropriate in every case but I would have no difficulty, to avoid the pleasure of seeing too much of Cashel or Fermoy on the way to our second city, if I was required to pay a few euro extra. That needs to be decided on a case by case basis and I oppose the use of hard tolls on the M50 or city bypasses, for example, as people should be encouraged to use such roads and there should not be barriers to that. I have no problem with PPPs where there is a clearly defined income stream. However, to introduce a profit motive into the health service, even by the back door, is very difficult.I do not understand what this Bill is about. I know the Minister has a problem with borrowing and perhaps he is trying to take it off the balance sheet. However, the initial justification offered of gathering together expertise in an advice centre, as it were, is a reasonable one. If that is all there is to it, I would have no problem supporting it. There are PPP units in individual Departments, although they are probably patchy in terms of experience as is the Minister's experience of them. There is a useful and well resourced unit in the Department of Finance which has been doing good work in dealing with the social partners in putting together a structure over recent years. Are those people to be taken from that Department and put into the new agency? Why is that new agency and its brass plate needed? Why not do this in the context of the NTMA rather than giving it a different corporate structure? Why is it necessary to set up special purpose companies, SPCs, which cause serious concern? Accountability will become diffuse and may get lost altogether.I do not understand if it is intended to continue with PPP units in individual Departments or what the decision making process is in that regard. I will use a road project as an example. The NRA currently develops the project and decides in principle that it wants to do it, usually in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. That Minister eventually comes, as part of the Estimates process, to the Minister for Finance who either provides the money or not, and the project goes ahead or does not. At what point in this process is it necessary to go to the NDFA? Will that be before money is sought from the Minister for Finance as part of the Estimates process or at an earlier stage? Is this only being done because Departments have been slow to come up with suitable projects for PPPs? If that is the case, I am not sure this is the right way to do it. Departments need to be encouraged to be innovative in their thinking and I appreciate that they have not always been that. Nonetheless, I am not convinced that the NDFA is the right way to go.I believe PPPs are useful in principle but we must be discriminating in the way they are approached, and careful to ensure there is accountability to this House with regard not just to the overall budget but to individual projects. That has already been lost by the use of the NRA and may become more diffuse if the NDFA is introduced. The Labour Party is opposed to this Bill largely because it is unnecessary but also because my party is suspicious of the motives of the Minister in introducing it.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I welcome the Minister to the House. Like Senator McDowell, I find it hard to understand what the Bill is about. I have gone into some detail with regard to public private partnerships. In some cases, I can see how such partnerships will work but not in all. If this Bill is passed, I hope that public private partnerships will only be used where there will be a positive gain.How does the Minister envisage sewerage schemes and the provision of sewage treatment plants working under public private partnerships? This Bill seems to put a body in place to advise on the financing of public private partnerships. The financing of a such partnerships is only one aspect and, as Senator McDowell has said, if this Bill was only about advice with regard to financial matters, that would be fine. However, there are more aspects to public private partnerships than finance. The provision of a sewage treatment works to any medium-size town under a public private partnership gives rise to a situation where ratepayers must pay for part of the extension of the sewerage lines and for the capital upgrading of the sewage treatment works under the polluter pays principle. Under a public private partnership, the ratepayers of a town have not only to pay for the running costs of a project but also the capital costs because there is a clawback under the polluter pays principle.  In cases such as this, these partnerships will raise the cost of providing those services throughout the country. There will be an inequitable system because there are sewerage systems in place for many years that are not a capital cost to ratepayers in some towns. On the other hand, ratepayers will have to pay a capital cost for new schemes in the town. One town will have a clear advantage in terms of sewage treatment works. It will be an inequitable system. It does not only apply to sewage treatment systems, but to the provision of water services, etc.Like Senator McDowell and other speakers, I do not have a problem with the Bill if it relates only to the provision of financial expertise to public private partnerships. However, it does not seem feasible to set up a finance agency to do only that. It seems there is not much more to the Bill.As regards the national spatial strategy, I have looked for a debate on several occasions on the BMW region and how it is coping financially compared to the rest of the country. That region is not getting its fair share of the cake. If the Bill is passed and this finance agency is established, and if the Minister is serious about the national spatial strategy, he should consider locating it in the BMW region.

We all agree that we need proper management of our finances to ensure things work.

Much work will remain to be done even when the system is complete.I do not know the purpose of special purpose companies. The Minister did not indicate in his speech how many or why such companies will be established. Will one be established in every county? I do not know the reason for them. Perhaps the Minister might clarify that.I agree with Senator McDowell that public private partnerships have worked well in other countries in the past. However, we must be conscious of safety issues. We are all aware of the problems with the rail service in England. Companies tend to put profit before safety. We should study the English system carefully and learn from its errors.We had a private briefing session this morning with the Department of Transport at which I raised the issue of tolling. That is a classic example of public private partnerships in action. Will the Minister consider abolishing car tax? Other countries which have tolling systems do not have car tax. It would be a gesture of goodwill to motorists.

That would generate goodwill in local communities. We are all hounded by people who oppose motorways and tolling systems. However, they might accept them if they thought car tax would be abolished and some of the tolls would be used for local roads. That might work, particularly given that the National Roads Authority is not putting money into non-national roads. Tolling is important if we want to improve our infrastructure.I disagree with Senator Mansergh about the great track record of Fianna Fáil, which has been the dominant party in Government for the past 80 years. Unfortunately, the country's infrastructure is not good, so we must equate one with the other. We have a lot of work to do in that area.

I was impressed by their well-informed contributions. I hope it proves informative for those who follow the debate outside the House.As I said on many occasions, the Bill is an important part of the Government's plan to address the country's infrastructural deficit. The Bill, when enacted, will establish a National Development Finance Agency which will endeavour to maximise value for money for the Exchequer in a number of ways, including through the identification of the optimal financing packages and the application of commercial standards as regards the evaluation of financial risk and costs for each project. The NDFA will add an important dimension to the financial advice and expertise through existing arrangements for developing infrastructure. It will not substitute or replace those arrangements.Even with normal democratic arrangements, the Government will have overall responsibility for deciding social and economic issues and priorities. Responsibility for the initiation of projects, including PPP projects, for determining what projects will be prioritised and for individual project management will remain with the relevant Ministers and PPP units created in the particular sectors, such as the NRA for national roads and the RPA for railways.The PPP unit of the Department of Finance has responsibility for leading, driving and co-ordinating PPPs in Ireland. Experts from the central unit have already made significant contributions to developing early pilot projects, to stimulating competitive markets for PPPs and for agreeing with the social partners a framework for PPPs. In addition, the central PPP unit has been instrumental in achieving PPP contracts which provide for the benefits of any private sector re-financing to be shared with the public sector. This has been lauded in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.The PPP market has developed in recent years to a stage where there are now upwards of 40 PPP projects in procurement. The primary role of the Department of Finance's unit is the creation of a comprehensive body of guidance on all aspects of public private partnerships covering financial, legal, technical, human resource and process issues. This guidance will set the context within which the NDFA will function.The NDFA will provide expert financial advice and, in some circumstances, it may provide finance. It will underpin and augment existing arrangements. It will not replace, supersede or duplicate these arrangements nor will it add another layer of bureaucracy. The National Development Finance Agency should achieve significant savings on project costs through negotiating optimal financing packages and reducing consultancy fees.Senator Phelan asked what the benefits of the NDFA will be. It is expected that the benefits of the agency will include maximising value for money by helping State authorities avail of the best finance packages for capital projects being funded by non-Exchequer sources, applying commercial standards in terms of evaluating financial risk and cost for each project, underpinning the PPP approach to delivery of infrastructure and centralising commercial, including financial and legal, expertise thereby reducing dependence on external consultants with consequent savings.Giving other bodies, such as the National Roads Authority or the Rail Procurement Agency, powers to raise project finance themselves will not achieve these benefits. As Senator Mansergh correctly said, these agencies have technical expertise but can not be expected to have the financial knowledge of the NDFA.Senator Finucane and others mentioned infrastructure. The country is facing infrastructural deficits and it is important that these are addressed urgently and in a way that delivers value for money. With this in mind I wrote to all Ministers and to the NTMA earlier this year asking them to bring forward projects and proposals for tackling our infrastructural needs. At the same time I asked my officials to examine international developments and best practice in financing and structuring public investment projects, particularly public private partnerships. Finally, the experience gained from the early pilot PPP projects indicates that Departments and State authorities need specific expert advice to assist them in identifying the optimal financial packages for their projects.Senators Finucane, Browne and others asked about the provisions in the Bill for special purpose companies. It is proposed that section 5 will provide powers to enable the establishment of special purpose companies, or SPCs, to give the NDFA additional options for raising moneys on the most beneficial terms for relevant projects. Section 5 now provides that the NDFA may itself form, or cause to be formed, an SPC. Special purpose companies are for financing purposes only and the consent of the Minister for Finance must be obtained in writing before each company is formed. Special purpose companies created under the legislation are not prevented from receiving funding and guarantees from the Minister. I am satisfied this is necessary to ensure that the NDFA has adequate flexibility in discharging its functions. It is not envisaged that functions and guarantees will be given to all special purpose companies. In practice, the power of the Minister to guarantee the debts of a special purpose company will not be used very often as it is likely a special purpose company will be used in instances where there are cash flows from user charges or tolls thereby obviating the need for such a guarantee. Nevertheless, it is considered prudent to include such a provision at this time.The Minister for Finance has the power to make funds available to the NDFA on such terms as he or she considers appropriate. Should the NDFA or a company require funding at a time when market conditions are not optimal, the Minister will be able to provide interim funding. In other words, this provision will ensure that the NDFA or a company is not held hostage to the financial markets. Depending on Exchequer resources funds may be provided to such bodies on a longer term basis. This provision will prove most useful in enabling the Exchequer to top up or provide core funding for a project where there are hard tolls or user charges but not in sufficient quantity to service 100% private sector funding. In such an instance the Exchequer would provide, say, 20% funding and the company would seek to raise the balance based on the cash flow for the project and would allow, of course, for a Government guarantee.The NDFA also has powers similar to those of the Minister already described. The concept is to provide for the Minister to channel money to a company via the NDFA and provide for the NDFA, with the approval of the Minister, to use its own resources to fund a company wholly or in part. In the event of the NDFA having a surplus at some time in the future it may be appropriate to use such moneys to fund new projects. Any new company formed would require share capital. This amendment gives the Minister and the NDFA power to contribute to such share capital, which is essential.Special purpose companies offer the following benefits. First, the optimal financing structure can be put in place to raise the money to invest in projects such as bridges or tunnels with hard tolls where private sector financing packages are not sufficiently attractive. Second, a key concern to investors, the debt repayment capacity of the borrower and the risk that the cash flow may be diverted to other parties, can be addressed. Where the cash flows are sufficient to service the debt the best way to insulate them and give maximum protection to investors/lenders is to form a special purpose company as a financing vehicle for the project. This special purpose company would raise the moneys for the project and would have priority rights for cash flows such as, for example, tolls. Such an SPC would not get involved in any other project and, therefore, investors would have more confidence that their investments would be repaid. In return the special purpose company should be able to raise the moneys on better terms, that is lower borrowing.Special purpose companies have been used before. The NTMA formed a special purpose company in the late 1980s when the loan books of local authorities were sold off to raise money. A special purpose company was formed under the auspices of the NTMA through which the finance was raised. A SPC would be a limited company with normal memoranda and articles of association and its purpose – a road, bridge, tunnel or whatever – would be set out. The private sector might take, for example, 60% of the company and the NDFA would also take a part. This would allow the SPC to get the optimal financing arrangement for the project.Senator Finucane asked about the PPP project comprising five post-primary schools. The Comptroller and Auditor General has already commenced a value for money audit of that project, which was the first PPP pilot scheme to reach financial closure. While we learned a great deal from the schools project there were problems, particularly in relation to the cost of private finance. The development of our proposals for the NDFA, with its emphasis on optimal financing structures and value for money, owes much to the evaluation we made of the schools PPP project and other early projects under the pilot programme.Senator Mansergh, with his knowledge of history will know this better than me, but I believe Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance when the special purpose company was used for the sale of the loan books. The company concerned was called Ulysses.The State should always be the borrower who will get the most attractive terms. There is folklore to the effect that in the early years of the State a large company in Dublin – now a multinational company – lent money to the State. Only the very largest public companies could borrow at levels near to those available to the State. There are other advantages in managing a project by way of a public private partnership. In the case of the schools project, the schools were delivered on time and on budget to a higher specification. I have not seen any of the schools but I am told this by everyone concerned, Opposition Deputies and Senators included. The financial arrangements were more expensive than would have been available to the State. Six schools were to have taken part in the project and one school opted for the traditional approach and decided to wait its turn with the Department of Education and Science. The five schools have been built under the PPP and the sixth school is still in correspondence with the Department. It is likely to be so for some time – without giving away secrets about next year.The financial package was undoubtedly quite expensive. When the NDFA is set up, the projects will be decided upon by the line Minister in the relevant Department or by an appropriate accounting officer under the equivalent delegated sanction. They will manage the project and use the expertise in their Department to decide what should be done. They will then be obliged to consult the NDFA and offer a financial arrangement. Having obtained the agency's advice, they will not be obliged to accept it. The NDFA may say it will be able to finance a project better than anyone else and that it will do it in a certain way. It will then be the responsibility of the line Minister and his or her Department to decide what route to take.The NDFA will not be responsible for deciding whether projects goes ahead and will have nothing to do with assessing them. When the chief executive officer and chairman of the NDFA, on foot of its annual report, come before the committee each year, they will speak about the financing. They will not answer questions on whether it was a good idea to proceed with a particular project. For example, if, as stated on Committee Stage in the Dáil, we decided to build a Taj Mahal in Celbridge – which is near my home and that of Senator Walsh – it would cost thousands of billions of euro to do so. The Government would then be obliged to make a decision on whether to proceed and the NDFA would offer advice about the optimum financial arrangements. It would not be in a position to say it was a great idea, a bad idea, a Mickey mouse idea or whatever; it would offer advice on the best financial arrangements for the project. Common sense will, hopefully, prevail and the Taj Mahal will be built nearer to my home in Clane than to the home of Senator Walsh.Apart from that, the NDFA will advise about finance. It will not act as a layer of bureaucracy designed to stop projects proceeding. Projects will take their normal place in the queue and Ministers in the relevant Departments will have to decide, in lieu of their total capital allocation, how matters will proceed.For at least ten days after the launch of the Fianna Fáil manifesto earlier this year, much to the chagrin of many commentators and members of Opposition parties, we concentrated on the economy. A great deal of the debate took place at press conferences held at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m., which was much too early for some journalists to attend. Had they been present, they would not have made such outlandish comments during the past six months about what was or was not promised.There was much debate during the campaign about the National Development Finance Agency and we produced charts which outlined the position for the next five years. Senator McDowell definitely saw these and the Labour Party produced similar charts dealing with finance, current spending, etc., for the next five years. One of our charts contained information about additional capital projects costing €2 billion a year for the next five years. I subtracted that €2 billion to get the Exchequer borrowing requirement, made an assumption that 50% would not qualify for the general Government balance and then added it back to arrive at the GGB percentage. Senator McDowell will remember this fact, which has been missed by most other people. The increase in current spending was in single digits for the five years outlined. When we announced it after the election everybody became upset.

The sponsoring Department will be entitled to either accept or ignore the agency's advice.Let us consider the example of a project in line with the overall schools building programme. It is likely the NDFA would state that it could provide a better financial package for such a project. In the instance to which I refer, the line Department was the Department of Education and Science which possesses all the details of the project in question and its officials could be questioned by members of the relevant committee, if necessary. Jarvis Limited ran the project, but the financial package was put in place by Barclays Bank which, naturally, would have sought a return on its investment. It is possible that, had it been in existence, the NDFA would have offered advice on alternative financial arrangements. That, in a nutshell, is the purpose of the NDFA.The agency may occasionally become involved in providing finance to the relevant body. That is why, in the period between the Bill's publication and the Committee Stage debate in the Lower House, I came to the opinion that the restriction on not allowing the Minister for Finance to guarantee or provide funds was too restrictive. There may be an opportunity for the NDFA to provide finance when a particular SPC needs some kind of State guarantee or requires equity finance from the State. We allow for as much flexibility as possible, but this provision relates to finance only.

The reason is that the NTMA would be at cross-purposes. The NTMA's job is to borrow money for the State at the lowest possible cost while the NDFA will try to obtain the best possible deal for a particular project.Members also asked why money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund cannot be used for these projects. The answer is that it can be used. There is nothing in statute to prevent money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund being invested in any capital projects in the State. Such investment would be subject only to the normal rule that the optimal rate of return would be obtained. There has been a good deal of misinformation about the National Pensions Reserve Fund. The trustees of the fund – like any other pension fund trustees – can invest in any project they wish, but they must be satisfied that a particular project is not overly risky and that they will obtain a maximum rate of return on their investment. The National Pensions Reserve Fund was as near as I could have got at the time to a normal pension fund in terms of obtaining an optimal rate of return. I suggested many other ideas, but in the end I opted for that simple approach.The purpose of the NDFA agency is to deliver value for money for the Exchequer by facilitating the best financial arrangements for projects. This, in turn, will assist in the delivery of key elements of the national development plan and other infrastructure projects. Great care has been taken to ensure that best practice is being followed with regard to the structure, staffing and governance arrangements for the agency. The Bill imposes rigorous requirements regarding disclosure of interests and confidential information in relation to seeking to exert improper influence.I again thank Members for their contributions and I commend the Bill to the House.

In page 4, subsection (1), line 32, after "Finance" to insert "and Project Management".This acknowledges that the problem with the national development plan is not one of funding but of managing the projects. It is with that in mind that I tabled the amendment. Given that the Minister has gone to the trouble of setting up the new agency, he should take into consideration the primary problem in regard to the building of all types of infrastructure, which is the managing of projects rather than funding.

Project management relates to the execution of a project according to technical and perhaps financial parameters. The Bill has to do with something rather separate such as financial mechanisms. Therefore, I am not sure whether it is a sound amendment.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	248	The proposed national development finance agency is not intended to undertake project management. The functions of the agency, which are very specific and are set out in section 3, include providing advice and, in certain circumstances, finance in respect of public investment projects, including public private partnerships. It will be a matter for the relevant Ministers or, where there is delegated sanction, the accounting officers or their equivalent, to decide on the financing structure of projects. The management of projects will be a matter for the appropriate State authority. In other words, the NRA will manage its projects and the DOE, or a local authority on its behalf, may manage another project. The Department of Education and Science or one of its subordinate agencies may manage another project. It will not be a matter for the new body to be involved in the management of projects. Consequently, is dona liom nach bhfuil mé in ann glacadh leis an leasú.

In page 4, line 41, after "authority" to insert "provided that the opportunity to offer a financial package is open to competitive offer by other providers".The amendment seeks to ensure that the sponsoring Department does not find itself restricted only to public private finance packages put together by the agency. If there are competitors who can offer better arrangements, and there is a body of experience in other European countries, we should allow them to offer their services. The agency should be solely responsible for providing financial packages for public projects and we might have the opportunity to find others who could finance packages on better terms in a more innovative manner.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Section 3(3) provides: "In carrying out its functions the Agency shall comply with all guidelines and instructions that the Minister may, from time to time, issue to the Agency." Such guidelines will be drafted by an interdepartmental group of experts and will be subject to the advice of the Office of the Attorney General. They will take full account of national and EU procurement procedures which are designed to ensure fair, competitive and transparent practices. For that reason, it is not necessary to amend the functions of the agency and I regret that I will not, therefore, be able to accept this amendment.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I would like to ask the Minister of State about this amendment, in so far as it relates to projects such as group water schemes, extensions to sewerage schemes or the provision of sewage treatment units. There is a lot of merit in the amendment proposed by Senator John Phelan. I understand that a number of companies will tender for specific PPP projects, such as group water schemes or schools. The tendering process has been put in place so that a successful tendering company will be assured that its proposal represents the best deal in terms of finance, maintenance, machinery and all other aspects. The successful group will know that it is the only group that can provide a certain PPP as all the other tenders will have been different in some respects. This amendment proposes that tenderers will be open to receiving advice from the NDFA.I am not sure how this section of the Bill will work and I would like the Minister of State to explain it to the House. The expert agency that is being established in this Bill will give financial advice to local authorities and Departments about the commencement of PPPs. How will the agency be able to give financial advice to a company that is tendering for a contract for a group water scheme or a sewerage scheme? How will the agency's advice be of benefit? Each company will tender independently and will claim that it has made the best proposal in terms of finance, maintenance and so on. Advice will be received from the National Development Finance Agency only after the tenders have been received. I do not know when the agency will become involved.I support Senator Phelan's amendment because if the agency can give advice, the groups who are tendering should be able to hear it. The advice should be made available to them so it can be taken into account when tenders are being drawn up. We are trying to get the best possible deal for the people of a town or a community – the people who will be served by the PPP project. I hope the Minister of State can understand the point I am making. I am in a haze about how those who will tender – several companies will want to tender for PPP projects – will benefit from the financial experience and advice of the NDFA and I would like the Minister of State to explain the matter. There is merit in the amendment, as all groups should be able to avail of the agency's advice.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	252	The wording of this amendment does not seem to be in accordance with the point made by Senator Paddy Burke. The amendment seems to be superfluous, as section 3 of the Bill clearly covers all possibilities in its reference to, "the optimal means of financing the cost of public investment projects." As the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has stated, the EU has strict tendering procedures. I do not understand Senator Burke's point that the agency's role should include giving advice to other groups, as the Bill clearly says that the role of the agency is to advise the State. We should not forget that the State represents the entire community, including taxpayers. While the agency may hold discussions with other groups about financing, its clear responsibility is to advise the State. I do not think we should invite the possibility of a conflict of interest by allowing it to advise private groups that are tendering for a project, unless it is acting on behalf of the State in doing so.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I would like to ask the Minister of State about the NDFA, the role of which is to advise, as Senator Mansergh has mentioned. Staff of local authorities were traditionally the best placed persons to give advice on the ground. Will the new agency seek advice from representatives of local authorities? If not, where do we stand in relation to the last Government's policy, as outlined in Better Local Government? Does this Bill create another layer of bureaucracy that is tightening the purse strings of the Government when it comes to funding local authorities? It is understandable that confusion exists, as the role of local authorities in the tendering process is unclear if another agency is giving the ultimate advice and is charged with ensuring that value for money is assured.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I have listened with great interest to the important points made by Senators Paddy Burke, Mansergh and Ulick Burke. Senator Paddy Burke raised the question of tendering for PPPs and asked about the companies that put forward the best overall deal. The NDFA will advise State authorities on the financial elements of the tenders and will assess and evaluate what has been proposed. Invitations to tender will make clear that the NDFA may give such advice and the Office of the Attorney General will watch out for illegalities in the procedures. Several stages are involved in the tender process and the agency will assess all of them. The public invitation to tender by State bodies and Departments will specify that the NDFA will be involved in giving advice.Senator Paddy Burke is a decent man and he comes from a great county, but his suggestion involves a request for the State, through the NDFA, to act as a public consultant to various groups and to disperse advice to them before allowing tenders to proceed. Over the years, the relevant Department or State agency involved in seeking tenders for a large project had to appoint national or international consultants that sometimes received large amounts of money to evaluate the proposals and make recommendations to the State. The new professional agency will give advice about tenders, assist the procurement of finance and make recommendations, but the final decision will be a matter for the appropriate Minister or body, based on an independent assessment carried out by the NDFA. That is a new departure for the State, which is bound to save a lot of money.To move on to the point made by my colleague, Senator Ulick Burke, better local government has been delivered with massive new structures, systems and numbers of staff. I hope it is working. If it is not, God help us, in view of the resources which have been ploughed into it.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	255	The Minister is losing touch.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I would not say that. The Senator is in the middle of it and I hope he can use it to the maximum advantage of our constituents. He was on that local authority for a long time. I hope all of these innovations and structures are working.Looking at construction inflation over recent years, huge money, allocated by the Government for various public projects has been eaten up. It was in double digits last year and has gone up massively over the past five years. Surely we need an independent assessment to ensure we get real value for the taxpayers' euro. That is the purpose of the agency. By getting the real value we will have extra resources to spend, be able to carry out more projects, improve our infrastructure and meet our targets within the national development plan.Senator Paddy Burke's question on group water schemes highlights a good example of how the NDFA adds a new and necessary dimension for project development. The NDFA can advise the project managers of the best financing mechanism to deliver the scheme and, if it is the best value for money, provide funding direct or through a special purpose company. The question was raised as to what they can do for various group schemes. A special purpose company can finance them if that is relevant, prudent and practical. The advice will be provided, not to the tenderers, but to the bodies delivering the project. That will meet the needs of the users by putting in place a financially viable project and give much better value to the people.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Surely this is just another layer of bureaucracy, in the light of what the Minister of State has said. The National Development Finance Agency is only going to advise about finance. It will have no role other than obtaining finance for some of the public private partnerships and advising about the financial package. There is much more to those public private partnerships than just finance. There is, as I have already pointed out, the running of the business, the construction of it and so forth.Senator McDowell said earlier that he did not know what the Bill was about. I was also at a loss and I am at a greater loss now. The Minister of State has spelt out in detail that this is only another layer of bureaucracy. We have established that and the Minister of State should tell it as it is.When a company tenders for a group water scheme or a sewerage scheme this agency will evaluate the available financial packages and financial status of the tender. It will advise the local authority or the Government. However, it will not have the expertise, unless it employs it either inside or outside the State, in relation to the construction, the maintenance or the type of machinery. I am at a loss to know why the Government should set up a national development agency just to advise on the financial packages that will be available or as a vehicle for companies to raise the funding to carry out the public private partnership.The Minister has confirmed what I thought, that it is another layer of bureaucracy. There is some merit in the proposal made Senator Phelan that the role of the agency should be given to other operators. There is no basis for setting it up for the sake of it and for advising about financial packages and funding.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I completely reject Senator Paddy Burke's contention that it is another layer of bureaucracy. It is substituting for consultants who often cost much more than bureaucracy. We are talking about a procedure which is already there, not adding another procedure. The experience with bodies like the NTMA showed that there is a possibility of saving significant amounts of money and of broadening the range of financial instruments which can be used to fund projects. It is failure to understand it that would lead any Senator to say it was another layer of bureaucracy. If that was all it was, there would no point in the Bill.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Will the Minister confirm what Senator Mansergh has said, that it is a substitution for consultants? If this body is to substitute for consultants and there has to be an assessment by it of all projects throughout the country, surely it will have to call in consultants' expertise. If not, then the agency will be nothing more than a stalling group for endless projects, as in the Department of Education and Science. There are no architects but there is a list of 400 national schools that are begging for the go-ahead. Now there will be another agency that will take control, in order to give advice. Nothing will be given the go-ahead or the green light until this body has vetted it as to its value for money. With a range of projects throughout the country awaiting a final decision, there will be further delays. Maybe this is a kind of interim agency to legitimately hold and freeze everything. The Government does not know where it is going with this Bill.

It is good to hear him. As my colleague, Deputy McCreevy said, it is not another layer of bureaucracy. It is an added dimension, providing financial expertise to Ministers, Government Departments and State agencies and authorities to get the best value for money. If we wanted to create another layer of bureaucracy we would do what the Opposition said and give all of the responsibilities to the new agency so that there would be duplication of effort and a slowing down. The agency is to expedite projects, it is to expedite the national development plan and bring a new stream of opportunity through new financial decision-making processes and new procurement procedures.The responsibility for any project will rest with the relevant Minister or the relevant agency or authority, as always. The agency will not be another layer of bureaucracy. It will not duplicate any of the project development, project management or implementation structures that are already in place and the expertise already there. The agency will be involved with the financial side of projects. It will draw on the acknowledged expertise of an existing agency, the National Treasury Management Agency. We were lambasted for setting it up.

Expertise on technical and structural issues will be found in the NRA or any other agency this new body will be dealing with and need not be duplicated in the NDFA. The new agency will bring many benefits. It is expected that these will include maximising value for money by helping State authorities avail of the best finance package for capital projects from non-Exchequer sources, taking the pressure off the Exchequer and off the taxpayer. It will be able to identify the funds, the system and the mechanism of delivering the finance in co-operation with the other agencies. It will apply commercial standards in terms of evaluating financial risks and costs for each project. It will be able to evaluate those risks and decide whether there will be a strain on the finances of the State if a particular route is followed.

What more can we do? How could one do it better? How are we to get rid of the delay caused by tendering for consultancies, going through the interview process, advertising and making the decision? The consultants must then decide how to handle the project and then there is more advertising for the tenders. This will all be streamlined by this new agency.The NDFA will help to maximise value for money for the Exchequer by clearly identifying the best financing packages and applying commercial standards in evaluating financial risk and costs for each project. In addition, when the NDFA is able to borrow at better rates than the private sector, less State subvention may be required for capital projects. It can look at the expertise of the NTMA and the international financial marketplace and see where opportunities exist. It will see the mobility of currencies across the world and be able to make recommendations.

In page 5, subsection (1), between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following new paragraph:"(e) to manage the investment on behalf of the National Pension Fund of moneys assigned by the Fund each year for the purpose of investment in infrastructural projects that yield an adequate return to the Fund.”.This is an important amendment. Much time was given on Second Stage to the issue of the national pensions fund. While I was the first to admit to the Minister that the idea of setting money aside for future pension commitments was admirable, we have borrowed about €1.5 billion this year to invest in the pensions fund. This money is being invested in stock markets around the world while our infrastructure – not just roads but also sewerage schemes and so on – is groaning and under pressure, in many cases out of date and dilapidated. It is not appropriate for us to take that €1.5 billion out of the economy and invest it in other countries.The Minister made the point that he did not want to influence the economy unduly at a time when things were going quite well, but by the Minister's own admission the Celtic tiger has become a bit quieter. It would be appropriate for the Minister of State to accept this amendment because it does not commit the Government to using funds from the national pensions fund but would allow the NDFA to manage an investment from the fund if it decided to invest in infrastructure in order to obtain the best possible return. I urge the Minister of State to consider this amendment because it is a reasonable one.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	277	While I understand the sentiment behind this amendment and its superficial attraction, I think it would be a bad move. We heard the Minister say that there was no obstacle to the money from the national pensions fund being used for infrastructural projects, but this subordinates the judgment of those who manage the fund to the NDFA and this should not happen. Those who manage the fund should concentrate on where to invest: they must make that judgment, not the NDFA. I see this amendment as hollowing out the independence and autonomy of the national pensions fund.The fund is critical for our economic future, especially for our younger people. Many European countries, including Germany, are in a state of total stagnation because of huge pension liabilities. We are provident in providing for the future and we must resist the temptation of the Opposition, both before the election and since, to undermine the integrity of the national pensions fund. The amendment is not a good one.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	279	Far from being superficial, as Senator Mansergh said, this amendment is entirely appropriate. If he reflects upon it in greater detail he will see why. My party, before the last election, proposed no diminution of the funds to be set aside for pensions into the future, irrespective of other views from the Opposition. Those views, as the record shows, did not emanate from this party. It seems sensible to co-ordinate the moneys rightly put aside by the State for the provision of infrastructural services. Nothing can stop that, as the Minister said in his Second Stage speech. There is considerable merit, however, in the amendment as proposed by Senator Phelan. In effect, one is asking experts, in the Minister's own words, to manage money and ensure that as much as possible is invested in the State. In a sense, we are suggesting the addition of a function to those set out in section 4. I do not see it in any way as undermining the existing arrangements.I went into this debate with an open mind. As other colleagues have said, I have not yet heard an over-riding argument for the establishment of this new quango. We should give it the financial teeth it is looking for. The suggestion for the most significant additional function to come out of the debate so far is Senator Phelan's. It is worthy of consideration.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Senator Paddy Burke is correct – of course public private partnerships are commercial entities that exist to make money. There is nothing wrong with that. We are giving a new dimension to the State financing and procurement area, giving it commercial teeth and taking it away from the situation where it has been a constant drain on the Exchequer, where the tap is run and the nation is bled dry. We have to ensure that does not happen and that we give an opportunity for private sector resources to be deployed to improve public infrastructure. A new vehicle is being created to assist that, the National Development Finance Agency.This amendment would constitute a significant amendment to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act. There are no plans at present by either the Government or the Minister for Finance to alter the arrangements in relation to the national pensions reserve fund. There is nothing in that legislation to prevent the pensions fund commissioners investing in infrastructural projects, subject to the overriding requirement in the legislation to invest prudently and to seek the optimum return for the fund. That is what the commissioners are charged to do. The national pensions reserve fund has managed to achieve the highest rate of return on its investment.The NDFA will seek value for money with the lowest cost of funds possible for delivering the project and develop value for money financing mechanisms for infrastructural projects. This amendment would place statutory requirements on the NDFA and that would not work. It would tie the hands of the NDFA and the pensions fund commissioners.There is nothing, however, to stop the commissioners, as they see fit, from investing in these projects. It would be foolish to insert an amendment that could jeopardise the flexibility required by the commissioners and the NDFA. Consequently I cannot accept the amendment.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The Minister of State has missed the point of the amendment. We are not proposing that the new agency tells the national pensions reserve fund where to put its money. The amendment would allow the use of public funds by the NDFA. Different Government agencies are involved and it is logical that there should be contact between the National Development Finance Agency and the pensions fund when there is such an infrastructural deficit and the economic situation has changed in recent years.This is not telling the national pensions reserve fund where to put its money. It is a mechanism to allow for this wording to be inserted in the Bill whereby funds could be put to use by the NDFA.

There is a conflict of interest between the functions of the two agencies. It is important to stress that we all support pensions fund money going into infrastructure where it will get a good return for the pensions fund. The trustees must make that decision and must not have the decision made for them by the NDFA. There is a fundamental flaw in the amendment.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 5, subsection (3), line 17, after "Agency" to insert "and the Minister, after issuing such guidelines, shall present them to the Oireachtas or the appropriate committee of the Oireachtas and provide 21 days during which time the guidelines could be amended or revoked by the Minister or by a motion in either House of the Oireachtas".Last week, when debating the National Tourism Development Authority Bill, I tabled a similar amendment. The Minister would be allowed to issue an instruction to the new authority but it would be discussed by the appropriate committee of the Oireachtas before any final decision is made. Openness and transparency were mentioned earlier. In this age of transparency it would fitting for the Minister of State to accept the spirit of the amendment because there is merit in allowing the Houses to discuss and see directions the Minister might give to the new agency.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	295	It is important that when we establish new legislation and give significant powers to the Minister to set out orders or guidelines there is some parliamentary accountability on the issuing of those guidelines. The Minister of State had a distinguished career in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and was responsible for many initiatives. It is important for all sides that there is some scrutiny of guidelines and orders set out by the Minister of the day, whoever that may be. This is a sensible amendment enabling discussion to take place at the relevant committee. There are significant guidelines to be issued by the Minister when this Bill becomes law. The idea that there can be no debate once he or she issues those guidelines is nonsensical from a parliamentary perspective.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	296	This agency will be responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts and there will be plenty of options to scrutinise its management, operations and successes. Senators have raised the matter of the guidelines on State authorities seeking advice from the NDFA. The legislation provides that the Minister for Finance would issue guidance on the circumstances on which National Development Finance Agency advice should be sought, taking account of the type of project or programme of projects, the stage of development of a project and any other relevant factors.The reason this guidance has not been prepared and published in advance is straightforward. Full guidance could not be provided in a vacuum. The guidance would be very detailed and specific, dealing with cases as they arise. It would be drafted with input from a cross-departmental team which would include a representative of the Office of the Attorney General in an advisory capacity and, before the guidelines are finally created, the NDFA will be consulted and involved.With regard to the amendment, it is our intention that these guidelines would be widely available. They will issue to Departments and State agencies and authorities, and will be on the public private partnership and Department of Finance websites, fully available to everybody for scrutiny and public information. For that reason, we have no difficulty in submitting the requisite number of copies of the final version of the guidelines to the Oireachtas Library for Members of Dáil and Seanad Éireann to peruse and raise in whatever manner they see fit. However, under section 3(3), the responsibility for issuing guidelines and instructions to the agency rests with the Minister.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	297	That is correct.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	298	It is therefore a matter for the Minister to revoke such guidelines and instructions. The legislation is clear in what it proposes. Consequently, I regret I cannot accept the amendment but I assure the House that once the guidelines are available they will be available to everybody.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	299	If the guidelines are to be freely available to all Members in the library or elsewhere, it is not much of a leap to have those guidelines discussed in the Houses. That is the purpose of the amendment and the Minister of State should consider it.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I support Senator Phelan and agree it would not be much of a leap. When public private partnerships are in place, whether for water, sewerage of otherwise, the contracts will be for 20 to 25 years. Local accountability will be taken away. Heretofore, local authorities had annual estimates where local councillors could ask the county manager for a report regarding water, sewerage or otherwise. When public private partnerships are put in place, a contract for 20 to 25 years with annual inflation will be built in. As a result, there will be no local accountability and no local authority member will be able to question the cost. The local authority will get a bill at the end of the year and be asked to pay up using whatever criteria was worked out for the payment.It is imperative there is openness and transparency with regard to the guidelines put forward. I support Senator Phelan as it would not be much of a leap to publish the guidelines and accept this amendment. When we go further down the public private partnership road, there will be problems. There will not be local accountability and, from what we are led to believe, there will no longer be the dual mandate with Oireachtas Members on local authorities. Deputies may always have the facility of a question to the Minister but he or she may not be able to say anything by way of reply because he or she may have no ministerial responsibility with regard to it. It is an important amendment and the Minister of State should accept it.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I am glad to hear the Minister of State say that the guidelines will be available because transparency is important. However, the amendment represents an encroachment on Government by the Legislature. Every ministerial act should not be immediately subject to debate and revocation. When Governments are elected, they must be allowed a certain discretion to act. Of course they must be accountable and the guidelines should be public, but I do not favour the amendment.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I listened with interest to what Senator Paddy Burke said about accountability. I served for six years on a local authority and became chairman on my second year there. The situation pertaining to local accountability has not changed. My recollection is that a project is advertised and tendered, it is decided who is to get the tender, it goes to construction, is opened officially and there is never another word about it unless something goes wrong with the project. The only time there are questions is at the estimates stage and the same situation will prevail here. If money is delivered by a local authority for the payment of a public project which has been managed through the NDFA advice system for one of the State bodies, there is no reason why there would not be accountability and querying of a manager at estimates time as to why money is being paid, how much and why there are variants. In the same situation at national level within the Oireachtas, there is no reason Members cannot get answers to questions, whether through the Committee of Public Accounts—
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	303	Did the Minister of State ever try?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	304	It is not the case with parliamentary questions.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Parliamentary questions are not relevant in this case.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I would say they are not.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	307	There are Adjournment debates, special notice questions and motions; these instruments are readily available to get to the bottom of any situation. There are other people sitting in other houses across the city trying to dig deep and they are finding it hard to get answers. I am quite confident about this new system.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	308	We will give way on this if the Minister of State gives way on parliamentary questions.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	309	That is a matter for the Minister, the Attorney General and the Clerk of the Dáil.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	310	The Minister of State can sing that one.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I will not legislate or take powers for myself to say: "This will be the way, boys, and that is it." I will leave the system to evolve and ensure that sustainable legislative structures are put in that give—
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	312	That gives a whole new meaning to sustainability.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Absolutely. I am confident that we will have a good system in position and a good structure to give great public advice in the interests of the taxpayer.Senator Paddy Burke raised the matter of ongoing costs with regard to priorities. This relates to ownership of projects. It is important to note that while the proposed legislation provides that State authorities would be obliged to seek NDFA advice, they are not obliged to take it. The final decision on the structure and financing of a project remains a matter for the appropriate Minister or, where there is delegated sanction, the appropriate accounting officer or equivalent. The Minister or equivalent will be democratically accountable as always and there is no doubt about that. The same opportunity will be there for everybody to question on these matters.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 5, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following new subsection:"(4) The guidelines referred to in subsection (3) shall require in respect of each project where a public private partnership is anticipated that an assessment shall be published in advance of the following:(a) the principles underpinning the pricing policy to be pursued,(b) the provisions which will apply in the event that the project does not fulfil its revenue expectations for the private partner,(c) the method whereby the cost performance and physical progress of the project will be reported on a quarterly basis to the Oireachtas,(d) the cost benefit analysis and the analysis of the benefit of a public private partnership over an exclusive publicly funded alternative approach.”.This amendment reflects expressions made by Senators during the debate on Second Stage regarding the possibility of private companies withdrawing from public private partnerships or suffering financial difficulties and being unable to maintain their part of the partnership. If, for example, a hospital was built by a public private partnership and was subsequently unprofitable, which caused the private partner to withdraw, what would the Government do? This amendment is intended to take account of such a possibility.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I am concerned that this amendment might lead to precisely what Senators opposite have been complaining about in relation to a different section, namely, another layer of bureaucracy. To fulfil these requirements, cover all hypothetical situations, provide quarterly cost benefit analysis, etc., will require many hours of work.The purpose of the Bill is to enable us to proceed with projects. In many areas of policy one can be so busy monitoring, reviewing and watching every step taken that one adds to bureaucracy. I have reservations about this amendment on those grounds.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I have listened with interest to what both Senators have said. The purpose of the National Development Finance Agency is clearly set out in section 3(1). Its purpose is to advise and, in certain circumstances, provide finance on public investment projects. It will be a matter for Government Ministers or, where there is delegated sanction, the accounting officer or equivalent, to decide on the appropriate financing structure of projects. It is not the role of the NDFA to undertake PPP assessments of the type envisaged in this amendment. That is a matter for the relevant Minister, accounting officer or his or her equivalent to undertake in accordance with existing requirements and reporting arrangements and subject to the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.This goes back to points raised earlier about accountability and opportunity to question the success or otherwise of the agency itself, the various projects and the manner in which they are delivered. The Comptroller and Auditor General will have a key role in carrying out a critical analysis. He will report to the Committee of Public Accounts which will carry out any appraisal it deems necessary on any project or decision taken by the agency. This gives democratic and financial accountability to the affairs of the agency.I regret I will not be able to accept this amendment.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 8, subsection (2), line 45, after "members" to insert "one of whom shall have relevant experience in public policy development and the appropriate role of pricing in the delivery of public services".This amendment is self-explanatory. Section 12 states that the board of the agency shall consist of a chairperson and four ordinary members. I have mentioned in the House a number of times the issue of appointments to and qualifications for membership of boards of Government agencies or State-sponsored bodies. This amendment seeks to spell out the qualifications which at least one member of the board would have to satisfy to become a member of the authority.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	318	It would be fairly extraordinary to pick out one member of a board and give that person special functions. Given that this is such an important agency, I have no doubt that the people appointed will be highly qualified and will have a wide range of expertise. I do not see how one can choose one member to have relevant experience in public policy development and an appropriate role in pricing. Therefore, the amendment seems inappropriate.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I agree with Senator Mansergh's conclusion. We cannot be selective in saying one person has to have this, that or the other. If we were to go down that road we would have to be specific and say that each member must have certain expertise or some area of expertise. The proposed amendment is too restrictive in the demands it makes on the composition of the board. It would restrict the board, the Minister in his or her appointments, and the Government in its consideration of the board. The agency has a unique financial remit which will require specific expertise. The Minister for Finance, in his advice to Government for appointments to the board, will be mindful of the requirement for gender balance as provided for in section 10(11) and will endeavour to ensure that appropriate expertise is represented on the board of the National Development Finance Agency, drawing from as wide a pool of potential appointees as possible across the nation. The Government's record in making appointments to boards is clear. We appoint the best people from across the nation and have a strong commitment to gender balance.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I am confident we will do the same again. I would not like to restrict the composition of the board and it would be unwise to do so.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 13, subsection (4)(a), line 42, after “is” to insert “reasonably”.This section primarily states that information expressed by the board or the Minister is confidential. As it stands the Minister can define anything as confidential. This goes beyond what would be desirable in this situation. This amendment would provide that information that is reasonably expressed would be permitted.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	323	It is not necessary to include the word "reasonably" in subsection (4). The Minister and the National Development Finance Agency are obliged under law to act reasonably in the performance of all their functions. Reasonableness, fairness, equality, etc., have to prevail and we can be certain that will be the hallmark and track record of this agency. Consequently, I regret I cannot accept this amendment.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 14, before section 20, to insert the following new section:"20.–(1) It shall be an offence for any member of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or a member of staff of the Agency or the National Treasury Management Agency or a consultant adviser or other person engaged by the Agency to receive any improper payment from persons involved directly or indirectly with the promotion of a project or scheme under consideration by the Agency.(2) All persons acting on behalf of the Agency shall comply with requirements set out by the Public Offices Commission.".The amendment seeks to reinforce earlier sections of the Bill which outline how members of the authority may have to disclose their interests. It seeks to provide that the Public Offices Commission would set out the requirements for those acting on behalf of the board in the context of the public office obligations of all State bodies. I urge the Minister of State to consider the amendment in this era of openness and transparency. It is reasonable.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	325	This is not a piece of criminal law legislation. There are clear laws on corruption and on public ethics and it would be inappropriate to insert clauses which imply that but for this clause chief executives might well engage in the type of behaviour suggested. It is not particularly appropriate.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	326	This matter was raised on Committee Stage in the Dáil by Deputy Richard Bruton and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, informed him that he could accept it in principle, subject to consultation with the Attorney General. We have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that the concerns, which have been expressed in both the Dáil and Seanad, which are sought to be addressed in this amendment are adequately dealt with in the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1889 to 2001. The changes made in 2001 deal with the situation. Consequently, the amendment is not necessary because the corruption Acts already cover this area. Regretfully, I cannot accept the amendment.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 15, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following new paragraph:"(b) the policies adopted by the Agency in implementing its functions,”.The amendment is self-explanatory. It seeks to expand the role of the Committee of Public Accounts in dealing with the authority and the chief executive officer of the authority, whereby the committee can question the policies adopted by the agency and how those policies are implemented. It is not beyond the bounds of comprehension that the Minister of State would seek to take the contents and the spirit of the amendment on board.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	328	It is not a matter for the board of the National Development Finance Agency to report to a committee of the Oireachtas on a project or projects which it funds. It will be a matter, as in the normal course, of democratic life for the relevant Minister, accounting officer, or the equivalent in a Department or agency or authority to report to the Government and Oireachtas in the normal manner in keeping with existing democratic accountability arrangements. It would be unwise if we were to change the structure which has served the country so well for so long.There is a clearly defined structure in existence. The Minister is accountable to Parliament. The various accounting officers who are the secretaries general of the various Departments or the directors general of the various State agencies are responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts and to the senior Departments also. Given that situation it would be unwise to have a different structure in this case. The Minister for Finance considers that the requirement in section 18(6) for the chairman and chief executive of the National Development Finance Agency to give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts whenever so required, provides for sufficient accountability by the agency in the performance of its functions. In other words, the chairman of the board, the chief executive of the agency – one responsible for the board, the other responsible for the staff – would be the two people who would be responsible to give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts whenever they are required to do so. On that basis, we are satisfied that that democratic accountability in a public forum on behalf of the taxpayers, through parliamentary committee, is the proper way to proceed. Consequently, I regret I cannot accept this amendment.

In page 15, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsection:"(7) The Chief Executive Officer and the Chairperson shall whenever required by a committee of the Oireachtas give evidence to that committee on any projects with which it is involved that fall within the terms of reference of the said committee.".This amendment seeks to broaden the scope of the Oireachtas committee to question the chief executive officer and the chairperson of the agency. I would not envisage that this amendment, if accepted, would be used often but it would be important that the facility would exist. Obviously, the requests would have to be reasonable. There would be instances where the advice of the agency to the committee would be deemed appropriate. I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment which would provide for that facility.

#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I thank the Chair for taking this matter about school buildings in County Galway on the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, for coming to the House.I am concerned about the 400 building projects on the Department's programme, particularly the 40 in County Galway which are at architectural planning stage. Five of these projects are in Galway city and 35 are in the county. Galway and Dublin are the two counties with the highest numbers of schools at this stage of planning. I know the Minister intends to publish the expenditure proposals for school building in January. I urge him to advise schools of their position at this point.There is a real need to provide funding for primary schools and I hope the Department's priority will be to invest in primary education. It is the sector most in need of funding at present. I raised the issue of getting low cost buildings when the Minister of State was last in the Seanad. The question of professional fees has arisen and even with prefabricated buildings there is a need for architects, engineers and planning. I do not believe we need to spend so much on professional fees.While there are 35 school projects in Galway county at the architectural planning stage, there are also a number of schools which need assistance urgently. Four schools in north Galway, two of which are in adjoining parishes, have applied for new buildings. Cahergal near Tuam has applied for a new school and in the same parish Bearna Dearg national school is on the list for improvements. In the adjoining parish Newtown girls' national school and Brierfield national school need assistance and I hope progress will be made on them next year.I remind the Minister of State of the urgency of investing in primary education. The Department has invested in remedial teachers, resource teachers, classroom assistants and the psychological service, but it has fallen down badly in terms of providing new buildings. I hope the Department will be able to provide information in the new year regarding its plans to spend money on primary education.

However, I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for mentioning it.I thank Senator Kitt for raising this matter. It gives me the opportunity of outlining to the House the achievements of the Government in addressing the accommodation needs of primary schools. I assure Senators that the programme of capital investment in the primary sector will continue and that the allocation of €147 million for 2003 will enable the Minister for Education and Science to consolidate the considerable progress that has been made in recent years. Admittedly, in view of current economic realities and the tightening of the financial position, the rate of progress in 2003 will be somewhat slower than he would have liked.As a result of past under-investment over the course of decades, many schools are in a poor state of repair and require substantial funding for upgrading to meet modern requirements. It will not be possible to improve the accommodation situation in all schools overnight and deal with emerging needs at the same time.Capital expenditure on primary buildings in 2002 will be €172.6 million. As a result of the Government's commitment to funding educational infrastructure, in excess of 120 major capital projects in the primary sector have recently been completed or are currently under construction. Many of these projects will continue in construction into 2003. The 400 major primary school projects in architectural planning that are listed on the Department's website were not included in the 2002 construction programme. Because they are major projects, they have to go through a detailed process of architectural planning which will take a considerable period to complete.The starting date for construction of any major school building project depends on factors such as the size of the project, the complexity of the architectural planning, land acquisition where necessary, sorting out title, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors. It is the Department's intention to release the projects in architectural planning to construction on a phased basis over a number of years.The Minister for Education and Science will look closely at the potential for using PPP mechanisms and the concept advanced in An Agreed Programme for Government of a multi-annual programme schools modernisation fund to be financed through the National Development Finance Agency. For the information of the House and, in particular, Senator Kitt, the Minister intends to publish his expenditure proposals for primary school buildings in the new year. The Department's website will be updated at regular intervals from that point on.As Senators will recall, there was a comprehensive debate in the Seanad some days ago in relation to primary school infrastructure. In his contribution to that debate, Senator Kitt made a number of very succinct and practical points. Naturally, he mentioned his own constituency of Galway East on that occasion. In his contribution tonight, he again outlined a number of projects which need to be addressed in that area. He can rest assured that publication of the expenditure proposals for primary schools will help to clarify the position on a number of questions he would, no doubt, wish to ask in that regard. In the recent debate to which I referred, the Senator also mentioned his proposals as to how best we might provide buildings in the most practical and cost-effective way for primary school students. I have passed on those proposals to the Minister for Education and Science for his consideration.I thank Senator Kitt for raising this matter. He has again highlighted the needs of primary schools in Galway and I acknowledge his continuing hard work in that regard. I hope the position will be clarified further in the new year.The Seanad adjourned at 10.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18 December 2002.
