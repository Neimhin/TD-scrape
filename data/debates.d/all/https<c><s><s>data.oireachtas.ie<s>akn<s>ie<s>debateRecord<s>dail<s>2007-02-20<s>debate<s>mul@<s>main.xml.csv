#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Government introduced a number of changes to the Freedom of Information Act 1997.  Departments other than the Department of the Taoiseach have made it difficult for people to get information and, in a number of cases, the Information Commissioner has overturned the rulings of those Departments.Is the Taoiseach satisfied that every request made to the official in his Department responsible for freedom of information is processed in an open and flúirseach manner?  While the Department clearly would not want to share sensitive information about national security, is every request treated as openly as possible?Why does it remain the case when a freedom of information request is allowed on appeal that the person making the application has to pay?  It seems somewhat harsh that a person has to pay if he or she is first turned down under the Freedom of Information Act but then receives the requested information on appeal.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I have a third question.  The Ceann Comhairle upset me with a shot from the left wing.When is it proposed to extend the list of agencies and organisations that are subject to the Freedom of Information Acts?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	4	As for the first question, my Department has a centralised system whereby, in the first instance, all freedom of information requests go to a designated official before being sent to the designated officers in various sections.  It forms part of their ongoing work and no one is assigned specifically to such duties.  While there is a statutorily designated officer in each section, it forms part of his or her duties with a range of other matters.Last year, only three out of the 54 requests received by my Department were refused.  I understand that all the others were either fully or partially granted.  Two were withdrawn and three had no records.  I am satisfied that such requests are dealt with fairly quickly.Section 20 certificates provide for a mandatory exemption for records in respect of which the Secretary General of a Department certifies they are part of an ongoing departmental deliberative process.  As far as I am aware, no such certificates have issued from my Department and I understand that one was issued by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Hence, this feature has not been used widely.  Moreover, only a few refusals pertaining to security matters have been made.  The issues were genuine and included issues pertaining to the Special Criminal Court.The fees structure is a matter for the Minister for Finance in the first instance.  However, the current system was introduced following a review that considered all the options.  A fee of €15 is very modest, particularly when compared to the estimated average cost of the time involved at €425.  This figure would be greater now because it has not been updated to take account of increased salary rates during the four-year period.It is also important to point out there is no charge for the time involved in making a decision on a freedom of information request although most other jurisdictions have such a charge in addition to the application fee.  Moreover, there is no charge for access to personal information.  While a significant decline took place in such requests to my Department after the changes in 2004, the subsequent figures have increased by 30% and I understand this upward trend continues.Regarding appeals, it costs €75 for an internal appeal and €150 for an appeal to the Information Commissioner.  Significant reductions apply in respect of medical card holders — €25 and €50, respectively — and appeals concerning personal information are entirely exempt from such fees.  An appeal to the Information Commissioner is a quasi-judicial process that may require many months of work to complete and can entail a considerable amount of work for officials.  The view is that this fee constitutes a fair reflection of the nature of the appeal process and of the costs and time involved.It is also important to note that a person who appeals to the commissioner will receive a preliminary decision, which is a fairly good indication of the likely final decision.  Even at that late stage in the process, the requestor can withdraw the appeal and obtain a full refund of the fees.  This system is understood by such appellants because approximately one third of the appeals are now withdrawn at that point.  People are entitled to use the system so they withdraw at this point and secure a refund of their fees.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	6	While that is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, last summer an additional 130 bodies and groups were brought within its scope.  Almost all of the bodies under the aegis of my Department, with the exception of the Law Reform Commission which is still under review, were brought within its scope.  Each Department must examine it.  To the best of my knowledge, there are no plans to extend the Act to the Garda Síochána but I think the position is due for review this year.  I do not know whether any change will be made but it is due to be looked at again this year.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Has the time been reached when the Government, consistent with requirements for security, ought to apply the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act to the Garda Síochána?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the extent to which legislative provisions are inserted in legislation to circumvent the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Taoiseach on his Department.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	13	It is not the case in my Department.  We have extended the number of bodies which come within the remit of the Freedom of Information Act and I have only one left, namely, the Law Reform Commission which, as I mentioned, is being examined.  Other areas are also being examined this year.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	14	As the Taoiseach stated, the Law Reform Commission comes within his Department's remit.  There is a relationship also with the Garda Síochána.  There is reason to ask the question.  I support including the Garda Síochána within the remit of the Freedom of Information Act.  On the last occasion this issue arose the Taoiseach also stated he was considering extending the Act to the Law Reform Commission.  No decision has yet been made.  Will he give an indication of the timeframe within which he will make a decision?  It seems pointless for us to keep asking the same question and for him to keep giving the same answer.  We are going around in circles and wasting valuable time in the process.  Will he give an answer as to when we will know the answer to the question on the Law Reform Commission?Since we last asked this question, the Department of Finance issued a directive on the implementation of freedom of information requests to do with fees and the number of topics which can be covered by one fee, which it is hoped will make the position easier.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate on whether his Department will implement this directive?  Has it been implemented?  Will he make recommendations to the Department of Finance as to what improvements could be made to ensure greater transparency, given the complaints from the Information Commissioner that following the introduction of fees, there was a considerable fall-off in the numbers of requests made.  The number of journalists' requests fell from 3,000 in 2001 to 1,000 in 2005.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The question refers specifically to the Taoiseach's office.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Indeed.  Will the Taoiseach provide us with information on implementing the directive from the Department of Finance?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	17	There is no connection between the Law Reform Commission and the Garda Síochána but as I stated, both bodies, with others, are up for review this year.  The Law Reform Commission, while under the aegis of my Department, has a certain independence.  I understand discussions are ongoing between my officials and the commission.  It is a matter for them to resolve.  I do not have any difficulty with it, as I stated previously.Regarding the issue of procedures, as I understand it, all of the improvements suggested by the Department of Finance have been made in my Department.  In the case of the Department of the Taoiseach, the functions of general examination and primary decision making have been delegated by order, as envisaged in the Act, generally to assistant principal officer grade.  A few higher executive officers are in specialist areas and the function of internal review has been delegated to officials of not below principal grade.  That fulfils the criteria set.  The number of staff allocated to deal with FOI requests in addition to normal duties is 18.  These are key decision makers across divisions, mainly at assistant principal level.One higher executive officer, the freedom of information liaison officer I mentioned earlier, is responsible for receiving and monitoring requests and general co-ordination of the requirements under the Act as they relate to this Department.  That keeps a flow going and the system together.Two assistant secretaries and four principal officers are responsible for the internal review process.  The various stages laid down by the Act, and the criteria set out by the Department of Finance, leave the primary decision with assistant principals in the Department, internal review with principal officers or higher and a review by the Information Commissioner.  If there was an appeal it would go to the High Court.As I said to Deputy Kenny, having stabilised and declined in 2003 when changes were made to the Act, requests made through the Act are up approximately 30% in my Department.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Would the Taoiseach agree that requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act are adversely affected by Departments bringing in Bills that effectively change the Act?  That is regularly done without reference or consultation with the Information Commissioner.  Has the Taoiseach acted on this recently as the Information Commissioner addressed the matter in her 2005 report?  In the case of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, for example——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	19	That is a matter for another Minister.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I complied with the Information Commissioner's stipulations and the Department of Finance guidelines.  I have not done anything to restrict other issues, which have been covered in legislation.  To the best of my knowledge I have not heard of any difficulties with any of them.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive, together.The total cost incurred by the communications unit in 2006 was €367,740.  The total cost of the unit since June 2002 was €1,453,064, with €612,468 being a direct cost to my Department and €168,119 on average being borne by the five other Departments which have staff seconded to the unit.  The total projected cost of the unit for 2007 is €388,780, with €173,637 being a direct cost to my Department and an average €43,029 being borne by the five other Departments which have staff seconded to the unit.The communications unit will continue to operate in the period between the dissolution of the current Dáil and the holding of the general election, as it did following the dissolution of the 28th Dáil.  The unit operates on a strictly non-political basis and deals only with the Government press office and press offices in the various Departments.  It has no contact with Deputies or the Fianna Fáil press office.  The staff of the unit are subject to the usual conventions which apply to civil servants regarding political impartiality at all times.  I am satisfied the personnel will continue to observe these conventions in the performance of their work.The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments.  It furnishes news updates and transcripts which ensure Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments.  In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public.The communications unit works an 18-hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts.  The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments.  The work of the unit means that Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies and ensures they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	25	We are back to this round of questions again.  The Taoiseach invited Deputy Rabbitte and myself to look at this unit and meet the people there but we did not take him up on that yet.The Taoiseach stated the total cost of the unit since June 2002 has been approximately €1.453 million.  Did the Taoiseach state it would close on the dissolution of this Dáil?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	26	No.  He said the opposite.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The opposite.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	28	From whichever perspective one examines the matter, there seems to be an assumption that the communications unit operates for the Government's advantage.  The Taoiseach has stated it is a cost-saving exercise because Departments do not need to go to other companies to be supplied with newspaper clippings, but I read a report recently on how the unit was stretched to the limit when the media wrote about him a number of months ago.To be fair to everyone, will the Government close down the system under which public servants are seconded from other offices from now or St. Patrick's Day until after the general election?  This would remove the threat to the Government of comments to the effect that it has an organisation working flat out to collect vital information on what someone in County Wexford said about the Minister for Health and Children——
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	29	They would need to work 24 hours a day for me alone.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	30	——or that the unit could be used to bolster the Government's crumbling defences.  The public assumes that it pays taxes for a communications unit for the sole advantage of Ministers who are also Deputies.  Will the Taoiseach close down the unit, tell its workers to go back to their constituencies and Departments and ensure a level playing pitch for everyone?  At least two Ministers and Ministers of State have told me that, with the greatest respect to members of the media, they do not read the Sunday newspapers or many other newspapers because they do not want to be depressed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	31	For the same reasons, I hope the Deputy does not read the newspapers.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Not for years.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Right.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	34	We have been over this ground.  A small group of civil servants replaced a service that used to be bought in.  They do their jobs in a non-political way.  In so far as I have seen in the past decade, no matter what issue or person is in the news, they operate on the same basis.  The one sure thing is that there is news for them to report everyday, whether big, small or indifferent.There will be no change in the role of the communications unit during the election period.  What is likely to change is the increasing references to the forthcoming election across the range of news bulletin programmes monitored by the unit.  In keeping with its role, it will not monitor media coverage of a political nature.  It does not put a political slant on reports.  Its workers do what civil servants do best, namely, they do not include details or such content in the daily reports.  They do not report on what is contained in individual parties' political documents.  They cover the main news items of the day.While the people concerned will not be around in the campaign, the Civil Service structure, the sections and units that receive information everyday, will be in place, as will the units which follow up on matters across the Civil Service.  That is the function of the communications unit.  It does not have a political function.  Its news reports go to Ministers and press officers and officials in Departments.  There is a range of people who receive the reports.The unit is entirely apolitical and reflects what one would hear if one turned on the news.  If one looks for transcripts or tapes, it will produce them.  By and large, the unit monitors the national media and the main stations in Dublin, but it does not monitor local newspapers or data.  It does not do the contract work done by outside agencies such as supplying press cuttings from newspapers.  Its civil servants move around and staff are seconded from Departments.  The same individuals are not there on an ongoing basis.  The posts are not senior, data for which I have provided for the House previously.  Theirs is not a politically advantageous role for the Government.  If there was a change in Government in any form, the same individuals would continue in their posts, as civil servants do in any other section of the Civil Service.   There is no difference.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Perhaps the Taoiseach will put our minds at ease by making available a copy of the report he or the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, received yesterday so that Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Sargent, Deputy Morgan — who is filling in for Deputy Ó Caoláin — and I are aware of what we are up against.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	36	By the way, I do not think I ever got a report from this group.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	37	The Minister never looked for it.  That is why she is so out of touch.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I just get clippings from the newspapers from the press office on what the Deputy says every day.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	39	It is of no great significance.  I am sure Deputy Kenny's report would be far more sophisticated.  I do not want to say anything further in this regard.  These people do their job, but in a non-political manner.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The Taoiseach needs to clarify the real role of the communications unit.  He is at pains to say that it is totally apolitical, having us believe that it could not distinguish, for example, last autumn between Percy French's Paddy Reilly from Ballyjamesduff and Paddy Reilly from Ballybough, his own Paddy the Plasterer.  How realistic is that and how does he distinguish between a function whereby they can be the Taoiseach's personal eavesdroppers as opposed to providing objective reports to Government Departments?  I ask him to illustrate the answer with an example.  I can see how, for example, departmental issues in education, health or the environment could be monitored as the subjects of debates and so on, with perhaps synopses presented.  However, last autumn, what exactly was the role of the communications unit during the controversy over payments in the 1990s to the then Minister for Finance — now the Taoiseach — from business friends?  Was the Taoiseach given a rundown by the communications unit on what was a very political issue, but which did not involve Departments, of the speeches and statements made?  Did he receive regular briefings on the issue along with political reaction to what was happening?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	41	As regards the issues last year and whether I was given paper cuttings, rundowns, etc, on what was involved, the answer is "No".Regarding the Deputy's first question on what they do, there are press officers in all Departments across the Civil Service at various levels and in different units.  They naturally have an interest as regards what is going on.  The unit deals with press officers from the various  Departments on an hourly or two-hourly basis.  The unit has no dealings with backbenchers or any other Deputies and its staff are subject to all the conventions of the Civil Service.  It factually lists headlines from the news media and goes through the newspapers to get an indication of what is topical.  Press officers will pick up on such data.  If, for example, there is a story on page 16 of one of the national newspapers, the press officers will follow this up.  It is a matter of communicating issues to them early and throughout the day which they will follow up.  That is all the unit is doing.If it is asked to get transcripts or the details of an interview on the radio, it can do this and it is not a cost to the Department concerned.  Previously, almost all Departments used half a dozen companies separately, which meant two or three might get the same tapes and scripts.  It was a very costly operation.  The carrying out of this work by these six relatively junior people saves a great deal of money.  My colleagues have given me a note of what was on the last list issued.  It includes five items, the hospital consultants talks, the Wellington Quay trial involving the bus driver, a new school teachers' report, the PSNI training college and the Iranian nuclear controversy.  Such lists are sent to the Departments and they then have something with which to deal if they have an interest in it.  That is what is done.  The same applies to the newspapers.  In the normal course of a day officials in the press offices of Departments do not listen to the media as they are involved in other jobs and events.   This is a facility for them to be aware and to communicate with their sections or their people or to submit responses.  It is no more than that.  It is a good service.  If we were to compare the costs of the work of these officials as against the costs involved in 1997 — I keep referring to such costs — these six civil servants who cover an 18 hour day well more than pay for themselves.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Do red lights start flashing in the Department when the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform goes out on the plinth?

That seems to be political.  It describes the detail the Taoiseach got, the names of the journalists and all that kind of information.  Leaving that behind us and putting this into a general election context, that seems to be very political.Discussions are taking place at another forum about a level playing pitch for the general election as between Members of this House who will contest again, people outside this House who will contest and so on.  It seems Members on this side of the House are at a considerable disadvantage in that the same rules do not apply to Ministers.  Ministers can proceed to do their normal business on the basis that it is different from their role as parliamentary representatives and representatives of their constituencies.  Is it not the case that this unit, at the cost of more than €30,000 for the duration of the election campaign, confers an advantage on office holders on the opposite side of the House that does not exist for the benefit of Members on this side of the House?

Whatever information I received, it would not be coming from the communications unit.  I have to get on with my job, rather than worrying about these things.Probably 99% of the work done in the unit is released to press officers in Departments, who are civil servants.  They are not political animals.  They deal with information relating to the Departments as that is their job.  They are not involved in the political process.  If Deputy Rabbitte was to suggest that we close departmental press offices and also withhold funding from political party press offices during the election, then an argument could be made.  However, that is more nonsense.  This unit does not play any political role.  Any general election candidate, whether a Minister or otherwise, would not use this information.We are not on the eve of a general election, so Deputy Rabbitte should not get excited about that.  Taking into account what he said last weekend and what the Minister, Deputy McDowell, said this weekend, I will obviously have to go elsewhere to cost those issues.  However, I would not get it from the communications unit.

Is it true the Taoiseach gave an invitation to Fine Gael and Labour Members only to visit the communications unit?  That is quite a political decision, given that the Technical Group does not seem to have been part of his invitation.  Can he explain his selectivity?Does the Taoiseach accept there is no such thing as news that does not have some editorial discretion?  Who has the editorial discretion in the news given to the Taoiseach?  Is there an equivalent to an editor-in-chief of the communications unit?  Can the Taoiseach tell us something about such a person?  Do Ministers ever ask the communications unit to keep an eye on any difficulties that might exist with the European Commission, such as coverage on Ireland's failure to comply with various bits of European legislation?  Who determines editorial policy of the communications unit?

The civil servants in my Department that are responsible for the unit will always provide an open invitation to the Green Party, Sinn Féin or to the other parties to look at their work.

Freedom of information requests for copies of the documents which are distributed are frequently made.  The documents do not attract much attention because there is nothing in them — they usually comprise paper cuttings which are months out of date.  All the information released by the officials under freedom of information could have been acquired by turning on the radio.

That work is done on a non-political basis.  Great references to political slants or spins are not made during election campaigns or at any other time.  The civil servants in question merely produce copies of newspaper headlines, or maybe some lines from editorials, to forewarn the officials in the various Departments, who can look at the text of the various sheets to see the issues they should be functioning on and dealing with quickly.  It is a quick way for the Government to communicate and deal with things properly.  The service exists to inform officials in line Departments of issues which need to be followed up — something incorrect may be in the public domain, for example.  It is entirely appropriate to use a small group of people to do that for the Civil Service.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	71	While I have to admit that a part of me almost sympathises with the efforts of the poor old Government to get an advantage as we approach the general election, there is a serious side to this matter.  Why is this job not being done by the departmental press officers who are responsible for communication between the line Ministers and the media etc?  Why is there a need for the duplication and huge costs which arise from the bundling together of this group of people?  I have not heard a proper explanation from the Taoiseach.  Can he outline, in good old-fashioned terms, the benefit to Ministers, taxpayers and the media of this huge cost?  Journalists usually contact Departments when they want information.  Departments are able to use simple modern technology to issue statements and communicate easily with the press.  I not understand the need for this infamous unit which, at long last, we have been invited to inspect.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The unit does not cover the provincial newspapers or the local radio stations, other than the Dublin stations.Deputy Morgan asked a fair question.  There are two advantages to the work of the unit.  The press offices in the Departments and a wide range of public and civil servants get information sheets outlining the main issues on the news early in the morning and again during the day.  The information sheets refer to issues which are relevant to individual Departments and may need to be followed up, as well as issues from newspapers which may need to be examined.  This information is not just sent to the press office.  I think there are several hundred civil servants on the list of people to whom it is sent.  Ministers and Ministers of State comprise 30 of the people on the list.  The people who receive the information are forewarned about various issues.  The information sheets give a good summary of matters of general interest throughout the newspapers.  They do not refer just to the headlines and the editorial comments, but other issues in the newspapers.  In each case, they just give the headline — they do not put a political slant on it or make a comment about it.Until the communications unit was established, a Department had to use an outside company when it wanted a tape of an interview or a feature.  The Departments had contracts with outside companies which were providing information of this nature, which was very costly.  At least four or five companies were feeding off the various Departments.  There was duplication of tapes and documents on many occasions.  It was decided a decade ago to establish a centralised unit, by seconding people from Departments on a rotational basis, to do a far more efficient job.  If one compares the cost now with the cost at the time when there were far fewer radios, I would say they have probably saved their salaries by multiples.  It is a question of quick communications.  The radio is a means of knowing what is happening quickly.  However, hundreds of officials do not have their radios on all day and cannot be informed in the same way as somebody in a party press office.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	74	The roll-out of a national cervical screening programme is the most efficient population approach to preventing and controlling cervical cancer.  It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model.  For that purpose, on 1 January this year, I established a national cancer screening service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish cervical screening programme.  The total allocation to the new service is €33 million, a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the services.  It includes additional revenue funding of €5 million to commence roll-out of the cervical screening programme and €8 million to commence roll-out of BreastCheck. Significant preparatory work is well under way in respect of the roll-out of cervical screening, involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.In parallel with the roll-out of cervical screening and as is the case in other jurisdictions, we are examining the potential role of vaccination against human papilloma virus.  One vaccine, Gardasil, has been shown to be effective against four types of this virus, including two that cause 70% of cervical cancers.  However, there would remain at least 30% of women whose cervical cancer would not be prevented by the vaccine.  The national immunisation advisory committee has been asked to advise on its potential use.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The Minister has stated the vaccine, Gardasil, would protect approximately 70% of patients from cervical cancer and that the other 30% could be protected by a national cervical cancer screening programme.  When added together, those figures show that under the Government 100% of women are not being protected because a national screening programme in not in place and the vaccine, Gardasil, is not to be made available to women with medical cards.  A pilot scheme for cervical cancer screening has been in operation for six years but, on the other hand, the Minister is referring the vital question with regard to Gardasil to be considered by another committee.  This weekend there will be a big row about whether the anthem "God Save the Queen" should be sung in Croke Park but at least the Brits have had a cervical cancer screening programme in place for the past 40 years, while we are talking about something that the Minister is considering doing or is referring to a committee to be discussed.  It is becoming a national joke that we have not yet sorted out a national cervical cancer screening programme.  A pilot scheme is ridiculous in a sense.Patients are waiting significant lengths of time.  Current expenditure on a screening programme that is not working is approximately €10 million to €12 million.  For the same sum of money we could have a proper programme.  The Minister should show a clear commitment and move forward.  A national cervical cancer screening programme needs to be undertaken urgently.  The vaccine, Gardasil, could then be added to the programme for those women most at risk.  There has been screening for cervical cancer for 40 years and it can be organised logistically.  It amazes me that the Minister has failed to implement the programme.  I am also amazed at her replies.  In so far as cervical cancer screening is concerned, a total of 100% of Irish women are being let down by the Government because of its failure to take this issue seriously.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	76	It is true that there has been cervical cancer screening in other jurisdictions for some considerable time, including the United Kingdom and Canada, where it was introduced in the 1960s.  I acknowledge that we are way behind in many areas.  However, we have in place a co-ordinated programme for the roll-out of both BreastCheck and a cervical cancer screening programme on a sustainable basis.  The vaccine has not been rolled out in either the United Kingdom or Canada.  Everybody is examining the most effective way of rolling it out.  It would not be appropriate to simply provide for it on the medical card.  Any immunisation programme would have to be targeted at the whole population to be effective.  Some countries have decided what course they will take — I understand the Canadians are considering a programme aimed at nine year old children while others are considering beginning with 11 year old children.  We have asked the national expert group, which advises on immunisation programmes, first, whether we should do it and, second, how we should do it.  The most effective way to do it would be on a whole-population basis among the age group to be targeted, probably utilising the schools.To take as an example BreastCheck, a national screening programme, of the women contacted, 70% come forward for screening and 30% do not.  The most effective way to implement screening programmes is to seek the most appropriate way to reach the whole population.  If we decide to introduce a vaccine for nine, ten or 11 year old girls, we should do this through a school programme.The cervical screening programme will begin later this year and the screening group has been put in place.  In addition to a roll-out of the screening programme, we must also deal with cytology facilities, which, as the Deputy knows, are inadequate.  Due to these inadequacies, a number of smears had to be sent abroad recently so that results were expedited and not delayed.  The HSE is currently working with hospitals to improve cytology facilities so smear tests give accurate results.  As a general practitioner, the Deputy will know there have been hundreds of thousands of opportunistic smears.  The results have been questionable and in one case it was necessary to close down a screening clinic given the dubious results.Huge action is being taken.  As I said, later this year we will have both the screening programme and, I hope, a decision with regard to the vaccine.

Rather, no action is being taken.  The issue to which the Minister refers in regard to the workload of cytology clinics has been known for years.  Another point on screening is that non-attendance decreases dramatically on second and subsequent calls for attendance at any screening programme, whether it is BreastCheck or cervical screening.  The problem is there is no nationwide screening programme for anything.  The Minister has let everybody down with regard to screening.  That is the point we need to make.  The Minister is doing nothing.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Screening plays a major part, as it does with other cancers.  We are currently rolling out BreastCheck and in April it will be rolled out to the rest of the country.  Clearly, rolling it out on a population basis cannot be done overnight.  Particular issues arise with regard to lower socio-economic groups, which is why the issues of education and awareness, and the huge efforts being made in that regard, as well as the provision of mobile facilities to try to bring screening closer to the population, are so important.With regard to cervical screening specifically, a pilot project has been in operation in the mid-west for several years.  We have learned from that experience and this will inform the manner in which the new screening board, established on 1 January last, will later this year begin the roll-out of a national programme for 25 to 60 year olds.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The background to the planned industrial action by the Irish Nurses Organisation and Psychiatric Nurses Association is that they will not take part in the current benchmarking process which is reviewing the pay of public servants and is due to report in the second half of 2007.  The INO and PNA have so far declined to sign up to the new national partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  Both unions have lodged eight cost-increasing claims related to pay increases and a reduction in working hours.  The additional cost of these claims would be almost €1 billion per annum.  The unions are also seeking retrospection estimated to cost in excess of €500 million.In November of last year the Labour Court recommended that the pay claims be processed through benchmarking.  On the claim for reduced working hours, the court recommended that the parties should jointly explore the possibility of initiating an appropriate process aimed at achieving major reorganisation of working arrangements and practices within the health service generally.  While health service employers have accepted this recommendation, the unions have stated they neither accept nor reject the recommendation.Following the publication of the Labour Court recommendation on the union's claims, I wrote to both unions and arranged for exploratory discussions to be held between all the parties concerned on 19 January last.  While I understand the discussions provided clarity as to the respective positions of the parties, the meeting adjourned without agreement on the way forward.  It remains the Government's view that benchmarking is the appropriate mechanism to resolve the pay issues.  Management is readily available to enter into discussions on an appropriate process aimed at achieving major reorganisation of working arrangements and practices within the health service generally, within the context of the Labour Court recommendation and the prevailing national agreements.  I urge the leadership of the INO and PNA to give further consideration to the recommendation of the Labour Court and to make the case on behalf of their members, as other nursing unions have done, before the benchmarking body.The INO and PNA served three weeks notice of industrial action on 2 February.  This notice states that there will be a nationwide work to rule and series of work stoppages across health employments.  Health service employers have been endeavouring to agree contingency arrangements to ensure maintenance of essential services during the planned industrial action.  However, the INO and PNA have not stated the format, location and timing of the work stoppages.  The failure to provide this information is a very serious matter.  The HSE requires this information to ensure that services and patients are not put at risk.  I ask the leadership of the INO and PNA to urgently reconsider their position.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I thank the Minister for her reply, although it does not bring us very far.  The Minister will recognise the health service is still in crisis.  Only today we received notification from Beaumont Hospital that the much-vaunted accident and emergency strategy simply is not working.  At one point this morning there were 52 people waiting on trolleys and chairs in the accident and emergency department at the hospital, which is the highest figure ever.Does the Minister accept that, where nurses are working in these conditions, she needs to take note that the almost 100% response to the ballot carried out by the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Psychiatric Nurses Association was for industrial action, and that this is such an overwhelming vote her reply is an inadequate response?  Is the Minister stating this matter can only be progressed through the benchmarking process?  It seems a more imaginative approach is needed if we are not to see many difficulties being created in the health service by people who, as everybody recognises, do tremendous work, often in stressful conditions.  Nurses do not lightly take industrial action, yet in this case they have overwhelmingly decided to take industrial action.What is the precise approach the Minister is taking?  Is it only through benchmarking or is the Government considering alternative means that may lead to some resolution to this very serious situation?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	83	As the Deputy is aware, there is labour relations machinery in the State through which the eight claims in this matter were progressed.  The Labour Court recommended that nurses pursue certain matters through the benchmarking process, in particular the issue with regard to the approximately 1,000 nurses in the mental health area, where those reporting to them receive about €3,000 per annum more than the nurses.  The Government recently negotiated a national pay agreement with hundreds of thousands of trade unionists, who have accepted the agreement, which gives a 10% pay increase over the next 27 months.  Some nurses, including those represented by SIPTU, have accepted this agreement.  It is not just an issue with regard to nurses but one of public pay policy.The Deputy may be aware that, as I stated at the Joint Committee on Health and Children last week, major work practice changes are needed in the health system.  In particular, we need staff working more closely together as part of a team at primary care level.  We need longer working days from certain health care professionals, particularly those involved in diagnostics, so that patients can get the service they require, on a non-emergency basis, for longer and after 5 p.m.  In that regard, I have suggested — I am not the author of the suggestion, which comes from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions — it would be worthwhile to establish a process whereby we could bring various stakeholders in the health system together to find whether we could develop innovative solutions with regard to the work practice issues, such as the kind of model we devised in the 1980s with regard to the economy.  That is worthy of consideration.  I would like to think the INO and the PNA would consider pursuing, for example the issue of a 35-hour week, through that process.The health care system has substantial numbers of nurses working in it, 12.2 nurses per 1,000 patients, whereas in France the figure is 7.5 and 8.5 throughout the European Union.  With regard to the issue of a 35-hour week, as I have said to the nurses' organisation, if we can, with the same number of nurses, cover in 35 hours what is currently covered in 39, there will not be an issue.  However, if a reduction to a 35-hour week were to require the employment of 4,000 more nurses, there would be an issue.  What is required is an innovative process in which some of these matters can be explored, for example, different ways of working or a better skills mix.  We could develop many innovative processes for better working practices in the health system if we could establish a forum in which these issues could be pursued.  I hope a forum can be established in this case.  The issues relating to nurses can be explored in that context.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I think the Minister would acknowledge that the nurses have been very open to the idea of changes in practice with regard to health reform.  However, the problem relates to the lack of engagement by the Minister, the Department and the HSE.  The Minister talks about a forum and an innovative process, but when will that forum be established?  What will be its terms of reference and how speedily will the process begin?  If the Minister has faith in it, why is she talking about it in such broad terms when a head of steam which will have a major impact on the delivery of health services, particularly at acute hospital level, is building up?There seems to be almost lethargy about the way the Minister is talking.  It seems to be almost an abstract view that it might be a good idea to develop a new approach.  Is this the approach?  Has the Minister talked to the nurses about a timeframe, terms of reference, how it will be done etc?  Does she recognise that child care workers who are being paid more than nurses answer to nurses?  This imbalance is unique and I am not aware of anything similar happening in any other sector.  While such difficulties require an innovative approach, they also need a coherent and realistic approach.  Exactly what approach does the Minister suggest?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	85	We have a process for dealing with relative pay claims, the benchmarking process, and this is the approach suggested by the Labour Court with regard to the issue raised by the Deputy.  There are 1,000 nurses working in the mental health service in which those reporting to them are paid approximately €3,000 more than them.  The reason for this is that their work is extraordinarily difficult and it is very difficult to get people to work in the area.  I accept there is an issue when the person to whom these workers report is paid less than them.  The Labour Court recommended after adjudication that this should be considered in the context of benchmarking.  I understand the nurses organisations want any increase extended to every nurse, not just those working in that environment.The innovative approach I suggest will not work if all the stakeholders are not involved.  By all the stakeholders I mean those that represent the key professions that work in the health system, including radiographers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, junior hospital doctors and so on.  We cannot resolve in isolation the issues that affect nurses and the new working arrangements we want to see without it being done as part of an overall arrangement with other key professionals.I repeat: we have processes and want them to be used.  Public pay is determined in the context of the social partnership agreement, not in any other process.  Changes in work practices that could involve a shorter working week could be pursued through an innovative approach through a process or forum.  Others are exploring this option.  It is not a matter for me, as I do not represent the workers involved.  However, my door is open, as is that of the Government, to any process agreed by the various stakeholders to look at devising innovative work practices within the health system.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I take it that the Deputy is referring to a discussion document prepared by the joint department of medicine at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda and Louth County Hospital in advance of a meeting between the joint department and the National Hospitals Office.  I have seen a copy of the document and I am advised that it is the subject of ongoing discussions between the National Hospitals Office and the joint department.  It outlines an increase in volume and complexity of medical activity at both Drogheda and Dundalk hospitals and notes the concerns of the joint department for patients and staff arising from this increase in workload.  It includes an endorsement of the Teamwork report, Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards.  In line with the recommendations of the report, the HSE is developing a single medical clinical network for the whole of the north-east region, including County Louth.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I am afraid it involves much more than what is covered in the Minister's reply.  Is she aware the report states patients cannot access routine basic care requirements such as food, water and washing facilities?  Is she aware it further states patients get better despite the service, rather than as a result of the care they receive and that large numbers are managed in a site not fit for the purpose by persons not trained for the purpose?  It also states it is a testament to the staff that no fatalities have resulted to date with medical patients.  That is the import of the report.Is the Minister not ashamed of conditions in hospitals such as this?  Is she shamed by the content of the report?  What is she doing about it?  I have already asked what discussions she has had on the report.  She mentioned the Teamwork report.  Is she aware that under that report, it is proposed that medical facilities from Louth County Hospital be transferred to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, thereby compounding the problems there?  When the medical facility transfers to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, the accident and emergency unit will automatically follow.  Is the Minister aware the intensive care unit will also transfer, compounding the problems in the Drogheda hospital where outpatients spill into the accident and emergency area?  Accident and emergency patients have had to be housed in the maternity unit which is already at breaking point.  The facilities in Drogheda are getting worse.I would appreciate it if the Minister would address a serious issue I raised under Standing Order 31 last week.  It concerns the Minister's view on these matters and on whether she should remain in her position.  I raised the issue of her resignation and do so again today in a calm and measured manner.  As long as these conditions persist in our hospitals, the Minister should consider her position carefully.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	88	There is nothing new in the Deputy's call for my resignation, as he calls for it frequently on the radio station in the north east.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	89	This is only the second time.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I have visited both hospitals and seen at first hand the wonderful way in which the joint surgical department works.  Essentially, day surgery is performed in Dundalk and more complex surgery in Drogheda.  The system works well and the volume of surgical procedures in both hospitals has increased substantially as a result.  The new road network makes the joint working process more acceptable than perhaps it would have been in a different era when the distance to be travelled was greater.With regard to the report from the physicians of both hospitals, they suggest a similar process be put in place for medicine, that they should have a joint department of medicine — in effect, the two hospitals would work as one.  Currently we might have patients on trolleys in Drogheda, while there are vacant beds in Dundalk.  This makes no sense.  If we can get hospitals such as those in Dundalk and Drogheda to work closely together, it makes more sense from patients' point of view.As the Deputy is aware, there are significant deficiencies in the north east where we have five hospitals for a population of 350,000.  The hospital admission rate in the area is 5.9 per 1,000.  In the United Kingdom the rate is approximately 1.7 per 1,000.  Half of all surgical cases and 30% of medical cases from the area are referred to Dublin.  Therefore, there is a crying need for a state-of-the-art regional hospital and that will happen.  That welcome decision has been made and endorsed by the Government.  In the meantime, unlike other facilities and although we have made a decision to proceed with a new hospital, we must invest in the existing hospital infrastructure.  We need a new accident and emergency department in Drogheda.  This year over €6 million will be provided from the capital programme towards this year.  We need other investment in personnel and staff in the region in order to provide services between now and the time we will have the new hospital in place.It is not the case that nothing is happening.  Much is happening.  Above all else, we must take on board the reports commissioned and the advice of the training bodies on patient safety and accreditation.  Dr. Eilís McGovern has been appointed by the HSE to oversee implementation of medium-term changes in the north east.  The HSE and I have given an assurance that nothing will change until something better is put in its place.  That is what is currently under way, and I expect the support of the Deputy and everyone else.  Change is never easy, but patient safety must come first.  We must use resources in County Louth as effectively as possible for the benefit of all patients.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I would love if we adopted the principle that nothing should change until better facilities have been put in place.  However, the opposite experience has obtained and I ask the Minister to examine that position.  There should be a public inquiry into what is going on, such is the current state of crisis.  Half of the cases in Louth are coming to Dublin for major operations because there are no facilities in the north east for them.  I welcome the proposed regional hospital, but when one has hospitals in Monaghan, Louth and Navan closing and pouring their patients into an already overcrowded facility at Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda, there is not much chance.I will give a brief example.  The paediatric protocol was implemented in Louth on 10 April 2005, meaning that no children could be treated in the accident and emergency department of Louth County Hospital.  They too are now having to be admitted to it and then transferred to Our Lady of Lourdes, joining an already excessive queue for basic treatment.  Someone must examine what is going on because I have no doubt that in future, when there is some scrutiny of this carry-on, we will be told that the authorities did not realise the seriousness of the situation.  I put the Minister on notice that we are absolutely at crisis point and that it is unacceptable.  I call on the Government to act once and for all.  It is already too late, but it should nevertheless address the situation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	92	We are doing so, and for as long as I have been in the Oireachtas — 30 years this summer — hospitals in the north east have been a major political issue.  Every time that we were about to get around to doing something imaginative, it was suddenly reversed, one of the reasons behind current problems.  The consultant cardiothoracic surgeon appointed, Ms McGovern, is well respected nationally and internationally.  She is the appropriate person to oversee implementation of a programme of reform in the region, in particular ensuring that patient safety is foremost in the minds of everyone involved in the change process under way.  That is happening, as the Deputy knows.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I welcome the publication of the Competition Authority's report on competition in the health insurance market and the Health Insurance Authority's companion report published last Friday.The Competition Authority report makes 16 recommendations.  Several are of a very technical nature and require further consideration by the Department and the Health Insurance Authority.  Many of the recommendations that require action on my part will be included in the VHI Bill, which I hope to have published before Easter.  I fully accept the recommendations designed to increase consumer awareness and to make it easier for consumers to switch from one insurance provider to another.I have repeatedly restated the Government's commitment to maintaining community rating in the market and to promoting greater competition.  I also want to ensure that the regulatory framework does not place unnecessary obstacles in the way of companies seeking to enter the market.  For that reason, I have appointed a market review group to examine the rate of return to be earned in the market and associated issues as quickly as possible.  When I receive its report before the end of March, I expect to bring proposals to the Government based on its recommendations and those of the Competition Authority and the Health Insurance Authority.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Essentially, nothing will change until publication of another report at the end of March.It is important that we ask those who pay private health insurance premia.  What will their situation be when the Minister receives the report at the end of March and they face the next general election?  VHI, without risk equalisation payments, will increase its premia by between 5% and 10%.  The Minister's co-location plan to build private hospitals and move private beds out of public hospitals could add another 5% to 10% to premia.  Medical inflation adds between 10% and 15% to premia.  Does the Minister agree that VHI premia alone could mean increases of anywhere between 20% and 35% for its 1.5 million customers on top of normal market variations over the next five or six months?Does she further agree that if VHI has to increase its reserves to the levels held by other insurance providers that could add another 5% or 10% to premia?  I would like her to tell me this, since VHI is a semi-State organisation.  The CEO has increased premia by 12.5% in each of the past two years.  He has made public statements on some of the figures that I am using here to the effect that premia have risen as a result of Government policy and medical inflation.  Why has VHI not yet announced how much premia will increase by next year?  Has that been subject to political influence because of the approaching general election and because the Government has made such a mess of the private health insurance market that the customer and patients with private health insurance are to be hammered?The Minister was very unclear regarding the co-location plan and what the Competition Authority and her own group intend.  We cannot distinguish fact from rumour, for example, whether VHI is to be broken up.  The Minister has said nothing about whether serious plans exist to split the services that VHI provides.  The market is incredibly muddled and those getting the rawest deal are private patients.  What happened with BUPA was anticipated and has caused untold worry for its customers.  What is happening now will do the same for Quinn Direct and VHI private patients.  They will be hammered by the cost of premia, since the Government has lost direction and does not know what it is doing regarding the private health insurance market.  The Minister should explain to us her exact plans to keep premia down.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I find Deputy Twomey's intervention extraordinary because when BUPA announced that it was to pull out, he stated on the airwaves that the risk equalisation was far too severe.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	105	For the first time, I have secured a Government decision to put VHI on a commercial footing.  The tragedy is that it was not done in 1996, when we legislated for risk equalisation, since it is among the reasons that we do not have a level playing field.  VHI does not have to meet its competitors' solvency requirements, a major issue for the latter.  The Deputy knows that it is being pursued by the European Union.  The regulatory body requires 40% of premium income to be put aside as a reserve, while in the EU generally the figure is 23% or 25%.  Our requirements are far too severe and very conservative.The group that I recently established, led by Mr. Colm Barrington, is specifically tasked with taking on board what BUPA and Vivas have said, namely, that one cannot make a fair return on capital in the Irish market.  Its members have enormous experience of insurance and investment and will report by the end of March.In the meantime, there are real issues to address.  We have an exemption under Irish law whereby one can enter the market and provide health insurance for three years without making any risk equalisation payments.  That issue must be addressed, and I intend doing so, but there are also other questions.  For example, many people do not yet realise that one can switch from one insurance company to another without any penalty.  I still find that there is great ignorance among consumers in that regard.Among the suggestions in the two reports that I have mentioned is that renewal notices be issued up to a month in advance.  I believe that the period for car insurance is 15 days and that has had a major impact.  At least people then have a chance to shop around.  The HIA has recommended that up to a month's notice be given and renewal notices should probably include reference to the fact that one can switch insurers without any penalty.On the future of VHI, the Government has decided to commercialise the organisation and it is important that this is done as quickly as possible.  The Deputy acknowledged on a previous occasion that it could not happen overnight because of the solvency issues.  I have not spoken to VHI about price increases, nor would I interfere with its board or executives.  I therefore resent very much any suggestion that, because there is an upcoming election, the VHI has been asked to act inappropriately.  I would not stand over any Minister being involved in practices of this kind.  It would be totally dishonest and the board of the VHI would be reckless if it were to agree to such a request, if put to it.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Considering the board of the VHI made so many comments during 2006 on the impact of risk equalisation and competition, or the lack thereof, in the Irish private health insurance market, does the Minister not believe it should indicate its planned increases in premiums?  It is usually at this time of the year that we are told what they are to be.  Given that the board has been saying all along that risk equalisation, medical inflation, the collocation plan and a range of other factors, such as the reserves, have an impact on the cost of premiums, and that 2 million people will be affected next year, would it not be more appropriate for it to make comments on the increases?  Some aspects of this matter are outside the Minister's control but quite a few of the health insurance cost drivers are well within her control.  In some respects, she has contributed to the costs.  Might it not be prudent for the board of the VHI to indicate its planned increases?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	107	On the supply of private facilities or consultants, in most insurance markets companies like to see more suppliers of products and services because this drives innovation and drives down prices.  The health insurance industry in Ireland is unique, perhaps because there has mainly been one company, apart from the providers of the ESB and Garda medical schemes, offering insurance in the market since 1957.  The view was taken that the fewer the number of private hospitals, the better, but neither I nor patients accept this.  Deputy Twomey knows as well as I do that the huge shortages are such that many patients must wait some considerable time for access to a consultant.  The private system has not filled the gap, as it would do in other countries.We need 1,500 more consultants so everybody can gain access to one quickly.  If somebody tried to suggest to me that we should limit the stock of private hospitals to keep down the price of medical insurance, I would reply that it would also delay patients' treatment.  This is not a solution to any problem.Collocation has been proposed for a very good reason.  The beds involved are ring-fenced for private patients in public hospitals and are funded and staffed by the taxpayer.  Everybody should have access to these beds.  Equity of access is central to our new contract of employment for consultants.  Access to facilities funded by the taxpayer should be on the basis of equity and one group of patients should not be privileged over another.  This is why nine hospitals are so interested in collocation.Collocation provides an on-the-site response.  The taxpayer obtains money from the lease or sale of the land in question rather than having it used as a carpark.  The public system can procure, if it wishes, services from the private provider, or the private provider can procure services from the public provider.  Thus, both sides work in a co-ordinated way, as is the case at St. Vincent's Hospital.  This system is preferable to having one in which a plethora of small private hospitals emerge, which are not connected to the public hospital system.  If the two are connected, a better service is afforded to patients and we get better bang for our buck.Community rating and competition are fundamental to my policy and that of the Government.  If there is no competition, there can be no innovation or good value.  Rather, there would just be a monopoly supplier of services in the market.  Obviously there cannot be community rating without risk equalisation because, if one company has all the younger premium holders and another has all the older ones, they could not compete on a level playing field.I recently met a couple in their 60s who returned to Ireland after having lived in the United Kingdom.  They stated that, because of their health condition, their insurance in the United Kingdom cost £12,000.  Their health insurance in Ireland, involving one of the better plans, costs in the region of €2,200.  That shows the difference.  There is no doubt that, without community rating, insurance cover in Ireland would be held by approximately 10% to 12% of the population and certainly not the 54% who hold it at present.  Community rating is central to Government policy.

These regulations were signed by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children on 14 January 2005.Class 1 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises.  In this case, a weekly charge of €120, or the weekly income of that person less €35, whichever is the lesser, can be levied.Class 2 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises.  In this case, a weekly charge of €90, or the weekly income of that person less €55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser, can be levied.These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person.  The HSE issued revised guidelines for the implementation of the charges in July 2006.  No further distinctions are made in terms of the classes of persons to which charges apply and I do not have plans to introduce any.The HSE has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of "undue hardship".  Under section 1(b) of the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, the HSE can examine a person’s overall financial circumstances in view of his or her reasonable expenditure regarding himself or herself or his or her dependants, if any.I welcome the recent decision by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, to grant the full disability allowance to all persons in institutional residential care who, prior to this decision, were not eligible for this allowance.  The net impact of granting the full disability allowance, in the context of long-stay charges, is that the individuals will continue to receive the same level of service as before but will have increased income which they will be able to retain for their personal use.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I heard many of the Minister of State's points during the reply to an Adjournment debate and am aware of the charge that is levied.  I was essentially seeking an evaluation of the impact of the charge on patients.  Having read the explanatory memorandum to the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, I note it focuses very much on old age pensioners.  Was it envisaged, when the legislation was being drawn up, that those with physical and intellectual disabilities would be subject to the charges?  What consideration was given to differentiating between those living in capital-assisted houses with a house parent and the others?  Those in the former category are not subject to the charges.  Many individuals living in residential institutions, who aspire to live in capital-assisted houses but have not had the opportunity, are doing the same sheltered work as those living in capital-assisted houses, yet there is a very significant difference in the income they are allowed to retain.Was the legal opinion proffered during the drafting of the Bill that one could not apply the charges to elderly people if they were not applied equally to everybody else in residential institutions?  The difficulty is that there is a class of persons whom nobody expected would have to pay a price for the introduction of the legislation.Much fundraising is done by parents and friends to keep residential institutions functioning and many of these people are elderly.  I have met pensioners who are making contributions from their pensions towards the cost of keeping their children in institutions.I call for an evaluation of the impact of the charges on people in institutions for whom small treats such as being able to choose their own clothes and shoes or going to the pictures are being put in jeopardy.  The charges are also impacting on family members with limited means who may wish to take their relatives out of institutions.  I do not think the charges are in the interest of patients.

The decision by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to pay the full disability allowance, which means that residents of institutions have more money to spend, should be welcomed by everybody.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	121	Given the amounts charged in administrative fees, the institutions are going to end up with more money but is there any benefit to the residents of institutions from these charges?  It seems they were simply seen as a soft target.  The Government is legally compliant in that it imposes a charge irrespective of whether a patient is elderly or has an intellectual or physical disability but many of the people to whom I refer are not in a position to fight back and their parents and families often do not fight because they do not want to upset the institutions.  This is a mean charge on a vulnerable group of people.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	122	The Health Service Executive has detailed operational guidelines in place for the assessment of medical card applications.  The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure every person entitled to a medical card or GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of his or her entitlement and that a consistent approach is taken to means testing nationally.  The guidelines include provisions dealing with how applicants' savings and investments are treated.  I have not issued any instruction to the HSE on this aspect of the assessment process.Since the beginning of 2005, the medical card assessment income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29%.  Other significant changes which I have introduced are that applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and that allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage or rent, child care and travel to work.  In June 2006, I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I thank the Minister for her reply.  However, the answer to the question remains unclear.  According to Comhairle, no rules are set out for assessing income from savings and practices vary among health service areas.  The Minister stated that rules are in place, so she might outline them.Does she accept that guidelines are extremely important?  For example, all social welfare recipients formerly qualified for medical cards but that is no longer the case.  A person aged 65 who just retired may have difficulties in getting a medical card.  These guidelines need to be crystal clear if such people are to be able to obtain medical cards.Will she comment on the dramatic decrease in the proportion of people on medical cards?  The proportion has fallen from 35% ten years ago to 29% now, despite the introduction of the over-70s scheme.  That decrease is having a serious effect in terms of preventing people from attending their family doctors.  In the Republic of Ireland, it is estimated that 18.9% of people do not visit their doctors when they should because of the costs involved, whereas the figure in Britain is 1.8%.

The first €20,000 in savings for a single person, or €40,000 for a couple, is disregarded, €1 is applied per €1,000 per week for the next €10,000 and €2 is applied in respect of the following €10,000.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I am unclear on the matter because I have been supplied with two different notes, one which states the guidelines have issued and another which states they are about to be issued.With regard to medical cards, some 1.3 million people hold doctor-only or full medical cards.  Incomes have increased by 60% in real terms over the period to which Deputy McManus refers.  The scenario was very different ten years ago, with 17% unemployment and 8% long-term unemployment.  We have substantially increased the income threshold and have moved it to disposable income.  In addition to the traditional medical card, a further 50% increase has been made in respect of the doctor-only card.However, notwithstanding the advertising and public awareness campaigns which have been conducted, I continue to meet people in my constituency clinic who are unaware they qualify for medical cards.  It is similar to the family income supplement in that I wish we could find another way of ensuring everyone who qualifies for the medical card is aware of his or her entitlement.  A continuing programme of assessment will be required in that respect, possibly including having general practitioners target some of their patients.I will investigate Deputy McManus's claims with regard to people on social welfare.  The intention is that people will not be excluded from the medical card scheme by virtue of annual budget increases to social welfare payments.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 125, 175, 191, 196, 199, 206, 367 and 368 together.While it is an unfortunate fact that health care associated infections are not preventable in all cases, I assure the House that every effort is made to minimise the incidence of such infections.  The Health Service Executive has appointed an assistant national director of health protection as the lead person nationally to address the issue of MRSA.  Since its establishment, the health protection group has concentrated on a number of key issues, including the development of a three-year action plan and overseeing its implementation, as well as putting a high quality governance structure in place.The Health Service Executive is also appointing a number of new infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists.  These staff will strengthen specialist support for infection control and facilitate the development of the national surveillance system.  Some posts have already been filled and the remainder are currently being recruited.  The Health Service Executive has also initiated a number of other actions, including a two-year national publicity campaign on health care associated infections and antibiotic resistance which will use the full range of media at national and local levels, the development of a national surveillance system, a national infection control education programme, information for patients and the public, a new hygiene assessment scheme, a GP education initiative on antibiotic prescribing and measures to tackle overcrowding.I have asked the Health Service Executive to set up a national helpline through which patients and their families can report incidents of poor infection control in our hospitals.  If, for example, patients are unhappy that a hospital staff member is not disinfecting his or her hands between patients, they or their family members can call the helpline if they feel they are not in a position to raise the matter directly with staff in the hospital.  This is not about blaming people, but about helping all of us, including patients, visitors and health care staff, to play our part in improving patient care.Although MRSA is not a notifiable disease, the health protection surveillance centre of the Health Service Executive collects data on it as part of the European antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.  The European surveillance system collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter.  The Irish data from the European surveillance system which are published on a quarterly basis by the Health Service Executive show there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 in 2003, 553 in 2004, 592 in 2005 and 435 up to the end of the third quarter of 2006.  It is difficult to identify the number of fatalities attributable to MRSA as many people also have significant co-morbidity factors.In 2006 Ireland participated in the Hospital Infection Society's prevalence survey of health care associated infection in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The survey which included 45 Irish acute adult hospitals, including eight private hospitals, provides accurate and comparable data for the prevalence of health care associated infections, including MRSA.  Preliminary results of the study are now available.  The overall prevalence of health care associated infection in the United Kingdom, excluding Scotland and Ireland, is 7.9%.  The figures for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are 8.2%, 6.3%, 5.5% and 4.9%, respectively.No figures are available for the number of staff diagnosed with MRSA.  Routine screening of staff is generally not recommended because staff colonisation with MRSA is rarely implicated in MRSA transmission.  Compliance with good practice, including the wearing of protective clothing and hand hygiene measures, should minimise the risk of cross-infection.A primary element of the fight against health care associated infections involves changing practices and procedures and the manner in which many health care staff go about their daily work.  Accordingly, it is unrealistic to try to isolate the overall cost of implementing such a strategy.  The reduction in the incidence of such infections will both improve patient care and generate savings in the cost of service delivery.  While accepting that many health care associated infections are not preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infection and treat them promptly when they occur.

I told the Minister at last Thursday's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that in the event of a pandemic of avian flu, there was a plan.  The plan starts with putting the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, in charge and consists of a book, approximately two inches thick, on what to do in the event of avian flu affecting the population.Ireland has an epidemic of MRSA.  Professor Drumm's comments in this respect are important because they lead on to the question.  When I asked him how many front-line staff in our hospitals had been swabbed for MRSA, he replied:We have not swabbed staff at large in the hospitals . . . If we swabbed everybody in the system for MRSA, how many staff would immediately be taken out of the system?The Minister has just stated it does not matter whether staff have MRSA.  At the same joint committee meeting Professor Drumm stated that simply shaking hands could spread MRSA.  While a plan for MRSA is desperately needed, is it true the HSE has only got as far as drawing up draft guidelines on how it will deal with MRSA in hospitals?  Professor Drumm has no idea of the number of staff affected.  Subsequently, he stated that when one did swab staff——

She should confirm these figures.  Professor Drumm stated: "It looks like up to 40% of isolates from staff in this country may be multiply resistant."  Is it true that of the staff being swabbed, 40% have MRSA or some variant thereof?  Is Professor Drumm wrong when he claims it can be spread by shaking hands?  The Minister has stated it is not spread by staff.There is serious concern in respect of MRSA in Ireland.  Members want to know who will be in charge and what is the plan.  There are no clear guidelines as to how the Minister will deal with this issue, apart from talking about public campaigns and raising issues in respect of prescribing.  While Members are aware that these are the key issues, they want to know whether the Government has a clear plan.  This is particularly true when one considers the enormous number in the community and who work in the health care services whom Professor Drumm is afraid to swab because of the possible consequences.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The Government has a plan.  I understand Fine Gael recently held a meeting that was addressed by my good friend, Dr. Maurice Nelligan, who told the audience that half of them had MRSA.  Deputy Twomey is a doctor and knows that one can swab people's hands and they may have it and one can swab their noses and they do not, or vice versa.The action plan is being led by Dr. Doorley, Dr. Kelleher and Dr. Hynes of the HSE's medical team, with others.  I met them two weeks ago to discuss the plan and I have mentioned some of its requirements such as the recruitment of specialist nurses and surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists.  It involves an education programme with general practitioners and the public because, as the Deputy is aware, the main reason for the increased incidence of MRSA is the over-prescription of antibiotics.  This has been shown worldwide and the countries that do best are those that have in place an active programme with general practitioners and patients.  It involves a helpline to assist patients to draw the attention of the authorities to matters about which they are unhappy, rather than expecting patients or their families to complain at local level, which the Government understands can often be difficult.The plan also involves the swabbing of staff.  Will we swab visitors?  A host of measures are involved and the statistics I cited regarding the comparison between Ireland and England, Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrate we are better.  I do not boast about this because an incidence of 4.9% is still not good enough.  I would prefer to see Ireland reach the levels that obtain in the Scandinavian countries or Holland in which the rates are substantially lower.  While that is the target we must set for ourselves, it will take us some time to reach it.There is a major programme of training under way within the HSE in respect of this issue.  I refer to the general practitioner programme and the recruitment of staff.  In addition, there is the entire issue of hygiene.  As the Deputy is aware, the standards of hygiene that apply when one visits a food production or pharmaceutical company are substantially higher than those in hospitals.  I visited a company recently in which one was obliged to cover one's hair, shoes and so on. We probably need to reconsider the standards that apply to those of us who visit hospitals, particularly those of us who visit seriously ill patients.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

Higgins — the urgent need for the provision of a new site for a school in Oranmore, County Galway; (7) Deputy Hayes — to ask the Minister if his Department can report on the transaction purchase and resale of a site commonly known as "the convent grounds", Cashel, County Tipperary, with a view to resolving current difficulties that have arisen in respect of same; (8) Deputy Catherine Murphy — the size of apartments being offered under the affordable housing scheme in some locations and the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to insist that local authorities achieve a better housing mix, as well as anticipating the issues that will arise with large numbers living in apartment complexes in the long term; (9) Deputy Connolly — to discuss the recent changes in the nursing homes subvention scheme; (10) Deputy Durkan — the reply to Question No. 219 of 13 December 2006; (11) Deputy Boyle — that the Minister for Transport make a statement to the House explaining the circumstances under which the Government has reneged on its promise that a newly independent Cork Airport Authority would begin its life debt free; further explaining how, by allocating Cork Airport Authority with a start-up debt of €100 million, Cork Airport can hope to achieve long-term viability;  (12) Deputy Ferris — the unemployment situation in Tralee; (13) Deputy Lowry — the urgent need to include a primary school in the school building programme and to proceed to construction; (14) Deputy Lynch — the serious implications for the future viability of Cork Airport of the Government decision to require the airport to meet debts of €100 million, despite having previously promised that the airport would be debt free; the need for the Government to review this decision and honour the commitment previously made; (15) Deputy Cowley — the need to improve the conditions and remuneration of nurses; and (16) Deputy Deenihan — the five year delay in the delivery of three buildings at the Institute of Technology, Tralee, County Kerry.The matters raised by Deputies Cregan, Michael D. Higgins, Lowry and Deenihan have been selected for discussion.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	138	This issue is somewhat like a recurring decimal.  Today the figures from the Irish Nurses Organisation show that 392 patients are on trolleys across the State.  This is not unique, as last week there were 383 on trolleys.  On Wednesday there were 378 on trolleys.  In October 2004 the Minister for Health and Children announced a ten point plan to deal with accident and emergency departments with great fanfare.  Seventeen months later, in March 2006, while still Tánaiste, she declared the crisis in accident and emergency units to be a national emergency.  Today, however, nearly 400 patients remain on trolleys across the State.It has come to the point where Beaumont Hospital has issued a statement asking people not to attend its accident and emergency unit except in emergencies, because of the extreme pressure on its services, as 52 patients wait for admission.  This is appalling.  The hospital now has more than 100 patients waiting for a bed to become available in a more appropriate post-acute setting.  It is advising people not to attend its accident and emergency services.We have had ten years of this from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  We have had overcrowding, the spread of infectious diseases, hundreds of patients on trolleys every month, the figures for which are massaged, while operations are cancelled every year.  Some 29,000 people are on waiting lists.  They have been failed by the Government.It is about time politicians in the Government parties, particularly Members, were exposed to what is happening because they are secreted away.  I will go to Beaumont Hospital at 6.30 p.m. today and invite the Taoiseach to come with me.  Let us get stuck in traffic if we must.  Let us go to the accident and emergency unit and meet the patients waiting on trolleys who must put up with the remnants of what was supposed to be a world-class health service.  I challenge the man of the people to come with another and examine this issue.

However, a small number of hospitals, particularly Beaumont Hospital, are having difficulties in the delivery of accident and emergency services.  There have been on average 19 patients per day awaiting admission at Beaumont Hospital during this month.  At 8 a.m. today 40 patients were on trolleys in the hospital awaiting admission, five of whom were waiting longer than 24 hours.  However, it is still a considerable improvement on last year; the plans have led to improvement.  However, it is outside the range of what the HSE is trying to achieve.  Out of 52 hospitals, I understand four are in that position.One of the main problems affecting Beaumont Hospital is the unacceptably high number of patients awaiting discharge to a more appropriate setting.  The HSE is working with the hospital to address the issues involved.  The hospital has taken a number of steps to alleviate the situation in its accident and emergency department, including opening a five-day ward over the weekend, which is helping.In fairness to the HSE, those working on the winter initiative and on delayed discharges, the figures are substantially down.  Beaumont Hospital has a significant number of beds, 138 in total, occupied by patients whose discharge has been delayed.  This effectively means they do not have a location.  They cannot go home.  Out of 550——

Thanks be to God we did not have bird flu.  There does seem to be a mild outbreak of influenza which is causing this problem.  The Taoiseach has not answered my question or accepted my challenge.  Last Friday a 90 year old man was admitted to the accident and emergency department at Mayo General Hospital having fallen in his house.  At 1.40 a.m. on Saturday his 81 year old wife was contacted by the hospital to state the patient was being sent home.  She has difficulty looking after herself, never mind looking after her husband.  This is not the world-class service we were promised.In a case from Galway, an 86 year old woman must wait two years for a seat which will allow her take a bath after she was placed on an emergency list by the Health Service Executive.  In a case from County Cork, an appointment was made for a person on 15 July 2008.  In heavy black print the letter states that if the person concerned is unable to attend, the outpatients' department should be notified on a number given in order that another patient may benefit.  This is what we are at.I repeat again that I will go to Beaumont Hospital this evening, which is not far from the Taoiseach's constituency.  People have been told not to attend the accident and emergency unit because services are completely overstrained.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to come with me to see what is happening on the ground there?  I will give him backing if he takes appropriate action to sort out these matters.

I see the figures every day because I get the chart from the Minister for Health and Children.  Of the 52 acute hospitals, about six have difficulties.  The others are managing very well and the HSE is actively assisting them.A range of areas around Beaumont Hospital operate the HSE d-doc system in north Dublin in centres in Swords, Hartstown, Ballymun, North Strand and Coolock.  This is helping dramatically.  Approximately 8,000 patients have been seen under the scheme.  The HSE rolled out 90 of the primary care teams last year, with 120 this year.A number of improvements have been made in the minor clinics, the rapid access clinics which were part of the plans of Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  They now open five days a week from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m.  Referrals are taken from hospitals, including hospitals in the north inner city and Beaumont Hospital.  The service will be extended to accept referrals from the other teaching hospitals and a wider network of general practitioners.  To date, the service has supported almost 200 patients and is targeted to provide a service for 2,000 per annum.  These measures are all hugely helpful.A home service for patients from the five participating Dublin hospitals, as well as James Connolly Memorial Hospital and GPs in the north city and county area is available from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m.  There are community intervention teams.  A whole range of points put in the action plan by the Minister for Health and Children are now operating very effectively.

The survey was carried out by the Irish Society for Quality and Safety in Healthcare with the RCSI and MORI Ireland.  Some 76% of patients were satisfied with their experience in accident and emergency departments and 86% of patients with a choice of service would choose the same accident and emergency department.A patient who reported he or she received less information, advice and pain relief than it was felt required were more likely to be dissatisfied with the service.  Some 50% of patients who needed to be seen by a doctor were seen within one hour of the initial assessment.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I wish to raise the 28th Amendment of the Constitution Bill, which I received this morning.  Other Deputies would have received it somewhat earlier.  What clarity can the Taoiseach provide on its processing from here?I understand there are seven propositions encompassed by the Bill.  There are actually eight but one is the simple transfer of a section from the existing article of the Constitution to the new proposed article.  Of the seven propositions, two are related to criminal law, with the other five related to issues of the upbringing or custody of children, welfare, care, guardianship, adoption etc.Does the Taoiseach accept that these are two easily distinguishable and separate issues?  One issue relates to criminal law and the protection of children from sexual predators and the other relates to the welfare of children.  One has been the subject of detailed examination by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  There is a consensus on the question of the zone of protection for children among all parties in the House.The other five proposals have not been the subject of any such discussion, although there is a necessity to tease out their implications.  They are complex and there has been no national debate, which would appear to be required.I remind the Taoiseach of the Whitaker review of the Constitution in 1996 when the question of a prohibition on two different questions of substantive different effect was discussed.  Consideration was given as to whether it was permissible or if there should be a prohibition on two such different questions being taken in a single vote.  The review of the Constitution concluded it could rely on the good sense of the Oireachtas to separate two such distinct issues.When my colleague, Deputy Howlin, was being briefed by the Minister of State with responsibility for children, it was also Deputy Brian Lenihan's view.  It was certainly his view in 2001 when he was chairman of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  As I understand, he has been stating he has an open mind on that issue.We have not had the opportunity to discuss this in the House.  The Labour Party agrees to proceeding as soon as possible with the absolute zone of protection for children and allowing adequate time for a national debate on the other five matters, which would make sense.  This could be done in conjunction with the general election, for example, or sooner if the Government so wishes.  We should take the issue and dispose of it as all parties in this House are agreed on the necessity to protect children in those circumstances and allow an opportunity to debate the other bundle of issues.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I have been fair, frank and open about this.  I would be very glad to hear the Deputy's conclusions.  He stated last week that if we published the legislation, he would examine it with legal and other advisers and give his view on it.The outline of the legislative proposals lists four areas of legislation which can be addressed under the particular amendment, with legislation relating to sexual offences.  A great deal of work has been done by the Joint Committee on Child Protection in this area and, in general, the Government accepts its recommendations.That explains our position on the two issues that remain outstanding before legislation can be finalised.  Yesterday we went through all the issues and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, went through all the points in great detail afterwards.  We listened to the Opposition's comments.Our view is that all these issues need to be dealt with.  The Deputy has stated that five of the issues are not contentious.  There are seven issues — the Deputy says eight — and six are not considered contentious.  Some people may think two are contentious, although we do not.  We believe we can engage on the matter and I would ask the Deputy to arrange for his spokespersons to enter into arrangements with us to consider the issues.We would rather have one question but we are not absolutely embedded in that position.  It is our preferred view and we believe it could be done.  It does not create a difficulty.  I have already given my view on timing.  It is possible to proceed as we have proposed and we have been advised to do so in this fashion.  There is no difficulty and we have cross-checked it with a large range of people, as have people in various organisations in the field.We will listen to views and I have stated that we want consensus before we can go forward.  I do not want to indicate that my position is the only one and that I will not listen to anyone.  I am not saying that.  Six of these issues do not create a difficulty and I cannot find anyone who would raise them as a problem.  If there is a wish for a discussion on the other two we will have it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	194	My point is not that six of the proposals are uncontentious and two are contentious.  Rather, my point is that they are distinctly different.  It is claimed that some relate to the rights of children, with the others concerning the protection of children.  The Joint Committee on Child Protection was referred to by the Taoiseach.I am not even asserting that two issues are contentious as I have not concluded so for myself.  These issues have not been debated.  There has been no national discussion on them.Given that the genesis the situation was last May and that the time that has passed is not the fault of this side of the House, does the Taoiseach see merit in proceeding with the two amendments on the zone of protection for children and the issue of soft information immediately or contemporaneously with the general election so that both can be put to the people as quickly as possible?I do not claim to speak for all parties in the House, but they are of a like mind, as demonstrated at the joint committee.  We could proceed on that basis and provide adequate time for all those who want to discuss complex and complicated issues relating to the family and the balance of rights between children and the family.  We should be more concerned about getting this right than doing it in a hurry.  Is there not merit in there being two separate questions?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The Taoiseach seems to be saying he is not wedded to a single question.  The Whitaker review considered the question of whether there should be a provision prohibiting the submission of a Bill containing a number of proposals for amendments with different substantive effects for decision by the people in a referendum by means of a single vote.  It concluded that while there should not be such a prohibition, one could rely on the common sense of the House to distinguish into separate questions where matters have different substantive effects.  That is manifestly the case in this instance and there is a strong argument for dividing the issues.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I have listened to the arguments and I will not get into an argument on this because I want to try to get agreement on it.  It did not start last summer.  Some of the other issues were raised in the Judge Catherine McGuinness report of 1993, moved onto the constitutional review of 1996 and into the debate on the Children Acts between 1996 and 2001.  Other issues formed part of the adoption review, which has gone on for a long time.  There are different issues concerned with trying to help the rights of parents and families.The wording, we believe, strikes a balance between the rights of children and the rights of parents and families by replacing Article 42.5, which contains, according to our advice and constitutional advice, limited protections for children, with a new dedicated children's article.  It contains a number of different, substantial and practical elements, all of which will protect the rights of children.  None will undermine the role of parents or the constitutional safeguards for the family.  We have been careful in all our discussions to try to define these.Many people who have examined this and been involved with it believe it is commendable to have such a balance.  As the Deputy knows, there is a broad view.  I accept that people need time to examine the wording and that they cannot do it the day following publication, but I ask the Deputy to examine the wording, take his advice and to come back to us.We believe we can do this in an integrated way.  I accept that some people have argued that, perhaps, there is an alternative to putting it into one question with this wording.  The people working for the Government on this came to the unanimous conclusion that this was the best way to do it, but I am not saying that there are no other views.  We are prepared to listen to those views and, as soon as the Deputy has had a chance to put those to us in discussion, we will be glad to listen.I would like to try to deal with these issues during the current Dáil or, if they have not been dealt with comprehensively and fully, to bring them as far as we can.  The House must reach an agreement on how best to do that.  This is our proposal and it is our view that we could take the Bill through, but if the Deputy wants to talk to us, as he obviously does, we are open to that.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Does the Taoiseach take responsibility for the monstrous costs involved in these tribunals because he failed to curb them, does he admit that the scandal of cost was raised with him and the then Tánaiste, the Minister for Health and Children, many years ago by myself and other Deputies and what does he propose to do to allow the investigation into corruption, which must be unmasked, to continue while curbing these outlandish fees for which the taxpayer will be liable?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I ask the Deputy to give way to the Taoiseach.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	230	The answer to the Deputy's question is that, yes, several years ago, we increased both the staffing and fee levels of the tribunals.  In 2004 we introduced new legislation to increase the number of judges and to attempt to speed up the modules.  We did this when the tribunal indicated it would not finish its work until 2016.  At that stage we introduced a new regime which ends at the end of this month.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is in discussions with the tribunal as to how agreement may be reached on the modules and the fees for the future.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	231	What has the Government concluded as regards the planning tribunal, for example, in terms of how long more it should run?  Has this been discussed and has a decision been made by Government in this regard?  How is it proposed to curb the legal costs?  The Taoiseach has not given the House notice of any specific measure to place a limit on the legal costs which are bearing down on the taxpayer.I remind him this is a much wider issue, involving justice for ordinary working people, and the poor, who simply cannot afford going to court and risk the enormous fees that may fall on their heads should they be unsuccessful.  It is an extremely serious issue, not just for the taxpayer, but as regards working people generally.  Taxpayers have inadvertently made several millionaires out of lawyers in the tribunals in recent years, but they themselves cannot afford to darken the doorway of the Four Courts should they need to go there because they cannot risk the costs.  What concrete measures is the Taoiseach proposing today to curb this ruinous level of costs in tribunals and for people generally?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	232	The Government is dealing with a number of the tribunals as regards costs.  We must reach a conclusion because the dates are up shortly for some of these.  The date for the planning tribunal is 31 March, and it is clear for a variety of reasons that its work will not be finished on that date or for a long time afterwards.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is trying to reach a conclusion as regards what modules are outstanding, how long they are likely to take and what to do about costs.  It is not just a question of the planning tribunal.  This must be dealt with as regards other tribunals as well.  It will take a few weeks and this is being negotiated between the tribunals and the Minister, Deputy Roche.

There is a need for further action to address this issue.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following specific matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the serious implications for the future viability of Cork Airport of the decision of the Government to require the airport to meet debts of €100 million, despite having previously promised it would be debt-free; and the need for the Government to review this decision and to honour the commitment previously made in writing by the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan.  In view of the importance of the issue I hope the Ceann Comhairle agrees to this request.

However, part of the programme of legislation to deal with that will be the issue of the age of consent.  I made my position on this clear last year.  The committee which dealt with the issue of the zone of protection for children and the age of consent had a view that it should be 16 on the basis of——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	254	Has the Deputy a question?  He is going back over the end of Leaders' Questions.

When does the Taoiseach expect that legislation to be published?  What is his view at this stage on the age of consent as to whether it should be 16 or 17?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	258	As I said yesterday and as the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said, the age of consent has nothing to do with the referendum.  We have deliberately formulated the proposal to ensure the age of consent does not enter into the debate in any way; this is about the age of protection, about establishing protection for children in the criminal courts and about creating a strict zone of protection.  That is the issue.  The legislation covering the details of other parts of this area is a matter for the future.  Therefore, it does not affect the proposed referendum.  The Deputy does not have to move from what I understand is his stated position.  I have also made remarks on this issue, but it has nothing to do with the referendum.  That is the point.  That legislation will not ready for some considerable time.  Irrespective of what happens, that legislation probably would not be ready before the referendum, even if it was held in the autumn.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	259	In respect of the zone of absolute protection and the age of protection, has that been decided by Government?

I believe four legislative issues arise out of this which will be dealt with over a long period — there is no possibility that it will be dealt with now.  It might take a few years for some of it to be dealt with.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, gave a detailed reply on that matter yesterday.  I refer Deputy Kenny to that reply.

Has there been a change in Standing Orders in terms of providing equality of time in major debates for all parties in the House of two Deputies or more?  I refer to the public statement by the Tánaiste that he had only five minutes to speak on the Moriarty tribunal; he was busy writing his inspirational work for the weekend and could not take up that five minute slot and he could not find any of his colleagues to tell them he was not taking up that slot.

Can we rewind the clock to give the Minister, Deputy McDowell, an opportunity to come to the House to speak on that matter?The second matter I want to raise relates to the Privacy Bill sponsored by the same Minister.  At the weekend he got the chairman of his constituency to put down a motion denouncing the Bill, saying it was a charter for those with things to hide.  Is there a precedent for a Minister disowning his own Bill in this fashion, having come into the House sponsoring it and——

The Taoiseach said there should be a strict zone of protection for children.  This could be delivered, at least in part, if the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill, which refers to sexual exploitation of children, was enacted.  I am not sure what the Taoiseach's plans are for summer 2007, but the indications are that we will not be here.  Is it intended to accelerate the enactment of that legislation to ensure the genuine sincerity of the referendum campaign can at least be reflected in it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The heads of the Bill were completed last summer and it went for drafting.  The legislation was due to be ready early in the summer, but I do not know if we can meet that timeframe.  It is a Bill we would like to get through.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	294	We have been promised the establishment of the Dublin transportation authority by three successive Ministers.  Every time we ask a question about it, we are told its establishment is imminent, but we are always disappointed.  The word on the street is that it is the Taoiseach who has put a stop to the passing of this Bill and that he has given commitments to the agencies which consider their interests would be affected by the passing of it.  Is that true, or does the Taoiseach intend to have this legislation passed before the end of this Dáil?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	295	On the Deputy's first question, the answer is "No, it is not".  On her second question, the Bill should be ready this session.

Taking into account the statements made by the Tánaiste last week, is there any chance the legal costs Bill will be brought forward ahead of its expected publication date?  It comes within the Tánaiste's ministerial brief.  The pharmacy (No. 1) Bill was to be published in this session.  Is there any indication of when it will appear?  Why is there a delay in publication of the pharmacy (No. 2) Bill?  Has a date been indicated?

The Bill will be published later this year, but I doubt if it will be published before the summer.  The pharmacy (No. 1) Bill has been cleared by the Government and should be published any of these days.  It is not possible to indicate a date for publication of the pharmacy (No. 2 Bill) at this stage.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am very pleased to introduce the second of two Bills intended to implement the largest social welfare package in the history of the State at €1.41 billion, announced in last December's budget.  This substantial investment brings total expenditure on social welfare in this year to €15.3 billion, or almost €1 for every €3 of current Government expenditure.  Ireland is now making solid and steady progress in tackling the core issues that can blight people's lives, blunt opportunities and leave some vulnerable and marginalised in society.As well as income support improvements of over €970 million which took effect from January, another €430 million is being directed to support a range of significant reform measures, representing nearly one third of the total package.  These include confronting and tackling remaining child poverty, increasing income supports for all pensioners, recognising and supporting carers and those with disabilities, as well as increasing the status and incomes of women.  These are major structural reforms which, when taken with a number of other reforms implemented in areas such as pensions and lone parent allowances, will contribute greatly to the overall policy reform agenda that I have been pursuing for the last two years.  These reforms on child poverty, carer's allowance, women's incomes and pensions are about more than just increasing incomes.  They are important and necessary structural reforms that create change, open up fresh opportunities and deliver enlightened social policies.On various occasions I have described child poverty as an unacceptable blight on society.  Childhood deprivation can leave lasting marks on children by impeding their development and limiting their life chances.  It is not just the child who suffers.  Society also loses, as its children are its wealth.  Since I began in this portfolio, I have been determined to make a lasting impact on the problem by bringing forward the reforms and targeted measures that reach to the very core of the issue.In recent years we have lifted more than 250,000 people, including 100,000 children, out of poverty, but we still have a distance to travel.  It behoves all of us to redouble our efforts and complete the task.  Prior to budget 2007, resources were aimed at alleviating child poverty through substantial increases in the universal child benefit payments, rather than through increases in the qualified child allowances, which are paid to recipients of social welfare payments.  In January of this year, I increased the qualified child allowance, which used to be known as the child dependant allowance, for the first time since 1994.  The increase in the allowance to a new single high rate of €22 per week has benefited over 340,000 children by targeting those in poorer households.The shift towards child benefit has been significant in tackling disincentives to employment.  In 1994, child benefit represented just 27% of the combined child benefit-qualified child payment for a four-child family.  Today, child benefit accounts for over 65% of that combined payment.  When a welfare recipient moves into full-time employment, his or her family now loses less than 35% of its child income support through loss of qualified child payments.  In this Bill, I am increasing child benefit rates by €10 per month.  Over 560,000 families, or approximately 1,134,000 children, will benefit from the increase, which comes into effect in April and will apply to all children.  It is expected that expenditure on the child benefit scheme will be €2.15 billion in 2007.It is well established that child poverty is especially prevalent among the families of those on the one-parent family payment.  Last March, I launched a Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, which proposed an expansion of the availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, an extension of the national employment action plan to focus on lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.  One of the report's proposals was that the upper income limit for the proposed new social assistance payment should be €400 per week.  I increased the upper weekly income limits for the one-parent family payment from €293 to €375 in budget 2006.  I am delivering on this element of the proposal by increasing the upper income limit to €400 per week in this Bill.The long-term aim of the proposed new social assistance payment, which is being developed by officials in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, is to help people to achieve financial independence by enabling them to enter the labour force, which offers the best way out of poverty and social exclusion.  I fully realise that the proposed new payment cannot be introduced without the development of co-ordinated supports and services by other Departments and agencies.  For that reason, the Government has instructed the senior officials group on social inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations to facilitate the introduction of the new payment scheme.I have taken the opportunity presented by the budget to address the earnings limits for recipients of deserted wives benefit, which is an issue that has been raised with me by several Members of this House.  In response to the Deputies' representations, I have decided to introduce a new single earnings limit of €20,000 gross, even though the scheme has been closed to new applicants since January 1997.  In addition, I am providing in the Bill that when claimants' earnings exceed the new limit, they will be entitled to a new half-rate transitional payment for six months to ease the impact of losing their entitlement to the payment.  Up to 2,300 recipients of deserted wives benefit may benefit from the revisions to the scheme, which will bring it more into line with other social welfare schemes.Deputies will recall that in the Social Welfare Act 2006, I made significant progress towards achieving the Government's commitment to increase the qualified adult allowance for the spouses and partners of contributory pensioners to the level of the State non-contributory pension.  Since January, the budget increase of €23.70 per week in the qualified adult payment has benefited approximately 35,000 couples.  That increase brings the rate of qualified adult allowance payments for those aged 66 years and over to 86.5% of the target rate referred to in the Government commitment.  There is now a €60 million commitment to reach the target rate within the next three years.  This Bill includes the provisions necessary to implement in new cases from September, the direct payment of increases for qualified adults to the qualified adult for the duration of the entitlement of the State pensioner.  It will remain open to any qualified adult to continue to have his or her portion of the pension paid jointly with the personal portion of the pension, if that is his or her preferred option.I have said many times that this country's social welfare system should evolve to reflect the social changes of recent years.  The system needs to keep pace with changes in working and living conditions, particularly those of women.  Accordingly, I propose to reform significantly the way spouses are assessed as qualified adults in a range of social assistance schemes.  Women are generally involved in these instances.  The assessment procedures for many schemes are predicated on the outmoded notion of a "qualified adult", with the woman in the relationship involved in ongoing part-time and low-paid work.  As such assumptions are increasingly outmoded in our modern society, more enlightened social policies are needed.I propose to remove the differential disregards from employment income which apply to couples on assistance schemes and to assess both members of a couple in a similar manner with common disregards and assessments applying to both.  I will remove the poverty traps in the current method of assessment, which arise from the way the current disregard operates.  At certain income levels, if a woman increases her income from part-time employment to more than the current disregard of €100 per week, her spouse can lose €1.20 from his jobseeker's allowance for every €1 she earns in excess of €100.  Such a situation, which represents a withdrawal rate of 120% in respect of income, has no place in a modern labour market.Increases in labour market participation will be rewarded under the proposed reform.  This will allow women to move beyond the occupational cul-de-sac of long-term part-time employment with earnings below €100 per week.  The current position whereby it is more advantageous for the half of a couple who undertakes part-time work to be a qualified adult will be removed.  Both partners will be able to claim jobseeker's allowance in their own right, as long as they satisfy the usual conditions.  They will receive the same rate of payment as a couple where one is a claimant and the other is a qualified adult.  This will facilitate women, in particular, to claim jobseeker's allowance in their own right and access the accompanying range of employment supports and training opportunities.  As part of this reform, I will increase the daily disregard of €12.70 from earned income from employment to €20.  I will extend the disregard to all customers with such income.This proposal removes the anomaly whereby parents of qualified children cannot avail of the disregard.  It further strengthens the incentive for labour market participation by increasing family income when children are involved.  The complexities I have mentioned mean there is potential for some couples to be less well-off under the proposed reform.  They will not be less well-off, however, because the Department of Social and Family Affairs will operate a transitional saver system to protect the level of income they have at present from a combination of jobseeker's allowance and employment income.  I am confident that the proposals will reduce significantly the complexity in the system and recognise, encourage and reward increased labour market participation.As carers play a valuable and much appreciated role in our society, it is important that we support and care for them.  Since the Government took office in 1997, it has been committed to supporting care in the community to the maximum extent possible.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  As a result of these improvements, almost 28,500 carers now receive either carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  Such carers receive a respite care grant, as do approximately 10,000 other carers.  Our commitment to carers was further reinforced in the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, which contains significant commitments in the area of caring.  Work is progressing on the development of a national carer's strategy, which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  It is hoped that the strategy will be finalised by the end of the year.As I have said on many occasions, the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support.  As a general rule, just one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual.  In practice, people who qualify for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.  I am aware that this causes particular concern for people in receipt of one social welfare payment when they become carers.The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs has made some specific and sensible recommendations in this regard.  I have responded by introducing in this Bill a fundamental reform in relation to payments to carers.  From September, people in receipt of certain other social welfare payments, who also provide full-time care and attention to a person, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, subject to their means, up to half the rate of carer's allowance.  Abolishing the old rule that a person cannot receive two welfare payments means that, for the first time, people who are caring will have some real recognition of their caring duties.I am also including in the Bill provision for an increase of €300 in the rate of the respite care grant to €1,500 from June 2007.  This will allow up to 40,000 carers to have a well-deserved break from their caring duties.  The full package of measures for carers which I included in budget 2007 will cost in excess of €107 million in a full year.  We have travelled some distance in recognising and acknowledging the significant contribution carers make in looking after people in their own homes and communities.  Our next step forward will be to achieve our vision of a co-ordinated, comprehensive, accessible and sustainable system of delivering services and supports in the community to people who need care.  At the same time we will continue to support and reward carers and ensure that we care for the carers.The Bill gives effect to a number of improvements to the supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement scheme as part of the overall supplement package announced in budget 2007.  These include an extension of the qualifying conditions and an easing of the rent supplement means test.  The key objectives of the changes are to simplify the means test, so that a rent supplement recipient can judge the impact of an offer of work, and address disincentives and eliminate poverty traps faced by rent supplement recipients seeking to increase their hours of work or wishing to take up full-time employment.  I am also making provision whereby rent supplement may be withheld in respect of accommodation which fails to meet local authority housing standards and to allow rent supplement to be refused in respect of private rental accommodation located in specified areas of regeneration identified by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.This latter measure supports the State's significant investment on regeneration in areas such as Ballymun.  The objective is to achieve a better balance between owner-occupied and rented accommodation in these particular localities.  In taking this approach, provision is made to protect existing tenants.I am also taking the opportunity in the Bill to bring forward enabling legislation which will help to give effect to the Government decision to transfer certain income support and maintenance scheme functions from the Health Service Executive to my Department.  At present, the SWA scheme is delivered by some 700 community welfare officers, CWOs, 59 superintendent community welfare officers and supporting clerical staff in the community welfare service of the HSE.  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 currently stipulates that HSE staff determine entitlement to social welfare allowance.The legislation I am now bringing forward is a technical change which is necessary to ensure that CWOs may continue to administer the scheme when they transfer out of the HSE to my Department and will come into operation by means of a commencement order.  The legislation required for the transfer of functions will be prepared later this year following full consultation with staff and other stakeholders.  The HSE's community welfare service is responsive and flexible in meeting needs and I will be ensuring that these attributes are preserved and built upon as part of the transfer process.The transfer of functions presents fundamental reform and developmental opportunities for a fully integrated and enhanced income support system, including the restructuring and integration of income support services within one entity.  This presents both a challenge and an opportunity for those within the CWS and my own Department in supporting those most disadvantaged in society.  I regard the transfer of functions as a positive way forward and I am confident that it will be embraced by all as the transfer programme progresses in the coming months.The Government is concerned about retirement income in general, now and in the future.  I do not need to remind the House of the demographic pressures our pensions system will face in the future.  Thankfully, unlike other countries, our position will remain favourable for a number of years yet.  It is important that we use the time we have available to act now to find the solutions for tomorrow.  Everyone is entitled to adequate income, dignity and security in their older years.  I am determined that we work towards delivering adequate retirement income to all our citizens which is financially, economically and socially sustainable.I was very pleased at the prominence afforded to pensions in the social partnership negotiations for Towards 2016 and the final agreement features a number of commitments in this area.  As part of the agreement, the Government is committed to publishing a Green Paper on pensions outlining the major policy choices, the challenges in this area and the views of the social partners.  Following a consultation process, the Government will respond to the consultations by developing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda over the long term.  I am confident that the forthcoming Green Paper will offer options for reform — for both State and supplementary pensions — that are sensible and realistic.I view this Green Paper as the beginning of the end of a process of examination, consideration and national debate.  While we face a difficult challenge in securing agreement on a way forward, I am confident that the process will deliver a system that will command broad acceptance and provide the way for people to accumulate adequate resources for their retirement.  Work on drafting the Green Paper is progressing well and I am confident it will be completed on schedule by the end of March.I will now outline to the House the main provisions of the Bill which includes new measures and amends the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, the Pensions Act 1990 and a small number of other Acts.Sections 1 and 2 contain the usual provisions for the Short Title, citation and commencement of the Bill, and the definition of certain terms used throughout the Bill.  Section 3 contains a technical amendment to clarify the definition of a volunteer development worker for the purposes of the social welfare code.  Section 4 provides for an increase of €10 in the monthly rate of child benefit, bringing the lower and higher rates, respectively, to €160 and €195 per month.  Families who receive the monthly payment via their bank accounts will receive the budget increase from April 2007, while those who receive payment via personalised payable order books encashable at post offices will be paid in the first week in May 2007, back dated to April 2007.  In addition, section 26 provides for a measure of flexibility in the payment arrangements for child benefit by removing the presumption that a child resides with only one person.Section 5 provides, in addition to a technical amendment, that where a person who was in receipt of illness benefit for at least two years has engaged in employment for less than 26 weeks and subsequently re-applies for that benefit, payment will not be made at a lower rate than that which he or she previously received.  This section and section 8 provide that former recipients of carer's benefit or carer's allowance who transfer to illness benefit or jobseeker's benefit may revert to a rate not lower than that previously in payment.  Section 5 also removes an obsolete reference to "rules of behaviour".Section 6 contains a number of measures to enhance the maternity benefit scheme.  These include provision for the payment of maternity benefit to the father of a newborn child on the death of the child's mother without having to satisfy the contribution conditions of the scheme in his own right.  This section also provides for the payment of not less than six weeks maternity benefit on the death of the mother, bringing this scheme in line with the after-death payment arrangements of other social welfare schemes.  In addition, the section clarifies the position in respect of disqualification for receipt of maternity benefit by providing that benefit will not be payable where a woman engages in any form of insurable employment or self-employment, or fails, without good cause, to attend for medical examination.As the provisions governing adoptive benefit mirror those applicable to maternity benefit, section 7 extends the section 6 enhancements to adoptive benefit.  It also clarifies that a person will be disqualified from receiving adoptive benefit if he or she engages in any form of employment or self-employment.  As outlined, section 9 contains amendments to the provisions governing the means test and the assessment of spouses' earnings for the purposes of jobseeker's allowance, pre-retirement allowance, farm assist and disability allowance.Sections 10, 11, 16 and 25 provide for technical amendments to the occupational injuries schemes including the deletion of an obsolete provision regarding the prescribed time for claiming the cost of medical care.  They also provide for the deletion of obsolete references in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to "rules of behaviour".Section 12 provides for the inclusion of education and training, subject to prescribed conditions, in the activities in which a recipient of carer's benefit may engage and still satisfy the conditions for receipt of that benefit.  Section 13 provides for a technical amendment to clarify date of entry into social insurance for the purposes of a State pension, contributory.Section 14 provides for the direct payment of increases for qualified adults payable with the State pensions directly to the qualified adult, for the duration of the period of entitlement of the State pensioner.  This provision is applicable to the State pension, contributory, State pension, transition, and the State pension, non-contributory, and will come into effect for new claims made from 24 September 2007.Section 15 provides that where a recipient of invalidity pension subsequently qualifies for State pension, contributory, or a pension payable under reciprocal arrangements by another state, he or she shall be entitled to receive whichever payment is the most beneficial.  Section 17 provides that guardian's payment, contributory, and guardian's payment, non-contributory, shall not be payable simultaneously with a payment under Part VI of the Child Care Act 1991.Section 18 provides that, for the purposes of the bereavement grant, "qualified child" shall include a person aged between 16 and 22 who is in receipt of disability allowance.  Section 19 contains a technical amendment to clarify that the widowed parent grant is applicable to recipients of widow's and widower's contributory pensions which are payable under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.Section 20 provides that where a person who was in receipt of a widow's or widower's payment ceases to be a widow or widower and subsequently applies for jobseeker's allowance, payment of the allowance will commence without the application of the "waiting days" condition normally applicable for that allowance.Section 21 provides for an increase in the upper earnings limit for customers in receipt of the one-parent family payment from €375 to €400 per week.  This provision is effective from May 2007.  Section 22 confers power to make regulations to provide for a transitional payment where a deserted wives benefit beneficiary's entitlement ceases because her earnings have exceeded the prescribed upper limit of €20,000.  Section 23 provides for a means-tested payment equivalent to up to half the carer's allowance rate to certain persons who may also be in receipt of another social welfare payment.Section 24 provides that where a person is unemployed for 12 months and in receipt of rent supplement, he or she may engage in full-time employment, or where a person participates in a community employment or back to work scheme, he or she will continue to receive rent supplement if he or she has been accepted as being in need of accommodation under the rental accommodation scheme.  This section also provides at Schedule 1 for the transfer of certain functions from the Health Service Executive to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, as recommended by the Core Functions of the Health Service Report and as agreed by Government.  In effect, the section removes the HSE from the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.Section 24 also provides for a number of consequential amendments to existing provisions in the area of appeals, overpayments and recovery of overpayments arising from this.  This is a technical change, necessitated by the fact that, following the transfer, the staff concerned will no longer be employees of the HSE.  The section also provides for measures to preclude the payment of rent supplement where accommodation standards, as defined by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, are not met.  In addition, the section contains the legislative provisions to preclude the payment of rent supplement in areas of regeneration, as identified by the same Department.Section 27 provides for an increase in the amount of the annual respite care grant from €1,200 to €1,500 from June 2007.  The section also provides for an enhancement of the scheme by providing that, subject to the conditions that may be prescribed, a person may engage in education and training and still qualify for the grant.Section 28 clarifies the obligation of a claimant to provide the information and evidence required in support of a social welfare claim, and to inform the Department of any relevant change of circumstances in the course of payment.  Section 29 outlines in legislation the five factors, based on European Court of Justice case law, that are taken into account when determining whether a claimant for certain social welfare schemes satisfies the habitual residence condition.Section 30 provides for the exchange of relevant employment data between my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to facilitate the operation of the agency established under Towards 2016 with responsibility for ensuring employment rights compliance.  Section 31 contains measures to further strengthen control in issuing personal public service numbers.  They include increased penalties, enhanced identity measures and provisions to combat the use of fraudulent documentation.Section 32 provides for the household budgeting scheme to encompass any telecommunications service provider which is registered with the Commission for Communications Regulation.  Section 33 contains provisions for the inclusion of the managers and staff of social welfare branch offices in the categories of persons designated to decide claims for certain social welfare payments under the social welfare code.  This measure is intended to facilitate improvement in claim processing times in branch offices by removing the current requirement to forward certain claims to social welfare local offices for decision.Section 34 provides for an improvement in the means test applicable to disability allowance by increasing by €30,000, from €20,000 to €50,000, the amount of capital which is disregarded for the purposes of the means test.  It also provides for some technical amendments to Schedule 3 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.Section 35 provides a number of enhancements to the means test for entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance, including the exclusion from means assessment of any moneys received by way of guardian's payments and respite care grant.  This section also provides for the disregard, for rent supplement purposes, of 50% of additional income, including earnings from employment to a maximum of €200 per week and subject to a minimum disregard of €75 per week.  This, together with the improvement in section 24, whereby a rent supplement recipient accepted for the residential scheme may engage in full-time employment, is aimed at supporting people returning to work and to assist tenants in achieving long-term housing solutions for their needs.The Department recently met with the social partners to discuss the proposed measures and will hold further consultations with the social partners shortly.  Arising from these discussions, some further adjustment to the measures may perhaps be suggested.  In that event, I may bring forward proposals to Government for the inclusion of any necessary amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage.The main measures I am introducing in this Bill with regard to the Pensions Act will further enhance the regulatory regime governing supplementary pensions.  Section 36 and Part 1 of Schedule 2 make provision for the inclusion of trust retirement annuity contracts — trust RACs — within the remit of the Pensions Act 1990.  This is a requirement under Directive 2003/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 June 2003 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision — the IORPs directive.  This amendment to the Pensions Act only applies to trust RACs which currently have approximately 10,000 members.  These are arrangements for groups of individuals established under trust, for example, the Law Society of Ireland or the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ireland.  This amending provision treats trust RACs in a similar manner to that already provided for in the Pensions Act 1990 in respect of defined contribution occupational pension schemes.Part 2 of Schedule 2 contains amendments to the Pensions Act to enhance the Pension Board's powers in the area of prosecution.  Section 3A of the Pensions Act was inserted by section 39 of the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Act 2006 to provide an alternative to the prosecution of an offence by the Pensions Board.  It allows the board introduce an on-the-spot fine regime as an alternative to taking a prosecution.  Section 3A is now amended to specify the sections of the Act, a contravention of which will warrant the application of an on-the-spot fine.  Contraventions of the Act which are not specified under section 3A because they do not, in the board's view, meet the criteria for an on-the-spot fine will be considered for prosecution by the board.The Pensions Act is also amended to increase the level of fines for both summary and indictable offences under the Act from €1904.61 to €5,000 for a summary offence and from €12,697.38 to €25,000 for an indictable offence.  It provides that fines imposed under the Act shall not be paid out of the resources of the scheme or trust RAC, or out of the assets of any PRSA, as the case may be.Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Bill provides for a number of miscellaneous amendments which are mainly technical in nature, namely, the insertion of two new sections into the Pensions Act in regard to the accountability of the chief executive of the Pensions Board and the Pensions Ombudsman before the Committee of Public Accounts.  This amendment is in compliance with the requirements of the Report of the Working Group on the Accountability of Secretaries General and Accounting Officers — the Mullarkey report.  I thank the Pension Board for its help in drafting these amendments to the Pensions Act.Section 37 amends the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to underpin the proposals in Towards 2016 for the Revenue Commissioners to transfer to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the new office dedicated to employment rights compliance, information similar to that which the Revenue Commissioners will be empowered to transfer to my Department.  Section 38 and Schedule 3 of the Bill amend the Combat Poverty Agency Act 1986 and the Family Support Agency Act 2001 to provide that the director and chief executive officer, respectively, of these agencies, which are under my remit, are accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts on the same basis as are the Accounting Officers of Departments.This Bill builds further on the development of social inclusion measures adopted by this Government over recent years.  It safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare income and other supports and prioritises the allocation of resources in favour of those most in need.  Resources will continue to be targeted at helping those most in need in order not alone to raise their standard of living but to ensure that everyone is a valued citizen who can make his or her own individual contribution to society regardless of his or her particular personal circumstances.  However, while the significant social issues we face can be eased, they cannot be solved by welfare and support payments alone.  It is vitally important that we do not view welfare solely as a panacea.  That is why a "one size fits all" welfare system does not provide the answers.  Welfare support systems must be tailored to the specific needs of individuals and should be seen as stepping stones to achieving a better quality of life.The Bill is also about solid and fundamental structural reforms of welfare policies.  It is about reforms that will modernise, make the welfare system fairer and deliver more enlightened social policy, which the country deserves.  For these reasons, I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I thank the officials from the Department of Social and Family Affairs for the briefing we received on the Bill today.  I find all the officials in the Department extraordinarily courteous and helpful.  Many colleagues have said the same and it is something other Departments could emulate.  I do not say this to get on the good side of the officials.I would like to raise a concern I raised when making my speech on last year's Bill.  I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in 2000 the Bill for that year was published on 10 February and debated on 24 February.  Therefore, Opposition Deputies were given 14 days to study the Bill and come up with a reasoned response.  In 2001, the Opposition was given 20 days to do the same.  In 2002, it was given 13 days; in 2003, 12; and in 2004, 13.  In 2005, the number of days provided dropped to seven.  Last year it dropped to one, the same as this year.  There is much in the Bill which is complex and important.  Does the Minister think it is fair that Members on this side of the House have only one day to examine, take advice on and respond to the legislation which calls for constructive debate?  Last year he said in his closing speech:I apologise to those Deputies who feel that we are dealing with this Bill too quickly.  That was not my intention, but it was just the way it happened on the day.  I particularly regret inconveniencing Deputies Stanton and Penrose who had to respond at one day's notice to the legislation.  The process has slowed down since then, but I appreciate that it was a bit unfair to them.  It was not intentional, but the Bill appeared on the Order Paper rapidly.Why did the same happen this year?  This is not good enough.I asked the Ceann Comhairle last week, while the Minister was present, what the convention was and he said the time allowed was normally two weeks.  It is an insult to the Opposition and the House that the same has happened again this year.  I can understand it happening once and believe it was unintentional, but now that it has happened a second time, I must put it to the House that it was intentional and meant to discommode the Opposition.  I cannot understand why the Bill could not have been brought forward two weeks ago, as the Minister had the whole year to put it together.  In other years this happened.  I will not continue to moan about it, but I want my annoyance noted.  That it happened a second time is indefensible and the Minister cannot make a valid defence.  It is unfortunate that it has happened again.The briefing on the Bill was scheduled for yesterday.  However, as we all know, many Deputies from rural areas are not in Dublin on a Monday and I am glad it was possible to reschedule the briefing for today.  If we were even given one week instead of the conventional two to prepare for the debate, it would be helpful.Much of the Bill implements provisions and changes made in the budget, mostly increases in payment rates which are always welcome.  I welcome, in particular, improvements in payments rates of child benefit, maternity and adoptive benefit, and respite care grants, as well as improvements to qualification criteria applying to transfers between payments, illness benefit, carer's benefit, jobseeker's benefit, injury benefit, invalidity pension and bereavement grants.While increases in child benefit, and child dependant allowance last year, are welcome, I am disappointed that there has still been no progress in other areas of child income support.  The Minister stated in his speech last year:In the area of child income support, the Government's policy is to concentrate resources on enhancing the child benefit scheme.  Child benefit now accounts for some 67% of child income support, while in 1994 it constituted less than 30%.  There are sound reasons for this policy.  Child benefit is both neutral vis-à-vis the employment status of the child’s parents and it does not contribute to poverty traps.  As a near universal payment, child benefit is not taxable, is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits and is payable to the primary carer, usually the mother.  When account is taken of these aspects of payment, child benefit is a most effective child income support mechanism.It is clear from statistics and reports that increases in child benefit alone do not improve the circumstances of young children in low income households and have failed to confront the unacceptable blemish of child poverty in the Ireland of the 21st century, an Ireland of "exceptional wealth", to use the Minister's words last year.  I agree with him when he says child poverty is unacceptable and that we must strive to banish it for good.  However, current policies are not working.  If they were, we would not have seen an increase in the rate of consistent poverty for children under 18 years, up a percentage point since 2004 to 10.7% in 2005, as published in the most recent EU SILC 2005 figures published last year by the CSO.  A recent UNICEF report shows that under the "material well-being" indicator, Ireland ranks 19th out of 21 countries surveyed, ninth on average when all six indicators are taken into account.I see in today's newspaper that the Minister is going to Brussels on Thursday and remind him that the risk of poverty in Ireland is a matter of great concern to the Commission.  We are not out of the woods yet in that regard.  We all come across frustrating cases in our clinics each week.  People are trapped and can see no way out.  If there was more flexibility and imagination, more help could be provided.  A 62-year-old man in receipt of disability allowance rang me today.  He is living in a house in which the roof is falling in and water is coming through the walls, but he can do nothing about it.  He is trapped.  He owns the house, but there is no support for him to help him improve his circumstances.  Such cases are heartbreaking and we find it impossible to get help for such persons.If Government policies were working, we would not have had to see the establishment of an End Child Poverty coalition with members from OPEN, the Combat Poverty Agency, Barnardos, etc.  These groups had to get together in a coalition to make their case.  The Government has failed to meet its child poverty target set in the national anti-poverty strategy.  It promised that relative income poverty among children would be eliminated and that consistent poverty levels among children would be reduced to under 2% by 2007, but this has not happened.Despite the announcement by the Minister in 2004 of the introduction of a targeted second tier payment and recommendations at national and international level and an ongoing study by the NESC, this payment has still not been introduced.  I acknowledge that child dependent allowance was increased to €22 per week in the budget and that there were increases in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and FIS, but the take-up of FIS is still low, estimated at about40%, while many families miss out on the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance due to the September deadline, a matter I raised previously.  Bureaucracy rules, however, and there is no movement in the matter.Greater efforts must be made to target the State's resources towards low income families with children.  If we can help children at that stage, their education and life chances will benefit significantly.  However, if they are stuck in poverty, their life chances suffer, while the opportunity for them to reach their potential in education, training, employment and life is diminished.  We must focus more attention on children experiencing poverty.  Year after year Ministers come and tell us there has been an improvement.  We have never had so much money and wealth.  Why, therefore, do we still have children experiencing consistent poverty, as measured by the Minister's measure?  We are talking about families who do not have the price of a pair of shoes, a change of clothes or track suits.  Their children cannot go to birthday parties because they cannot afford to bring a present for their friends.  Some children go to school hungry.  We are not dealing with these problems.In September last year the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child called on the Government to strengthen its support to families to ensure children were protected against the negative impact of economic hardship on their development.  Therefore, it is not just the Opposition which has pointed this out.  The committee also called for the introduction of a supplement to the existing universal child benefit payment as an additional and targeted allowance to assist families which experience the highest levels of poverty.  I appreciate that there may be barriers to the introduction of a second-tier payment, but three years is a lengthy period to determine those and reach a solution.  Perhaps the Minister might tell us when the NESC review will be completed.Another important element of the child poverty debate is the campaign to restore universal child benefit launched by the Free Legal Advice Centres.  The current weekly payments are €19.10 for an adult and €9.60 for a child.In addition to there having been no increases in the rates of direct provision in recent budgets, some 2,000 child asylum seekers are denied child benefit.  The application of the habitual residence clause to those children denies them.  While it also affects the children of immigrants, child asylum seekers are more severely affected, since their parents are denied employment and live from very limited cash income while on direct provision.We must debate and discuss this major issue.  There are currently 2,200 children in Ireland whose families receive €9.60 per week to care for them.  What is the price of a pair of shoes and a change of clothes?  In many cases, such children will be granted permission to remain in Ireland when their cases are heard.  Another issue is why it is taking so long to make a decision on so many of them.  Some of those children have experienced such deprivation for several years.  What kind of impact will it have on them as adult citizens?  What damage is being done to them?  They are innocents and surely we should do more for them.The Minister should consider their plight.  As far as I know, there are only 2,200 such children, but they are living in extreme poverty with only the barest necessities.  We should try to integrate them if possible.  I am not sure whether the Minister has visited any refugee centres — perhaps he might tell us in his response.  However, it would be useful if he called to see where those children are living and witnessed the conditions.  For example, the children will never see their own parents cook a meal.  One might contend that it is irrelevant, since they are provided with food, but something is fundamentally wrong with that and perhaps we should reconsider the entire area.  The children in question will probably remain here as future citizens and we are giving them an awful start in life.I also note that section 29 of the Bill provides a statutory basis for decisions on habitual residence conditions identified by the European Court of Justice.  Have guidelines been published regarding their interpretation?  Some of them seem rather subjective and open to interpretation and we may require more information.  I have been contacted in cases where payments have been denied under the "main centre of interest" subsection.  The reasons are confusing and the area should be re-examined.Another important means of tackling child poverty is creating better education and employment opportunities for parents, which will allow them to move from welfare dependency to gainful employment.  The Minister published his proposals on lone parents in February 2006.  At the time they received much media attention and were subject to a great deal of public debate.  The Minister said the following regarding the lone parent review:It is my intention that the outcome of these reviews, together with initiatives already in place in my Department, will contribute to the development of proposals designed to better support and encourage both lone parents and those seeking work in achieving a better standard of living, employment and education opportunities, a better future for themselves and their children.If the Minister had introduced such proposals, he would have found Opposition Members very supportive.  We encouraged the Minister to bring them forward, but we have not yet seen them.  Perhaps the Minister can now outline the status of those proposals on low-income families.Since his speech last year there has been no real movement, either on changing the one-family payment or on improving education and training opportunities for lone parents and providing them with successful and affordable child care to engage in new opportunities.  Child care, its cost, availability and, most importantly, its quality are still major issues.  The only change in the Bill is to raise the higher earning threshold from €375 per week to €400.  That will do little to solve the child care issues that lone parents face or assist them in upskilling and entering better-paid employment.Reports by the European Anti-Poverty Network, EAPN, and the One Parent Exchange and Network, OPEN, have clearly shown what poverty traps a return to employment can entail for lone parents and low-income families that enter poorly paid employment.  Losses of secondary benefits such as medical cards, rent supplement and so on, coupled with the additional child care and transport costs that a return to work normally entails, render employment an economically non-viable option for lone parents in particular.  I have had lone parents at my clinic ask me who will mind their children if they return to work.  It is a major problem.I note that changes to the rent supplement scheme will now allow a person in receipt of rent supplement who has been out of work for over 12 months to retain the rent supplement when he or she returns to work, as long as that person is on the RAS list.  At a recent committee meeting with the End Child Poverty Coalition, concerns were raised regarding the administration of the RAS and the transfer of people on rent supplement to local authority housing lists.I also note that changes to the means test regarding earnings limits, with a 50% disregard up to €200, are also included in Schedule 3 and those too should help lone parents and social welfare recipients returning to work.  I wonder how RAS is now functioning.  We know that a great deal of money has been transferred from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but little has been spent and the scheme may need reviewing.In the Minister's speech, he stated that the quality of much private rented accommodation was extraordinarily poor, with people living in very poor conditions.  They come to Deputies all the time and state that the accommodation is damp and that water is running down the walls.  Sometimes their children have asthma or a chest infection as a result.  That major issue must be addressed in today's Ireland.  We hear of two or three small children living with their mother in a cramped room with water running down the walls.  It is hard to believe until one sees it.Another important aspect to the proposals aims to end the cohabitation rule so that parents of children can live together without their income dropping.  The Minister said that the rule is outdated and does not reflect modern society.  However, in his Department there still appears to be a bias against unmarried fathers, who have little support from the State when it comes to access to their children.Great changes are happening.  According to the CSO Vital Statistics figures published in 2003, covering Ireland North and South, from "1980 to 2002, the proportion of birth outside marriage increased substantially in both jurisdictions, rising from around 5% to approximately one third of all births in both areas".  That figure continues to increase in the Republic of Ireland, with the CSO Vital Statistics for the second quarter of 2006 showing:there were 5,056 births registered as outside marriage in quarter 2 of 2006.  This accounted for 31.6% of all births, an increase of 0.2% on quarter 2 2005.  The highest percentage of births outside marriage occurred in Limerick City at 54.6%, while the county with the lowest percentage was Leitrim at 20%.  In quarter 2 of 1997, 3,445 births were registered outside marriage or 25.2% of all births.That substantial increase indicates a great change in society.  We must consider that and introduce proposals to support families more.We welcome the Minister's proposals regarding lone parents, the cohabitation rule and so on, and it would have been great if this Dáil could have ended with such proposals in place.  Then we could all have supported the Minister in that work, happy in the knowledge that we had achieved something.  The danger now is that, with the end of the Dáil, all those proposals could fall by the wayside.  Who knows what Minister will be in power after the election?  It is disappointing that the Minister has not achieved those aims.  The ideas were laudable and, to give him his due, his intentions were proper.  However, the reform has not been implemented.Changes have been made in the Bill to child and maternity benefit.  In the case of the first, we see the removal of criteria which presume that a child resides with only one person, which is of assistance.  In the case of maternity benefit, there will be a payment for six weeks to a father automatically on the death of the mother.  However, I am concerned that those will not apply to fathers not registered on the birth certificate.I have questioned the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform several times regarding the establishment of a guardianship register for unmarried fathers, which would confer greater rights on them.  However, the Minister has stated that he has no plans to do so, which is a shame.  At present, a father can register, but it is only a piece of paper that both parties sign, with no central register.  If that piece of paper is lost or destroyed, there is no record of guardianship.  It would be simple to establish such a register, but it has not happened.I was pleased to see changes to carers' payments, such as increases in the respite care grant and the inclusion of education and training opportunities to the carers' benefit scheme.  That is essential for carers who wish to return to work once their caring duties are over.I was pleased to see provision for the partial payment of carer's allowance to social welfare recipients.  I proposed a half-rate payment, particularly to pensioner carers, in Fine Gael's carers policy and believe strongly that carers should be given improved financial and social supports in recognition of the importance of their role to members of their families, for whom they care, and society as a whole.  Deputy Penrose has done a lot of work in this regard in his role as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.I was very disappointed to see no supports for young carers included in the Bill.  I have raised the plight of up to 3,000 young carers aged between 15 and 18 years with the Minister on a number of occasions and would like to see better social supports available to them.  They have great responsibilities by comparison with their peers.  In the absence of financial supports, other forms of assistance such as home help, counselling and support networks would ease the burden of caring on them.  Delivery in this regard has been postponed until 2016, or some such year, and no provisions are being made in the Bill before the House.Combating fraud, particularly in regard to PPS numbers, is another concern of mine.  Section 31 of the Bill outlines measures for the penalties to be imposed once fraud has been established and more security measures to combat fraud, in particular, the issuing of public service cards that include one's name, PPS number, photograph and signature.  Does the Minister intend to issue the cards on a nationwide basis?  If so, when and how?  Will they afford the holder access to other services?  Large sums of money are being lost each year through PPS fraud, the failure of companies to pay social insurance contributions for employees and problems with overpayments by way of the electronic fund transfer system.  I have tabled many parliamentary questions on the issue and I am awaiting the most recent figures regarding overpayments and the Department's recovery of these moneys.I am pleased that direct payments to all pension-qualifying adults will come into effect in September.  I am disappointed that the payment does not extend to all qualifying adults regardless of payment type.  Direct payment should be offered to all adult dependants, particularly women, to help them achieve economic independence from their partners.  The National Women's Council has raised concerns about the limitation rule which limits payments to households to 1.7 times the adult payment rate, even if two adults therein qualify for payment in their own right.There are other concerns regarding the marriage bar and pension entitlements, as raised by me and other Deputies on a number of occasions.  I note the Government has committed to giving all women of pensionable age an individual entitlement to a pension in their own right in the next three years.  The marriage bar issue is still a problem.  The averaging rule is a major concern.  Therefore, we should examine it.  A woman I met recently said she was one of a diminishing number of affected women.  Women who worked, took time off to care for their families and worked for a little period thereafter are denied a pension in their own right.  If they had not worked at all at the tail end of their working lives, they probably would have received a full pension, or at least some pension or recognition.  The averaging rule, therefore, needs to be addressed.Consider the transfer of the community welfare service from the HSE to the Department, a matter to which I have given some thought.  Deputy Penrose feels very strongly about it and I await his considered deliberations thereon.  Responsibility for rent supplement is being transferred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government from the HSE and Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Community welfare officers provide a very personal service that is unique and has developed over time.  Perhaps some of their functions can be transferred such as those concerning rented accommodation.  They feel very strongly that they have not been consulted on the transfer.  The Minister said he was including the relevant provision in the legislation and would consult them afterwards.  This may be putting the cart before the horse; he should have consulted them beforehand to learn from their experience.  There was no meeting or consultation but perhaps there has been recently.The transfer will affect approximately 1,000 people working in the health sector.  There are 100,000 recipients of supplementary welfare allowance payments.  Those using the services provided directly by the HSE, including domiciliary care allowance recipients, are affected.  The Government's justification for transferring the functions involves an organisational arrangement allowing the HSE to focus on core responsibilities.  Very often those who are or should be helped by community welfare officers are under considerable pressure and the assistance they receive is a safety net.I am amazed at the relationship community welfare officers build with recipients.  It is crucial to acknowledge that it is not just a question of money.  The officers offer personal support, very often by listening.  I have met and asked them about their training in counselling because very often they fulfil the role of counsellors.  They link in with other services in the health sector such as psychiatric and psychological services and public health nurses' services.  It is feared that this link could be broken if responsibility is transferred from the HSE to the Department and that the officers would become mere financial administrators.  Their role is much greater than this.I understand the transfer is included in the legislation but that it will probably not be implemented this side of the general election.  We will be debating the issue on Committee Stage.  Community welfare officers believe the proposal to transfer responsibility for the service is based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of their role requirements and the purpose, operation and function of the service and that this would inevitably result in the separation of health and personal social services over time.  The first time they were given an opportunity to express a formal view was during the committee proceedings last June.  They believe the transfer would have a profound, adverse effect on the service, ultimately undermining the quality and range of services they provide, to the detriment of some of the most vulnerable citizens.  There has been no public debate on the issue.Community welfare officers believe the description of their role as pertaining more to welfare supports than personal social services disregards the key information and advocacy role they perform in addition to making referrals to statutory health and personal social services.  It is, therefore, more than a question of money.  The officers are afraid the Department will not continue to devote resources to functions for which it is not ultimately responsible.  They believe their ability to make discretionary payments will be undermined.  We should be enhancing their power to make such payments.  We have all come across cases where this is useful.  Very many Deputies must now ring the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to obtain help for constituents because there is no other body which can help.  Community welfare officers should be fulfilling this role.There is a detailed section in the Bill concerning pensions.  Less than 50% of the workforce have personal pension coverage; coverage among working women is even lower.  Many women in part-time work and job-share arrangements are excluded even from State occupational pension schemes.  The Pensions Ombudsman is concerned about this.  We are still awaiting the Green Paper on pensions.  It is due in March and will be considered by the next Dáil.The Minister referred to mandatory pensions, about which we have been hearing and the looming pensions crisis for the past two years.  I suppose the Green Paper will make progress in this regard.  The trade union Amicus has advocated an SSIA-style saving model for pensions, especially for those in the lower tax bracket.  Pensions comprise a very big issue.The Bill has many provisions but, unfortunately, we did not have very much time to consider them in great detail or obtain advice thereon.  I understand Committee Stage will be taken in a few weeks and we might have time to consider it in more detail between now and then.This is probably one of the last Bills the Minister will introduce during the term of this Dáil and I hope it is successful.  It has many good, welcome and necessary provisions but we must still focus on certain issues, child poverty in particular.  I agree with the Minister that eliminating child poverty should be our aim.  We must focus all the resources and expertise of the State on the problem to lift those affected out of poverty and allow them the life chances they need and deserve in order to live fulfilling lives.  If we do not do so, the affected children may end up in trouble with the police, be put in jail and get into bother which would ultimately cost more than the cost of addressing the problem now.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute on behalf of the Labour Party to the Second Stage debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007.  I join Deputy Stanton in thanking the officials from the Department of Social and Family Affairs for giving us an insight into this Bill, which is possibly the most complex legislation to have come before us.  However, the late manner in which Bills are provided to Members has to stop because we do not have the Minister's support in terms of time and advice.  The Bill contains a number of positive developments which are welcomed by the Labour Party.  It is time, for example, that antiquated and obsolete practices such as rules of behaviour are eliminated.The waiting day requirement has caused anxiety among people in receipt of unemployment benefits and other payments.  Several people from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's county of Kilkenny raised that issue with me.  It is absurd that people have to wait three days for payments when they have already qualified by making social insurance contributions.  Any person unfortunate enough to be in that situation should be paid immediately.  Given the investments made on upgrading the Department's computer systems, there should be no waiting days for any payments.Concerns have been expressed with regard to people who do not receive their pensions on time despite applying for them several months in advance of retirement.  They are entitled to their pensions once they have completed the forms and submitted birth certificates and other documentation, so it is a scandal that complaints arise in that regard.  It does not say much for the new computer system if people have to wait.  The Department should be able to project ahead so that, like the travel pass, pensions are paid automatically from the date on which they are due to commence.  We should recognise people's contributions by paying them in a timely manner rather than make them feel as if they are begging for their entitlements.  It is time to end that charade.Deputy Stanton noted that people have to be in care on the first Friday in June in order to qualify for respite care grants.  I am aware the grant is annual and that facilities have been introduced for people who are hospitalised but what happens if a person enters care after that date and dies at the end of the following May?  The system should not be so rigid that it cannot react to events on the ground.  We should be capable of adjusting to sometimes harsh realities.I have championed the cause of carers at every available opportunity and will continue to do so.  It is Labour Party policy that we will abolish the means test if we come to power because we recognise carers and the work they do 24 hours per day.  They save the State billions of euro, so a payment worth €140 million is the least that can be made to support them.  I acknowledge that the respite care grant has alleviated some areas of distress and thank the Minister on behalf of carers for the €300 payments he is now making.  However, the payment is mere crumbs from a rich man's table because, without carers, many more people would have to be put into State care.  We would not even have sufficient accommodation for such an increase because the public sector, which accounted for 80% of accommodation in the 1960s, now comprises only 48% of total places.  Privatisation is being introduced by stealth and that is not for the better.Deputy Stanton has championed the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  The September deadline is too rigid because people often miss it.  If the sole aim of the Minister's policies is to help people who face poverty, flexibility is vital to ensure they receive the support they need.  Applicants would already have qualified through rigid means testing procedures.  Carer's allowance should not be assessed as income for the back-to-school allowance.  I am aware of a person from Robinstown in Mullingar who was disgracefully deprived of the back-to-school allowance for that reason.This is the most means tested country in Europe.  I would love to know how much the Department is spending annually on means testing.  There would be significant savings from abolishing the means test for the carer's allowance in terms of no longer having to measure small and irrelevant matters.  From that perspective, the allowance would not even cost €140 million.The social welfare system is in need of modernisation to meet changing needs.  The current system is rooted in outmoded concepts, relegating women in particular to subservient roles within a system of eligibility and assessment in the social welfare codes.  Progress has been made with regard to what was formerly known as the qualified adult dependant, although I do not believe in changing names for the sake of modernity when the underlying circumstances have not changed.  Nobody is made better off simply by changing a name.  We have seen before cases where money which could have been given to the people who need it was spent on changing names, thereby being consumed by a bureaucratic monolith.In the interest of equality and equity, the Labour Party wishes to see an end to outmoded concepts and we wholeheartedly promote and support economic independence for women.  To achieve that end, we must abolish the limitation rule for all payments and increase the rate of all qualified adult payments towards 100% of the personal payments, as well as making them directly payable.  However, people should not be fooled because the fact that the qualified adult allowance will be paid directly from September does not mean they will be better off.  Women, who comprise 95% of the people eligible for this payment, will merely receive the money formerly paid to their husbands.  There will be no economic benefit to many households if both adults receive individual payments.  Paying benefits solely to husbands restricts wives' economic independence and excludes them from receiving payments in their own right.  The only way to address that issue is by paying the qualified adult payment directly, which the Minister has done.  Abolition of the limitation rule is important in the context of economic independence for women.This is essential because no economic benefit would accrue to the household if both adults were to receive an individual payment as, in the case of the majority of qualified adults, their payments would go directly to their husbands.  This is very important and Members must state that while the first step is being taken, the second appears to be a long way down the road.  As I noted, 95% of qualified adults are women, many of whom were excluded from the labour market because of their caring and parental work.  I note that under Sustaining Progress, the Government has committed itself to increasing the qualified adult payment to 100% of the full personal payment by 2007.  This will not be honoured and the timescale for the achievement of this worthy objective has been long-fingered again.Many women were forced from employment by implementation of the marriage bar.  Effectively, women were discriminated against because of their gender and the application of the bar which, on reflection, was an incredible act of discrimination.  How was its application ever contemplated, let alone implemented?  It is mindboggling that it ever escaped detailed scrutiny.  Consequently, such women are now being denied a host of financial benefits to which they would have been duly entitled.  Up to 45% of women are at risk of poverty and much of this has its origins in implementation of the marriage bar.  It drove people from work who would qualify for a payment.  Effectively, Members have described as non-persons those who find themselves in this position.  They are not entitled to the State pension through no fault of their own.  As they do not qualify for the various schemes, effectively, they are being discriminated against.  Members should describe this as State discrimination.  It is high time that they grabbed the bull by the horns and admitted a gross error was made at the time which constituted a gross level of State discrimination.  They should try to deal with this very serious problem.Child poverty is a major issue.  While one can point to the universality of the payment of child benefit, the End Child Poverty Coalition made a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs recently.  It is clear that bodies such as the European Anti-Poverty Network, Barnardos and OPEN still consider child poverty to be one of the great scourges of Irish society.  It is an indictment on this society to state children are still at risk of poverty in 2007.  This issue has not been tackled.  Although child dependant allowance was increased by a few euro, a supplementary child benefit payment to supplement the universal child benefit payment was not introduced.  Such a payment would be aimed at those on lower incomes and would be directly targeted.  It would certainly be the most effective way to tackle and root out child poverty, a scourge and a blight on this society.  Moreover, without the work of individuals such as Fr. Peter McVerry and others who are engaged in non-governmental organisations and as community volunteers nationwide, an even greater level of poverty would be eating away at society.  The amalgamation of family income supplement, child dependant allowance and other measures should be considered in an effort to tackle this subject.  This is a matter on which much work remains to be done and I urge the Minister to continue to try to do it.I refer to better pre-application information and the relaxation of full-time care and attention rules for carer's allowance and the carer's respite grant.  Approximately 15% of carers are refused carer's allowance on the basis that they do not provide full-time care and attention.  In my experience, this is usually due to their distance from the person for whom they are caring or because the care recipient wishes to retain some independence such as continuing to dress or to cook for himself or herself.  While there is no specific guidance on the requisite distance or time to qualify for carer's allowance, there is a general list of tasks that each carer is expected to carry out.  Many carers go through the long application form which contains 69 questions only to be turned down at the final stage.  While I accept that each case is different, there should be clear criteria on the full-time care and attention rule in order that applicants know where they stand before they reply.  The Minister should also relax the criteria to allow carers qualify in cases in which they save the State a nursing home place or significant costs.  The essential question the deciding officer should ask is whether the care recipient would require nursing home care or significant professional assistance were he or she not receiving assistance from the applicant.  This is an important point.A person who goes from being a housewife to caring for an elderly relative is not awarded credits if she did not pay credits for the two years before making her claim.  This deprives carers of credits, which mainly affects them in the calculation of their pension.  This brings Members back to the issue noted by Deputy Stanton to the effect that averages are the scourge of many in respect of their pension qualification.  This is unfair, particularly to carers.  The Minister should ensure all such carers will be awarded credits and that all previous cases will be awarded with backdated credits.  He will state he hopes to deal with this in a forthcoming Green Paper on pensions.  However, it will not be published until March 2008 and one can only guess how long it will be before any concrete action is taken in this regard.Another point has been brought to my attention in the past few days concerning the manner in which many employers are taking on people on short-term employment contracts.  By so doing, they pay no PRSI contributions and the employees lose the benefit of PRSI contributions already paid in terms of dental health, etc.  This constitutes a major disadvantage for young employees who continue not to be covered.  Such employers have no payroll costs and make no tax returns for the employees concerned.  As the latter may choose not to declare their earnings, there is a potential loss of revenue and employment rights.  A contract leaves employees without any employment rights, including holiday, sick or bank holiday pay.  As temporary employees pay no PRSI, they build up no unemployment, redundancy or other benefits.  This is being used by employers to get themselves off the hook.  However, those who suffer ultimately are the employees, particularly young people.  This constitutes rolling backing the years and must be investigated and examined in order that people do not get away with avoiding the payment of PRSI.I wish to address the emasculation of the community welfare service.  While I know whose idea it was, I will not bother to reveal the name.  Now that the old health boards and, more recently, the HSE are off the pitch, where will the buffer be?  This transfer has been effected by stealth.  How will discretion and flexibility be protected when the referee owns the football?

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Yes.  The Labour Party is deeply alarmed by the Government's proposal to subsume the community welfare service into the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Labour Party Members strongly believe this service which caters for the most vulnerable in our society and which operates on the cutting edge of the link between health and poverty is best left exactly where it is, that is, within the health service.  If it is not broken, why will the Minister break it?  Is this little more than a carefully disguised cutback and attack on the vulnerable?As I predicted in the House two months ago, community welfare officers, CWOs, will be reined in and prevented from providing information, advice and advocacy for vulnerable persons and communities.  Consequently, the latter's most effective link to statutory health and personal social services will be effectively severed.  While the Minister claims that this cannot happen, it is possible because the people served by CWOs, including those with addictions, mental health problems, abuse victims and people with chronic social behavioural and psychological issues, are far more likely to access health and personal social services through community welfare than through formal channels.  This is because the possibility of discretionary community welfare payments provides an incentive and allows CWOs to make needs assessments and put such people in touch with appropriate health services.As Deputy Stanton noted, CWOs are much more than mere financial administrators and most adopt a holistic approach.  While a few may think they are the Minister for Finance, they are the exceptions, as 99.9% deal with issues in a highly positive manner.  If the proposed transfer goes ahead, the Government will be running an unacceptably high risk that the link between payments and access to health services will be severed over time, if not rapidly.  This is because the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be reluctant to fund functions for which it has no statutory responsibility.  Realistically, it cannot be expected to develop an interest in identifying or meeting health or personal social service needs in the way community welfare officers do.  They are not its responsibility.  It would be highly unlikely to continue to devote resources to functions for which it was not responsible.The Government's policy is based on the report of an interdepartmental review group, Core Functions of the Health Service Report, which recommended transfer.  I do not see any difficulty with the objective of focusing the HSE's resources, activities and core health functions.  However, the community welfare service performs a core health function.  It is a profound misunderstanding to characterise the service as limited administration with cash benefits through the social welfare assistance scheme.  The administration of the SWA scheme is a core part of the work of CWOs.  As the late Frank Cluskey stated when introducing the scheme in 1977, it was more than a mere cash response.  The service was deliberately placed within the community care structure and under the auspices of the Department of Health and Children with the intention of delivering a local response to individual needs and, crucially, providing its clients with access to a range of health and personal social services.  The importance of the relationship between income maintenance and effective health and personal social services, as well as a safety net separate from other social welfare payments, was clearly and specifically identified in the Dáil debates as what had led to the establishment of the service.These factors are as real and important today as when the scheme was first introduced.  We are concerned that the proposed transfer would inevitably mean an end to discretionary SWA payments which would have direct and damaging effects on a client's ability to access health services, even if this is not the intent.  It is hard to see how the discretionary element of payments could survive within the culture, structure and operational practices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  This not a criticism of the Department.  Rather, it is a recognition of a fundamental difference of approach.  CWOs can make immediate payments to meet identified needs within clear guidelines using discretion when required.  The Department administers entitlement based payments with a slower and more formal procedure which is not designed to respond rapidly to the urgent individual cases with which all public representatives are familiar.It seems ironic that the Government intends to implement this transfer at a time when funding was provided belatedly to implement the primary care strategy.  The community welfare service is a key component of that strategy which proposes an integrated team based approach involving interdisciplinary teams of health professionals in treatment and preventive care.  Other health professionals within primary care teams have acknowledged a need to involve CWOs and have, therefore, expressed concern about the proposed transfer which will make this more difficult.  Health professionals across the board also recognise the link between health and income maintenance and, therefore, highly value the contribution of discretionary SWA payments to positive health outcomes.The existing community welfare service performs a core health function.  The service works well and provides vital access to health services for the most vulnerable in our communities.  The proposal to transfer it involves substantial risk to the quality and integrity of the service and its contribution to the primary care strategy and approved health outcomes.  The Labour Party calls on the Minister to reverse the decision to transfer the service.  We support the view of the trade union representing CWOs that before any change in the service is proposed or implemented, we require a full study of the service and, as Deputy Stanton stated, wide consultation on the likely effect of changes with those who manage, deliver, use and interact with it.This measure will not be implemented until a commencement order is in place.  A commencement order needs 21 sitting days before becoming effective.  Therefore, it will not be implemented during the lifetime of the Government.  I was surprised the Minister brought it forward.  Someone must be buzzing at his ear.  He is a shrewd politician.  I give him that; he is able to smell the roses.  Someone must have persecuted him to include this in the Bill.  I could hazard a guess but will leave it at that.  I will tell him one thing.  We will not vote against much of what is included in the Bill because it is extremely positive.  However, we will vote against this measure and fight it tooth and nail.What the late Frank Cluskey introduced in the scheme was flexible, adaptable and allowed discretion.  Is the Minister prepared to guarantee the discretion vested in the community welfare scheme will remain when this falls within the remit of the Department?  Where will we find people at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. with intimate knowledge of the environment in which we all work and who are able to react rapidly to deal with an impending crisis?  Where will this happen?  Who will put it in place?  I have said enough on this and the Minister knows the Labour Party view.  Please God, no commencement order will be made and if we are returned to power, this will be another duck which will not fly.Deputy Stanton is correct to state the universality of child benefit was fractured by the habitual residency condition.  This is extremely regrettable.  Looking back, the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, told us about the great crisis of immigrants flooding the country but nothing could be further from the truth.  Very often the people flooding the country want to work.  Hundreds of Irish people are refused welfare benefits because a restriction introduced to prevent welfare tourism by immigrants applies to them.  More than 880 Irish nationals have been refused benefits such as unemployment assistance, one-parent family payment and old age pension.  It also affects returning Irish emigrants such as priests and other Irish nationals who were not here on a regular basis.  Figures from the Minister's study show the rationale for the continued use of the restrictions is no longer valid.  Migrant workers arrive in Ireland to work rather than to claim welfare benefit.  Migrant or any workers who experience exploitation should be allowed access to social protection, irrespective of nationality, length of time in the country or legal status.  We must ensure no more acts of exploitation such as what happened in GAMA occur.  This is extremely important.A young person was in contact with me regarding people being cut off from social welfare payments.  It is important that people are given due notice; it is not a matter of cutting off payments and then explaining why.  I raised the matter in the Dáil.  Surely people should be brought in and given an explanation as to why a particular payment is being terminated or what is the position.  The issue of unceremoniously stopping payments without prior explanation or warning must be addressed because it causes real hardship and stress for those living from week to week on a tiny income.  If an accusation of wrongdoing is made, it should be investigated and substantiated before the withdrawal of payment.  The person who contacted me felt the accused should be informed in writing of the allegation and given the opportunity to respond before any such draconian action is taken.  Surely this is the practice everywhere.  Why are the most vulnerable on the margins of society treated in such a way by a public service which purports to help them?  I felt extremely strongly about this case which involved the unannounced and unexplained suspension of a jobseeker's allowance.  It was sorted out afterwards but we want to ensure it does not happen.The Bill contains many provisions which the Labour Party supports, applauds and has fought for.  The disregard of 50% of additional income for rent supplement purposes emanated from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs which I am proud to chair.  It is an enlightened committee which brought forward a report on carers.  We indicated that social welfare recipients should not be denied because of the stupid rule that one could not receive a second social welfare payment.  It denied many, particularly widows and widowers who provided an important caring function within the home.  Often a husband or wife was caring for an elderly father or aunt.  Unfortunately, the husband might have died or been killed in an accident.  When he was alive, his wife was in receipt of carer's allowance.  However, as soon as he died, his wife, now in a vulnerable situation, lost not only the husband's wages but also lost carer's allowance because of this antiquated rule.I salute the Minister for bringing forward this provision and look forward to a constructive debate on Committee Stage.

Many of the proposals in the Bill come from that budget.  I stated at the time that we have had an opportunity over the past number of years resulting from the strong economy, etc., to lift children and their families out of poverty.  I note the Minister spoke of child poverty as an unacceptable blight on society, a view we would all share.The Minister and his Government have been in power for a number of years and have had the opportunity and resources to transform the lives of many people, particularly children.  They could have lifted such people out of poverty as there is now an extra €2 billion in the Exchequer, yet such resources are not used to that effect.With the wealth of this State over the past ten years came an unprecedented opportunity to create a more equal society and deliver a health and education system that the people deserve.  This Bill should also be taken in the context of UNICEF's latest report, which ranked Ireland 19th of 21 industrialised countries for its proportion of children who experience hardship.  Some 100,000 children in this State live in poverty, with 300,000 people living in consistent poverty.Statistics show that eradication of inequality has not been a priority for the Government.  The Minister may indicate it is being slowly eroded but why should this be so?  Why can the problem not be transformed overnight if resources are there?Like James Connolly, my party would have no sympathy with those who measure a nation's prosperity by the volume of wealth produced there instead of the distribution of that wealth among the population.  Although the Bill includes a welcome increase in child benefit, an important payment for tackling poverty, it is no longer universal and payment is discriminatory.  With the habitual residency condition in place, families which do not qualify and live a vulnerable existence — those in most need of many such payments — are negatively affected.This condition discriminates against families where parents are not permitted to work.  These include people awaiting decisions on their application for residency; those undocumented where employers fail to pay social insurance and tax; and people working in the State for less than two years who cannot show previous EU employment.  Many of these people, working in the black economy or the construction industry, do not have proof of employment.Although the Government has professed that tackling poverty is a major issue, it is now complicit in discriminating against certain children whose parents do not qualify for payments.  On one hand, the Government has claimed to be lifting children out of poverty but, on the other, it drives other children into poverty.  The Government has paid lip-service to ensuring that all children are equal but it is clear some are more equal than others.Article 26 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which the Government is a signatory, declares: "States Parties shall recognize for every child the right to benefit from social security, including social insurance, and shall take the necessary measures to achieve the full realization of this right in accordance with their national law."  My understanding is that the discriminatory practices of the Government are in direct contradiction of this statement.  This view is supported by the Free Legal Aid Centres' call for universal child benefit to be restored as a matter of urgency.A certain group of children should not be paying the price for immigration policy.  As FLAC rightly pointed out, with families in a variety of situations who cannot meet the habitual residency condition, being prevented from receiving child benefit can be the difference between having shoes or a warm coat for children or not having them.There has been much hype over the proposed referendum to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution but I pose the question of whether the Government wants to ensure the right of all children residing here to live free from poverty, another form of abuse.  If the Government does, it should once again make child benefit universal.I reiterate Sinn Féin's position on the guardians' payment.  The Government has refused to recognise the reality that many guardians are grandparents, aunts and uncles of children whose parents have succumbed to drug addiction.  Children are left in a state of limbo in that grandparents and extended families, often living on limited resources and low income, look after the welfare of the child while the State refuses payments due to the child because of unworkable criteria relating to parental abandonment.  Sinn Féin would increase the guardian payment to the level of foster care allowance while reforming the abandonment criteria for grandparents.  They would receive benefits even if they did not agree the child in question had been abandoned.Section 35 of the Bill deals with the rent supplement and I am aware proposals for reforming the one-parent family payment are ongoing.  It is recognised that the loss of rent supplement is proving a disincentive for those unemployed lone parents who take up employment.  Sinn Féin believes lone parents should be able to keep their rent supplement for at least the first three years of full-time work and continually if in part-time employment.  Any form of coercing lone parents into work is wrong.  Education, training and child care issues must be addressed as a priority for any reform of this payment.In a reply to a parliamentary question on 14 December last, the Minister proposed bringing forward enabling legislation to give effect to the transfer of community welfare officers and superintendents in time for the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007, with the transfer taking place as soon as possible thereafter.  No agreement has been made with the unions or members with regard to the transfer and community welfare officers are concerned they will be taken from disadvantaged communities, where they provide an invaluable service.  There are also fears their discretionary powers will be lost.  Will the Minister provide an update on the transfer as many people have been kept in the dark long enough?I welcome the enhancement of employees' rights, particularly with regard to entitlements to pensions.  However, current pension policy is neither equitable nor progressive, particularly as it is failing low-paid workers and women.  Irish pensions are paid at low rates compared to European norms and we must do more to keep retired workers out of poverty.  We should respect and appropriately reward contributions made by such people during their working lives by increasing pension rates to levels allowing not only income security, but a decent standard of living.The current public pension arrangements are also deficient in that they discriminate against women.  They generally tend to have lesser entitlements to contributory pensions because they are more likely to have less than complete social insurance records due to the time spent working in the home.  The home workers' disregard scheme is not a sufficient remedy.  The work of homemakers should not be devalued and should allow entitlement to contributory pensions for those involved.  The current system also prevents older women from enjoying economic independence.  It is Sinn Féin's view that unpaid work in the home is still work and women pensioners deserve equity.Sinn Féin is committed to an equitable pension policy based on social insurance and complemented by social assistance.  We wish to see all pensioners retired with financial security and dignity.  The welfare of pensioners, rather than the welfare of institutional or stock markettraders, should be at the heart of a pensions policy.I welcome the Minister's proposed changes but we should take them in the context of so many people out there who still live in poverty.  It is a missed opportunity because of the finances available to us.  Children in some of the poorest one-parent families will benefit from changes but not to the extent outlined by the Minister.  There must be a dedicated effort to approve high-quality child care throughout the State.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I am honoured and privileged to move the Second Reading of the Civil Unions Bill in my name and supported by the Labour Party.  I am proud to introduce this measure to the Dáil and to seek the support of Deputies of all parties and none for its enactment because it is a basic human rights measure.The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the recognition and legal registration of civil unions.  Civil union is defined as a conjugal status relationship "by virtue of which two persons of the same sex as each other receive the benefits and protections, and are subject to the responsibilities, of parties to a marriage".Many Irish citizens in stable long-term partnerships are denied legal recognition and the protections and rights of loving couples by virtue of their gender.  Irish society has progressed a long way.  Today, most citizens would have no difficulty in supporting the provisions of this Bill and taking this major step to ensuring legal equality for all Irish citizens.On my way into the House, I was handed the Government amendment.  Last week, I spoke to the Government and Progressive Democrats Whips and asked that, on the basis of my understanding of consensus on this issue, the Bill should be allowed to pass Second Stage and that if there was a difficulty with any provision, we could address it on Committee Stage.  The House could unite in a simple measure to advance equality, as we have done previously.  Quite frankly, I regard the amendment as little short of shameful because the Government does not have the guts to oppose the measure in the House.  Instead, it has tabled a reasoned amendment that passes the Bill notionally.  It states that the Bill will be read a second time in six months, knowing full well that this Dáil does not have six months——

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I will deal with the specifics of the reasoned amendment because I do not believe they are right or in accord with the shared opinion of Members on the Opposition Benches or the Colley report, which is cited in the amendment.Under the constitutional understanding of marriage and in accordance with current law, persons of the same sex cannot marry each other.  This Bill does not alter or seek to alter the current constitutional understanding of marriage.  Instead, it would create an equivalent status relationship for the benefit of persons of the same sex.  In simple terms, it provides that in most respects, the rules of law that apply to marriage will apply also to civil unions between persons of the same sex.Article 41.3.1° of the Constitution, which has often been examined recently, states: "The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack."  The Labour Party believes that the Bill does not offend against the provisions of that section since the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, caters for people who can marry.  The Bill is designed to cater for people who cannot marry under that constitutional definition and is in no way in competition with the definition.The Government amendment, circulated at the last minute, asks the House to note that "the terms of the Civil Unions Bill as presented appear to be inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution".  I want the Minister who will respond to the debate to tell me where the inconsistency can be found because it is not my legal advice or the conclusions of the Colley report that such an enactment would have any constitutional infirmity.This is the first time that a Bill on the legal recognition of same sex relationships has been debated in the House, but I wish to acknowledge an initiative by Senator Norris in the other House when he sought to advance this issue.  No doubt there are some who regard this measure as controversial or unacceptable.  The Government does not have the guts to argue that, but it will defeat the measure by its actions none the less.I am long enough a Deputy to remember the debate on contraception, which was controversial and emotive.  In my first month as Minister for Health, I was pleased to introduce the reforming contraceptive Bill.  A decade on, we wonder what all the fuss was about.  In similar terms, I remember the debate surrounding the legal recognition of divorce championed by my colleague, the then Minister, Mervyn Taylor.  It is interesting to see a recent opinion poll showing that if the question, which was carried by a squeak, were put to the people today, 75% would vote in favour.  Doomsayers' dire warnings of the end of marriage and an assault on communities did not come to pass.  The institution of marriage has proven more resilient than they feared.  This Bill or one like it will soon become law and we will again look back and wonder what the fuss was about.Let me set out the details of the Bill.  We propose that the general law as to capacity to enter a civil union should be the same as capacity to marry, that is, with similar restrictions as to age, the validity of an existing union or marriage, mental incapacity or closeness of blood relationship.  We make legal provisions for the notification, solemnisation and registration of a civil union by the same people and in the same way as marriage, mirroring the provisions in the Civil Registration Act 2004.  We provide that where a religious registered solemniser has a conscientious objection to presiding, he or she will not be required to preside.  This does not apply to civil registrars, but many church men and women are registered solemnisers of marriage under thelaw.The Bill deals with the benefits and responsibilities of parties to a civil union.  The essential purpose is to provide that parties are entitled to the same rights, privileges and benefits and are subject to the same obligations as those that apply to spouses in a marriage.  In particular, the Bill provides that parties to a civil union are responsible for the support of each other to the same degree and in the same manner as is provided by law for married persons.  We propose that the rights and obligations of parties to a civil union with respect to a dependent child be the same as those of a married couple with respect to such children.The Bill deals with issues such as pre-nuptial agreements, the recognition of foreign civil unions, civil union break-up and other related issues, as detailed in the Schedule.In general, the Bill applies the various aspects of existing family law to civil union relationships.  One area of particular focus is the issue of adoption.  The Labour Party felt that this Bill should be as comprehensive as possible and we carefully examined this matter.  Our examination led us to propose a general amendment to the law of adoption.  We set out for the first time in law basic principles or criteria to govern adoption in this State.  These principles would have general application in all adoption cases.The subsection provides that, in any decision on or relating to an application to adopt a child, due regard shall be had to the principle that the first and paramount consideration is the best interests and welfare of the child throughout his or her life.We set out in some detail the child focused criteria that we proposed should be applied to all adoption cases, including the child's ascertainable wishes and feelings regarding the decision considered in the light of his or her age and capacity to understand their particular needs; the likely effect on the child, throughout his or her life, of having ceased to be a member of the original family and to have become an adopted person; the likely effect on the child, throughout his or her life, of having become an adopted child of the person or persons who applied to adopt him or her; the child's age, sex, religion or religious background, national origin, cultural and linguistic background and any other relevant characteristics; any harm which the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering; the relationship the child has with relatives and with any other relevant person, including the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and the value to the child of its doing so; the ability and willingness of any of the child's relatives, or of any such person, to provide him or her with a secure environment in which to develop and otherwise have his or her needs met; the wishes and feelings of any of the child's relatives, or of any such person, regarding him or her; and, finally, the child's right to know the identity of his or her parents and, as far as practicable, to be brought up by his or her parents, each of them or by other family members.All of that in the judgment of the Labour Party makes eminent good sense in any adoption procedure.  The simple provision is that nobody has the right to adopt a child, but a child has a right to be adopted in the most nourishing, healthy, supportive environment objectively decided upon in his or her interest.  That legal provision, which some have found controversial, is in accordance with the child welfare amendment published yesterday by the Government and proposed by the Taoiseach, as repeated today in the House, to be inserted into the Constitution.  The new Government-sponsored constitutional amendment, which mirrors our legal provision, will insert a new subsection 42(A)4 into the Constitution as follows:Provision may be made by law that in proceedings before any court concerning the adoption, guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the court shall endeavour to secure the best interests of the child.Our objective mirrors and parallels that set out by the Taoiseach and the Government in its constitutional form, which obviously will have an even more robust legal basis than the mere statute we propose to enact here.  In essence, our proposal, which can hardly be considered controversial in any way, is that in any adoption case the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child.The Bill makes provision for similar recognition in terms of existing practices and regulations for same sex cohabiting couples as for cohabiting couples of different gender.  There has been debate and expert consideration of these matters in recent months.  Most recently, the Colley working group on domestic partnership provided thoughtful and useful advice to all of us as legislators.  The Labour Party Bill has been informed by the Colley conclusions.  The Colley proposals are in stark contrast to the Government amendment tabled tonight.What Ms Anne Colley and her group recommended, as she said, was that full civil partnership for same sex couples in contrast with opposite sex couples was viewed by the group as a distinct institution, separate from and not competing with marriage.  The group believed that full civil partnership for same sex couples did not suffer the same constitutional vulnerability as full civil partnership for opposite sex couples.She went on to say that introducing a full civil partnership scheme in Ireland would achieve equivalence in this area with Northern Ireland, where the Civil Partnership Act has been in force since December 2005.  The essence of what she said is in stark contrast to the gobbledegook presented by the Government in its amendment tonight, where it wishes to re-entangle the issue of giving statutory rights to cohabiting couples of opposite gender and to put that into the mix of same sex unions.That is constitutionally fraught because if equivalence is given to cohabiting couples as to married couples — where each member can marry if he or she wishes — then the institution of marriage is being attacked.  That is what Colley said.  However, by giving legal recognition to same sex couples who cannot constitutionally marry, no injury is done to the concept of marriage, which is unique under the Constitution, as currently defined, to opposite sex couples.  That is a basic fact which Colley recognised and it has informed our proposals.  It runs absolutely counter to the gobbledegook put forward in the Government amendment to the motion.I have said the Government amendment is shameful because a good number of people — I thought the Taoiseach and Tánaiste were among them — believe the time is now right.  Consequent to the very thoughtful proposals of the Colley group, we shall deal separately with the cohabiting issue, because it is a separate matter and is more constitutionally fraught than this one.  That is the legal advice available to us.  The Colley working group quoted the Taoiseach in its report.  It is worth putting on the record what he said, which was so much vaunted in the Colley report and welcomed by people who sought to have equality under the law.Our sexual orientation is not an incidental attribute.  It is an essential part of who and what we are.  All citizens, regardless of sexual orientation, stand equal in the eyes of the law.  Sexual orientation cannot, and must not, be the basis of a second-class citizenship.  Our laws have changed, and will continue to change to reflect this principle.That is the end of an empty quote, because it is meaningless in the context of the amendment the Government has tabled to the Bill.  I genuinely find it is shameful of the Government to actually attempt to present support for this measure.  For those who do not understand it, the procedure postpones the Second Reading of the Civil Union Bill for six months.  In the normal course of events, we need do nothing more than wait six months and the Bill is deemed to have passed.  However, the Government knows full well that six months from now this Dáil will have expired and under the Standing Orders of the House the Bill automatically falls.  It is a shameful betrayal of the words of the Taoiseach.  I want him and the members of the Government who will respond to this debate to explain how our proposals are unconstitutional, why they want to re-entangle the issue of cohabitation with recognition of civil union of same sex couples and why they want to wait for Supreme Court and other decisions before moving to enact legislation which is long overdue.I regard this Bill as a seminal equality issue.  I challenge all Members of the House to support it in principle.  If there are difficulties in the detail, let us deal with them, but let us give full equal citizenship to all citizens of this country, so that they are cherished and respected under the law.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I thank the Acting Chairman.The Labour Party has a long and proud tradition of advancing social and personal freedom.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Howlin, on introducing this Bill and giving all politicians in this House an opportunity to debate it and to cast their vote in favour or against it tomorrow evening.It is difficult for those born after 1980 to sometimes recall that there were once severe discriminations against women, particularly married women, children born outside marriage and gay people, who were criminalised up to 1993 when a Fianna Fáil-Labour Government decriminalised homosexual acts between consenting adults.  Severe discrimination existed on the right of access to contraception, which was addressed by both Deputy Howlin, as Minister for Health, and by his predecessor, the then Minister, Barry Desmond.  The right to civil divorce was piloted through by the rainbow Government of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left and by the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor.  How much damage was done in all those years of discrimination against people in all sorts of circumstances?  When the law was changed, Ireland became a better place, not a perfect place but a better place, particularly for those people who suffered those myriad discriminations.This Bill proposed by the Labour Party follows that tradition, which is to allow recognition and registration of civil unions between same sex couples.  I understand that the President of Poland, a state visitor to our country, made derogatory comments today about gay people and culture being a threat to the survival of the human race.  That is regrettable in the context of the contribution gay people have made not only to the culture, literature and music of Poland, but in general to many aspects of life in the past and to life today.In many ways Bills such as this one attempt to rebut crass and gross discrimination to ensure people can walk tall and live their own lives in harmony as their sexual orientation dictates.  As a State, we should encourage stable, long-term, enduring and loving relationships by granting them status and recognition.  As a State, we have done that up to now in regard to the family and marriage and recognised it in a particular way.  It is appropriate that we now extend that by way of this legislation.I look forward to the day when we see people celebrating same sex unions in the company of their friends and their families, as we have seen in other jurisdictions in recent years.  Countries are generally better where personal happiness, liberty and freedom are exercised.At present, a gay couple finds it difficult to secure recognition of status in terms of next of kin.  I am particularly aware of loving, long-term gay relationships where one partner becomes ill and the other has no legal status as next of kin, often up to the moment of death.  That is particularly distressing and painful.  Similarly, in respect of shared assets, such as a home, where one partner dies, particularly where the deceased partner has died without making a will, the surviving partner in a gay relationship may not only be bereft but could be effectively destitute and homeless.I reiterate that this Labour Party Bill seeks to create an equivalent status relationship for the benefit of persons who are of the same sex.  It provides that in most respects the rules of law applying to marriage will also apply to civil unions.  Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution states: "The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage ..." This Bill seeks to create a parallel situation for those who cannot marry under our Constitution and, therefore, the provisions of the Bill run parallel to marriage rather than in competition with it.  The Bill seeks to assimilate the general law as to the capacity to enter a civil union with capacity to marry.  The law as to notification, solemnisation and registration of a civil union under this Bill will be similar to the law applicable to marriage and Part 6 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 will apply accordingly.As my colleague, Deputy Howlin, said, this Bill also introduces a number of reforms of adoption law, basically taking into account various elements of the universal declaration on the rights of the child, namely, the right of a child to know his or her family and for the rights of the child to be foremost in legislation relating to children.  Some Members of this House may be uncomfortable and even opposed to the notion that approximately 50,000 people have been adopted since adoption law was introduced here in early 1950s.  The Official Report of that debate in the late 1940s and early 1950s, if anybody cares to check it, reveals that a considerable number of Members of the Dáil and Seanad objected to children gaining a right to be adopted into a family on the grounds that they followed the reservations of the Roman Catholic Church, which were stated repeatedly from 1930s onwards and which reflected the notion of the fear of a stranger's child entering a family and thereby acquiring inheritance rights.I do not believe that any Member of this House or of the Seanad today would object in terms of the stringent objections to the notion of adoption made in the 1930s to 1950s.  We must to bear in mind that life moves on and it is our job, as a Legislature, to reflect the society in which we live and to offer people the freedom to enter into civil relationships and to have their relationships publicly acknowledged and celebrated by themselves, their families and friends.

I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Howlin, on introducing this measure.  This is an historic occasion for the Dáil as it is the first time such a measure has been brought before this House.  If it is passed and eventually becomes law, it will represent a significant step towards the provision of full equality for gay and lesbian citizens and particularly for those in same sex relationships.The Labour Party is proud of its record in showing political leadership on equality issues since the foundation of the State.  It was Barry Desmond and Deputy Howlin who introduced legislation that provided for the easier availability of contraceptives, thus enabling couples to plan their families and reduce the number of crisis pregnancies.  The Labour Party in Government provided the impetus for the legislation that decriminalised homosexual activity between consenting adults.Indeed, it was ten years ago this month that the constitutional referendum, piloted by the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, went before the people and was passed — albeit by a very narrow majority.  People will recall that during the referendum campaign there were all sorts of scare stories put about that the introduction of divorce would lead to the collapse of marriage as an institution and the disintegration of the family. "Hello divorce, Goodbye Daddy" was one of the milder slogans touted at the time.  We were told the courts would be clogged up dealing with endless disputes that would make huge amounts of money for lawyers.  In fact we can see from statistics released this week that nine out of ten cases of divorce or judicial separation are settled before ever going to court.Divorce was a social change that many people feared, but it did not damage marriage or the family.  There are those who genuinely believe that what we are proposing would also damage marriage and the family.  I believe these fears are groundless.This Bill is about extending basic civil rights to couples in long-term stable relationships who currently enjoy few rights or entitlements under the law. If one person in a same sex relationship falls seriously ill, the partner has no legal standing.  If one person in a same sex relationship dies, the partner has no entitlement to inheritance.  Same sex couples do not enjoy the same rights or entitlements regarding tax or social welfare.  Our Bill seeks to create an equivalent status relationship to marriage for the benefit of people who are of the same sex.  It provides that, in most respects, the rule of law applying to marriage will also apply to civil unions.  Those who enter into a civil union will essentially have the same rights, but also the same obligations as those who are married.Despite the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste both having made sympathetic noises, and despite the publication in November 2006 of the report of the committee on domestic relationships, chaired by Anne Colley, the Government has failed to honour commitments to bring forward legislation to give legal recognition to same sex unions.  When asked about the issue in June 2006 by the leader of the Labour Party, the Taoiseach said he certainly would not rule out the possibility that we could at least start, if not complete, a legislative process over the winter.Having failed to deliver on their own commitments, I hope the Government parties will at least withdraw their amendment and allow this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage, where the complex issues involved can be teased out in much more detail.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I commend my colleague, Deputy Howlin, on introducing this Bill.  I am very proud to be a member of the Labour Party tonight.  This Bill should have been introduced many years ago.  Having governed for ten years, it is shameful that the equality agenda has not been advanced in any way at all by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party.I am absolutely amazed at the amendment that has been proposed by the Government.  It is the biggest political fudge I have seen in a long time and the most misleading amendment one could make to any proposal.  It is dishonest.  It effectively states that it accepts the need for legislative reform for the recognition of civil partnerships to enable persons who are cohabiting in relationships of mutual dependency to make fair and reasonable provision for each other, and for other persons dependent on them and in their dealings with other persons.  This sounds great.  However, the amendment suggests that this may be unconstitutional, although our legal advisers clarified that it is not.  The amendment then postpones the Second Reading of the Civil Unions Bill 2006 for six months.  The Minister, who has just arrived in the House, knows perfectly well that this Bill will fall if that happens.This amendment effectively misleads the House.  Since the Ceann Comhairle often tells us that we are not allowed to mislead the House, he should rule against this amendment as that is what it does.

It represents a complete failure of political courage.  The Progressive Democrats Party once had a proud liberal tradition and we often heard fine speeches in the past on its liberal credentials.  However, it seems to have completely subsumed itself into Fianna Fáil on these issues.Fianna Fáil also seems to have squeezed out anybody who had a bit of political courage on such issues.  I am particularly thinking of the former Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who had the courage in 1993 to take a step forward on this issue, when Fianna Fáil was in Government with the Labour Party.  Since my party has been out of power, virtually nothing has been done on the equality agenda.  The Minister who has just arrived in the House is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  However, he rarely describes himself as such.  He is now described as the Minister for Justice by the media, as if equality and law reform simply did not exist.  In effect, it does not exist for this Government and it is about time it was put back on the political agenda.  That is what the Labour Party is seeking to do tonight.I am extremely disappointed that the Government has not accepted the Bill.  If the Minister and his colleagues have problems with aspects of it, there is full provision to amend the Bill on Committee Stage and on Report Stage.  We do not claim to have all the wisdom on this issue, but we would like to see progress.  The Colley committee made these recommendations and drew a distinction between marriage in the Constitution and the kind of civil rights we are proposing to provide this evening.  This matter of civil rights is a core issue for the Labour Party, because we believe in a rights-based agenda.  We believe in policies and in legislation that are about equal rights for citizens.  Gay and lesbian people do not have equal civil rights when it comes to taxation, social welfare, inheritance and sensitive areas such as health.  We are trying to put these rights on the Statute Book this evening.I would like to refer to our colleague in the Seanad, Senator Norris.  I am a member of the all-party committee on the Constitution.  Senator Norris came to that committee and presented his own legislative proposals.  He addressed the committee, which contains representatives of the Government parties, and there was a general view held by committee members that we should forward the agenda of equal civil rights for gay people.  That appeared to be the position of the Government parties, as the committee is chaired by a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  Yet the Government cannot come into this House tonight and provide for those civil rights.We had an argument before about divorce and the tiny majority that passed the referendum.  However, it was accepted into the normal legislative proceedings.  It did not damage marriage and did not harm people who did not need or want divorce.  I have no doubt that if the Government were to sign our Bill into law, it would make no material difference to marriage in this State.This is simply a failure of political courage and a failure to address these important human rights issues.  They need to be addressed urgently because this agenda is being put on the back burner until the after the general election.  That means that it will take some time to bring this issue forward.  The Government could allow this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.  It could allow a full debate on the Bill in this House and in the Seanad.  It could enact the Bill so that all citizens in this State could have equal rights.This Bill is about legal rights, but it is also about the culture of our country and how accepting and all-embracing we are of all our citizens.  There have been some awful incidents of homophobic bullying in schools and in other places.  If we fudge issues of this nature, we will make it more difficult to protect people from such activity.  The message we will send out will be that we are not yet prepared to embrace equality for all our citizens in this area.  I am very proud tonight to be part of the Labour Party, which is proposing this legislation.  I find it shameful that the Government is not willing to allow the Bill a Second Reading.

To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"That Dáil Éireann:Affirms that any legislative reform in this area must be fully consistent with the provisions of the Constitution and in particular the State's constitutional duty to protect with special care the institution of marriage; andaccepts the need for legislative reform for the recognition of civil partnerships to enable persons who are cohabiting in relationships of mutual dependency to make fair and reasonable provision for each other and for other persons dependent on them and in their dealings with other persons; andnotes that the terms of the Civil Unions Bill 2006 are confined to conjugal relationships between persons of the same sex;welcomes the Reports of the Working Group on Domestic Partnership chaired by Anne Colley and the Law Reform Commission Report on Rights and Duties of Cohabitants as valuable studies of the options for legislative reform in this area; andagrees with the Government's stated position that a proposal to amend the Constitution so as to qualify that duty at this time would be unnecessarily divisive and counter-productive; andnotes that the terms of the Civil Unions Bill 2006 as presented appear to be inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution; andregards it as prudent to await the determination by the Supreme Court of an appeal now pending before that Court in relation to the issue of recognition by the State of same-sex marriages contracted in foreign jurisdictions before legislating in this area; andmindful of the desirability of legislating in this area in such a manner as to attract the greatest degree of social consensus; andaccepting that the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform is currently considering an approach based on a comprehensive legislative response to the foregoing issues,postpones the Second Reading of the Civil Unions Bill 2006 for 6 months.".I thank Deputy Howlin for introducing this Private Members' Bill for the consideration of the House.  The Government is not voting against the Bill.  Instead, it is proposing that the House should postpone the Second Reading for six months, with a view to enabling a more comprehensive approach to the question of civil partnerships to be adopted by the House.

A significant development in our constitutional jurisprudence will inevitably arise from the Supreme Court's decision on the Zappone appeal.  As increasing numbers of people in Irish society reside in domestic arrangements which are not founded on marriage and do not conform to constitutional or traditional family forms, the Government wants to deliver a framework in which all non-married couples, including gay couples, can live in a supportive and a secure legal environment.  This entails addressing the real life situations people choose for themselves.  The Government considers that legislative reform should provide protection for people in such situations on an equal basis with other relationships of mutual dependency.

A constitutional amendment to qualify the status of marriage to accommodate gay and lesbian relationships would, in the view of the Government, be highly unlikely to succeed.  If such an amendment were attempted, it could be very counterproductive in terms of achieving social consensus on this issue.  The Government is unequivocally in favour of treating gay and lesbian people as full and equal citizens in society.  It is complex and challenging to give effect to this principle in legislation by providing for civil partnerships, as it involves thinking about a host of related matters.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the courageous men and women who have campaigned for many years to achieve equality for gay and lesbian people.  From the dark days of prejudice, a new tolerance has emerged, based on our appreciation of the fact that homosexual people are in every respect entitled to be equally valued as members of society and not to be relegated to an inferior status.  That is what republicanism is all about.

Far from considering gay and lesbian orientation as a mere attribute, we are beginning to understand that sexual orientation is central to the character and identity of the individual and must be seen in that light.  I often consider the life of Dr. Alan Turing as a parable for our time.  As many people in the House know, Dr. Turing was a brilliant mathematician and a pioneer of computer science.  He was also gay.  In the course of the Second World War his brilliance was probably one of the key factors in the defeat of the Nazi war machine.  At Bletchley Park, he cracked the innermost secrets of the Nazis with his brilliant and inventive code breaking and mathematical work.

Having been excluded from his life's work because of his homosexuality, he was driven to suicide in June 1954.  His life and his history teach us how wrong it is to treat gay men in such a way.  When we hear homophobic comments, we should remember the martyrdom of Dr. Turing, who helped to save civilisation for all of us.

The comprehensive Employment Equality Act 1998, which outlaws discrimination on nine distinct grounds, including sexual orientation, deals with discrimination in work related areas from vocational training to access to employment.  The Act, which was introduced by the current Government, relates to employment conditions in general.  The Equal Status Act 2000, which provides protection for the first time against discrimination outside the field of employment, complements the 1998 Act and covers the same nine grounds.  The Act, which gives those who are discriminated against a statutory means of redress, has a broad-ranging scope, covering the provision of goods and services, the disposal of premises, accommodation, education and registered clubs.  Ireland remains one of the few European countries to specifically outlaw discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation in relation to access to goods and services.  That legislation was introduced by this Government.  When the Labour Party was in government, it produced a Bill that collapsed because it was found to be unconstitutional.

The Health Insurance (Amendment) 2001 deals with the question of how health insurance is provided to members of the community.

That was another step forward that was taken by this Government, rather than the Labour Party.  The decision to allow gay couples to take force majeure leave delivered on the commitment in the 2002 programme for Government to strengthen the parental leave scheme in accordance with the recommendations of the social partners.  Such important incremental improvements provide clear evidence of the Government’s ongoing commitment to achieving greater fairness in the law relating to cohabiting couples, regardless of whether they are same sex or opposite sex.  In continuing this policy, the Government has ordered a root and branch review of all statutory and non-statutory schemes under the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure they do not have any unanticipated negative impact on those who are protected under the nine grounds of discrimination which are set out in our equality legislation.In addition to legislative changes, this Government has expressed its commitment to full equality in society for gay and lesbian people in a number of other practical ways.  The Government has undertaken initiatives to foster informed public debate on issues of concern to gay, lesbian and bisexual people, including the legal recognition, rights and duties of cohabitants.  In 2002, in response to a commitment by the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the NESF undertook a study to identify barriers and opportunities to implementing policies to promote equality for gay, lesbian and bisexual people.  This study was based on consultations held with representatives of the relevant community and voluntary sector organisations, notably LGB groups and women's organisations, employer and trade union interests and representatives from Departments and State agencies.My Department is funding a post of liaison policy and equality implementation officer in the gay and lesbian equality network, GLEN, under a well-known three year programme.  The Department of Health and Children has funded Gay HIV Strategies, a programme operated by GLEN to combat HIV infection among gay men.  The Department of Education and Science funds projects managed by Belong To, a youth group for gays and lesbians.This Government has not been standing still on the question of full equality for gay and lesbian people.  Among the next steps is the extension of legal recognition to gay couples and other couples in domestic relationships.  The suggestion that we are hypocritical and have done nothing is wholly untrue.  The reality is that nothing was done by the previous Government and everything that has been done has been done in the lifetime of this Government.  This should not be forgotten.  Every single last thing by way of progress——

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	442	A political consensus is emerging towards legislating in this area, hence this debate tonight.  This mirrors an emerging international trend to provide enhanced rights and recognition to cohabitants and particularly to same-sex cohabiting couples.  However, there is no uniform international approach to statutory recognition and protection for same-sex civil unions.  A small number of jurisdictions have opened up marriage to same-sex couples while more have provided civil registration schemes either confined to same-sex couples or available also to opposite-sex couples.In legislating in this area, each country is faced with its own unique set of complex political, legal and social circumstances.  In this jurisdiction we are now facing into this complex environment.  In the UK, the Civil Partnership Act 2004 provides for registration of exclusively same-sex civil partnerships in an institution broadly equivalent to marriage.  The UK Act runs to 264 sections and 30 schedules in order to extend the appropriate legislative provisions on spouses to encompass same-sex couples.  Deputy Howlin's Bill attempts to replicate this 264 sections scheme in ten short sections.The Civil Unions Bill would be unlikely to survive a constitutional challenge and the Government cannot therefore support it in its current state.  The Bill falls short of being a suitable model to provide for the civil registration of same-sex relationships.  It is drafted in such a way that it would be unlikely to withstand constitutional challenge and in particular it offends against Article 41.3.1° of the Constitution which obliges the State to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded and to protect it against attack.The Bill purports to ascribe to the same-sex partners all the rights and obligations of marriage, with some minor exceptions.  The advice consistently available to the Government is that a law which equates non-marital relationships to marriage for all purposes could not survive constitutional challenge.  I said this in the Seanad when Senator Norris moved his Bill which was broadly similar.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	444	The Bill is also premature because it would clearly be unwise to attempt to provide a statutory scheme equivalent to marriage for same-sex couples until the Supreme Court appeal on the recognition of a foreign same-sex marriage has been decided.  I look to section 5 of this Bill which would purport to decide the issue before the Supreme Court in the Zappone case and I do not believe it is appropriate that we should attempt to do so.  If the Supreme Court is to uphold the High Court and rule that it would be unconstitutional to recognise foreign marriages in this way, section 5 of this Bill would fall flat on its face.  I suggest we wait for the Supreme Court decision in the Zappone case so that we know what we can do.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The Government fully accepts that same-sex couples and other unmarried cohabiting couples require heightened legal protection.  Many cohabiting couples share property, home life and income, and want to care for one another, to be next-of-kin to each other and to be cared for in that context and to have legal rights to do so.  While it is open to couples to regulate at least some aspects of their relationship by means of contract, this is a route which relatively few couples currently take.  Against this backdrop it is desirable to provide legislative safeguards with mutually enforceable rights and obligations, but if we do so, we must do so in a manner which is consistent with the requirements of the Constitution.As a society, we must give thorough consideration to what course we can and should follow in this sensitive and complex area.  We must be clear on what it is we are trying to achieve.  Do we wish to provide specific rights to cohabiting couples and confer the protection of the law on those rights?  If so, what rights do we wish to give, and how do we confer them?The House will be aware that I established a widely representative working group under the chairmanship of Anne Colley to report on the various options on domestic partnership.  The options paper was published in November 2006 and in the following month, December 2006, the Law Reform Commission report on rights and duties of cohabitants became available.  These two reports are very valuable pieces of work which are currently being considered in my Department and legislative proposals are being drafted.  The commission considers it appropriate to have a tiered approach which incorporates each of these models, status and registration type models.  It recommends the use of a contract model and a redress model as the basis for reform in addressing the rights and duties of cohabitants.The Law Reform Commission report left aside registration on the basis that the working group on domestic partnership was considering this along with a range of other options.  The options paper describes some such schemes in detail.  Both the options paper and the Law Reform Commission report correctly note that if an opt-in registration scheme was made available, the needs of cohabiting couples who choose not to register or marry would not be addressed unless other modes of protection were put in place.  This Bill fails to address that point.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	448	Legislative reform in this area might then include a civil registration scheme alongside the contract and redress models recommended in the Law Reform Commission report.  The working group and the Law Reform Commission suggest that such an approach would allow cohabitants either to opt-in to a set of rights and duties towards each other and attain a formal and public status or make a contract, while a failure to do either of these would trigger the availability of a redress scheme.Extending State recognition and the protection of the law to partnerships between persons who decide to create a relationship of mutual dependence between themselves, whether that relationship is heterosexual, homosexual or non-sexual, is qualitatively different from providing a status equivalent to and attracting the same rights and entitlements as conventional marriage.  Up to now, marriage has been defined as a status based on a male-female monogamous relationship for the duration of the life of the marriage.  While the case law on the issue has been conclusive to date, there is the outstanding appeal to the Supreme Court in the Zappone case.I do not consider it appropriate to address the issue in a piecemeal fashion, as this Bill would have us do.  It is an insufficient response to attempt to provide a direct equivalent to marriage for same-sex couples and deem the matter to be dealt with.  Our response, not just as a Government but as a society, should be coherent and well thought-out.  It must take into account the wide range of differing cohabitation and family models.I wish to take this opportunity to restate that the Government is unequivocally in favour of treating gay and lesbian people as fully equal citizens in our society.  Our legislative record shows that we have put in place a comprehensive framework of equality legislation, backed by a strong equality infrastructure, to ensure people cannot be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation.  I have previously stated that not all same-sex couples will necessarily want an institution which only and mandatorily gives them all the rights, entitlements and duties of marriage, just as not all cohabiting opposite-sex couples would want to be in that position.  That would be to give them all duck or no dinner — there is no choice.  They either take on all the incidents of marriage or get no recognition for their relationship.  Most people want a choice on these matters.  They do not want just to be told that they will have all duck or no dinner, and that is it.

Of course I acknowledge that many same-sex couples seek full equal status with opposite-sex couples by having the option of marriage extended to them.  I respect that ambition but legislative reform is possible only to the extent permitted by the Constitution.On the question of constitutional reform — I want this point made as a different impression was created earlier — the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution did not favour an amendment to the constitutional definition of the family.  In facing the strategic decision as to whether to change the definition of the family to extend constitutional protection to all forms of family life, the Oireachtas committee took the view that such an amendment would cause deep and long-lasting division and would not be passed by a majority.  The Taoiseach has accepted this point of view and I also believe it is the correct assessment.  If we were to go down the road of proposing change that required constitutional reform, and that constitutional debate was begun and lost, the cause of equality would be set back for years.  That is something for which I must take responsibility.  I cannot just simply posture on the subject.

My view is that it is beneficial for those in cohabiting relationships, and for society, to provide a legal framework of recognition and protection for unmarried cohabitation.  People who are heterosexual and in cohabitation must have some protection.  This Bill offers them nothing.  If offers people in long-term relationships with no sexual dimension nothing whatsoever with regard to conferring next-of-kin rights on each other. 
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	476	It does not purport to do so.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	477	An opposite-sex couple may want to stay outside the legal marital relationship but may nevertheless want to create some mutually enforceable rights and obligations in their dealings with each other and with society in general.  On the other hand, as the law stands, gay and lesbian couples are excluded from marriage and cannot make a full legal and social commitment to each other.  Just like opposite-sex couples, many gay and lesbian couples may want to create mutually enforceable rights and obligations towards each other and to be recognised within society.There is also the case of cohabitants where there is no sexual dimension to the relationship.  Such relationships are often accompanied by social and economic interdependences for the people involved.  Fairness demands that the rights of people in these relationships need to be considered.  For example, in the case of two elderly people who have been sharing a house for life, as matters stand, neither of them can confer on the other next-of-kin rights in the case of death or even in regard to hospital visitation.There are many complex issues involved in creating legal recognition and protection for cohabiting couples.  Rather than pretend the Bill is the way forward, which it certainly is not as it says nothing to cohabiting heterosexual couples——

It turns its back on the concept of civil partnership and states that there should be only civil unions for gay and lesbian people, and then deals with the matter in what I believe is an unconstitutional way.

It is far better to put in place a decent law, even if it takes six months and even if, after the general election, the Dáil has to put it back on the Order Paper and get on with the matter.

Gay and lesbian people who do not want that get nothing under the Bill.  If a person does not sign up to the full marital relationship, he or she does not get anything — no help with next of kin, no help with ownership of property and no help with anything else.  The Labour Party can posture and grandstand and try to pretend to the gay and lesbian community that this Bill is the answer to its problems, but it is not.  It is badly thought out, lazy and inadequate.  What I am doing and what I have consistently tried to do in my Department is to produce good quality legislation which advances matters.  That is what I am doing.

I had one thing in mind, namely, that having listened to Deputy Howlin, I would put on the record the difficulties and problems with his Bill, but Deputy Howlin has constantly interrupted me.  The truth is that in five years the Labour Party did nothing.  The Government, however, has done a hell of a lot.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The Labour Party has challenged us all this evening.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I am prepared to rise to that challenge.  Fine Gael believes in the general principle put forward by the Bill, particularly the statutory provision for a civil alternative for those who do not wish or who cannot marry for one reason or another.  This is not surprising, in the context that the Fine Gael Party was the first political party in the State — four years ago — to produce a major policy document on the concept of civil partnership.I support in principle the Bill put forward by Deputy Howlin.  I do not accept every provision in the Bill and wish to put down a marker with regard to one provision in particular.  I do not agree with section 8 of the Bill which would allow couples who have entered into a civil union under the legislation to adopt in Ireland.  I say this in the context that adoption rights did not form part of the Fine Gael document.  At the time, it was felt that adoption was a complex area that warranted further detailed study.Including the issue of adoption in the context of the Labour Party Bill muddies the water somewhat.  The issue of adoption still requires further analysis and should not be provided for in the Bill, but we can deal with that.  As Deputy Howlin said, we have a procedure in the House whereby when one does not agree with all aspects of a Bill, one can put forward a Committee Stage amendment.  I would be quite happy to do that in this case.  While one may not accept every provision of the Bill, it would be more beneficial to immediately allow all cohabiting couples to avail of the rights specified and then revisit separate issues such as adoption.As far as Fine Gael is concerned, I am not here to say "me too".  However, the point made with regard to same sex couples and opposite sex couples was well made.  There is a case for a Bill that makes civil union available to both same sex and opposite sex couples.  Again, this is an issue that could be considered on Committee Stage.  I accept that some people may say it is an attack on marriage or that others will say it is not fair or equal to have discrimination, as it were, in favour of same sex couples, but it is an issue that could be dealt with on Committee Stage.I cannot accept the Government attitude in the area of policy.  There are controversial issues, but let us face them.  We have a parliamentary process for so doing.  If one does not agree with all the aspects of particular legislation, one can table a Committee Stage amendment and deal with it in that manner.  Why then does the Minister tell us we should put the issue off, effectively sine die?  He suggests six months, beyond the life of the current Parliament, when he will be out of office and have no further responsibility in the matter.  We will find a suitable replacement.One line of the Minister's speech stands out.  He said he wanted to take this opportunity to restate that the Government is unequivocally in favour of treating gay people as full, equal citizens in our society.  How can that be squared with kicking the Bill to touch and not confronting the issues raised in the Bill?Some people who make submissions think politicians take no notice of their submissions.  When looking into the background of the Bill, I looked at the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and was struck by a submission made by the gay caucus which asked the question: Gay people, who are they?  The response was: "Gay people are your sons, daughters, sisters, brothers, cousins, nephews, nieces, uncles, aunts and even spouses; they are your co-workers, friends, neighbours and co-siblings".We are talking about all these people, but why do we continue to treat them differently?  Why do we not take this chance to confront the issues and give them the kind of rights set out four years ago in a policy document by Fine Gael and which the Labour Party is now attempting to cope with in legislative form?The gay caucus submission pointed out that while law can seem cold and abstract, it has consequences for real flesh and blood people.  The consequences for cohabiting gay people are that they pay higher income tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty, inheritance and gift tax.  Their non-Irish spouse cannot easily work or live in Ireland.  They may face discrimination in pension benefits.  In cases of domestic violence they are less protected by the law because they cannot claim barring orders under the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  They may not be recognised as next-of-kin if their partner is hospitalised.  The partner of a deceased gay person will have no entitlement equivalent to that of a spouse to a share in the estate of the deceased person and so on.  The submission finished with three words: "Is this fair?"Is the answer we are giving from the Dáil tonight, that we are not prepared to confront the issues and not prepared to make an honest attempt to try to put in shape a process that would deal with the obvious discrimination in our society?  This is the reason that, while I do not support all aspects of the Bill, I suggest we should all support it in principle.  Let us refer it to Committee Stage and try to work out an acceptable format that will get all-party consent, or if that is not possible that we will end with legislation that will end this disgraceful discrimination.The Minister referred to speaking in the Seanad on the issue, but if I remember correctly, he adopted the same attitude there.  That was two years ago when Senator Norris introduced a Bill along similar lines.  In passing, I compliment Senator Norris on having done so much for the cause of equality.  At the time of that Bill, the Minister again kicked for touch, but nothing has been produced in the meantime.The Minister said he wanted to await the report of the all-party committee on the matter.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution reported and recommended that legislation could extend to such couples a broad range of marriage-like privileges without any need to amend the Constitution.  The all-party committee has, therefore, stated there is an open door as far as the Constitution is concerned.  We can deal with the issue without a constitutional amendment.  Why do we not deal with it?The Law Reform Commission also reported on the issue and produced an excellent report on the rights and duties of cohabitants.  The working group set up within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has given its view too.  As usual, we have heard positive noises from the Taoiseach, but that is about as far as he goes from the point of view of achieving anything.  Over two years ago the Taoiseach stated, "These people who are in relationships which are not illegal, they are not immoral, they are not improper, they say: "We want more equality and we want to be treated fairer"."  I agree with that, and it is what this Bill envisages.  However, the Taoiseach and Ministers have refused it in the House, suggesting instead that we postpone consideration once more.  It is reminiscent of St. Augustine, who asked God to make him pure, but not yet.  Why do we not confront the issues, even if they are controversial?  Why do we not make an honest attempt to deal with them?  That is my main criticism of the Government.The Tánaiste has said that the Dáil should pass legal reforms that formally recognise those who have entered into a civil partnership with each other, regardless of their sexuality, and allow the surviving half of such partnerships to acquire next-of-kin status.  Why do we not do that?  What is holding up the process?  Why is this disgraceful discrimination allowed to continue?  Anyone can die intestate after being hit by a bus, and anyone thus affected could suffer disgraceful discrimination tomorrow or at any time unless we are prepared to confront the issues.That is where I fault the Government, since no legislation has been produced to address the sorts of issues touched on in that submission.  There have been many promises, announcements and noises, but just as with so many other areas, nothing has followed.Fine Gael has no difficulty confronting such issues, since it does not pretend to have the answer to every problem.  However, we made an honest effort to introduce proposals four years ago.  We are also prepared to participate with others in attempts to reach a broader consensus on such issues.  This Bill has taken on board many of the principles of Fine Gael policy.  When we published it, we did so in the teeth of great opposition.  However, we were ahead of our time, and it is now clear that a broad view exists that such issues should be tackled.  Last year an opinion poll showed that 84% of people believed that same-sex couples should be given some form of legal recognition.  The public wants it, as do the Labour Party and Fine Gael, so why do we not go ahead and do it?  Over half of those surveyed believed that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry.  Some 33% favoured civil partnerships and, above all, only one in ten said that there should be no legal recognition of same-sex relationships.  However, if we do as the Government wishes regarding this Bill, that is what will happen, since the current situation will continue indefinitely, sine die.  That is what the Government proposes.Let us recall what we are discussing and what we must do.  If a partner dies intestate, the surviving partner should be entitled to his or her entire estate and not be liable to inheritance tax.  Why do we not provide for what applies in a marriage?  As far as next of kin are concerned, a civil partnership would bestow such status on a registered partner.  Then there is the issue of pensions.  In the event of the death of a registered partner, the surviving party would be entitled to benefit from pension provisions in the same way as married couples under the same State or private scheme.Taxation was touched on in the submission that I quoted.  I support the equivalent of the married tax-free allowance and mortgage allowance being conferred on registered couples.  For the purposes of social welfare benefits, registered couples would be considered adult dependants and assessed according to their joint income.  It is of relevance in the context of workplace entitlements.  Registered partners should be entitled to compassionate leave from their employers in the event of serious illness or the death of their partner along the same lines as married couples.  It is almost universal practice nowadays that new homes are bought in the names of both partners.  The Family Home Protection Act 1976 should be widened to include registered couples.Those are the basic tenets of Fine Gael policy and, almost in its entirety, that of the Labour Party, which also covers those provisions.  Differences can be ironed out, and that is why the Government should change its approach between now and tomorrow evening.  It may not accept everything in the Bill, just as I do not accept everything, as I have made clear.  However, on the broad approach and the need to take legislative action and grant recognition, let us agree in principle.  The purpose of the Second Stage of any Bill is to agree broad principles, while the Committee Stage irons out differences on individual aspects.  The proper approach would be to allow this Bill through and let us confront the issues, including controversial ones, in detail on Committee Stage.  Let us iron out our differences but not kick the issue into touch once again.The Government amendment has pointed out constitutional vulnerability, but that can be overcome.  I accept that any Bill must comply as far as possible with the Constitution.  However, that can be achieved.  Let us work together on it and try to ensure that the outcome is a Bill that is not vulnerable to constitutional challenge.  The Government contention is that this Bill could be vulnerable, and I suspect that it might be true regarding adoption, although I am not in favour of that provision.  Where there are difficulties, let us do what is constitutionally possible and leave aside aspects that might give rise to constitutional challenge.  That is the practical approach that I suggest on behalf of Fine Gael.I do not say that from a political perspective.  It might not be the most important issue in my rural constituency of west Cork, but it affects everyone, and where there is inequality, injustice and unfairness, it affects all parts of the country.  Surely the least that we can do as legislators in such circumstances is make an honest effort to confront that.  As a party that aims to take a lead role in the next Government, Fine Gael is determined to implement an agenda of reform and fairness, and not only as a gesture to the Gallery.  We do not simply want to please lobbyists.  We want a change that will remove the injustice and inequality that I have mentioned.  Of course we will not do anything that will go down in flames in the Supreme Court, as suggested by the Minister.Before concluding, I will make a last plea.  We all realise that there is a problem that affects every part of the country and supporters of every political party.  Let each of them rise to the challenge very properly laid down by the Labour Party.  Let us try to find a way to overcome this disgraceful discrimination, unfairness and injustice.  The way to do so is to allow the Second Stage of the Bill to pass.  Let us go to the committee and try to iron out the details and produce a consensus acceptable to all parties.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	522	Will the Minister for Social and Family Affairs be present for this debate or will one of the Ministers in attendance be present?  I will continue in any case.The second social welfare Bill after any budget is traditionally less significant in terms of its cost to the State.  Its provisions in any given year incur a cost of some €260 million.  Given that the budget of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is now €14.5 billion, the Government could argue that we already dealt with a large proportion of the social welfare budget in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act 2006.  The Bill under discussion affords us an opportunity to examine the principles that underlie social welfare policy and to challenge the Government on the general direction thereof since the last election.  As we are now entering the end of an election cycle, this is as good an opportunity as any to challenge the Government's credentials as a caring and giving Government.There is no doubt that social welfare provision over recent years has increased enormously but it must be asked whether the opportunity has been taken to institute the reforms required in many areas.  As spokesperson for my party, I argue it has not, which view is shared outside the House.  The opportunity was not taken because of a timid approach to making the changes required to bring the social welfare system into the 21st century.  Unfortunately we still have too many vestiges of the Victorian notion of "the poor" in the Irish social welfare system.  Acts such as the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act 2006 and the consolidation legislation passed over recent years presented an opportunity to put our social welfare policy ahead of that of many more enlightened European countries.  The Scandinavian model, in particular, is one to follow.This Bill is an attempt to remove or at least ameliorate some of the anomalies in our social welfare system, which is to be welcomed.  The section in Part 2 dealing with the technical amendment to the definition of "volunteer development worker" is welcomed by my party and others throughout the House.  Irish citizens who did foreign aid work found themselves unable to claim employment and PRSI entitlements as a consequence of their having been abroad.  This anomaly could and should have been addressed before now but the proposal to do so now is to be welcomed.A large proportion of the costs incurred through this Bill arise from the child benefit increase, which, given the scale of Government munificence in every area, particularly in terms of tax reliefs, seems a bit low.  The €10 increase this year allows the Government to meet a promise it made on child benefit payments two years ago.  Given the inflation since then, a case could be made that the increase is lower than what it should be.  The rate is now over 5% and increasing.  Whoever has the privilege of delivering the next budget will need to reconsider this matter.The Government could argue that the introduction of the child care payment has provided an additional source of income for many but the real debate on the child-centred payments should focus on their universality.  The Government has already chosen to tackle one element of it in that all children who are born in this country are no longer entitled to receive such a payment.  This is a negative decision.  It will probably carry no electoral consequences but it was morally wrong.We see the consequences of such decisions in international surveys.  Ireland ranked very poorly in a recent UNICEF study of children in the developed world.  Twenty-one of the richest countries in the world were ranked in terms of children's standards of living in terms, affluence and access to services, and it is no source of pride that Ireland came 19th, followed only by the United Kingdom and the United States.  It is sad that Ireland regards the social services template of the United Kingdom and the United States as one to adopt.  If we really aspire to being a caring nation, we need to decouple ourselves from this form of benchmarking as quickly as possible.  I hope that the Government presiding over the 30th Dáil will follow a very different line.The measures the Bill introduces regarding illness, maternity, adoptive and jobseeker's benefits are small but they are welcome in their own right.  More significant changes are made in terms of the qualification of adults for certain schemes, including the qualified adult direct payment.  This is where the debate needs to be headed in terms of future social welfare provision.  That Ireland is the most means-tested nation in Europe and certainly in the OECD region in terms of social welfare payments warrants change.  That so many are defined as "dependent adults" within our social welfare system implies that the system is crying out for reform.Citizens of this State should be entitled to a guaranteed income because of their being citizens and the contributions they have made throughout their lives.  This is not the case for so many citizens, particularly women who have chosen to work within the home and who have not been formally employed throughout their working lives.  These women have made an important contribution to society and economy but this is still not recognised in our social welfare code.  Until we start tackling such issues, the pensions proposals in the Bill, made by political parties that seem to make up provisions as they go along, will not even be close to those required.Let me address the old age pension peripherally.  It is more a matter for the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill considered immediately after the budget because it is mainly a question of qualified dependants.  The Irish State pension is 33% of the average income while the EU average is 60% of the average income and there is thus a great discrepancy between the two.  The magic numbers mentioned by certain political parties in recent weeks, bringing the pension from what had been lower than £100 in 2002 to over €200 this year, and the promise of those parties to increase it to €300 if afforded another term in Government, do not secure the income maintenance levels that are needed.  If we are to come close to achieving the European average pension in terms of our gross national product, we should be increasing the State pensions by at least €25 per year for the next 15 years.  The Pensions Board estimates that State pensions need to be increased to 40% of gross average industrial earnings, while Age Concern seeks to have the level set at 50% by 2016, only nine years away, yet despite all the boasts of this Government, the current level is only 33% of average income.The real nature of this Bill has little relevance to financial contributions but a number of areas deserve particular consideration.  With regard to carer's allowance, the principle of a second payment is being relaxed, so if someone is in receipt of a social welfare payment, the Department is prepared to allow a half payment of the allowance in recognition of the special circumstances which carers can face.  However, this relaxation of what was a cardinal rule in the social welfare code will only be applied after a means test, even though the Irish social welfare system already has a higher prevalence of means testing any other European country.  Many of the people concerned are receiving maximum social welfare payments that when added to the carers allowance would still not come within means testing criteria.  Someone has decided that means tests must be applied across the board but what level of administrative waste is incurred from a rule of this nature?  If someone is in receipt of a State payment to which a half level can be added, there is no likelihood that a means test will be failed.  The only use for a means test would be in circumstances where a third payment may be involved because of an occupational pension, so I would like this provision to be relaxed.With regard to the supplementary welfare allowance, I adamantly oppose the decision to transfer community welfare officers directly to the Department and I will use every opportunity available to me on Committee and Report Stages to amend this flawed provision.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2007.  I commend the Minister on the progress he has made in his Department.  He has proved himself to be a socially conscious Minister who has the welfare of people close at heart.  I recognise that competing interests exist in the Cabinet and it can be a fraught task to come to the table with continuous demands but the people who are deemed less well off need someone to advance their case.  In the Minister, they have a friend who understands them and who is prepared to put taxpayers' money where his mouth is.However, much remains to be done in terms of meeting the benchmark of making sure everybody is entitled to a basic standard of living.  Those approaching their golden years deserve decent pensions and a sense of security.  In an era of great prosperity, we should provide for the future by setting benchmarks for pension provision.  The Minister has attempted to focus attention on that issue and it behoves Opposition Members to take him seriously rather than play politics.  The consequences for elderly citizens of not acting responsibly will be too awful to contemplate.  I welcome the publication of a Green Paper on pensions and hope it will stimulate debate.The claim that older people have free travel is a fallacy.  Those who live in Dublin or other urban areas with public transport have free travel.  However, those in rural areas, such as my constituency of Galway East, do not have access to public transport and so cannot avail of free travel.  This is one of the most glaring examples of discrimination against elderly rural people that I can instance.  This Government has made political capital from the free travel scheme and only last week it announced the expansion of free travel on an all-island basis.  Such claims, however, are drivel because elderly people in rural Ireland do not have free travel.  It is easy for those living in Dublin to board public transport in the morning with a packed lunch and spend the day being ferried around the city.  Compare that to an elderly rural person who is theoretically entitled to the same free transport scheme but cannot avail of it because of the lack of public transport in rural areas.  It is time the Government stopped practising this discrimination against older people in rural Ireland.  It should not be beyond the intelligence of Ministers or their officials to devise a scheme that ensures older people can avail of their entitlement to free transport.  However, every time I raise the matter with Ministers, I get the same nauseating responses.  They claim the rural transport initiative is being operated on a pilot basis but that they want to make statutory provision for it and that a further study has been carried out in that regard.  However, nothing is happening.The Government should immediately introduce a voucher system for elderly people in rural areas which would allow them to avail of their free transport entitlements by hiring taxis or hackneys.  These vouchers would not entitle people to pack lunches and spend their days sightseeing but it would enable them to go to the nearest town to collect their pensions or do their weekly shopping.  The discrimination against elderly rural dwellers should no longer be defended by loose talk about rural transport.  These people have also contributed to the development of Ireland and are entitled to the same benefits as everybody else.Unfortunately, I face no shortage of material when speaking about discrimination against older people in rural areas.  Another example of such discrimination is the refuse collection services for older people in Galway East.  Refuse collection in County Galway has been privatised, with the result that pensioners and others on low incomes cannot avail of waivers to their charges.  However, pensioners in Galway city can avail of waivers because Galway City Council provides the collection service there.  I have repeatedly asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to introduce a universal refuse waiver system for certain categories of people but he has shown no interest in ending this discrimination.  Devising a waiver system should not be rocket science and if there was a will on the part of the Minister, a way could be found.  It should be possible to implement a waiver system on a universal basis whereby waste operators, be they public or private, can pass on applications to the relevant local authority for assessment.  The cost of such a scheme could be met by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.While the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has no responsibility for refuse collection, he is responsible for people on low incomes and pensioners.  I ask him to use his influence with his Government colleagues to address immediately this discrimination against older rural residents and introduce a universal refuse waiver system as a matter of urgency.

In that context, when I first became interested in politics, social welfare debates in this House were cutting edge affairs.  The Visitors Gallery used to be full and people used to lobby intensely in the weeks before legislation was passed or the budget in respect of social welfare increases.  I make this point because it is important not to lose sight of the fact that increased social welfare payments are still integral parts of many people's lives.  This debate is taking place in the context of the Celtic tiger and the job opportunities available for many.  However, a large percentage of the population still depend on social welfare payments such as unemployment assistance, invalidity payments or the old age pension.  Members should always focus on that fact.  While they consider the relative percentages of those unemployed and those in the workplace, it is still an accepted fact that large numbers are dependent on social welfare.In the past ten years the Government has made great strides in trying to address poverty on behalf of those who are disadvantaged and in receipt of social welfare payments.  This must also be acknowledged.  It is important to place such efforts in the context of what the Government and Irish society in general are trying to achieve.  I refer to social welfare increases, job creation, tax reduction and creating opportunities for all.  What constitutes an opportunity to an elderly person living alone in a local authority house?  Does Irish society genuinely understand the needs of such individuals?  In general, it does so.  All political parties and trade union movements accept that the vulnerable in society must receive the greatest care.I do not accept the argument that a particular political party has a right-wing or left-wing philosophy.  In general, Irish politics and communities are cohesive.  Consequently, I welcome announcements and commitments to the effect that social welfare forms an integral part of the manner in which the challenges ahead will be addressed.  As a Fianna Fáil Member, I am very proud of how in the past ten years the party has fulfilled its commitments in respect of the old age pension.  In 1997 Fianna Fáil promised to increase it to £100, while in 2002 it stated it would increase it to €200.  Not only has the party achieved that target, it has exceeded it.This constitutes an acknowledgement that the Government, as well as Fianna Fáil as a political party, are highly conscious of the needs of the elderly.  In addition, the Government has recently introduced some highly innovative schemes which I believe to have been an important factor.  However, Members should not conclude that they have achieved everything that is necessary to ensure the elderly are well looked after.  I make this point because they are probably the most silent and most resilient people in our society.  Although they do not protest and probably vote along traditional lines, they are the people who made the sacrifices in previous years when times were difficult.  They were probably obliged to work with a single income coming into their households at a time when rearing many children and high unemployment were the order of the day.  Job opportunities were not readily available.  In my constituency the mother in a family often worked and reared the children because men found it very difficult to find work in the 1980s and early 1990s.These issues should be placed in the context of our aspirations for society.  In general, while our achievements should be recognised, Members should not pat themselves on the back or assert that all the fundamental issues in respect of the elderly have been addressed.  There is still social exclusion which extends to an inability to interact or socialise.  The issue of transport was referred to by Deputy McHugh.  These are all real and tangible challenges that must be faced by the Government and society when trying to address the outstanding obstacles confronting older people.One of the most fundamental issues at stake in this regard pertains to demographic change.  The challenges ahead in addressing older people's needs will be of greater importance.  In this debate Members have been discussing issues such as social welfare increases, pensions, grant aid for the elderly and rural bus initiatives.  In future pressures in respect of these issues will be brought increasingly to bear on Governments as they formulate policy.  I welcome any debate that sets out parameters or opens up public consciousness as to what is required for older people.  We have only encountered the tip of the iceberg in terms of what must be done.Members have encountered the lack of care for elderly persons in nursing homes, as well as difficulties regarding policing such institutions and ensuring they are up to the required standard.  As the Government and society move forward, they acknowledge past deficiencies.  However, Members should note that, as the population ages because of demographic factors, such challenges will become even greater.  Consequently, it is important to conduct a solid and open debate on what Members are trying to achieve.  Is it simply social welfare payments for the sake of providing extra money or are they genuinely committed to ensuring older people will play an active and positive role in both society and the economy?I welcome the debate on retirement ages.  For example, the State spends thousands of euro on Garda Síochána recruitment.  Although Garda numbers were increased to 14,000, a mandatory retirement age for Garda members was maintained.  I wonder sometimes why an active person, with considerable experience of up to 35 years working in the Garda Síochána, must retire at a certain age.  Members do not expect a person of 60 years of age to be as nimble on his or her feet as would be a recruit coming out of the Garda College in Templemore.  At the same time, however, forcing a person to retire at a certain stage constitutes a huge loss to the Garda Síochána and society in general.  Why can such members of the Garda who have a wealth of experience not be used for training purposes, advocacy in courts or presenting cases on behalf of the State?  Why can they not be used in community associations and groups or in interacting as community liaison officers?  Such challenges must be discussed if Members are serious about ensuring older people will be both cared for from the perspective of financial security and will consider themselves to be active participants in society.While I will discuss the issue of child care later, I must declare a vested interest as I have a 15 month old daughter.  Recently I read projections suggesting the average lifespan of a girl born today in the western world could rise to 100 years.  While this will pose enormous challenges in the future, in the interim our society must begin to address all such potential challenges and acknowledge that at present we do not do our older people justice in the sense that although many of them have a significant role to play, we do not allow it.In respect of housing policies, many local authorities provide sheltered housing for the elderly.  They may consider some areas of a city to be appropriate for the elderly, while housing lone parents with large families in other districts, thereby breaking down societal bonds.  It will be important to adopt a cohesive approach to housing and the manner in which our communities will be structured.  I raise this point because I am sure that most Members, especially those who represent large urban areas, will agree.  For example, a young girl who may have one or two children applies to the local authority for a house.  Eventually she is allocated one and shipped off to some far-flung part of the city, with the result that the supports provided by her parents and grandparents are suddenly cut adrift.  It will be important to adopt a flexible approach to housing and ensure older people are part and parcel of providing child rearing assistance.  They are amenable and can pass on their expertise to the younger generation.  These ideas sound far-flung but being a community means passing on experience, accepting responsibilities and then passing those responsibilities on to other people.  Young people acknowledge the work and commitment of older people and, in turn, look after them in their latter days.We can become extremely rigid and say we will provide a €200 social welfare payment per week to older people which should be sufficient.  We can make a commitment to raise it by so many euro per year for the next five years.  However, to make the lives of older people holistic and valued, we must address this issue.  On one side of the scale we discuss child care, but we must also examine this issue on the other side.Overall, social welfare increases must be acknowledged in the context of where we stand.  There is no doubt that fewer people are dependent on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit not only in real terms, but also as a percentage of the number of those in work.  It is realistic to assume that, even though we now have less people percentage wise on unemployment assistance, they feel more alienated than they did when a large number of people were on social welfare payments, particularly unemployment assistance.We must also consider young men who drifted through school, perhaps with psychological problems, alcohol abuse problems, drug addiction or without a solid family support service which we assume exists.  These young people drifted out of national school and perhaps dabbled in secondary school for a little while.  They are isolated from what is the norm in society at present, which is having a job and opportunities.They felt more at home in times past when many more of their peers were unemployed and had fewer opportunities.  As their peers move on and become more successful, those people become more alienated.  We have a great deal to do.  Statistics show suicide is an issue among young males.  One must ask why, when so many opportunities, challenges and supports exist, young people find they cannot continue in life.I say all of this because we have the resources, commitments and abilities to solve many problems.  If one stated 20 years ago that we would solve the problems of emigration and unemployment, people would have scoffed and stated it was another empty political rhetorical promise.  Those issues have been addressed.  However, we must acknowledge the residual problems such as young males feeling completely isolated.One can understand the context.  Young lads go to school, they grow up and their friends move on, embrace opportunities and perhaps have more supports around them.  The young male feels completely at sea and isolated in the context of what is happening around him.  Often, we have the tragedy of suicide, which is an ongoing epidemic in our communities and we must address it.Many people have debated the pros and cons of child benefit.  Many people ask where does the money paid towards rearing a child go.  In some communities it is called "make up money".  We have a universal obligation to ensure no child is at risk.  However, equally and as importantly, is it fair and reasonable that those with huge resources available to them as families are entitled to the same amount of money per week as a child who is born into challenging circumstances?We must debate this in Parliament, society and, as a member of Fianna Fáil, in my party.  Are we willing to continue funding universal child benefit?  We must consider and examine this issue.  We must be realistic about whether child benefit goes directly to offsetting the costs of rearing a child and providing child care facilities and services for the child or whether it is used to purchase an apartment in Florida.No matter how affluent a society is, one must ask whether it is fundamentally right and fair.  As individuals and political parties it is easier to say nothing.  I believe as times change resources may not be as readily available as they are now.  We may have to cut our cloth according to different measures in times ahead.  This could cause major financial strains and the people who will suffer most are those who have least.  I genuinely believe we must examine this issue.I welcome the increases in child benefit to date, including the once-off payment and early childhood supplement.  Just like on the issue of compulsory pensions, we should have a mature debate on this matter as a national Parliament.  We should not play Mickey Mouse politics with a genuine issue which could create major problems and, more importantly, make our communities and society more divided and less cohesive.We must be under no illusion that certain individuals are quite capable and competent and have the financial resources and wherewithal from an early stage to get on the ladder and make meaningful progress.  Others do not have such opportunities because of where they are born or the circumstances into which they are born.  However, the same supports are given to every child.  We must discuss this in a mature, calm and rational manner.  Often, when it comes to these issues, rational debate goes out the window.We must also welcome developments in maternity benefit.  One states a society can be judged on how it cares for its elderly.  Equally importantly, a society can be judged on how it cares for expectant mothers and families with a newborn child.  During the past number of years we had major changes in the make up of our workforce with the entry of a large number of women.  In this context, how do we cater for child rearing?It is important to acknowledge the need for flexibility on how a family deems it appropriate to rear a child.  Initially the mother will be on maternity leave and the father may take paternity leave.  We must become even more flexible in the workplace.  Many large private companies and institutions such as banks and insurance companies must become more adaptable in how they view their employees and how their manage their affairs in the context of child rearing.The changes in maternity leave and maternity benefit are progressive.  However, we should acknowledge we still have room for manoeuvre.  A person may be able to work one or two days a week and need two or three days off, or vice versa.  Large companies, other than the Civil Service and the public service, do not seem to have grasped the idea of jobsharing, flexibility in the workplace and part-time work.  We must also consider this in the context of maternity and paternity leave.Regarding a matter I recently raised on an Adjournment Debate, in the context of what we want to achieve as a European country, if we are to discuss social welfare payments we must also discuss embracing immigrants.  We must have a mature, calm and rational debate on this issue.  I proposed a forum on immigration where people with views on the matter, including employers, employees, groups representing immigrant communities, education providers, trade unions and the churches could come together for a calm, rational and intelligent debate as a mature society.We should be under no illusions that we have often had scaremongering on the immigration issue, with talk about masses of people coming here and wholesale abuse of the system.  Our people are embracing and welcoming people here, both those in the work force and those in need.  It is time we sat down for a mature, calm, rational and intelligent debate on all these issues.  We should formulate public policy and opinion rather than putting our head in the sand and denying that some elements of our society have views contrary to the norm.  This is an aside but in the context of social welfare we have all heard rumours of social welfare cheques buying cars and paying for holidays etc.  There is a slightly sinister undercurrent to this about which I am concerned.I commend the Bill in general and wish it the best of luck.  Many of the proposed changes will have a real impact on people's lives.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I am delighted to be given the opportunity to comment on the Bill.  Many people seem to forget elements when speaking about social welfare and naturally enough, if I was on the Government side I would probably do what Government Deputies normally do, praise the Minister and speak of the good deeds done.  There have been some good deeds and as I have been in this House a while, I fully appreciate that some matters are better than they used to be.I wish to pose two or three questions before we run away with ourselves.  We have fancy new names for welfare payments, such as the jobseeker's allowance, but we will stick to the old terms for a moment.  Most disability payments, give or take a few euro, are €185 a week, which a person gets if he or she is unable to work or runs out of work and is unable to find a job.  That amount would not bring a person too far in this day and age.  Michéal Ó Muircheartaigh would talk about a game of two halves but we have a nation of two halves in many ways.  I know people who would have no trouble spending €185 in one evening and would not find it unusual.  It might be spent on a meal for two or three people.  That would only be for one evening in the week but there are seven long days in the week for people on disability benefit.There was a fair bit of hype around the country after the last budget.  The approximate €200 for old-age pensioners is certainly better than €180, but to take it in the context of modern-day costs, I doubt old-age pensioners on the non-contributory pension, for example, are that much better off than they were four or five years ago, relatively speaking.  The electorate knows this.   When most people sat back and did the sums on their expenses, it was not as big an issue as it was many years ago.  Whatever way the Government conducts its internal polls, there was probably no great bounce despite the talk of bringing the old-age pension to €200.  There was a good reason for this.  As every day goes by, with inflation at almost 5%, the cost of foodstuffs is rising dramatically.  These are products people have to buy, such as the basic wheat products like bread or cereal products like corn flakes.  This does not take into account the ESB and gas costs.  These are daily items which elderly people must buy along with everybody else.  An elderly person must feed him or herself and keep warm.If we expect, as the years go by, that the majority of the elderly are likely to accept that level of pension after putting in sterling service to the State, I can assure the Government of what will happen and what I see happening around the country.  I take my cap off to active retirement groups and similar bodies, which are better organised than ever.  They are making a significant argument that there must be a comprehensive review of these issues.  Many old-age pensioners believed what they heard on budget day but even at this stage, a couple of months later, they think they were short-changed and will so find it difficult to live.  People tell me this.  I would like to go into many aspects of the matter if the time was available but I assume time will beat me.Every stratum in society has problems.  We all know the real difficulties associated with the cost of child care and in buying a new home.  The elderly are in no position to put up a fight where it counts, however.  I am glad to see age action organisations forming part of the social pillar and I hope their say at that level of consultation with Government will increase as years go by.A hermit might live on €50 or €100 per week and people who were in the work force in jobs that were not very well-paid might receive a contributory pension.  If such people do not have a private pension they could be in serious trouble.  They might have to run a car, naturally, and they may need a small holiday somewhere.  It is against such a background we must judge the €200 or €209 per week, and one can immediately see a significant problem.  We must figure out what level of pension a person can reasonably live on in comfort.For many years we were not in a position to do much about pensions because the resources were not available, no matter which party was in Government.  We are currently in a good position as the economy is going extremely well.  More and more people are employed and we can only hope the trend will continue for many years to come.  Leading from this a tranche of people are emerging as "the retired".  These are not the people with a "yuppie" lifestyle of three continental holidays and two cars parked outside the door, and I am not into that at all.  People at that stage of life, around age 66, also have another great anxiety.  If they are unlucky enough to become ill and must go to a nursing home, €200 per week will be of little use.Only in a thriving economy can one do certain things.  As Deputy Kelleher said rightly, a nation's moral fibre is judged on how it looks after its sick and elderly.  Irrespective of who is in Government, people will expect more than we have been able to give them in recent years.  We have reached a stage where that is their right because the level of pensions paid here compared to the levels in many EU countries is low.  There are several ways in which to measure the levels, such as wages and GDP, but we are down the ladder.  Many people say it was a great day when we were able to give our old age pensioners €200, but this is the reason for the lack of jubilation for this measure around the country.  Any Government would have seen it as a milestone, but there are many problems.  Due to the significant increase in costs of living, we must watch this issue during the coming years.I wish to refer to a number of issues.  The question of where to put community welfare officers arose ten or 15 years ago.  I spoke on this matter in the House a long time ago when an effort was made to shunt the officers back into the Department of Social Welfare and Family Affairs.  They are heading for that Department again, but I do not know why.  One could argue that what the officers do is closely related to what the HSE should be doing or, alternatively, what the Department of Social and Family Affairs should be doing.  Those of us at the coalface know what the officers do.  Wherever they end up, it is important that they be allowed the flexibility that is unique to them.I understand the officers do not like the change, but I get my views from the people they serve, not them.  Many people tell me that the officers, above all others in the community, have an absolute grasp of the family situations with which they are presented, which is important.  It is like the local garda on the beat.  Some official must know almost everyone with whom he or she deals.  One could argue that if the officers were located in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, they would still know the people in question, but this would only be the case were their job specifications to remain unchanged.  The evidence indicates that those specifications will be changed and the officers will not have their current degree of flexibility.We must accept that in any situation involving social welfare, it is important for people paid by the State to be in a position to wear two hats simultaneously.  We must ensure we pay the benefits to those entitled to them only, which is a normal concept.  We hope no one will draw benefits to which they are not entitled.  However, we must have a "fire brigade" system, as is usually the case, of community welfare officers with the flexibility, authority and wherewithal to help people in utter distress.  If something happens at 4.50 p.m. on a Friday evening, such as ordinary social welfare payments not turning up, and one rings a Department of Social and Family Affairs office expecting its staff to do something to help during the next 48 hours, one might as well ring St. Peter in heaven.  The situation is different with community welfare officers, who are in situ, available and contactable.  We should never do away with people on the ground with the authority and knowledge to implement the rules.  Until someone convinces me that the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be better in this regard than the HSE, the system should remain as it is.A number of considerable anomalies have often been mentioned on the floor of the House.  With all of the changes made to the various social welfare codes, it is strange that we have been able to achieve real progress.  I will put on the record of the House a number of cases replicated across the country and that I hear of in every county I visit and at my clinics.  Take the case of a person who was employed for three weeks in 1964 and had his or her contributions paid and recorded, but was then self-employed until 1989.  Upon applying for his or her contributory old age pension, the method of calculation, which has been around for time immemorial, involves taking the date from which he or she first worked until the date he or she last worked.  The number of contributions credited is divided by the number of years.  In this case, there were only eight contributions per year.  If someone was able to pull a leaf for the three stamps with which he or she was first credited in the 1960s, he or she would be in receipt of a full old age contributory pensions.We must maintain the integrity of the contribution, as it would be unfair to those who make contributions throughout their lives if someone got a full pension on fewer contributions.  I am arguing for a case to be made to disregard some of the years during which no stamps were given.  If it was simple, it would have been done many years ago, but it is time to bite the bullet.  People are being overpenalised.  I do not have time to go into the ins and outs.A cohort of people in rural Ireland, mostly farmers, were over 56 years of age on the day in 1988 that the Minister's colleague, Deputy Woods, introduced the self-employed pension.  It was not their fault they were born outside that date.  It meant they could not have the requisite ten years fully paid up by the time they reached 66 in order to be entitled to the full, or any, pension.  A number of small changes were made, but we are at the point where there is a tranche of people who are not entitled to anything.Worst of all is the situation where a self-employed person gets the old age contributory pension, but his wife is not entitled to anything because they own property.  In other words they have means and that does not allow the adult dependant's allowance to be paid.  Imagine the slur and the insult that represents to a woman after working all her life.  She is entitled to no pension in her own right.  It is not right, nor can it be, and I hope when the Green Paper on pensions is published this will be addressed because it is highly unfair.

However, it is important to do one's duty and I was very anxious to contribute to this debate.  On a sad note I went to Mass this evening because this is the 25th anniversary of the shooting dead of Garda Pat Reynolds.This is an important debate, and listening carefully to the contributions from across the floor of the House, the Opposition is getting close to admitting that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, is doing his job.  He is certainly revolutionising the Department and carrying the torch passed on by his predecessors, as even Deputy Connaughton has conceded, while at the same time taking radical measures, which is good.  I am glad he is not being distracted by all the talk about a general election.In the old days when the Taoiseach of the day called an election, all the parties held their conventions and we knocked on doors for three weeks.  Nowadays, people believe there is an election pending because of the hype and it is important none of us gets distracted.  There are at least 90 days to go, and indeed, the Taoiseach hinted to my constituency colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, today, that it might be even longer.  That is good because it means the Government can get on with its business and Deputy Brennan can continue to introduce the reforms he wants.  Like everyone else I am looking forward to the general election.  I am not looking for a job.  I was elected to do a job and I shall be happy for my term to continue so I may represent the issues that are of concern to me.As regards the social welfare remit, there are issues of concern to me, as well as other colleagues.  I am always happy to represent them.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  I am also secretary of the Fianna Fáil social and family affairs policy group and I get the opportunity to work with colleagues and the Minister on many issues of concern to people, which will be raised throughout this debate.  I was glad of the good news last week that Deputy Brennan made what the media called the historic North-South deal to provide free travel for the elderly.  As someone who meets many elderly people on a regular basis, that is something people were waiting for and have welcomed.  There have been a number of such initiatives in recent times that the Minister and his predecessors have been able to introduce.  It is important that should continue to be done.  It is not patronising, but all Members of the House refer to the elderly in terms of being the people who paved the way for the tiger economy, and who now need special attention.  I am proud of what has been achieved in recent years.  This Fianna Fáil-led Government with the PDs has reached a target.  There will be a good deal of talk about new targets, but it is important to assure the elderly they will continue to be looked after.  As with other issues one can think about when the economy is doing so well, we should look after people and provide the necessary resources.  I am glad to be a member of a party and supporter of a Government that is doing precisely that.I listen to what people are saying as regards these issues.  I am a member of the board of Tallaght Welfare Society.  Through contact with the elderly in the Glenview Lodge facility and the Dublin south facility in Kiltipper Road and the other clubs around the constituency, I seek out views on what people are saying on issues concerning senior citizens.  It is very important we continue to support the elderly in every way possible.  There are many issues in this Bill on which one might comment.  I listened carefully to the many issues raised by my colleague, Deputy Kelleher.  I have a good deal of sympathy with what he said, including the point about the need for a debate on immigrants.  Regarding returned emigrants, in particular, we all tend to talk about people who have gone abroad.  There was a time in the last century when many people went abroad to seek employment, myself included, and my father and grandfather.  Thank God those times have changed and people now emigrate because they want to.  It is a choice and there are many professionals who do that.  I challenge the Minister in this regard, however, and I should like his officials to take note.People who are encouraged to come home by FÁS, or advertisements for jobs, tell me that when they go to the local Department of Social and Family Affairs office in Ireland, they sometimes find it difficult to get their message across.  The Department talks about habitual residency and so on.  The Department has to uphold its regulations and I have no problem with that.  Frequently, however, families return home from Europe, America and other parts of the world and want to stay, yet find there is not enough time to find a job.  It should be easier.  I am not saying we should stand at the ports and hand out jobs, although as Deputy Kelleher said, sometimes we are told that is what we are doing for other people.  We should ensure, however, that the system is fair for people who want to return to Ireland, be it to my constituency, elsewhere in the Dublin region or elsewhere in the country.  I am not so sure, nor am I convinced that is happening.  I hope the Minister will look at this.  I am not asking him to give out freebies.  However, if State agencies are encouraging people to come back from abroad, we should be facilitating them when they arrive if they need help to get them over a short period of adjustment.  There is certainly some evidence available which indicates this is not happening in the manner it should be, and I want that to be examined.That raises the point I have often mentioned in terms of the Department.  I do not wish to sound patronising, but I have always said the Department of Social and Family Affairs is the best arm of Government for dealing with parliamentary questions and, I am sure, with queries from the public.  It is very important we continue to say the whole question of communications is vital and the Department must continue to ensure people understand their rights.As I said previously, I recall attending an event at which the former Fine Gael Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, made a speech about citizens information centres during which he said many people approach public representatives, particularly TDs, because the benefits to which they are entitled are not clearly set out.  I often say to constituents that I cannot get them what they want, but sometimes I have to contact not only the Department of Social and Family Affairs, as the Acting Chairman will be aware, but other Departments not to seek to get people something to which they are not entitled but to make sure they get that to which they are entitled.  Department's should be advised to make sure its advertising is effective and its communication system gets the message across.I repeat what I said at an Oireachtas joint committee last week about the phenomenon of swipe cards, with which I have no problem.  Like others, I recognise this is an aspect of progress.  I was not being flippant when I said I come from a bygone Dublin era and that I often wonder what my granny would think of the new ways we do business today.  The use of a swipe card to collect social welfare payments is a good move.  I am not against progress but we must ensure that not only the elderly but people in my age group and younger are not confused by the introduction of this new system.  When the Department introduces changes to the system it must recognise they will pose a challenge to people, particularly older people.  I ask the Department to be sympathetic in this regard and to ensure it gets its message across in a precise manner.The remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in regard to lone parents has been the subject of debate for a long period.  The Minister brought forward a number of radical proposals in this regard.  I attended a conference in Farmleigh at which these proposals were discussed with various groups and I assume the proposals are still in gestation in that sense.  It is important the Minister recognises the challenges faced by those who wish to qualify for lone parents benefit.  The Department must continue to make it possible for such people to gain their entitlements under the system.  This is not only an urban problem or one facing people in Tallaght in my constituency, which is the third largest population centre in the country.  Much of what happens there can be reflected throughout the country.  We should ensure that people in receipt of lone parents benefit are not stuck in a poverty trap.  We must help them progress.  Issues are raised with many of us at our clinics regarding the difficulties faced by single parents because they have friends or even partners, around which there are issues which the Minister has promised to examine.  There is also the question of how people qualify for this benefit.When the Minister brought forward these proposals I did not believe they would be easily implemented or simply get the nod.  There is a view that reform is necessary.  However, we must be careful of the counter view that has been brought to my attention and that of others regarding people who have not sought to qualify for this payment and still face the same challenges.  While we must be careful in dealing with this matter, there are issues to be addressed.The Department should endeavour to create a system whereby recipients of social welfare benefit can return to work without jeopardising their entitlements.  I have often said that an ever more liberal regime should prevail in regard to the sliding scale applying to rent subsidies and so on.  Many young people in receipt of social welfare payments call to my clinic.  They want to return to work but if they do so they face losing their rent supplement and other payments. I do not suggest the Department should simply hand out payments to these people but we should try to encourage them to return to employment.I am pleased to represent my constituency.  I was always happy to be involved in community work.  I was a reluctant politician; I did not sit at my desk in school contemplating becoming one.  When I moved to live in Tallaght, I did not plan to be a public representative and certainly not to be elected to this House.  I became involved in my community and there were always issues of interest to people.  It was said in the past that Tallaght had the population of a city but the status of village and that it had a high level of unemployment.  I am glad to represent my town and wider constituency where many changes have taken place and many more people from the area are now in the workplace.  However, there is still a need for the social welfare office.  I am glad Tallaght has as modern a social welfare facility as anywhere in the country.  It provides a first class service and the staff there answer the telephones.  I was interested in what the previous speaker said.  I do not have St. Peter's telephone number and I am not able to make the comparison Deputy Connaughton made.  If one were to telephone my local social welfare office, as I do regularly on behalf of my constituents, one would get through to a member of staff, which is a good feature of the system.In the next 90 days as we approach the general election, many people will say that more increases in benefits are required and that matters should be dealt with differently, and these matters will be debated.  However, I am glad that issues that require attention are being ticked off.  I mention in particular the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs under the able chairmanship of Deputy Penrose and Deputy Carty, the convenor of the group.  We have seriously examined a number of issues of concern to people.  We have reflected across party lines the issues that need to be addressed.  While some criticism will be always levelled, we should continue to build on the progress made by dealing with the challenges faced by carers in recent years.  We will never reach a stage where everything will be perfect and where people at risk in whatever age group will be okay.  The challenge facing the economy is to ensure we continue to look after those people.  I have no hesitation in saying, even from my position on the Government backbenches and I am proud to be here, that when our economy is doing well, we must continue to tackle poverty, particularly child poverty, and I was pleased to hear the Minister say that tonight.It is not good enough today that people are still poor at a time when our economy is doing well.  That is the challenge facing us politically.  I often quote my party leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who said that at a time when all boats are clearly rising — even my Opposition colleagues no longer deny that — we must remember there will be always the few small boats.  Those small boats exist in all our communities and they must be looked after.  We should not be ashamed to do that.  Irrespective of what people say in the run-up to the general election about who we should look after, who will vote, and so on, it is right and proper that we look after those in need in whatever category, and we should continue to do that.  I hope that ideal is not lost.  Social inclusion is important, as my predecessor, the former Deputy, Chris Flood, often said here.  It is important in every constituency whether it be in Cork, Donegal, Mayo, Kerry or the Dublin region.  As we go forward and hopefully the economy continues to improve, we should do that.It is important that the Department does not lose sight of its remit to help people return to employment.  Other agencies are involved in job creation.  People are concerned about job security.  Tallaght has lost jobs in the past and there will be always difficulties in that regard.  Where job losses occur, of which there have been a number in other constituencies recently, the Department must respond to such challenges and provide for people who have lost their jobs.  I bring to the Dáil my own life experiences.  I was made redundant three times in my life and happily I survived.  It is important that assistance is available when people and families are so vulnerable.I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I compliment the Minister and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, tells him that the work he is doing is appreciated on both sides of the House.  I know that from listening to the Opposition spokespersons, even though they have to make their odd political point, which is fair enough.

I compliment the Minister who has surely made his mark in this Department.  It was said four and a half years ago that he would not want to be a Minister in this Department.  The measures introduced have provided great relief to many social welfare recipients.  These people include those who were taken out of the poverty trap, lone parents, pensioners and carers.  Everybody received very generous increases.  Social welfare payments, at a little over €15 billion, equate to one quarter of total Government spending.  The Minister deserves real credit in that regard.In dealing with child poverty, the Minister has lifted 100,000 children out of the poverty trap with the introduction of new social welfare payments and increases.  He does not intend leaving it there because he recognises that childhood deprivation can leave lasting marks on children and on society.  The €2.15 billion expenditure on child benefit in 2007 speaks volumes about how this Government regards our children.  It is well established that child poverty is prevalent among those in one-parent families, who now make up a large portion of society.  I welcome the Government discussion paper that contains proposals for supporting lone parents.  It consists of proposals to expand the availability and the range of education and training for lone parents, the extension of the national employment action plan to focus on lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low-income families with young children.The Minister has also recognised the work of carers and the contribution they make to society.  Without those people, many of our more vulnerable members in society would find it much harder to cope.  Much ground-breaking work has been done since 1997 and increases have been made across the board.  I am glad that recognition has been given to carers.  They play a valuable role in our society and it is important that they are supported financially.  Since taking up office in 1997, the Government has been committed to supporting care in the community to the maximum extent possible.Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased.  Qualifying conditions for the carer's allowance have been significantly eased and coverage of the scheme has been extended.  New schemes have been introduced, such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant.  As a result of these improvements, there are almost 28,500 carers in receipt of their allowance or benefit.  These carers also receive a respite care grant, as do approximately 10,000 other carers.  The Minister's commitment to carers speaks for itself.The Bill provides for a number of improvements to the supplementary welfare allowance.  The rent supplement scheme is part of the overall supplement package announced in last December's budget.  This includes an extension of the qualifying conditions and an easing of the rent supplement means test.  The key objectives of the changes are to simplify the means test, so that a rent supplement recipient can judge the impact of an offer of work, and address the disincentives and eliminate the poverty traps faced by rent supplement recipients seeking to increase their hours of work, or wishing to take up full-time employment.There is concern about retirement income at present and for the future.  The position, thankfully, will remain favourable for a number of years.  Everybody is entitled to adequate income, dignity and security in their older years and the Government recognises that fact.  It is committed to delivering adequate retirement income to all our citizens in a way that is economically and socially sustainable.I welcome the efforts of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  He has made his mark in the Department and I know he will make further improvements across the board, helping lone parents, pensioners and so on.  I wish him the best with those efforts and I commend the Bill to the House.

Changing the role of community welfare officers is not a well thought out move.  Community welfare officers play a very important role in urban and rural communities.  They have built up a considerable amount of knowledge about their community and the people who live there, especially those in need.  This Bill seeks to take that role from the Health Service Executive and place it in the control of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Such a move is too quick.  Just like the transition from the health boards to the HSE, it has not been thought through well enough.  It will lead to much confusion about their role.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	529	Níl sé seo an chéad uair a luaigh mé an gá atá ann suíomh a chur ar fáil do Gaelscoil de hÍde in Órán Mór.  Tá sé scanallach go bhfuil an Gaelscoil, a bhunaíodh i 1994 agus a glacadh leis ar bhuan-fhoras a 1998, ag tosnú a dara deich mbliana gan aon suíomh buan a bheith ar fáil dos na 170 daltaí.  Is mian liom freagra díreach a fháil ar na ceisteanna bunúsacha atá agam.  An mbeidh an bord bainistíochta, na múinteoirí agus na tuismitheoirí in ann daltaí nua a ghlacadh an fhómhar seo chugainn?I should say that what is taking place in relation to Gaelscoil de hÍde is little less than a disgrace.  An appalling amount of cur i gcéill has been involved.  The parents' action group was recently devastated to learn it could not proceed with architectural planning for the school.  The Minister for Education and Science announced in November 2006 that Gaelscoil de hÍde had been "given the go-ahead to start architectural planning for a new school".  However, at an information session organised by the schools building section of the Department of Education and Science in December 2006, the parents' group was explicitly told that the architectural planning process could not start until a site had been acquired.  No concrete progress has been made on site acquisition or architectural planning for more than a year, since the parents' group met the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, on 1 February 2006.  I was present when a delegation from the school expressed its frustration on other occasions.The school, which was established in 1994, has been operating on a permanent basis since 1998, but it does not have a permanent building.  Its 170 pupils are mostly housed in prefabricated accommodation on a site of less than half an acre.  The school pays rent of €125,000 every year.  The parents were told over a year ago that the school had been placed in band 1.1, which meant that it was an immediate priority.  There have been some recent developments — we cannot protect ourselves from the time of the year that is in it.  The school was visited by the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Parlon, when he was viewing the flooding in the region, which I am sure he will solve in the next few weeks.  When the Minister of State and his representatives visited the school, I asked them a number of straight questions.  How many sites have been investigated by the OPW?  What is the status of any of the sites in question?  When will the OPW inform the Department of Education and Science that a site has been identified?  I addressed a further question explicitly to the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.  Will the school's board of management, parents and teachers — as well as other parents who may wish to send their children to a scoil lán-Ghaelach — be able to accept children in September?Oranmore, which is a rapidly expanding area, has been the victim of appallingly bad planning.  Most recently, an application has been submitted to build hundreds of houses on a flood plain.  It is interesting that Ministers and Ministers of State have come to Oranmore and meetings have been held, but we are no closer to locating a site for the school.  Tá sé in am freagra a fháil.  What stage is the process at?  What progress has been made in the talks with a person who may give the school a site?  When will the new school building open?  An mbeidh sé ar chumas an scoil glacadh le daltaí i mí Mheán Fómhair seo chugainn?  Ba mhaith liom freagra díreach a fháil.  An mbeidh an scoil in ann é sin a dhéanamh, nó nach mbeidh?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Sa chéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom buíochas ó chroí a ghabháil leis an Teachta Ó hUiginn as ucht an t-ábhar an-tábhachtach seo a ardú.  Tá an Teachta mar ionadaí náisiúnta don cheantar le blianta fada agus tá a lán oibre iontach déanta aige.  Tá spéis speisialta aige sa Ghaeilge, sa cheantar agus san oideachas.  Tugann sé a lán cúnamh do mhuintir na háite.  Tá an spéis céanna agam sa Ghaeilge, san oideachas agus sa teanga.  Ní raibh an t-ádh agam riamh bheith i mo ionadaí náisiúnta don cheantar, ach bhí mé i mo comhairleoir áitiúil don cheantar ar feadh sé bliana.  Tréaslaím leis an Teachta as ucht an t-ábhar seo a ardú arís.  Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall freagra cruinn a thabhairt don Teach.I thank Deputy Michael D. Higgins for raising this matter and affording me an opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects.  I will outline the position of the Department of Education and Science on the development of education provision in Gaelscoil de hÍde, Órán Mór, Contae na Gaillimhe.  The modernisation of facilities in this country's 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area.  The Government needs to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, particularly urban and rural areas like those in County Galway.Since it took office, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure that appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  As evidence of this commitment, over €540 million will be spent on school building and modernisation projects in the coming year.  That money will be spent on primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  Approximately €3 billion has been invested in school buildings since 1997, delivering over 7,800 school building projects.  Further investment of over €540 million is being made to build on such achievements, focusing particularly on the provision of school accommodation in places where the population is growing at a rapid rate.  As further evidence of the Government's commitment, it intends to invest €4.5 billion in schools over the coming years under the new national development plan, which was published recently.I am sure Deputy Higgins agrees that the record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority that the Government attaches to ensuring that this country's school accommodation is of the highest possible standard.  Responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level to reduce red tape and to allow projects to move faster.  Standard designs have been developed for eight and 16 classroom schools to facilitate the speedier delivery of projects and save on design fees.  The design and build method is used to expedite delivery when the use of standard designs is not possible.  Such initiatives, when taken with the unprecedented level of funding that is available, are ensuring that schools building projects are delivered in the fastest possible timeframe.Enrolments at Gaelscoil de hÍde in Oranmore, which is a co-educational primary school in a growing area, have increased from 125 in 2002 to 170 in 2007.  Officials in the Department of Education and Science have completed an assessment of the application for a new build school.  The school's long-term projected staffing level — a principal and 16 mainstream teachers — has been notified to the school authorities.  The Office of Public Works, which generally acts on behalf of the Department of Education and Science in acquiring sites for schools, has been asked to source a suitable site for Gaelscoil de hÍde.  A number of sites have been identified and the OPW has commenced negotiations on the most suitable of them.  In tandem with the site acquisition process, the Department announced in November 2006 that the project had been approved to proceed to the appointment of a design team.

#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise the issue of the need to provide funding for the provision of a replacement playground at St. James's national school, Cappagh, County Limerick.  Like many other schools in my constituency, St. James's national school applied for funding under the summer works scheme for the replacement of its original playground but this application was unsuccessful.  An appeal is ongoing and I raise this matter with the Minister and her officials in the hope that the appeal will be successful.The summer works scheme is a very practical scheme which has been beneficial to many schools throughout the country and throughout the constituency of Limerick West.  I fully understand that due to the volume of applications received in the Department, priority must be given to necessary works such as roof repairs or replacement, windows and doors replacement, the upgrading of heating systems, electrical works and the upgrading of toilets.Many schools have qualified under the terms of the scheme this year and will see work carried out during the summer months.  It is important to recognise the practical nature of the scheme.  Applications are invited and approvals are announced in the month of January.  The approved applications go to tender and the work can be successfully carried out during the summer holidays between June and September.  This cuts down on bureaucracy and red tape.  Practical and sensible contracts are signed on the ground and works are completed quickly.I understand the Minister was in a position this year to approve applications on categories 1 to 9.  This is commendable and I praise the Minister for what she has done.  Category 10 specifically refers to external works and such applications would this year have cost in the region of €20 million.  It may be the case that some of those applications for external works were not regarded as priorities but I wish to make a strong case for St. James's national school in Cappagh to ensure that its 103 pupils have a play area.  A fine new building was built on the site of the playground.  The school is not asking for an enhanced playground with white lines for basketball courts; it is simply asking for a basic hardcourt area costing in the region of €50,000.It might be suggested that the local people should raise this money but there is a good reason this is not possible.  Under the devolved grant scheme, the building of the school or the extension is left in the hands of the board of management and the staff of the school and this has worked very successfully in the case of St. James's school in Cappagh.  During the course of that building, those parents in a small rural parish in west Limerick raised in excess of €50,000 to add to the grant they had received.  It is not a question of asking the same people to raise additional funding for the playground.The issue of replacement of the playground may have been lost in the application.  I wish to emphasise that these children do not have a playground and they need a replacement playground.  I understand the large volume of applications under category 10 for external works.  I know of two applications from my constituency involving Ahalin primary school and Ballyhahil primary school, where the parents' councils, boards of management and the teaching staff have prioritised their applications on the basis of health and safety considerations.  Departmental officials may have had good reasons for not considering the parking and health and safety considerations but it is now time to recognise that category 10 contains some genuine applications such as those I have referred to.  The playground in Cappagh is very necessary, and parking facilities, safer access, dropping-off points and bus bays have all become very important areas of consideration for these local schools.I appeal to the Minister that those schools be given favourable consideration in the appeals process and that there will be a favourable response to our requests.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	535	I thank Deputy Cregan for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to this House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the position regarding the provision of a replacement playground at St. James's school, Cappagh, County Limerick.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  However, since taking office, this Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.The school in question, St. James's school, Cappagh, is a co-educational primary school with a September 2006 enrolment of 103 pupils.  Enrolments at this school have been relatively stable with a slight increase in recent years, from 86 pupils in 2002 to 103 pupils in 2006.The school originally submitted an application to the Department of Education and Science for major capital investment in its existing buildings.  Having considered the school's accommodation needs, the school authorities were offered and accepted funding under the small schools initiative in 2005 to provide accommodation suitable to that of a four teacher school.  This building project is currently under construction.The school authorities made an application for the provision of a hardcourt play area under the summer works scheme 2007.  Under the published prioritisation criteria governing this scheme, external environment projects, such as the provision of hard play areas fall into category 10.  Unfortunately this particular category was not reached this year.  The management of the school has appealed the decision and this appeal is currently under consideration in the Department of Education and Science.I wish to inform the House that more than 1,100 modernisation projects to greatly improve facilities at schools under the 2007 summer works scheme were announced by the Department of Education and Science on 8 January 2007.  A total of 641 primary schools and 324 post-primary schools around the country will receive funding to complete essential small scale capital projects.I thank the Deputy again for raising this matter and allowing me, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science who is unable to be here as she is at this time on RTE discussing education matters, to outline the progress being made under the school building and modernisation programme and the position regarding the application for the provision of a replacement playground at St. James's school, Cappagh, County Limerick.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to raise the accommodation crisis at Carrig national school.  Carrig national school is a rural school on the Tipperary-Offaly border.  In 1994 the school was expanded to cater for a maximum of 75 pupils and three staff.  In the 13 years since that last major expansion, the school population has increased to 91.  It has four classroom teachers and two special needs teachers.  With those six teachers, there are also five full-time special needs assistants, one part-time special needs assistant and a secretary, giving a total staff complement of 13.I want to emphasise the commitment to special needs education at Carrig national school.  Recognition of the basic right to education of every pupil is fundamental to the ethos of the school.  Of the 91 pupils in the school, ten have been assessed with a variety of learning disabilities, such as severe speech and language disorder, profoundly deaf with epilepsy, Down's syndrome and autistic spectrum.The needs of these pupils are of greatest importance to school management.  The further enrolment of autistic children next year will have serious ramifications for the school generally and its accommodation needs.  The school staff and board of management endeavour to provide the very best education possible for all the children in their educational care.  This cannot be fully achieved without proper resources and the provision of satisfactory accommodation.  The fact that parents, teachers and pupils learn sign language after school hours at night is proof of the dedication, caring ethos and determination to provide a rounded, well-balanced education for every one of the 91 pupils enrolled in Carrig national school.A scheme of 74 houses is currently nearing completion in the catchment area, with construction beginning on another significant scheme of houses.  There is also a planning application for 32 houses.  All of this additional development will have a considerable impact on the future accommodation requirements of the school.In response to the obvious accommodation need in terms of special needs and staff, the school management has applied for a devolved grant from the Department.  A staff room, an extra classroom to replace a prefab, a learning support room, a resource room, an office, a library and a meeting room are required to adequately cater for the school's needs into the future.  The school is currently using a teacher's toilet to store PE equipment and science equipment.  As the school has no general purpose room, access to the PE curriculum is dictated by weather conditions, as are school assemblies.  Therefore, the school also needs a general purpose room and a store room.It is crucial that this school is included in the major capital projects that proceed this year.  There is an acute accommodation crisis in Carrig national school, where first and second class and the learning support teacher are working in a damp, draughty prefab, which is costing the school a fortune to rent and heat.  Surely this is a prime example of poor value for money, when two or three years' rent would pay for the construction of a badly needed new classroom.Last year, the school unsuccessfully applied for an extension.  It was apparent to the Department at the time that major capital investment was required to address the accommodation crisis in the school.  This year, the school management has applied for funding under the devolved scheme.  Failure to include this school under the devolved capital programme would be a travesty and simply incomprehensible to parents, teachers and the wider community.  It is apparent from the planned housing development in the locality that additional school accommodation will be needed in the future.  It is also blatantly obvious that the school needs additional facilities to meet the requirements of the special needs teachers and pupils.The current overcrowding at Carrig national school is unacceptable.  The teachers and pupils are placed at an unfair disadvantage because of the intolerable conditions prevailing on a daily basis.  I ask the Minister, on behalf of the parents, teachers and board of management, to ensure the inclusion of this school in the 2007 building programme.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I thank Deputy Lowry for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the urgent need to include Carrig national school in the school building programme.  Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.Carrig national school is a co-educational primary school with a September 2006 enrolment of 91 pupils.  Enrolments at the school have shown a slight increase in recent years, having increased from 72 pupils in 2002.  The management authority of the school submitted an application under the small schools scheme of 2007 for accommodation appropriate to a four-teacher school.  As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Education and Science has moved, where appropriate, towards a model of devolving funding to school authorities.  Devolving of funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction, and can also deliver better value for money.  This particular devolved initiative was originally introduced on a pilot basis for 20 schools in the 2003 school building programme and due to the very positive feedback from schools has been extended in the school building programmes since then.All applications received in the Department of Education and Science under this scheme, including the application from Carrig national school, are currently under active consideration and the list of successful applicants will be published as soon as possible.  Once again, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and allowing me to outline the progress being made under the school building and modernisation programme and the position in regard to Carrig national school on the border of Offaly and the great historic county of Tipperary.

At that time, it was envisaged that the role of the college would be to provide a limited number of one-year and two-year higher certificate programmes, validated by the NCEA, and an extensive range of engineering apprenticeship courses linked to FÁS.  There were plans to cater for a total student population of 350 by the turn of the millennium.  It was thought that the college would primarily serve the south-west Munster region, which is still the case, with the student population drawn mainly from Kerry and parts of counties Clare, Cork and Limerick.With a student population of over 3,000, the policy of providing programmes to satisfy regional demand for graduates still holds today and the institute now offers programmes at craft, higher certificate, ordinary bachelor degree, honours bachelor degree and postgraduate level.  From its inception, it was the institute's policy to offer educational opportunities to disadvantaged and disabled students and it has an enviable record of achievement in this area.  Throughout its history, staff have been actively involved in the development of the local community and in assisting the socioeconomic growth of the region through research and development activities.A major development was the re-designation of the college as an institute of technology in 1997.  Since then, it has gone from strength to strength and has become a major educational centre in the south west.  In recent months, a number of students and staff of the institute have been in contact with me expressing concern that there seems to be no progress on the provision of the promised new library building, student facilities building or indoor sports facility.In 1998, the original phase 1 of the North Campus development was split into two phases — phase 1A, which consisted of business, information technology, hotel and catering and tourism buildings; and phase 1B, which consisted of a library, student facilities and sports buildings.  There was a firm commitment that when phase 1A building was completed in 2001, work would begin on phase 1B buildings in 2002 or 2003 at the latest.  However, this has not happened.  As I understand it, floor plans and layouts for both phase 1A and phase 1B have been at an advanced stage since 1998 but nothing has happened.I ask the Minister for Education and Science, through the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to clarify the amount of funds provided by the building unit of her Department to the Institute of Technology, Tralee, for architectural and other professional fees, and to whom they were payable for phase 1A buildings of the North Campus development and separately for phase 1B of that development in each of the years 1998 to 2005.  This would exclude the clinical studies building, which was funded by the Department of Health and Children.I would appreciate it if the Minister would provide information on the current status of departmental approval and capital funding scheduling for the buildings of phase 1B, particularly for the library building, the student facilities building and the sports building, and the other buildings of phase 1B.  I would like to know the reason for the delay in providing these badly needed buildings and the other buildings of phase 1B, which were promised to commence in 2002 or 2003 at the latest.  Was this due to her Department or the Department of Finance?  Also, will the Minister provide the schedule of proposed commencement dates envisaged by the building unit of her Department for each of these buildings?Finally, has the Minister or her Department plans to move the current activities of the South Campus to the North Campus, as envisaged in phase 2 of the institute development plan in 1998?  I am sure she would agree that reuniting both campuses would enhance the quality of life for students and staff and save the Exchequer the extra costs incurred by the institute in running a dual campus arrangement.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	539	I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this important matter as it affords me the opportunity to clarify the position regarding capital developments at the Institute of Technology, Tralee.  I endorse everything the Deputy has said about the institute with which I am familiar since my time in the Department of Education and Science when I had responsibility for the institutes of education.  Many past pupils of the Tralee institute and some current pupils are from my county and some have been reasonably successful in the game of football, although not quite as successful as Deputy Deenihan as yet.  We salute the institute for the rounded contribution it makes to both the academic and extra curricular development of its students.The Institute of Technology, Tralee, is an autonomous body and its day-to-day management is a matter for the institute's governing authority.  Likewise, the management of large scale capital projects is fully within the domain of the institute's governing body.  In December 2005, in the context of a budget day announcement of a €900 million multi-annual capital envelope for higher education, the Minister for Education and Science announced the approval of 35 major capital projects across the sector for advancement.  Key priority projects were included on the basis of an earlier review of all capital projects in the sector.  The projects included the development of facilities in a range of disciplines, including engineering, IT, research, digital media and business and enterprise.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the library and information resource centre at the Institute of Technology, Tralee, was one of the projects approved to proceed at that time.  While a number of these projects were announced for delivery through the public private partnership process, the library and information resource centre was earmarked for delivery through conventional procurement.Accordingly, since December 2005, responsibility for progressing this project rests with the institute's governing body.  The Department of Education and Science had expected to receive pre-tender documentation from the institute in December 2006, but to date this submission has not been received.  Accordingly, such delays as are being encountered with advancing this project are outside of the scope of the Department to address or rectify.  I assure the Deputy, however, that the Department is fully committed to progressing the project and is anxious to do so as soon as it receives the requisite material from the institute in Tralee.With regard to the question of funding for other projects at the institute, these will be considered in the context of the prioritisation of new projects for delivery as part of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  In that context, the Deputy will be aware of the significant priority given to investment in higher education under the NDP, reflecting the significance that the Government attributes to investing in the sector generally.As the Deputy is aware, the institute is currently located on two campuses.  The institute's strategic plan is to integrate all facilities on a single site.  The rationale for this strategy is the prospect of considerable operational efficiencies and growth opportunities for education in the institute.  With this in mind, the Minister is aware that the institute is investigating the possibility of delivering a number of projects, including the student facilities building, and the health and leisure building, through alternative methods.  Specifically, the institute is examining an expression of interest proposal.In broad terms, an expression of interest is an exploration of the viability of providing a range of campus facilities with interested parties in the private sector.  The institute advertised its expression of interest in the national media last September and I understand it has received a number of responses.  However, the proposal is at the early stages of investigation.  The institute will work to progress the process over the coming months.I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and allowing me the opportunity to clarify the position with regard to capital developments at the Institute of Technology, Tralee.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 95, 99, 105, 115, 116, 128, 361, 365 and 366 together.The issues of nurses' pay and working hours have been fully processed through the State's industrial relations structures and procedures — the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  While health service management have accepted the Labour Court Recommendation, the Irish Nurses Organisation and Psychiatric Nurses Association state that they have neither accepted nor rejected this Recommendation and have instead served notice of industrial action. Discussions regarding impending industrial action have been led by the Health Service Executive — Employers Agency. These discussions form part of the process of established industrial relations practices and procedures. Officials from my Department have been included in these discussions as appropriate and have ensured that I have been fully briefed on the issues.Social partnership agreements have created and sustained the conditions for economic growth over the last decade and significantly enhanced the position of employees in the public and private sector. The Government has agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions a basis on which pay and conditions for the public service as a whole should be managed and the second Benchmarking Body has been established to provide an objective means of assessing the appropriate pay for particular groups or professions. However, the Irish Nurses Organisation and Psychiatric Nurses Association are refusing to co-operate with the current Benchmarking process which is reviewing the pay of public servants and is due to report in the second half of 2007. The INO and PNA have so far declined to sign up to the new national partnership agreement — Towards 2016. Instead both unions lodged eight cost increasing claims for improvements in pay and conditions. The additional cost of these claims would be almost €1 billion per annum. The Unions are also seeking retrospection estimated to cost in excess of €500m.These claims were lodged during the lifetime of the Sustaining Progress Agreement which prohibited cost increasing claims. Both unions had signed up to Sustaining Progress and their members had received increases of 13.16% under this agreement, in addition to Benchmarking increases of between 8% and 16%.The claims lodged by the Unions were the subject of an in depth examination by the Labour Court which issued its Recommendation last November. The Court did not recommend concession of the major cost increasing pay claims. Instead the Court urged the Unions concerned to reconsider their position with regard to Benchmarking so as to have their pay claims examined through that process.In relation to the claim for a reduction in working hours from 39 to 35 hours per week, the Court recommended that the parties should jointly explore the possibility of initiating an appropriate process aimed at achieving major reorganisation of working arrangements and practices within the health service generally. The Court also stated that such an initiative should take account of and support existing development involving other groups. It held the view that if such a programme of change could be successfully implemented, the efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits accruing may allow this claim to be processed within a reasonable timeframe to be agreed between the parties.The Benchmarking Body is due to report in the second half of the year and is in a position to review the issues that the nursing unions feel strongly about. I believe that a solution to the current dispute can be found within the context of the Labour Court Recommendation and the prevailing national agreements. In this regard I arranged for exploratory discussions to be held between all the parties concerned at the offices of the HSE-Employers Agency on 19 January 2007.  While I understand the discussions provided clarity as to the respective positions of the parties the meeting adjourned without agreement on the way forward.The Deputy will be aware that the first graduates from the nursing degree programme qualified in 2006 and the vast majority accepted posts and remain in employment in the public health service. There is no evidence to suggest that 75% of graduates have left Ireland.It remains the Government's view that Benchmarking is the appropriate mechanism to resolve the pay issues. Management have offered to enter into discussions on  an appropriate process aimed at achieving major reorganisation of working arrangements and practices within the health service generally and remain available for further discussions within the context of the Labour Court Recommendation and the prevailing national agreements.  I would ask the INO and PNA to give further consideration to the Recommendation of the Labour Court and to make the case on behalf of their members, as other nursing unions have done, before the Benchmarking Body.

At the end of 2005, this figure had increased by 1,199 to a total of 13,344, involving an additional 719 in-patient beds and 480 day places.  This expansion of capacity by 300 beds and places a year on average is one of the fastest in recent decades.During 2006 the Health Service Executive undertook an extensive survey of capacity across all acute hospitals, including in-patient beds, day beds and other treatment placements, on a speciality by speciality basis.  I understand that the HSE intends to publish the results of the survey in March 2007 and to make copies available to members of the Oireachtas.

The report sets out the Institute's views on a range of issues, including, for example, the need to develop clinical maternity networks throughout the country.  The report also points to what the Institute sees as deficiencies in service provision. Clearly the report points to the need for significant changes in work practices and clinical cover by consultants on site.  These issues are at the centre of the new consultants contract which is to be discussed with consultants' representatives in the coming weeks.The Health Service Executive is responsible for the provision of maternity and gynaecology services and will have regard to the Institute's findings in developing these services.

In order to support this approach, capital funding of €490 million is being provided for Health Information and Communications Technology under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.The Primary Care Strategy included a commitment to provide improved ICT infrastructure for primary care teams. This was reaffirmed in the National Health Information Strategy.In 2004, my Department and the HSE jointly led the preparation of an ICT Strategy for Primary Care. This will be used to inform the HSE's ICT development plans for the primary, community and continuing care sector.  The HSE already supports computer links between hospitals and primary care providers, including GPs.  The message types supported include laboratory results, radiology results, discharge letters and outpatient department appointments.At present in excess of 1,000 GPs transmit and receive over 3 million electronic messages annually. The HSE intends to build upon the experience gained in these projects to further enhance and support electronic links between primary and secondary care.

If there is clinical suspicion of liver or kidney disease then it is good clinical practice to conduct these tests.  However, there is currently no evidence to support population screening for these diseases.My Department continues to keep evidence and practice in other countries under review and is actively considering the most appropriate ways to monitor new developments in screening and how they should be evaluated.

The regional hospital will provide emergency and trauma services on a 24 hour basis.  It will also provide planned specialist procedures that are complex and require the facilities of a large regional hospital. Local hospitals, including Monaghan, will provide services which meet the majority of patients needs including day and urgent care services.Led by the HSE's National Hospitals Office, the Steering Group has representation from key stakeholders such as clinicians and primary care providers. The Project Group is being led by a Consultant Surgeon from outside the region. The process is being supported by ten Clinical Network Leads who have been tasked with overseeing the full range of  planned care services to be provided at the local hospitals, including Monaghan.The HSE has given me an assurance that, in progressing the re-organisation of services, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The Health Bill 2006, which is currently before the Oireachtas, provides for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).  This Bill represents a crucial element of the Reform Programme and is a new departure for the health services.  For the first time, we are creating a body whose purpose will be to set quality standards and monitor enforcement of standards in an open and transparent way.  It is essential that mechanisms and structures are in place to audit that quality together with an independent system for continuous performance review to ensure consistently high standards.The functions of the Authority will be to:Set standards on safety and quality for all services provided by the HSE and service providers on behalf of the HSE, and private nursing homes, with the exception of mental health services which are covered by the Mental Health Commission and the Inspector of Mental Health.Monitor compliance with the standards it sets and advise the Minister and the HSE on the level of compliance.Undertake investigations as to the safety, quality and standards of services where the Minister believes that there is serious risk to the health or welfare of a person receiving services.Carry out reviews to ensure best outcomes/value for money for the resources available to the HSE.Operate accreditation programmes of health and personal social services in both the private and public health sectors.Carry out assessments of health technologies, including drugs and medical devices.Evaluate information available on services provided by the HSE and other service providers and on the health and welfare of the population, identify information deficiencies, and advise the HSE and the Minister accordingly.Set standards (including governance arrangements) for the HSE and service providers in relation to information and data in their possession on health and personal social services and on the health and welfare of the population and advise the Minister and the HSE on the level of compliance with the standards.I am confident that, working with the HSE, HIQA will play a key role in improving the quality of hospital services and outcomes for patients.

The Report considers that over 320 community mental health teams are required to service the mental health needs of adults, children and adolescents, persons with an intellectual disability, older persons etc. Teams should include input from psychiatry, nursing, social work, clinical psychology and occupational therapy. "A Vision for Change" also recommends that research should be undertaken to establish how many services currently have effective community mental health teams. Currently not all mental health staff are deployed within such teams.Implementation of "A Vision for Change" is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE established an implementation group in July 2006 to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in "A Vision for Change" a reality.As part of the work of the implementation group proposals for the recommended catchment areas are being considered. In addition an audit of mental health staff covering all disciplines and grades is being conducted which, when completed, will facilitate the deployment of staff within multidisciplinary teams.In 2006 funding was provided for 18 additional consultant-led adult multidisciplinary teams, 14 team enhancements and 8 child and adolescent teams. In 2007 funding was also provided to the HSE for the development of a further 8 child and adolescent community mental health teams.

The group will monitor and assess progress on the implementation of all the recommendations including those which fall under the responsibility of the HSE, government departments and other relevant agencies. The Group is to submit its first annual report before mid 2007.Implementation of the individual recommendations of "A Vision for Change" is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE established an implementation group in July 2006 to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in "A Vision for Change" a reality.

A further sum of €25 million has been allocated for 2007. Developments in 2007 will include eight new child and adolescent mental health teams, up to 36 new in-patient beds for children and adolescents, specialist mental health services for older people, the homeless, persons with an intellectual disability and persons with an eating disorder, suicide prevention initiatives including a national positive mental health awareness programme and enhanced services and additional places at the Central Mental Hospital.

While mass screening of the population for heart disease and blood pressure was not a recommendation in the Strategy, responsibility for risk assessment and the subsequent identification and management of those at higher risk was.Heartwatch, a pilot programme in general practice for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, was established in 2002 in partnership with the former health boards, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Heart Foundation and has enrolled  over 14,000 patients. This programme continues to be provided by the Health Service Executive.My Department is engaging with the Health Service Executive in an audit and review of the implementation of the current Cardiovascular Strategy. The Department is aware of emerging evidence on hypertension screening and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  These issues will be considered in the context of the current review and the possible development of a new Cardiovascular Strategy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I am aware of the report of the Drug Policy Action Group "Criminal Justice Drug Policy in Ireland" to which the Deputy refers.I understand that the UK system divides different kinds of illegal drugs into three categories, or classes. These classes (A, B and C) carry different levels of penalty for possession and dealing.  Class A drugs are those considered most harmful and are subject to the most severe penalties, including  up to seven years in prison for possession and up to life in prison for dealing.Under our Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988, drugs are classified in 5 Schedules according to the level of controls applicable to them, which in turn depends on the degree to which the drugs have a legitimate medical use, and the degree to which they have potential for abuse.  Drugs in Schedule 1 have no legitimate medicinal use and it is an offence to supply or possess them.   Drugs in Schedules 2 and 3  have a legitimate medicinal use but are prone to abuse and are the subject of prescription, supply, manufacturing, import and export controls. Drugs in Schedules 4 and 5 have lesser abuse potential and are subject to lesser controls.Under our Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, the various offences that have been created have penalties associated with them depending on the seriousness of the offence.  These range from up to life imprisonment in the case of serious crimes involving drugs to the lowest penalties, which are available in the case of the possession of cannabis for personal use. Thus the current means of classification under Irish law allows the Courts an appropriate basis for dealing with drug crime and it is unnecessary to adopt the UK approach in this area.

The HSE advises that it has been in discussion with the management of St James's Hospital on the issue of critical care capacity. The HSE has given approval to the hospital for the creation of one additional ICU bed and the upgrading of four general beds to the High Dependency category.It should be noted that ICU capacity at St James's Hospital has been increased over the past three years from 9 to 14 beds and that there has been an overall increase in bed numbers in St James's of 140 in the period 2000-2006.The hospital has also been advised by the HSE to explore further the possibility of collaboration with private hospitals to ensure maximum use of ICU capacity where available.The HSE has advised that patients may be discharged from ICU beds earlier than planned in order to admit emergencies to the ICU. Clinical decisions are taken to prioritise use of the ICU to maximise benefit to patients. When procedures requiring post-operative critical care accommodation are postponed to cater for emergency admissions, the procedures are rescheduled as soon as possible.Finally, the HSE is conducting a national review of acute bed capacity at present which will include an assessment of critical care bed needs. The Intensive Care Society of Ireland will be an important participant in this exercise.

However, I understand that this has been addressed.The health repayment scheme is administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in conjunction with the appointed Scheme Administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.The HSE has informed the Department that over 25,000 forms have been submitted to the Scheme Administrator applying for repayments and these applications are being processed at present. The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive as living people who were wrongly charged will be prioritised to receive repayments. It is estimated that there are now in the region of 14,000 people within this category, approximately 10,000 of whom have already applied.The HSE has advised that offers of repayment commenced in November 2006 and that the first payments issued in December 2006 with further payments continuing on an ongoing basis. The HSE has indicated that over €19 million has been repaid to date and that the average repayment is approximately €21,000. It is expected that the bulk of payments to estates will commence later in the Spring.   Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008.A dedicated website, an information phone line and an e-mail facility have been established by the Scheme Administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 8.00 am and 9.00 pm from Monday to Saturday. To date approximately 33,000 call centre queries have been dealt with.In relation to repayments to patients who die before payment is made, the legislation provides that if the relevant person dies on or after 9 December 1998, the legal representative of the estate of the relevant person or the person entitled to extract a grant of representation can submit an application. If a patient dies during the application process, the application ceases as there is no longer a person to whom payment can be made. Based on advice from the Attorney General, a new application has to be made by the person's Estate.

The Home Help Service by its nature is a flexible service which responds to clients' needs.  As a result, therefore, the level of service required in individual cases will fluctuate from time to time.  There is a continuing demand for home helps because of the increased number of older people.There has been significant and sustained investment in this service over the past number of years. The investment package in 2006 provided a sum of €30m which equated to a total of 1.75m additional home help hours in a full year. An additional €21m was allocated in 2007 for further expansion of home help services with the planned delivery of an additional 780,000 hours. This continued investment in the Home Help service comes on top of a baseline budget of €156m or 9.1m hours. The total budget in 2007 for Home Help services (not including those delivered as part of home care packages) is now €207m.In 2006 there was an increase from the 2005 baseline monthly average of 758,000 to a monthly average of 952,000. This will further increase in 2007. These figures are not inclusive of the additional 620,000 hours of home help which were delivered in respect of home care packages.Prior to the establishment of the HSE, varying practices had developed in relation to the operation of the Home Help service across the country, including various means of recording data. The multiplicity of statutory and voluntary providers supplying these critical services to both older people, as well as people with disabilities, operated in very different ways. This makes the provision of comparable data more difficult. The HSE has informed the Department that figures are now being recorded in a standardized format across all areas.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there has been significant progress in developing services in these important areas.  In Budget 2007 the Government allocated an extra €255m for services for older people and an extra €75m for disability services.The Government's commitment to the development of a comprehensive range of services for older people has been clearly demonstrated by the significantly increased resources made available in recent years. Budget 2007 provides €255m for developments over 2007 and 2008.  This includes €82m for the development of home support and community based services, €88m for additional public and private long stay beds and €85m to support considerable improvements in nursing home subvention rates in 2007.In relation to Disability services, work is underway to provide extra residential, respite and day care places and personal assistance/home support hours.  These improvements include 255 new residential places, 85 new respite places and 535 new day service places. There will be 80 new residential places for people with a Physical and Sensory Disability and 250,000 additional hours of personal assistance/home supports.  Implementation of these developments have commenced and will continue during 2007.The HSE has set targets for each of the new service developments and these will be tracked closely throughout the year.  Figures for January have not yet been collated by the Health Service Executive, but these will become available as the year progresses.

At that point the HIA and the Competition Authority were undertaking a joint study of this issue. It appeared at that time that a company entering the market by acquiring the business of an existing undertaking could gain an exemption in a manner not intended by the Oireachtas when it enacted the legislation. However the Government's capacity to bring forward amending legislation at that time was circumscribed by the constitutional challenge to the risk equalisation scheme then before the courts. The High Court judgement in that case was not delivered until the end of November.Following delivery of the judgement advice was sought on the matter. The advice confirmed that the potential loophole identified by the HIA did exist and I am taking further advice on that issue.The Deputy will understand that I am unable to comment on any particular commercial transaction as I am not privy to the details of any agreement entered into by the companies concerned. However I can confirm that the Government remains committed to the maintenance of a community rated health insurance market and to ensuring that consumers in this market benefit from effective competition.

The Project Group is being led by a Consultant Surgeon from outside the Region.The Teamwork Report makes a number of short, medium and long-term recommendations.  It concludes that the present system, where five local hospitals deliver acute care to relatively small populations, is exposing patients to increased risks and creating additional professional risks for staff.  The Report highlights the need to develop a high quality and responsive emergency and planned service, in line with international standards, by developing local services within existing hospitals and other local centres supported by a new Regional Hospital.The Teamwork Report recommends a three strand action plan in order to provide easily accessible and sustainable local and regional services which are based upon international quality standards;The development of local services, with the existing five hospitals and primary and community care providers playing central roles,The development of a new regional acute hospital,The development of a series of clinical networks which bind these local and regional services and are centred around the needs of patients, including networks for Emergency Care, Surgery and Critical Care.The HSE has given me an assurance that, in progressing the implementation of this report, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.

The development of the hospital is being overseen by a joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group and the project is proceeding as planned.The next stage of the process involves the preparation of a high level framework brief for the new hospital.  The brief is being developed for the Transition Group by Rawlinson Kelly & Whittlestone Ltd (RKW), an established UK-based health care planning company.  RKW will be advising on a range of issues which will help to inform the design of the new hospital.  They will be advising, for example, on the preferred model of care, on the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and on the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital.  In this context RKW have been requested to advise, as a priority, on the range of services which should be provided outside of the main hospital through the urgent / ambulatory care service, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children's hospital services.RKW is consulting widely in the course of its work, and in this context the input of all stakeholders will be of benefit in ensuring the delivery of our shared objective of providing a world-class hospital for the children of this country.

It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out, beginning late this year, based on an affordable model.  For that purpose, on 1 January 2007, I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme.The total allocation to the new Service is €33m; this is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the Programmes.  This includes additional funding of €5m for 2007 to the Service to commence roll out of the Cervical Screening Programme.  Significant preparatory work is well underway involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.  The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.I am aware of reports of delays in obtaining results of cervical smears.  These delays have not arisen under the Irish Cervical Screening Programme but relate to smears referred by General Practitioners to hospital laboratories, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  The HSE has informed my Department that it has reviewed hospital services, including cytology, and is planning on the basis of a 4 week turnaround time in reporting.  My Department  has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the issues raised.

The decision was taken  having regard inter alia to the issues raised in the report prepared for the HSE by Teamwork Management Services — "Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East".In line with the Teamwork report, it is planned to have one major regional centre in the North East, supported by local hospitals and care centres at a number of locations, including Monaghan. The regional hospital will provide emergency and trauma services on a 24 hour basis.  It will also provide planned specialist procedures that are complex and require the facilities of a large regional hospital. Local hospitals, including Monaghan, will provide services which meet the majority of patients needs including day and urgent care services.Led by the HSE's National Hospitals Office, the Steering Group has representation from key stakeholders such as clinicians and primary care providers. The Project Group is being led by a Consultant Surgeon from outside the region. The process is being supported by ten Clinical Network Leads who have been tasked with overseeing the full range of  planned care services to be provided at the local hospitals, including Monaghan.The HSE has given me an assurance that, in progressing the re-organisation of services, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.

The following table shows the number of medical card holders for each year from 1997 to date, together with the number of GP visit card holders for 2005, 2006 and to date.  There are a number of contextual factors which must be taken into account in interpreting this data.The Health Strategy Quality & Fairness committed to making improvements in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes eligible for the medical card and to give priority to families with children. In November, 2004 I set out my priorities for new health initiatives in 2005 including the provision of medical cards to an additional 30,000 people and GP visit cards to 200,000 people. Funding of €60 million was provided to the HSE  for these measures. The two initiatives were intended to assist those on low and moderate incomes in accessing GP services and to help remove disincentives to people taking up work or progressing to better paying work.  Following the enactment of the necessary legislation and the conclusion of negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, the first GP visit cards were issued by the HSE in November, 2005.Taking holders of medical cards and GP visit cards together, some 1.287m persons (30.2% of the national population) now have access to general practitioner services free of charge.In recent years there have been significant improvements to the way in which people's eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. Since the start of 2005, the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications have increased by a cumulative29%. Other significant changes in 2005 mean that, on a standardised basis nationally, assessment  is now based on an applicant's and spouse's income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child-care and travel to work. Initially the GP visit card guidelines were 25% higher than the medical card guidelines however in June, 2006 I agreed with the HSE to further increase the income  guidelines for GP visit cards and they are now 50% higher than those used for medical cards.The HSE (and before 2005 the health boards) have undertaken a substantial programme of work in recent years to improve data quality in the GMS client database. For example, in 2003 and 2004, work carried out by the health boards led to a deletion of approximately 104,000 inappropriate entries where, for example, there were duplicate entries for the same person, the expiry date on the card had passed, the person had moved away or was deceased. This exercise did not involve any reduction in the actual number of people who held medical cards but rather resulted in a more accurate picture of the number of individuals in receipt of GP services under the GMS Scheme.YearNumber of people  holding medical cardsJune 19971,244,459December 19971,219,852December 19981,183,554December 19991,164,187December 20001,148,055December 20011,199,454December 20021,168,745December 20031,158,143December 20041,148,914December 20051,155,727December 20061,219,829February 20071,227,577YearNumber of people holding GP visit cardsDecember 20052,716December 200647,550February 200759,406

The plan will be updated on a regular basis to reflect the most up to date advice of the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group and international developments.The health service response is based on eight core elements: communications strategy, telephone hotline, responsibilities of the public, surveillance, antiviral drugs, pandemic vaccine, reorganisation of health services, and essential supplies. Significant funding has been allocated to develop contingency plans — €9.3 million in 2005 and €19.3 million in 2006 and 2007. Most of this investment has been put towards the national stockpile of medicines and supplies.The development of a robust emergency plan based on the National Pandemic Influenza Plan is a priority for the Health Service Executive in 2007. The HSE National Service Plan sets out key deliverables  for the development of specific emergency plans for an influenza pandemic across all directorates and functions. In particular these plans should address:For the National Hospitals Office: bed capacity, ventilation capacity, role of private hospitals, ambulance transport requirements;For Primary, Community and Continuing Care: redeployment of staff to support care settings and supports;For Population Health: plans for surveillance, contact tracing, and management of cases.All directorates and functions across the HSE are required to address the issue of redeployment of staff to manage essential services and business continuity issues. In addition, National Procurement will manage the purchase, storage and distribution of the National Stockpile of Medicines and Supplies. Human Resources will manage the industrial relations agenda arising from the pandemic influenza plan. ICT will design, scope and implement the information technology solutions required, for example around the telephone hotline.The implementation of the HSE pandemic influenza plan will be monitored by my Department through the service planning process.The National Pandemic Influenza Plan concentrates on the health response to pandemic influenza but also provides some advice on the planning which must take place across all sectors of society.  In this context, my Department established a Standing Inter-Departmental Committee in 2006 to provide advice on non-health areas of public policy or public services to ensure a coordinated cross-Government response. In addition, my Department is considering legal issues arising from the public health management of pandemic influenza. This work will be a priority in the Department's Business Plan for 2007.

With this in mind, in 2005, I asked the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) set up a number of out-patient pilot projects to seek to reduce waiting times for patients on public hospital waiting lists.  17 hospitals responded and the pilot programme operated successfully; arranging appointments for 4,500 in the last quarter of 2005.  The initiative was expanded in 2006 with 22 public hospitals, from across all regions, referring patients to 13 private hospitals for first-time out-patient consultations.  Nine specialties participated and over 10,000 patients had been provided with out-patient appointments by the end of 2006.  The NTPF proposes to expand the programme again in 2007 and expects to offer appointments to at least 9,500 persons.  I am very pleased with the success to date of the out-patient programme.

The Strategy encompasses all aspects of cancer control, including prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, supportive and palliative care.  This Government is committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy.  I have made available an additional €20.5m this year for cancer control.  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment.The Health Service Executive (HSE) is establishing a National Cancer Control Programme to manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  The Programme will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.Evidence based population based screening programmes are an essential element of the Strategy.  I established a National Cancer Screening Service Board on 1 January this year which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programmes to deliver both programmes nationally.  The total allocation to the new Service is €33m; this is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the services.  The Service will also advise on the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme, specifically on the population to be screened, at what intervals screening should take place, and the requirements for a quality assured and well organised cost effective symptomatic service.

The information to be collected includes:the numbers and identities of people to whom assessments and services were provided;the services provided and the persons providing them;the aggregate needs identified in assessment reports which have not been included in service statements;the numbers of applications for assessment and the number of assessments completed;the numbers of people to whom services have not been provided and the age and disability categories of such persons.As outlined in the Sectoral Plan of my Department which was published in July 2006, Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will commence for children aged less than 5 years with effect from 1st June 2007. From this date it will be the responsibility of the HSE to compile the above information and submit it to the Minister each year, indicating what additional services are required to meet identified needs, what the ideal timeframe for delivery of such services would be and the estimated costs involved.  The report must be published by the HSE within one month of its submission to the Minister.

Funding is being provided for the development of such services on an incremental basis in line with the recommendations in the report and in the context of available resources and workforce planning across the health service.Since October 2001, almost €22 million has been invested in palliative care services. Funding of €13 million (€9m in 2006, €4m in 2007) was provided by the Government for palliative care in Budget 2006. A further €5 million has been allocated in Budget 2007, to develop the service. This funding is being used to improve palliative care services in consultation with the newly established Regional Development Committees and in line with the recommendations made in the report of the National Advisory Committee.A Baseline Study, on the recommendations contained in the Report was carried out and published in March 2006. It tracks services on a regional basis against the recommendations of the 2001 Report. The Study indicates that there are regional variances across the country in the provision of hospice/specialist palliative care. The Government is committed to working with the HSE and other key stakeholders to address the issues raised in the Baseline Study and to develop palliative care services throughout Ireland. The Government's commitment to further developing palliative care countrywide with particular reference to the Baseline Study is reiterated in Towards 2016.

The National Taskforce on Obesity published a report in 2005 containing 93 recommendations to halt the rise in levels of overweight and obesity.The Taskforce recognises that a multi-sectoral approach is necessary, involving other state agencies and government departments and real engagement of the public and private sectors to implement all of the report's recommendations.  My Department is currently finalising proposals for the development of a mechanism which will facilitate inter-sectoral working on the prevention of chronic diseases including obesity.The Health Service Executive has established a Working Group to implement the health sector recommendations of the Task Force on Obesity for which the HSE has the lead responsibility and for which €3 million has been allocated.  In 2006 eight additional posts focussed on obesity were secured and a number of new initiatives commenced and are continuing.In relation to the surveillance and monitoring of obesity, funding has been provided by the HSE to UCD to record height and weight in children at school entry point as part of the Lifeways cohort.  The development of a national database to monitor prevalence trends of growth, overweight and obesity was also funded.  The HSE is working with the Irish Universities Nutritional Alliance to research food and nutrition in children and its determinants.  Funding was also allocated to the Irish Heart Foundation to progress the Action for Life physical activity programme and to undertake a project on marketing of foods to children.National Guidelines for community based practitioners on prevention and management of childhood overweight and obesity were published and launched in December.  Training for primary and community based practitioners on patient centred skills in addressing overweight and obesity was also funded.  New growth charts for children were developed.The Health Service Executive is working with the Community Games Association to integrate Health Promotion as a strategic priority in their strategic plan.  This plan addresses Nutrition and physical Activity as well as other key health promotion topics.  The partnership with the Education Sector is progressing.  The HSE has also developed a strategic alliance with the Irish Sports Council, and have part-funded the Local Sports Partnerships to promote Physical Activity.

In the same period, a total of 175 mental health tribunals were held.  151 mental health tribunals affirmed the involuntary admission/renewal orders and 24 mental health tribunals revoked the involuntary admission/renewal orders.  It is important to note that the total number of tribunals held in this period includes tribunals held for both patients who had, on 1 November 2006, been detained under the Mental Treatment Act 1945 and patients who were involuntarily admitted to an approved centre under the Mental Health Act 2001 in November and December 2006.Section 28 of the Act allows for the discharge of patients by the responsible consultant psychiatrist if he or she is of the opinion that the patient no longer has a mental disorder.  The consultant psychiatrist must notify the patient concerned and his or her legal representative of the entitlement to have his or her detention reviewed by a mental health tribunal if he or she so indicates to the Mental Health Commission within 14 days of the date of his or her discharge.  During November and December 2006, 249 involuntary admission or renewal orders were revoked before the hearing of the mental health tribunal occurred.  It is important to note that these included a number of patients who had been detained under the Mental Treatment Act 1945.The Mental Health Commission has published activity statistics relating to involuntary admissions and mental health tribunal hearings on its website and will update this information on a monthly basis.

It is estimated that there are now in the region of 14,000 people within this category, approximately 10,000 of whom have already applied.The HSE has advised that offers of repayment commenced in November 2006 and that the first payments issued in December 2006 with further payments continuing on an ongoing basis. The HSE has indicated that over €19 million has been repaid to date in respect of 894 payments and that the average repayment is approximately €21,000. In addition, the Scheme Administrator has issued a further 1,537 letters to individuals outlining the calculation of the amount of repayment due on the basis of their applications.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	592	In late 2005, the Health Service Executive (HSE), at my request, undertook a review of tertiary paediatric services.  McKinsey & Company were engaged by the HSE to advise on the future strategic organization of tertiary paediatric services in line with best practice and in the best interests of children.The resulting report — "Children's Health First" — International best practice in tertiary paediatric services: implications for the strategic organization of tertiary paediatric services in Ireland — was presented to the HSE in February 2006. It included a number of key recommendations:The population and projected demands in this country can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospitalIt should be in Dublin, and should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital (i.e. should be within a practical walking distance of such a hospital)It should also provide all the secondary (i.e. less complex) hospital needs of children in the Greater Dublin areaIt should be supported by a strategically-located urgent care service.A Task Group was established in February 2006 to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new hospital.  The Task Group invited the six major Dublin hospitals, including the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital (Tallaght Hospital) to make submissions.The Task Group engaged in extensive consultations with, inter alia, the three existing paediatric hospitals.  Each of the paediatric hospitals expressed strong support for the development of a single paediatric hospital, and emphasized the crucial need for decisions in relation to the new hospital to be taken urgently. Consultant representatives reiterated their commitment to move to the new hospital regardless of its location, a point which appears to have been lost in recent debate.Proposals were also received from a number of private hospitals, property developers and site owners. However, none of the proposals presented by the private interests satisfied the key requirement of co-location with an adult academic teaching hospital.The Task Group concluded that each of the six sites demonstrated the feasibility of accommodating the proposed new paediatric hospital.  However, it was the Task Group's view that Connolly Hospital, St. Vincent's University Hospital and Tallaght Hospital did not offer the same breadth and depth of tertiary services to complement the paediatric hospital as the three other hospitals, and on this basis they were ruled out as co-location options.Following detailed assessment of the three remaining sites in relation to the criterion of ease of access, the Group considered that Beaumont was significantly less suitable than St. James's or the Mater in terms of ease of access, particularly for the children in the greater Dublin area who would have to use the hospital for less complex care.  Consequently, subsequent assessment focused on St. James's and the Mater hospital sites.Based on further assessment, the Task Group recommended that the new National Paediatric Hospital should be developed on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.The Task Group's report and its recommendations were endorsed by the Board of the HSE in June 2006.  At its meeting on 8th June 2006, the Government strongly endorsed the recommendation of the Board of the HSE, in line with the recommendation of the Report of the Task Group, that the new National Paediatric Hospital be developed as an independent hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  The Government has recently reaffirmed this decision.The Government mandated the HSE to move forward with the development of the new hospital and its associated urgent care centres, and to explore any philanthropic proposals in relation to its development.A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group was subsequently established to advance the development of the national tertiary paediatric hospital.The next stage of the process, which is being overseen by the Transition Group, involves the preparation of a high level framework brief for the new hospital.  The brief is being developed for the Transition Group by Rawlinson Kelly & Whittlestone Ltd (RKW), an established UK-based health care planning company.  RKW will be advising on a range of issues which will help to inform the design of the new hospital.  They will be advising, for example, on the preferred model of care, on the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and on the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital.  In this context RKW have been requested to advise, as a priority, on the range of services which should be provided outside of the main hospital through the urgent / ambulatory care service, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children's hospital services.RKW is consulting widely in the course of its work, and in this context the input of all stakeholders will be of benefit in ensuring the delivery of our shared objective of providing a world-class hospital for the children of this country.

It provides human resource information for in excess of 70,000 employees and is used to pay 30,000 employees.The report produced by the Health Service Executive's PPARS Review Committee in September 2006 recommended that, prior to reaching any conclusion on the most appropriate long-term approach to the provision of a comprehensive solution for the HSE's HR and payroll requirements, it would be necessary to maximise the effectiveness of the system in the existing implementation sites and to clearly define the HSE's requirements for the future. This work is now well underway and I understand that it will be concluded by June 2007 and will include a business case and an action plan for the delivery of the HSE's national HR and Payroll solution.In relation to financial system solutions, the HSE has also been examining the most effective means of meeting its requirements in the context of its new unified structure.I am referring the Deputy's question to the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive so that a comprehensive answer to the detailed issues raised can be provided.

The Unions are seeking 39 hours pay for 35 hours work. It is estimated that an additional 4,000 nurses would have to be recruited to maintain existing levels of service if this claim were to be conceded. The increase in the hourly rate would also lead to an increase in the cost of overtime, premium pay and agency nurses. It is estimated that the additional cost in nursing pay terms of conceding this claim would be approximately €250m per annum. This figure does not include the additional superannuation costs associated with employing 4,000 additional staff. If additional suitably qualified staff were not available and the shortfall  had to be made up by the overtime and/or agency nursing the costs would be even higher.The majority of staff in the public health service — approximately 73,000 out of a total of 106,000 staff — currently work a 39 week. Grades who work a 39 hour week include non consultant hospital doctors, emergency medical technicians, social care professionals, health care assistants, catering staff, engineering staff, and others. In the wider public service, groups such as the gardaí and prison officers work 39 or more hours per week.The claim for a reduction in the working week was one of eight claims heard by the Labour Court on 20 June 2006. A Recommendation (LCR 18763) issued on 9 November 2006.  In relation to this claim the Court stated that concession of this claim at this time would have profound consequences for both health care delivery and costs unless effective countervailing measures could be put in place. The Court did recommend that the parties should jointly explore the possibility of initiating an appropriate process aimed at achieving major reorganisation of working arrangements and practices within the health service generally. The Court also stated that such an initiative should take account of and support existing development involving other groups. It held the view that if such a programme of change could be successfully implemented, the efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits accruing may allow this claim to be processed within a reasonable timeframe to be agreed between the parties.I would emphasise that the Labour Court Recommendation has been accepted by the Health Service Employers but regrettably the Unions have stated that they neither accept or reject the Labour Court Recommendation. I arranged for exploratory discussions to be held between all the parties concerned at the offices of the HSE-Employers Agency on 19 January 2007.  The employers indicated their willingness to engage in the process recommended by the Labour Court. While I understand the discussions provided clarity as to the respective positions of the parties the meeting adjourned without agreement on the way forward. I would urge the INO/PNA to give further serious consideration to the Labour Court Recommendation.

Essentially, the policy provides a strategic framework for the promotion of positive recreational opportunities aimed principally at young people aged 12 to 18.  It includes seven core objectives incorporating a series of corresponding actions for priority implementation by various Government Department and Agencies who will have a crucial role to play in their delivery within the overall framework of the national policy.The policy adopts an evidence-based approach and makes proposals to address issues which emerged from a public consultation process which was undertaken by the Office of the Minister for Children (OMC) to give all interested parties, including young people, a chance to have a say in the development of the policy.One of the key aspects of the policy is the provision of more recreational facilities and in particular, the establishment of youth cafés, identified by young people as their single biggest need.  The policy recognises that youth cafés, similar to the GAF in Galway, offer great potential for providing a wide range of developmental, educational and information programmes to young people and that the provision of such services within these settings will require a cross-Departmental and inter-Agency collaborative approach through a formal partnership process.Some provision has been made from within the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Children to support the implementation of the policy in its initial stages.  Other Departments and Agencies will also have a role to play and details will be made available on publication of the policy.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	599	EU food labelling legislation is harmonised by Council Directive 2000/13/EC, as amended.  That directive — as amended — has been transposed into national legislation by the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2002 to 2005.  These regulations apply to the labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer, or for supply to mass caterers, and are based on the principle that food labelling should not mislead consumers.Labelling rules are designed to inform consumers so that they can make informed choices.  Currently, origin labelling is not required for pre-packaged food unless its absence misleads the consumer.  Thus, for example, where other particulars such as a flag or a map other than that of the country of origin are displayed on a label, the true country of origin must be clearly declared to ensure that the consumer is not misled as to the true origin or provenance of the food.Discussions have now commenced on the review of the European horizontal food labelling legislation and country of origin labelling will be considered in this context.  Following consideration of the responses received to the national consultation undertaken last year by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on foot of a European Commission consultative document, and following discussions with the Department of Agriculture and Food, my Department's position is that consideration should be given to the extension of food labelling legislation to provide for a clear indication of the country of origin for all meat and products made substantially from meat.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	600	I propose to take Questions Nos. 164, 205 and 333 together.In 2005, a process was begun to examine all aspects of the drugs supply chain with a view to achieving greater value for money in the pricing and supply of drugs and medicines to the health services and the GMS and community drugs schemes, consistent with patient safety and continuity of supply.  This process was agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children negotiating team was put in place to advance this process.In mid-2006, the negotiating team reached agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI).  Discussions then began with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributors' Federation (PDF), as part of the agreed process on supply to community pharmacies and the health services.  However, PDF advised the State that a legal issue precluded it from negotiating a new margin for distribution to community pharmacies.  The negotiating team then obtained legal advice, which subsequent legal advice to the Department confirmed, that this issue also had implications for negotiations with community pharmacists.The position is as follows. Section 4(1) of the Competition Act, 2002 prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the restriction or distortion of competition, including agreements to fix prices, unless the agreement, decision or concerted practice meets certain conditions. Those conditions are not met in this case. Wholesalers and pharmacy contractors are undertakings.  PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings under Section 4(1) of the Act; the coming together of wholesalers under PDF or pharmacy contactors under the IPU to negotiate prices would be a breach of Section 4(1).  Entering into an agreement, making a decision or being involved in a concerted practice in contravention of Section 4(1) is a criminal offence and would expose those parties, their directors, managers and officers to the risk of criminal prosecution.In light of these factors, it is not possible for the HSE to engage in negotiations with PDF or the IPU in relation to fees or margins.  The HSE has written to all community pharmacy contractors, setting out the position in relation to these issues in detail. The negotiating team is now examining how best to address this issue for pharmacy contractor services.  However, negotiations must comply with the law.  To this end, the team has engaged with the IPU, has set out the legal position and clarified the situation in relation to contract negotiations.   The team is currently considering, in the context of the legal position, proposals from the IPU with a view to agreeing a process for contract review that would comply fully with competition law.  A meeting has been arranged with the IPU at which these issues will be discussed.  It is hoped that this ongoing dialogue will allow this matter to be resolved.With regard to IPU representation of pharmacists, both my Department and the HSE recognise the IPU as the collective representative body for its members.  There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU, within the constraints of the legal advice provided.  I wish to see that dialogue continuing in a constructive manner.

Two new pieces of legislation — the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 and the Disability Act, 2005 form an integral part of this Strategy, along with the suite of six sectoral plans, launched in 2006.One of the most important aspects of my Department's sectoral plan is the arrangements for commencing Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which provides a statutory entitlement to an independent assessment of health and education needs, a statement of the services (Service Statement) which it is proposed to provide, and the right to pursue a complaint through an independent redress mechanism if there is a failure to provide these entitlements.Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will be commenced on a national basis (including Galway) in respect of persons of different ages as follows: for children aged less than 5 years — with effect from 1, June 2007; for children aged 5 years to 18 years  — in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004; for persons aged over 18 years — as soon as possible but no later than 31, December 2011.Services for adults and children will continue to be enhanced progressively over the next number of years. The commitment by the Government to provide a Multiannual Investment programme of some €900m over the period 2006-2009 for disability support services recognises the need to build capacity in the health services to deliver on these obligations.The bulk of this funding, around €720m, is being spent in the health services.  I have allocated €100m in 2006 and a further €100m in 2007 for the continuing development of services for people with a disability.

The Health Service Executive provides over 11m hours of Home Help Hours per year with a budget in excess of €186m.  A significant portion of the service is provided directly by Health Service Executive staff or voluntary organisations on behalf of the Health Service Executive. In some parts of the country where it has been necessary to engage private sector service providers to deliver services on behalf of the Health Service Executive this has been done through a tendering process. Where the Health Service Executive engages private sector providers to deliver Home Help or related services this is done on the basis of a Service Agreement which includes agreed standards of service and care to be provided.  The Health Service Executive monitors the standard of care in line with the service contract.

Further documents were tabled by management but difficulties were encountered, however, in these negotiations due to objections by the medical organisations to arrangements adopted by the Health Service Executive in relation to Category II Consultant appointments.On 25th January 2007 the chairman issued a report to the parties that conveys his opinion that in order for constructive talks to take place: there should be an unequivocal agreement between the parties that there would be unconditional negotiations for a defined period of time; an agreed agenda must be drawn up by the parties; outline responses must be exchanged in writing between the parties on the various issues; a mechanism must be established to deal with issues arising in relation to the current contract; the parties should be represented by smaller teams; confidentiality should be observed by all parties; and the framework within which any agreement could be concluded should be worked out in greater detail.Both parties have agreed to reconvene negotiations.  These talks are scheduled to begin today.  Both I and officials of my Department have been in regular contact with the Health Service Executive regarding the negotiations.  Issues such as the retention of the Category II post will be dealt with in the talks process.  In relation to the costing of the new contract — this will undertaken by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  This body has reviewed the salaries of medical consultants for a number of years and thus has the experience and expertise required to set the appropriate level of remuneration for a new consultant contract.  Finally I am pleased that the negotiations have recommenced today.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I wish to state at the outset that I do not accept IMPACT's criticisms of the running of the health service.  The Health Reform Programme is an ambitious programme which tackles reform across the spectrum including structures, legislation, services, eligibility and HR/IR. Obviously this is an enormous challenge with the ultimate intention of improving services to patients, and one which will require our continuing commitment over a number of years.  Nevertheless, there has been significant progress, for example, the HSE and the Office of the Minister for Children have been established, and my Department has been restructured. Major advances have also been made in modernising and strengthening the regulatory framework underpinning service delivery and patient care.The Health Bill 2006 will establish The Health Information Quality Authority on a statutory basis.  HIQA will provide an independent review of quality and performance, and its analysis will inform policy development within my Department.  It will also undertake health technology assessments and will evaluate information on health and social services and the health and welfare of the population and advise both myself and the HSE on deficiencies identified. The Bill will extend the remit of the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services to provide for older people and for people with disabilities.The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance was established and has been asked to report to me by mid-2008 with proposals in a number of areas including more effective reporting of adverse incidents, a system of licensing of public and private providers of health care and a clearer role for patients and carers in giving feedback on the care received.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the statutory registration of a range of allied health professionals and will underpin the delivery of safe and high quality services to members of the public.  Consideration of appointments to the Health & Social Care Professionals Council is now at an advanced stage.The Medical Practitioners Bill 2007 provides for an enhanced and modern system of regulation of the medical profession in Ireland. It is in the interests of patients and doctors alike that a modern, accountable and efficient system of regulation is in place.  The provisions within the Medical Practitioners Bill will achieve that goal.Legislation enabling Nurse Prescribing has been enacted, and Regulations have been drafted and notified to the EU in order to make its introduction a reality in 2007.  More broadly, considerable work has been done in preparing draft new legislation to update the existing regulatory framework for the nursing profession.There has also been significant progress relating to service delivery, for example, up to 100 Primary Care Teams are now coming on stream in a number of areas around the country, enabling the Primary Care Model to be demonstrated in action while allowing practical experience to be gained from the process involved in developing these teams and providing expanded services  in the community.In relation to Acute Hospitals/Services there is a broad objective to ensure that people are not inappropriately admitted to hospital and where admission is appropriate that the patient stay is for the minimum period necessary and the outcomes are the optimum that can be achieved for the patient. This objective is being achieved via targeted improvements in A&E Services/ Departments plus capital investment, out of hours GP co-operatives, and improved waiting times for most common surgical procedures.In regard to older people, €55 million was allocated in Budget 2006 towards the ongoing provision of home care packages and community supports into 2007. Funding of €88 million was provided for public and private beds for long-term residential care, over the period 2006/2007, including €6 million to strengthen nursing home subvention.In addition, in relation to the implementation of the Disability Act, the multi-annual investment programme provides for cumulative investment of €900 million in services for people with disabilities over the period 2006 to 2009.The aforementioned examples are just some aspects of the reform programme. I do not suggest that the programme is complete, or that service delivery is where we want it to be. However, while recognising the challenges that face us, we should also recognise the progress that has been made.

From the research available in this country, however, asthma is a common childhood condition with approximately 10% having experienced an attack of asthma.  Similar to other European countries, the level of asthma has increased and is now approximately 20% in young teenagers.There are a variety of risk factors for asthma including environmental and genetic factors.  Ireland's involvement included the European Union's Joint Research Council initiative on childhood asthma and the co-ordination of an EU approach under the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2004.  Ireland has participated in international prevalence studies on asthma and there is ongoing work on the development of information systems on asthma.In recent years, the Health Research Board has funded a number of proposals relating to asthma and respiratory disease.  Legislation on smoking at work has also provided greater protection from toxic tobacco smoke which contributes to asthma.

The actions necessary to improve the quality and availability of health information are set out in the National Health Information Strategy (NHIS).  In line with NHIS recommendations, the Health Bill 2006 provides for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) which will have a key role in health information development in terms of setting standards, evaluating the information currently available, identifying gaps and deficiencies and advising on appropriate priority developments.  The issue, therefore, of the need or otherwise for the establishment of databases along the lines suggested in the question will be one for consideration, in the first instance, by the new Authority.

Judge Clark was also requested to advise on a mechanism for ensuring maximum recoupment from wrongdoers and indemnifiers of any monies payable under an agreed redress scheme; including the estimated cost of the scheme.  I will shortly be bringing Judge Clark's proposals to the Government for consideration and decision.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	614	The development of Services for Older People is a priority for the Government.  This is reflected in the funding committed to services for older people in Budgets 2006 and 2007.  Last year, the Government funded the largest ever expansion in services for older people with a full year cost of €150m.  This year a full year package of €255m has been allocated for services for older people.  This gives a total of over €400m added to services for older people over two years.Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.There is a complementary link between Government policy in the area of the care of older people and in care for people with dementia.  Both policies stress the need to provide support in dignity and independence, through the provision of appropriate services to the people concerned and their carers. The Government is fully committed to providing such support and service improvement, including the expansion of community and residential care services for people with Dementia. This commitment was reflected in the additional funding of approximately €109 million in Budget 2006 and €82 million in Budget 2007 which was allocated to community supports for older people including those with dementia. These supports include Home Care Packages, Home Help Scheme and Respite Care.The additional funding provided for Home Care Packages and the Home Help Scheme will further enhance the supports available to families caring for people with dementia at home. In 2006 a total of 2,000 extra Home Care Packages were provided at a full year cost of €55 million (prior to this date only 1,100 packages had been in operation on a pilot basis).  A similar increase in the number of packages will be provided in 2007, benefiting some 4,000 people. An additional €21 million was provided for 2007 to fund the cost of some 780,000 additional home help hours in 2007.  This brings the total funding allocated to home helps to approximately €171 million per annum.Among the areas where funding has been provided are day care and respite care which are an integral part of delivering a comprehensive community service for older people. Day care and respite care offer respite for family members and/or carers and provide social stimulation in a safe environment for older people with mild forms of dementia. The provision of an additional €9 million in a 2006 allowed for 1,325 additional places per week in these centres together with additional programmes for specific needs such as activity therapy. It also means that many day care centres can increase the number of days per week they open. Additional funding of €3.5 million provided in Budget 2007 will cater for a further 1,100 day places per week in day care centres.The Government's sustained high level of investment in healthcare has enabled the completion and commissioning of numerous new facilities in both the acute and the non-acute sectors. This year, the sum available for expenditure in health under the Health Service Executive's capital plan is €559.5 million and over the period of the National Development Plan the figure is €4.9 billion.The HSE has responsibility for the planning and management of capital projects in the health sector, including the development of services for people suffering from dementia. The Department of Health and Children received the Health Service Executive's Capital Plan for 2007 on 17 January 2007.  The Plan is presently being evaluated with a view to its approval by my Department and the Department of Finance. The Health Service Executive will announce details of the approved capital programme following this process.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	615	There were 78 wide ranging recommendations emerging from the 2004 Strategic Task Force on Alcohol (STFA) Report.  Responsibility for their implementation fell across a broad range of Government Departments and Agencies. The Government approved the implementation of the recommendations and the various Ministers were asked to pursue implementation of the recommendations appropriate to their Departments.Some progress has been made in relation to the recommendations, for example: random Breath Testing was introduced in 2006; the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 responded to a number of recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol.  It contains a number of provisions on the serving of alcohol to intoxicated customers, the prohibiting of "happy hours" and the restriction of children at certain times and circumstances from licensed premises; a Voluntary Code of Practice on Alcohol Advertising has been agreed between the Department of Health and Children and the drinks, media and advertising industries. This addresses many of the concerns in relation to the placement of alcohol advertisements. The establishment by the drinks industry of Central Copy Clearance Ireland addresses the issue of the content of alcohol advertisements. A Monitoring Body has been established to oversee the implementation of and adherence to the Voluntary Code and will report to the Minister in the Spring 2007; in relation to community mobilisation resources have been allocated to the Health Service Executive to support the development of community mobilisation projects. The Government recently approved the allocation of €940,000 from the Dormant Accounts Fund to support 17 community based projects aimed at tackling Alcohol Related Harm; the Responsible Server Training Programme was developed in association with the Drinks Industry Group. This programme is now being delivered by the hospitality training body FAILTE; the Health Service Executive continues to roll out alcohol awareness campaigns which are effective in developing media attention, generating public awareness of the issue in addition to developing programmes, initiatives and disseminating a range of relevant materials; and research projects have been undertaken and continue to be undertaken to monitor and inform alcohol policy decision-making.Sustaining Progress Working Group on Alcohol.Further impetus was added to the implementation of the Task Force recommendations with the establishment in July 2005 of a Working Group under the Sustaining Progress Special Initiative on Alcohol and Drugs Misuse.  Its aim was to mobilise stakeholders through social partnership to achieve a targeted and measurable reduction in alcohol misuse. Their Report entitled "Working Together to Reduce the Harms Caused by Alcohol Misuse" was published in June 2006 and it agreed on a programme of actions to deliver targeted results in relation to underage drinking, binge drinking and drink driving. The report included recommendations on issues such as community mobilisation, workplace alcohol policies, advertising, labelling and education and awareness.  An Implementation Group has now been established to monitor and report on progress on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report. The Implementation Group's membership comprises key stakeholders in Government Departments and Agencies and the Social Partners and is expected to report by the end of 2007.This Department along with the Health Service Executive (HSE) are working closely together to advance the recommendations of the Sustaining Progress Working Group.  In parallel the Department and the HSE have undertaken to review progress on the implementation of the STFA recommendations and to provide a co-ordinated response to the continuing problems associated with problematic alcohol use in Ireland.

The Report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the sector, including the regulation of therapists. The Report noted that "the complementary and alternative therapy community in Ireland is a very disparate one with a broad range of levels of expertise, training and level of association with other practitioners and/or international organisations." It goes on to say that compared with other countries Ireland is at an early stage of forming solid frameworks of associations and federations with which to link and to govern the sector.The Report makes a number of recommendations on future measures for strengthening the regulatory environment for complementary therapists.  These range from a working group to examine statutory registration for a small number of therapies to facilitated workdays and symposia for different therapies to develop greater unity and harmonisation.Facilitated work days are being organised at present for some of the therapy groups and it is hoped to start these in February–March of this year. It is expected that a number of different therapy associations will come together to undertake a process of harmonisation and development. This will lead to greater unity in the complementary therapy sector and within each individual therapy. It is hoped that the facilitated work days will encourage agreement between different groups for each therapy on common basic standards of practice, education and training. It is also expected that greater unity within the sector will provide a common voice for individual therapies and a common source of information for public, thereby making it easier for consumers to make a judgement on complementary therapies and therapists.At the same time as the launch of the report, an Information Guide for the public on Complementary Therapy was also launched. This is in keeping with my belief that providing information for consumers of complementary therapy services will play an important part in protecting public safety. The leaflet was prepared following concerns that patients who have a serious illness should be aware of the importance of consulting their doctor even if they are attending a complementary therapist. The leaflet will help people to choose wisely to safeguard their health and its key message is that if people have a condition which could need medical treatment they should visit their doctor first.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	617	The Primary Care Strategy aims to develop services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.It has been estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.Wider implementation of the Primary Care Strategy will focus on developing new ways of working and of reorganising the resources already available to the health service in line with the service model described in the Strategy.  This whole-system approach to implementation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service, and not solely within primary care itself.The HSE received an additional €16m in funding in 2006 to enable the establishment of up to 100 Primary Care Teams in development, to provide for the establishment of additional GP training places and to enhance GP out-of-hours co-ops.  A further €25m is being provided in 2007 to meet the full year costs of the 2006 developments and to enable a further 100 Primary Care Teams in development to be established. This is in addition to development funding already provided of €5m in 2002, €2m in 2003 and €5m in 2005 and brings the total additional revenue funding specifically related to the Primary Care Strategy to €53m. Capital funding of €2.725m  and €1.8m in respect of ICT supports was provided to support the development of the initial ten "pilot" primary care teams approved in 2002.  It should be noted that new and existing funding provided under other headings will also be used to support the development and delivery of services in line with the principles of the Strategy.

Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular issue raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	619	There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements are made to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.   My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service. While considerable work has taken place to develop arrangements which would ensure that no top-up charges are applied, it is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements and the process by which they are arrived at comply with the terms of the Competition Act 2002.   In this context legal advice is at present being sought in relation to the permissibility of negotiating contractual fee arrangements with organisations representing self-employed health professionals.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for chiropody services, it is the appropriate body to consider the  matter raised by the Deputy in relation to access to chiropody services for elderly people in public nursing homes.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	620	My Department published the Report of the Working Group on Diabetes, "Prevention and Model for Patient Care" in early 2006 and the Health Service Executive has been working actively to progress the recommendations of the Working Group.Following the publication of the Report, the recommendations have been considered by the Management Team of the Primary, Community and Continuing Care Directorate. The Management Team has identified the following priorities for Primary, Community and Continuing Care Services:To audit and assess current provision in the local health areas and the Administrative Areas;To identify Best Practice;The Development of local registers;The identification of high risk patients;Development of the working arrangements between the HSE and the voluntary sector;The further roll-out of the screening programme for diabetic retinopathy;The Chief Executive of the HSE has identified the establishment of Expert Advisory Groups as a major step in the Reform programme which is about making things better for the people using our services. The purpose of the Expert Advisory Groups (EAG) is to bring the expertise of the clinical and health community and the voice of patients, clients and service users to a more influential role within the HSE. These EAGs will play an influential role in crafting a strategic vision of their areas of focus.The HSE established an Expert Advisory Group on Diabetes in October 2006. This group has identified a number of priority issues which it will focus on initially and that will be incorporated into a wider strategy for implementation in relation to Diabetes Care.In addition my Department and the HSE are working to put in place a series of measures to manage the health impacts of chronic disease generally in the population.These measures include: the development of a comprehensive, integrated chronic disease policy framework which will view chronic disease as a continuum with "upstream" action on the avoidable cause of disease, disability and premature death as well as "downstream" action to improve the health and quality of life of those already suffering from the condition; comprehensive patient registration systems; the development of shared care models for each condition under a disease management programme; the development and use of evidence-based clinical guidelines for each condition; a Self-Care Management Programme; evaluation Protocols.

The allocation of the increased budget is currently being determined by the HSE.  This Department met with the HSE recently to discuss the allocation of funding in this area and a further meeting is to take place next week with the Directors of the two main NGO networks in this area, the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland and the National Network of Women's Refuges and Support Services.Two early decisions have been taken.  Firstly, Women's Aid has been allocated an extra €70k to develop its helpline service and, secondly, allocations will be made to meet shortfalls experienced by membership organisations of the two networks named above.  An audit is ongoing in the HSE to determine the funding requirements within this sector.  The outcomes of this audit, together with needs identified by the two national networks, will inform the HSE in the optimum allocation of the remainder of the increased allocation.

This Government is committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy.  I have made available an additional €20.5m this year for cancer control.This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes €3.5m to support the initial implementation of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.  The Programme will manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  It will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.  The Service Plan of the HSE for this year sets out the detailed deliverables of the Programme.  This includes the establishment of the leadership team to implement the Programme, including the Director of the Programme and key medical leaders at network level.  I have allocated an additional €3.25m this year to support the implementation of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.  This will support the appointment of additional Consultant Radiation Oncologists, Specialist Registrars and support staff.   The National Cancer Registry has been allocated an additional €0.4m this year and €0.35m has been allocated to the Health Research Board for All-Ireland-NCI Cancer Consortium activities, including a cancer biobanking initiative and further support for the clinical trials initiative.Evidence based population based screening programmes are an essential element of the Strategy.  I established a National Cancer Screening Service Board on 1 January this year.  The total allocation to the new Service is €33m, a 71% increase on the funding available in 2006.  This includes €8m which has been allocated this year for the roll out of the national breast screening programme to the West and South which will commence this Spring and €5m to commence the roll out of a national cervical screening programme later this year.  The Service will also advise on the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	623	Evidence based population based screening programmes are an essential element of the National Cancer Control Strategy which was published last June.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) is establishing a National Cancer Control Programme to manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  The Programme will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.In relation to screening for prostate cancer, the National Cancer Forum has recommended that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population based prostate screening programme in this country.  The Forum has recommended that this issue should be reassessed when the results are available from randomised trials currently being conducted.This position is consistent with the Recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for healthcare resources.  The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.Appropriate treatment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer is available at major hospitals throughout the country.  Any man who has concerns in relation to prostate cancer should contact his GP who will, where appropriate, refer him to the appropriate services in his area.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	624	Based on the recent studies in relation to radon exposure, the WHO has established an International Radon Project (IRP) in which over 20 countries, including Ireland have formed a network of partners to identify and promote programmes that reduce the health impact of radon. The IRP will be issuing detailed recommendations on radon risk reduction which will be examined by my Department in due course.The vast majority of lung cancer deaths, including those deaths that are linked to radon, are among people who smoke, and non-smokers are at a low risk of contracting the disease.  Programmes aimed at smoking cessation will help to maintain this fall in smoking rates among adults and will give rise to a significant reduction in the lung cancer deaths in future years. The Office of Tobacco Control support my policy by discharging a variety of functions including conducting research into tobacco and communicating the findings, organising a national inspection programme and enforcing the tobacco control laws generally.However the priority is to continue with the identification and remediation of homes with higher concentrations of radon to ensure that the current figures can be lowered.

In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The report makes a very welcome contribution to the debate on the best way to finance our healthcare needs. The Adelaide Society is to be congratulated on taking the initiative and producing such a report. Previous Governments have examined the question of moving from a healthcare system financed from general taxation to one funded by universal health insurance or universal social insurance. These Governments came to the conclusion that we should continue to finance healthcare from general taxation.This Government is committed to ensuring that patients with similar needs are treated equally and while I agree that we need to have a debate on the issues raised in the Adelaide report, I believe that our priority now is to consolidate the reform process which is already in train.In this regard, work is underway on a new legislative framework to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility and entitlement for health and personal social services. The aim is to produce a clear set of statutory provisions that ensure equity and transparency and to bring the system up to date with developments in service delivery and technology that have occurred since the Health Act 1970.

The Scheme offers two types of funding:Stage 1 offers  a pre-development grant of up to €5,000 to enable qualifying applicants investigate the need for CCTV in their area and to complete a detailed proposal, for submission under Stage 2.Stage 2 is a direct Application Process for organisations who consider that they can develop and deliver a CCTV Programme immediately.  It enables communities to avail of grant aid funding of up to €100,000 from this Department to install a CCTV system in their area.  In addition, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has given a commitment to provide successful applications from RAPID areas with a further grant to a maximum of €100,000 subject to the total grant-aid from both Departments not exceeding €200,000 or 100% of the capital costs of the project, whichever is the lesser.Pobal have been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department.  A new round of funding under the Community Based CCTV Scheme was advertised on 1 December 2006. The closing date for applications has been set at 28 February 2007.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,298 (or 21.5%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training as at the 31 December 2006 was 14,068. Furthermore, I should say that in December, 2006 as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of 275 new recruits per quarter into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Clonmany Garda Station which covers the Parish of Clonmany on 16 February, 2007 was 2 (all ranks). Clonmany Garda Station forms part of Buncrana District. The personnel strength of Buncrana District on 31 December 2006 was 86 (all ranks).I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Clonmany area will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.

I understand that the local community policing unit has a good relationship with the residents.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that current policing plans in the area are designed to achieve, inter alia, the prevention of anti-social and public order offences, the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area.

The circumstances of the school were fully considered in this assessment.The planning and consultation procedures for the prison development at Thornton Hall are set out in the Prison Bill 2006 currently before this House. These procedures will require the publication of an Environmental Impact Statement which will address all the relevant issues including the proposed access arrangements and all of the relevant background information including detailed traffic surveys etc.This Environmental Impact Statement will be published and members of the public will have the opportunity to comment.

When policy underlying the Act was being formulated, consideration was given to the matter of expenses but it was decided that expenses should not be paid as performance of jury service was considered to be a basic civic duty which arose relatively infrequently as far as the individual is concerned.  That policy has been retained by successive Governments.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	646	Amnesty International's Action Briefing on Mental Health Policy of October 2006 deals primarily with issues concerning mental health, which is a matter more appropriately addressed to the Minister for Health and Children.One of the recommendations in Amnesty's document is a call for the implementation of the recommendations made by the Equality Authority in its 2005 report, "Implementing Equality for Carers". Of the recommendations made in the Equality Authority's report, three are relevant to my Department. Recommendation 6.4 asks that government departments and state agencies should support and implement equality proofing of policies and programmes which should include a specific focus on carers, driven by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Equality Authority through the Equality Proofing Working Group. The Group, on which the Equality Authority is represented, is to examine the issue under its work programme.Recommendations 6.6 and 6.7 ask for amendments to the current equality legislation.Recommendation 6.6 asks for a review and change of the definition of carers under the family status ground in the equality legislation. The Equality Authority asks that a new definition should encompass the full diversity of carers, resident and non-resident and providing continuing or intermittent care, and reflect and support models of shared caring alongside any focus on a primary carer.Recommendation 6.7 asks for further development of the equality legislation to include a positive duty on the public sector to have due regard to equality. It also asks for the equality legislation to be extended to include a requirement on all employers and service providersto make reasonable accommodation across all grounds, including carers, as is currently the situation with the disability ground;to pursue a planned and systematic approach to promoting equality and combating discrimination, andto give due consideration to the flexible working arrangements requested by employees who have caring responsibilities.Equality legislation is kept under constant review by my Department. The specific issues raised in the report above by the Equality Authority and endorsed by Amnesty International are issues which would have to be addressed by the social partners. In this context I should point out that one of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement "Towards 2016" is the development of a National Carer's Strategy. This strategy, which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community, will be developed by the end of 2007. All relevant Departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.

The Garda Fleet is currently undergoing a major investment programme and an expansion in specific areas which will target organised crime, public order and traffic in particular.   The total spend for 2006 on the purchase of 1,378 new vehicles to upgrade the fleet was €27.45 million resulting in the renewal of over half of the entire Garda fleet in just a single year. Further investment is planned for this year including the purchase of additional motorbikes which will make a significant contribution to traffic law enforcement.The more detailed information sought by the Deputy has been requested from the Garda Authorities and I will revert directly to the Deputy when it is to hand.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	657	The Sex Offenders Act, 2001 which commenced on 27 September 2001 sets out the notification obligations on persons convicted of a range of sexual offences against both children and adults.  A convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to the Garda Síochána within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison.Thereafter, the offender must notify the Gardaí of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any twelve month period must also be given to the Gardaí.The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries or who have been convicted abroad of an offence comparable to one covered by the Act.Additional measures contained in the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 makes it mandatory for a convicted sex offender to inform their employer or future employer of their conviction if their job entails having unsupervised access to children.  The Act also allows for a Chief Superintendent of An Garda Síochána to request the Court to make a Sex Offender Order, whereby a sex offender can be prohibited from behaving in a particular way, where such behaviour is perceived by the Court as having a potential danger to the welfare of children.  It should be noted that Garda clearance is now required for potential employees in a number of occupations which entail access to, or authority over children.If the court imposed an order for post-release supervision, Part 5 of the 2001 Act obliges the convicted person to undergo supervision by the Probation Service for a specified period and to comply with such conditions that are specified therein.  Offenders who are subject to a post release supervision Order are managed on a one-to-one basis by a Probation Officer.   Should a sex offender fail to comply with obligations as outlined in the Act, the offender is guilty of an offence and subject to a fine and/or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months.I can advise the Deputy that my Department through the Probation Service provides funding to a community based sex offender programme specifically for convicted sex offenders who abuse children.   I can further advise that the Probation Service has two officers directly involved in the delivery of adolescent sex offender programmes in both North and South Dublin.   In addition, the Service is involved in the management and organisation of a community based adolescent sex offender programme based in the west of Ireland.I also wish to advise the Deputy that in advance of release, there are three forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to prisoners serving sentences for sexual offences which assist in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention.  These are:individual counselling from the Irish Prison Service's Psychology Service and from the Probation Servicethe Sex Offender Programme which has been in operation since 1994; andone-to-one interventions by visiting psychiatrists who provide support to prisoners.Before an offender is released from prison, the Prison Service must inform him/her that they are subject to the notification requirement of the Act. Ten days before the date of release, the Prison Service must inform the Garda Síochána that s/he is being released.There is a system in place whereby Child Care Managers in the Health Service Executive are informed, by the Senior Probation Officer, of the impending release of sex offenders from prisons irrespective of whether the offence is against a child or adult.   The Child Care Manager is provided with the date of release, details of the offence committed and address of  the offender following release.A ‘Protocol for the sharing of information on the management of sex offenders between the Probation Service and the Probation Board for Northern Ireland (PBNI)' was signed by the Heads of both Organisations in March, 2006.  That protocol established mutual arrangements for the management of sex offenders, subject to supervision by the respective Services.    This protocol facilitates best practice and effective case management of sex offenders between jurisdictions by enabling exchange of relevant information on a structured and agreed basis.In additional, I also wish to advise the Deputy that on 27 November, 2006 I signed a Memorandum of Understanding on information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK relating to sex offenders.The MOU was negotiated between my Department and the Home Office, with input from the Northern Ireland Office. It relates to information about persons travelling between Ireland and the UK and who are subject to sex offender notification requirements in their own jurisdiction.  This covers sex offenders travelling between any of the legal jurisdictions in these islands.  The rationale for the Memorandum is that such information will be shared between police forces for the purposes of protecting the public from the risks presented by sex offenders — whether paedophile or otherwise — and investigating serious sexual offences.  The transmission of any information necessary to achieve these purposes is covered.As a result of the MOU, the exchange of such information between the Garda Síochána and British police forces, which of course has already been taking place for some time, is now being put on a formal footing.  The information will now be shared as a matter of course.This Memorandum of Understanding is another example of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK and in particular between the two parts of this island.  It is also the most recent example of the benefits which accrue to both sides through cooperation and coordination in the areas of criminal justice and law enforcement.As the MOU provides, its use and effectiveness will be kept under review, and I am confident that full use will be made of its potential by the police forces of all our jurisdictions.A Registered Sex Offender Advisory Group has been established consisting of representatives of An Garda Síochána, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Northern Ireland Office.  As part of its work, this Group evaluates the potential for sharing information, examining the registration criteria in both jurisdictions for sex offenders and identifying areas for further co-operation.The provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 are kept under constant review by my Department with a view to ensuring the Act is operating in an efficient and effective manner.

If s/he did not intend to stay away for more than seven days but did, s/he must inform the Gardaí within a further seven days.The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries or who have been convicted abroad of an offence comparable to one covered by the Act.Part 4 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides that it is an offence for convicted sex offenders to apply for, or to accept, work or to offer services, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of unsupervised access to, or contact with, children or mentally impaired persons, without informing the employer or organisation of his/her conviction for a qualifying sexual offence.It is an offence to fail to comply with the notification requirements. The penalty is imprisonment for up to 12 months or a fine of €1,900 or both.The courts can also sentence an offender who has been found guilty of an offence under the schedule of offences in the Act to a period of statutory supervision under the Probation and Welfare Service on their release from prison.Before an offender is released from prison, the Prison Service must inform him/her that they are subject to the notification requirement of the Act. Ten days before the date of release, the Prison Service must inform the Garda Síochána that s/he is being released.The Garda Síochána has in place a system for the monitoring of persons subject to these requirements. The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit monitor and manage the notification provisions. The information on persons who are subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 is maintained at a central location.There are nominated Garda Inspectors in each Garda Division who are notified by the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit when a sex offender, who is subject to the requirements of the Act, is resident in their Division. These inspectors are responsible for the monitoring of such offenders.On 27 November, 2006 I signed a Memorandum of Understanding on information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK relating to sex offenders.The MOU was negotiated between my Department and the Home Office, with input from the Northern Ireland Office.

The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have requested the CSO to provide the information sought by the Deputy, in relation to 2006, directly to him.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	661	I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 to 246, inclusive, together.An application for Leave to Remain in the State made pursuant to Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 arises where a non-Irish  national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3 (3) (a) of the Immigration Act, 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent to deport is afforded three options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary Leave to Remain in the State be granted instead.In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996. Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned. Statistics are not maintained in a way which distinguishes between those who have made an application for leave to remain and those who have not. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that many of those who failed the asylum process, and who did not opt to return voluntarily or consent to deportation, nonetheless left the State before a decision to deport or grant leave to remain was made.It is not uncommon for persons with leave to remain applications under the eleven criteria of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, and for persons with alternative leave to remain applications made under different and separate criteria, to make subsequent applications for residency in the State on other grounds such as marriage or familial association to an Irish/E.U. national. Given the multiplicity of application grounds, it is not possible — without disproportionate use of resources — to separate out the applications according to the various grounds.

They have the same rights of access to the Republic of Ireland as a citizen of an existing EU member state with the exception of access to the labour market.It is not necessary for Bulgarian or Romanian citizens to register their presence in the State. This applies both to new arrivals and to those already here. I wish to advise the Deputy that all pending applications from Bulgarians and Romanians for temporary leave to remain in the State made pursuant to either Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, or using other criteria, have now fallen away and will remain unprocessed. This decision was taken as a direct consequence of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	667	Under my Department's Decentralisation Programme, around nine hundred posts are scheduled to transfer from twelve agencies to seven locations around the country.To date, one hundred and thirteen civil servants from within my Department have been re-assigned to provincial locations.  By the second half of this year, we will have a presence in all seven locations when over four hundred posts will have moved. This will account for 46% of my Department's overall target with three years of the programme still to run.During this phase of my Department's programme, thirteen people have transferred from a non-Dublin office for training,  spending on average eight weeks in Dublin for that purpose.The information sought by the Deputy in respect of staff who transferred prior to their decentralisation assignment cannot be compiled without the usage of a disproportionate amount of staff resources which would not be warranted.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	668	I understand the Deputy is seeking information on the terms of the stamp duty relief for farm consolidation.Stamp duty relief in respect of exchanges of farmland between two farmers for the purposes of consolidating each farmer's holdings was introduced in the Finance Act 2005.  Because of the limited take-up of farm consolidation relief in the 18 months since its introduction, it was decided in the recent Budget to extend the relief to qualifying exchanges of land where only one farmer is consolidating his/her holding.  In such cases both farmers would qualify for relief, provided both farmers meet all other conditions of the relief.However, one of the main difficulties with the take-up of this relief relates to the requirement to exchange land between two farmers.  Therefore, in further consultation with the my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and the farming industry, it has been decided to put forward an amendment at Committee Stage of the 2007 Finance Bill to introduce a new relief where only one farmer acquires and disposes of qualifying land within an 18 month period from the first qualifying transaction.  Relief would be applied on the difference in the consideration, where the land acquired is greater in value than the land disposed of.  Where the consideration for the disposal is greater or equal to the consideration for the acquisition, there would be no stamp duty liability.As with the existing relief, under the new arrangements the farmer must farm and retain the land acquired and the land being exchanged must be approved by Teagasc as having consolidated the farm concerned.However, commencement of the new relief will be dependent on State Aid approval from the European Commission.

Donegal.The position regarding access to adjoining properties by nearby residents is that ad hoc local permission was granted by An Garda Síochána from time to time as a "gesture of goodwill" to access their properties through the Garda station property.  No legal rights way exist on the said property.If the Garda station is considered surplus to requirements in the future it will be offered for sale on the open market.  It will then be a matter between any new owner of the property and the nearby residents to agree access issues of the land referred to.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	670	I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 257 together.Section 34 of the Finance Act 2005 introduced a number of changes to the capital allowance regime for hotels, guesthouses, holiday hostels and holiday camps.  Guesthouses and holiday hostels were specifically brought into the capital allowances regime for the first time.  Also, the entitlement to the capital allowances was provided for the first time on the basis of buildings being registered in the appropriate Fáilte Ireland register.Following the Finance Act 2005 changes, the Revenue administrative practice of granting capital allowances in respect of buildings and structures erected in registered caravan parks was reviewed in consultation with my Department and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. As a result of these deliberations, the Revenue Commissioners decided that retention of a non-statutory scheme on behalf of caravan parks was not appropriate and decided to withdraw it with effect from 1 January 2006. Allowances in respect of expenditure incurred before that date are not affected.It should be noted that some of the expenditure that would typically be incurred by these caravan park operators may be eligible for the "plant and machinery" capital allowances but this would not generally include any buildings or structures.I have no plans at this time to extend the existing regime of capital allowances to registered caravan and camping parks. However, I will bear  this matter  in mind for future consideration.

Of those in Tullamore, ninety-one (91) moved to my Department to decentralise to Tullamore.  The data available in my Department on the previous careers of these staff do not indicate in all cases the previous locations of staff or whether or not they had an earlier transfer within a two year period of the decentralisation transfer.  However, nineteen (19) of these staff came to Dublin for training prior to moving to Tullamore.

A backlog arose during the early years of the Office when, due to a combination of factors, the rate of receipt of applications for review exceeded the rate at which decisions could be issued.  The number of cases on hands reached a high of 796 at the end of 2003 and now stands at 301. The Office intends to reduce this figure significantly further during 2007.The length of time taken to deal with each application received by the Office depends on the complexity of the issues on which decisions are required and the volume of records involved.   However, in 2005 (the latest year for which figures are available) 68% of cases were completed within 3 months, compared to 60% and 59% in 2004 and 2003 respectively.My Department does not have any request on hands from the Office of the Information Commissioner for the appointment of additional staff to that Office.

The vast majority of the c. 1,600 Office of Public Works staff concerned (i.e. c. 94%) have already had their pensions revised in line with the latest pay increase awarded to the State industrial sector, effective from the 1st of June 2006.  It is anticipated that data for all remaining staff will be furnished to the Pay Master General's Office by late March 2007.  Due to the nature of the pension scheme, all of the pensions for industrial staff have to be calculated manually and on an individual basis. This is complicated and time consuming work involving inter alia, inclusion of calculations on items as diverse as clothing allowances, housing emoluments and overtime. The work is being done as quickly as resources, including overtime utilisation, permits.The next set of pay increases and consequent pension revisions, due from the 1st of December 2006, is contingent on the outcome of the verification process for State industrial employments, which at present is being considered by the Civil Service Performance Verification Group.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	676	As the Deputy will be aware, Section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides tax relief at the standard rate of tax (20%), up to certain specified maximum amounts, to individuals who pay for private rented accommodation that is used as their sole or main residence.However, tax relief is not available in respect of tenancies held from Local Authorities.  Responsibility for rent schemes was devolved to local authorities in August 1986. The principles governing rent schemes are broadly as follows:the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income householdsallowances should be made for dependent children including those under 21 years of age in full-time educationa contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners in the householdprovision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship andappropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwelling and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.Within these broad principles, authorities have discretion as to the types of income to be taken into account in the assessment of rents and how to deal with hardship cases, poverty traps and any other anomalies that arise in individual cases.  By definition, local authority rents should reflect ability to pay.  They bear no relation to economic rents in the private sector.Local authority rents are heavily subsidised at present. In my view, it would not be appropriate, on the one hand, to provide subsidised housing to a person, at a rent which takes full account of ability to pay, and also offer a further subsidy through the tax system.  Furthermore, among the other advantages which local authority tenants enjoy are greater security of tenure vis- a- vis the wider rental sector and the right to buy the property at a market discount.

In relation to the issue of reducing VAT rates for a certain category of consumer, the position is that the rate of VAT which applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the status of the consumer.Under the VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. As the majority of defibrillators were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991 it is not possible to apply the zero rate to the supply of such products. Implantable defibrillators are subject to the zero rate.In addition, Member States may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. The reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators.Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the Standard VAT rate of 21%.

The stamp duty code generally does not provide exemptions based on an individual's particular circumstances and introducing such a provision would represent a significant departure from normal stamp duty rules.  However, I have been advised by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government that a scheme of disabled persons grants is operated by local authorities with capital provision from that Department. These grants are designed to meet the needs of persons who are either physically handicapped or are suffering from severe mental handicap or severe mental illness. Where a new dwelling is being bought or built a maximum grant of €12,700 is payable. In the case of adaptation of an existing dwelling, 90% of the approved cost of the works is available up to an effective maximum grant of €20,320.  Full details of the scheme and the conditions applicable are available from the local authority in whose area the dwelling is situated.I would point out that there is no stamp duty on the purchase of new residential property for owner-occupiers where the dwelling is not greater than 125 square metres and complies with certain conditions in relation to building standards.  If the property is over 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged on the site value or one quarter of the total value of the property (whichever is the greater).You will appreciate that stamp duty is a significant contributor to the Exchequer and stamp duty receipts allow for a broader tax base than would otherwise be possible.  These receipts form an important element of State revenues which permits Government spending on services such as health and education.

The scheme is aimed at encouraging the development of new tourism infrastructure, or the refurbishment of existing tourism infrastructure, in that area. The list of qualifying areas which are to be designated on a district electoral division basis is included in a new Schedule 8B to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which is replicated below. The qualifying period for the scheme will be 3 years from the date of its commencement which will be done by way of Ministerial order. Relief will be available by way of accelerated capital allowances over 7 years for qualifying construction and refurbishment expenditure incurred in the qualifying period. In the case of refurbishment the qualifying expenditure must exceed 20 per cent of the market value of the property before work commences. In areas which are not in the BMW region only 80 per cent of construction and refurbishment expenditure will qualify for relief. The nature of the tourism infrastructure buildings and structures which may qualify under the scheme will be set out in guidelines to be issued by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in consultation with the Minister for Finance. While relief will be available over 7 years there will be a 15-year holding period in order to avoid a clawback of allowances given. Existing restrictions on the sideways set-off of excess capital allowances against non-rental income for passive investors will apply as will the restriction on the use of specified reliefs by high-income individuals which is effective from 1 January 2007.Projects wishing to avail of relief must get approval in advance (for which an application must be made within 1 year of the commencement of the scheme) and also must get formal certification after completion. This approval and certification will be given by a special board established for the purposes of the scheme and will be carried out in accordance with the guidelines to be issued by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, in consultation with the Minister for Finance. Certain buildings such as those that facilitate gaming or gambling are specifically excluded from the scheme, as are licensed premises (but not restaurants). Accommodation facilities that are provided as part of a qualifying project may qualify for relief to the extent that expenditure on such facilities does not exceed 50 per cent of the overall expenditure on the project or such lower percentage as may be specified in the guidelines for the type of project involved. This is subject to the over-riding condition that qualifying expenditure on accommodation facilities may not exceed qualifying expenditure on non-accommodation facilities. The scheme will be notified to the European Commission under the new regional aid block exemption guidelines."SCHEDULE 8BSection 372AW.Description of Qualifying Mid-Shannon AreasPART 1Description of qualifying mid-Shannon areas of ClareThe District Electoral Divisions of Ayle, Ballynahinch, Boherglass, Caherhurley, Cappaghabaun, Carrowbaun, Cloonusker, Coolreagh, Corlea, Derrynagittagh, Drummaan, Fahymore, Feakle, Inishcaltra North, Inishcaltra South, Killaloe, Killokennedy, Killuran, Kilseily, Lackareagh, Loughea, Mountshannon, O'Briensbridge, Ogonnelloe and Scarriff.PART 2Description of qualifying mid-Shannon areas of GalwayThe District Electoral Divisions of Abbeygormacan, Abbeyville, Ballinasloe Rural, Ballinasloe Urban, Ballyglass, Ballynagar, Bracklagh, Clonfert, Clontuskert, Coos, Derrew, Drumkeary, Drummin, Eyrecourt, Kellysgrove, Killimor (Portumna rural area), Kilmacshane, Kilmalinoge, Kilquain, Kiltormer, Kylemore, Laurencetown, Leitrim, Lismanny, Loughatorick, Marblehill, Meelick, Moat, Pallas, Portumna, Tiranascragh, Tynagh and Woodford.PART 3Description of qualifying mid-Shannon areas of OffalyThe District Electoral Divisions of Ballycumber, Banagher, Birr Rural, Birr Urban, Broughal, Cloghan, Clonmacnoise, Derryad, Doon, Drumcullen, Eglish, Ferbane, Gallen, Hinds, Hunston, Killyon, Lumcloon, Lusmagh, Mounterin, Moyclare, Shannonbridge, Shannonharbour, Srah and Tinamuck.PART 4Description of qualifying mid-Shannon areas of RoscommonThe District Electoral Divisions of Athleague East, Athleague West, Athlone West Rural, Ballydangan, Ballynamona, Castlesampson, Caltragh, Cams, Carnagh, Carrowreagh, Cloonburren, Cloonown, Crannagh, Creagh, Culliagh, Drumlosh, Dysart, Fuerty, Kilcar, Kiltoom, Lackan, Lecarrow, Lismaha, Moore, Mote, Rockhill, Roscommon Rural, Roscommon Urban, Scregg, Taghmaconnell, Thomastown and Turrock.PART 5Description of qualifying mid-Shannon areas of TipperaryThe District Electoral Divisions of Aglishcloghane, Ardcrony, Ballina, Ballingarry (in Borrisokane rural area), Ballygibbon, Ballylusky, Ballymackey, Ballynaclogh, Birdhill, Borrisokane, Burgesbeg, Carrig, Carrigatogher, Castletown, Cloghprior, Clohaskin, Cloghjordan, Derrycastle, Finnoe, Graigue (in Borrisokane rural area), Greenhall, Kilbarron,  Kilcomenty, Killoscully, Kilkeary, Kilmore, Kilnarath, Knigh, Lackagh, Lorrha East, Lorrha West, Mertonhall, Monsea, Nenagh East Urban, Nenagh Rural, Nenagh West Urban, Newport, Rathcabban, Redwood, Riverstown, Terryglass, Uskane and Youghalarra.PART 6Description of qualifying mid-Shannon areas of WestmeathThe District Electoral Divisions of Athlone East Rural, Athlone East Urban, Athlone West Urban, Ardnagragh, Auburn, Ballymore, Bellanalack, Carn, Castledaly, Doonis, Drumraney, Glassan, Killinure, Moate, Mount Temple, Moydrum, Muckanagh, Noughaval, Templepatrick, Tubbrit, Umma and Winetown."

In common with other projects in the Decentralisation Programme, following receipt and evaluation of Expressions of Interest, tenders for the proposed building were invited by the OPW from a number of contractors on a design/build basis and a preferred tenderer was identified.A planning application was lodged by the preferred tenderer with Limerick County Council in October 2006.  In December 2006, additional information was requested by the Council in relation to the foul sewer, the site boundaries and the front elevation of the proposed building.  Also requested by the Council was a comprehensive historical study and comprehensive record drawings and a photographic study relating to certain existing buildings which were on the site at the time of purchase.  In the interests of moving the project forward, the OPW is assisting the preferred tenderer in providing the additional information.  It is expected that the additional information will by submitted to the Council this week and a decision on the planning application will be due within four weeks of the date the additional information is lodged.On receipt of a satisfactory planning permission, the OPW will endeavour to have the working drawings and other necessary documents completed by the preferred tenderer with a view to a contract being placed and work commencing on site at the earliest possible date.

The Plan is delivered through seven Operational Programmes (OPs), the Economic and Social Infrastructure OP, the Employment and Human Resources OP, the Productive Sector OP, the Southern and Eastern (S&E) Regional OP, Borders, Midland and Western (BMW) Regional OP, the PEACE OP and the Technical Assistance OP.  Each of these OPs has a Monitoring Committee which meets twice yearly to monitor the ongoing implementation of the Programme.  There is also an overarching NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee which is chaired by my Department and this Committee also meets at least twice a year.Progress on the NDP/CSF is monitored and reported on a regional basis, that is, for the BMW and S&E regions.My Department reviews and generally monitors implementation of the NDP/CSF on this basis from information submitted by the Operational Programme Monitoring Committees but does not monitor expenditure at county level.  However, the NDP/CSF information website (www.ndp.ie) provides information on certain projects categorised on a county basis and the Deputy may wish to refer to that website for information on projects in particular counties.  Furthermore, my Department does not maintain data on the status of individual projects under the NDP/CSF as this is a matter for individual Departments and Agencies who are responsible for project funding and, where appropriate, project implementation.The most recent information for expenditure in the S&E Region is from the December 2006 reports to the NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee which relate to the period January 2000 to end June 2006 and is set out in table 1.   A total of €35 billion has been invested in the region to end June 2006.  Of this amount €30 billion represents Exchequer and EU sources.

It is a matter for each individual Department and sector of the public service and relevant Minister to set priorities to give effect to this policy.As I stated in my Budget speech last December, the policy is not being implemented indiscriminately.

The National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) will create 50,000 of these places.It is intended that, between now and the end of 2010, the NCIP will respond to identified local needs for childcare and that resources under the programme will be targeted in a way which meets these needs.  Therefore, the number and type of childcare places which will be created in a particular county will be determined having regard to local demand and changing demographic patterns.In addition to the NCIP, targets for childcare training places have been set under the National Childcare Training Strategy with 17,000 childcare training places to be delivered during 2006-2010.

The Government is committed to the full implementation of "A Vision for Change" and has accepted the report as the basis for the future development of mental health services.  The report contains a number of recommendations relating to the involvement of service users as active participants in the planning and delivery of mental health services.Implementation of the individual recommendations of "A Vision for Change" is a matter primarily for the HSE.  The HSE established an implementation group in July 2006 to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in "A Vision for Change" a reality.  I have been informed by the HSE that they plan to publish a Progress Report and outline the proposed implementation programme over the life of "A Vision for Change" in the near future.In recent years significant funding has been provided to support the work of advocacy groups in the mental health area. These groups include the Irish Advocacy Network, Schizophrenia Ireland, Grow, Steer, Aware, Mental Health Ireland and Bodywhys. In recognition of the key role of advocacy related to hospital admission and detention, peer advocacy is now available at all psychiatric acute admission sites, many community service sites and the Central Mental Hospital.In January 2007, the HSE launched the National Service User Executive for mental health services, in line with the recommendations of "A Vision for Change".  This group will ensure mental health service users have a meaningful and significant input into shaping the future development and direction of mental health services.  The National Service User Executive will offer advice and make recommendations to the HSE and the Department, play an active role in service design and delivery, as well as promoting the role of service users throughout the mental health services.

As a result, the Group was unable to meet the contractual deadline of 31 December 2006 for EOCP grant applicants and it was necessary to advise them in January 2007 that the indicative funding approved for their project had been withdrawn and, for the same reason, it was not possible to consider their request for additional capital funding for the project, as requested by them in October 2006, under the EOCP.I understand that the Group was also advised that it is open to them to have their previous application admitted into the NCIP and that, subject to confirmation from them that they wish this to be the case, account will be taken of all relevant preparatory work undertaken by them as part of the EOCP process.

These discussions form part of the process of established industrial relations practices and procedures and in particular the Framework for Dispute Resolution in the Health Services. Officials from my Department have been included in these discussions as appropriate and have ensured that I have been fully briefed on the issues. Outside of this formal process I would have had ongoing discussions with the HSE in relation to aspects of these matters.I am concerned that the industrial action recently notified by the INO and PNA includes a nationwide work to rule and work stoppages which will have a significant impact on patients and their families. I am monitoring the situation closely and I would urge the unions concerned to give further consideration to the recent Labour Court Recommendation and to participate in the agreed processes for the determination of public service pay.

The Crisis Pregnancy Agency (CPA), was established by the Government in 2001. The Agency has responsibility for funding a range of independent agencies providing counselling services to women with a crisis pregnancy.The CPA has informed me that such funding is subject to a service agreement between the CPA and each counselling agency.It has also indicated that a key element of this is that each counselling service commits to refer women to other bona fide service providers where it is not in a position to provide the information or service requested.Research has shown that counselling gives women extra time and space to reflect on their decision regarding their pregnancy.  If a woman has more time to come to terms with her pregnancy, this makes the option of abortion less likely.I understand that the CPA and the organisation concerned are at present in communication regarding the question of continued funding for the organisation based on the terms of their service agreement.   I do not consider it appropriate that I should make any further comment on the matter pending the outcome of these discussions.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	700	The Health Service Executive is currently undertaking a national review of acute bed capacity needs. This review will help to inform decisions on bed capacity needs for all regions, including North Dublin. My Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE to reply to the Deputy in relation to the issues raised.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	701	The Deputy may wish to know that while the main emphasis will continue to be on providing supports that help older people to remain in their own home for as long as possible, additional long-stay residential places will be required in the coming years to meet the needs of an aging population. Last year, the HSE, in conjunction with Prospectus, undertook a Needs Assessment of bed capacity requirements in the areas of long-stay, dementia specific and respite care beds. This report was submitted to the Department of Health and Children in September 2006. While the report indicates a small national surplus of long-stay beds, it also notes that this surplus masks the uneven distribution of beds between and within regions. In particular, HSE Dublin North east and HSE South have an immediate requirement for additional beds. This shortage is being addressed by the measures outlined below.In 2006, the HSE contracted a total of 1,050 extra beds in the private nursing home sector. A total of €28m is being allocated to cover the full year cost in 2007 of these beds. In addition, the HSE hopes to contract a further 350 beds in 2007 at a cost of €12m. 220 of these will be procured in the Greater Dublin area and 100 will be procured in HSE South.The HSE also proposes to expand public capacity by 446 beds in 2007 and by 414 in 2008. This expansion will take account of the regional variations identified in the HSE/Prospectus report. The running costs in full year of this additional public capacity will be €42m. According to the overview document for A Fair Deal there is a total of 9,488 beds in public nursing homes including Welfare Homes of which about 8,250 are long-stay beds. Approximately 7,415 older people currently occupy public long-term care beds.Overall between public and private residential facilities there are currently 21,200 older people in long-term residential care nationally. This equates to 4.6% of the over 65 population nationally.

As part of this initiative, the Government launched the National Disability Strategy, in 2004 as a framework of positive action measures to support the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society. Two new pieces of legislation — the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 and the Disability Act, 2005 form an integral part of this Strategy, along with the suite of six sectoral plans, launched in 2006.In addition, a sum of €74m was allocated in the 2006 Budget and €75m in Budget 2007 (both for revenue purposes) to the Health Service Executive for disability services.  This sum incorporates the 2006 and 2007 elements of the Government's Multi-Annual Investment Programme 2006-2009 for the National Disability Strategy.  This Strategy is committed to enhancing, among other services, the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services to adults and children with an intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those with autism.To date, for the Deputy's information, this Government's investment in disability and primary services has resulted in a significant growth in speech and language therapy services, the quadrupling of training places for speech and language therapists since 2003 and a 112% growth in numbers of WTES (whole time equivalents) between 1997 and mid-2006.As outlined in the Sectoral Plan of my Department, which was published in July 2006, Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will commence for children aged less than 5 years with effect from 1st June 2007.  This prioritisation reflects the importance of intervention early in life, which can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment. Part 2 will be commenced in respect of children aged 5-18 in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act. The statutory requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act will be extended to adults as soon as possible but no later than 2011.In relation to children under 5, an assessment report will result in a service statement which will outline the services which will be made to the applicant based on the findings of the assessment report. In addition, the service statement will indicate when provision will be made available. Section 13 of the Disability Act, 2005 imposes significant requirements on the HSE to maintain and keep records in relation to a number of issues including, the numbers and identities of people to whom assessments and services were provided, the services provided and the persons providing them, and the aggregate needs identified in assessment reports which have not been included in service statements. This information will be reported to me on an annual basis and a report will be published by the HSE within a month of its submission to me.  This process will help indicate where service developments are to be focussed into the future.As the balance of the Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The development of the hospital is being overseen by a joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group and the project is proceeding as planned.The next stage of the process involves the preparation of a high level framework brief for the new hospital.  The brief is being developed for the Transition Group by Rawlinson Kelly & Whittlestone Ltd (RKW), an established UK-based health care planning company.  RKW will be advising on a range of issues which will help to inform the design of the new hospital.  They will be advising, for example, on the preferred model of care, on the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and on the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital.  In this context RKW have been requested to advise, as a priority, on the range of services which should be provided outside of the main hospital through the urgent / ambulatory care service, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children's hospital services.RKW is consulting widely in the course of its work, and in this context the input of all stakeholders will be of benefit in ensuring the delivery of our shared objective of providing a world-class hospital for the children of this country.

It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over the next 7 to 10 years.  "A Vision for Change" acknowledges gaps in the current provision of services for people with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.In 2006, a sum of €26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with "A Vision for Change".  A further sum of €25 million has been allocated in 2007 to continue this development. €0.75 million of this additional funding is for the initial development of a dedicated eating disorder service in each HSE area through a combination of reconfiguring existing services and commissioning services from agencies.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	713	A number of initiatives in recent years are aimed, inter alia at ensuring that services for children and young people are delivered in an effective, efficient and coordinated manner.The Office of the Minister for Children (OMC) was set up to bring greater coherence to policy making for children. Children now have a stronger voice on issues that affect them through my attendance at cabinet meetings. The OMC focuses on harmonising policy issues that affect children in areas such as early childhood care and education, youth justice, child welfare and protection, children and young people's participation, research on children and young people and cross cutting initiatives for children.The OMC is responsible for implementing the National Children's Strategy (2000-2010); implementing the National Childcare Investment Programme (2006-2010); developing policy and legislation on child welfare and child protection; and implementing the Children Act (2001).The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Again, the purpose of having one body with responsibility for services at a national level is to ensure the delivery of services in an effective, efficient and coordinated manner.In the context of the implementation of the Children Act, 2001 the Health Service Executive is involved with the Irish Youth Justice Service, the Garda Juvenile Liaison Service, the Probation Service and the Courts Service in the co-ordination of services for young people.The HSE also has a key role in the National Implementation Group established under the Partnership agreement "Towards 2016" which hopefully will lead to improved co-ordination of services to children and young people in each county.The Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) which is operating on an administrative basis since 1999 currently concentrates on the child care area, in particular on the inspection of Health Service Executive (HSE) operated residential child care facilities and has also undertaken pilot inspections of foster care services.  The Inspectorate play a crucial role in ensuring a quality assured system of care for children and young people who are in the care of the state.  Legislation and standards have been developed in this area and it is essential that the services are monitored to ensure that they meet these requirements and that any deficiencies are identified and corrected.  The SSI  publish an annual report on the findings from inspections and informs the HSE, other bodies involved in the provision of services for children and young people, and the public on the standard of care in children's residential centres. The SSI will be established on a statutory basis under the provisions of the Health Bill 2006 and its remit will be extended.In addition to the aforementioned significant developments, a National Policy for Children's Services is being developed by the Office of the Minister for Children and will be published in 2007. The principle of having social services provided on the basis of the child being supported within the family, within the local community will be at the core of the national policy.

However, Clostridium difficile infection was examined in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) in acute hospitals in 2006.  The survey found that thirty-six patients had Clostridium  difficile representing 0.5% of patients studied.  Clostridium  difficile  infection  increases  with  age  and  is eight times more common in patients over 65 years compared to those under the age of 65 years.  The emergence of more virulent strains of Clostridium difficile which is partly due to over use of antibiotics underlines the importance of strict antibiotic stewardship in our health care system.Currently, acute hospitals collect information on HCAIs at a local level and there is no national surveillance scheme that collects comparable data.  The appointment of infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists is necessary to commence a national surveillance programme and some of these staff are already in place and the HSE are currently recruiting additional staff in this area.It is difficult to identify the number of fatalities attributable to Clostridium difficile as many people also have significant co-morbidity factors.Measures to control the emergence and spread of HCAIs are necessary because there are fewer options available for the treatment of resistant infections and because these strains spread amongst vulnerable at-risk patients.  The prudent use of antibiotics underpins any approach to the control of antibiotic resistant bacteria.  This, together with good professional practice and routine infection control precautions, such as hand hygiene, constitute the major measures in controlling and preventing healthcare-associated infection.While many HCAIs are not preventable, we can make every effort to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.

My Department has asked the Executive's Parliamentary Affairs Division to reply directly to the Deputy in this regard.The Health Service Executive recently published a Review of Neurosurgical Services in Ireland, prepared by the former Comhairle na nOspideal.  The Report recommended that the future development of safe, high quality neurosurgical services in Ireland would be best served by a two-pronged approach:1. Increased capacity in Dublin and Cork;2. Improved access to neurosurgical units, including transport and telemedicine facilities for referring hospitals.The Report also identified a clear need for significant investment in neurosurgical services, and the planning and commissioning of such services on a national basis.  Additional funding of €4m has been provided in 2007 to support the development of neurosciences, including neurosurgery services.The HSE is committed to progressing the recommendations of the Report to ensure the development of neurosurgical services in Ireland in line with international best practice.

The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive as living people who were wrongly charged will be prioritised to receive repayments. It is estimated that there are now in the region of 14,000 people within this category, approximately 10,000 of whom have already applied. It is expected that the bulk of payments to estates will commence later in the Spring.   Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008. It is anticipated that final repayments will be made by mid 2008.The HSE has indicated that the cost of the repayment scheme will be approximately €1 billion. The Department of Finance has earmarked funding of €360 million for the repayment scheme in 2007 and this figure can be increased if necessary. The final cost of the repayment scheme will be dependent on the total number of applications received under the scheme.A dedicated website (www.repay.ie), an information phone line (1890 886 886)  and an e-mail facility  (queries@repay.ie) have been established by the Scheme Administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 8.00 am and 9.00 p.m. from Monday to Saturday.

Two new pieces of legislation — the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 and the Disability Act, 2005 form an integral part of this Strategy, along with the suite of six sectoral plans, launched in 2006.One of the most important aspects of my Department's sectoral plan is the arrangements for commencing Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which provides a statutory entitlement to—an independent assessment of health and education needs,a statement of the services (Service Statement) which it is proposed to provide, andthe right to pursue a complaint through an independent redress mechanism if there is a failure to provide these entitlements.Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will be commenced on a national basis (including Galway) in respect of persons of different ages as follows:for children aged less than 5 years — with effect from 1, June 2007.for children aged 5 years to 18 years  — in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004.for persons aged over 18 years — as soon as possible but no later than 31, December 2011.Services for adults and children will continue to be enhanced progressively over the next number of years. The commitment by the Government to provide a Multi-Annual Investment programme of some €900m over the period 2006-2009 for disability support services recognises the need to build capacity in the health services to deliver on these obligations.The bulk of this funding, around €720m, is being spent in the health services.I have allocated €100m in 2006 and a further €100m in 2007 for the continuing development of services for people with a disability.

This includes responsibility for the selection and recruitment  of general practitioners to provide services under the contract to persons covered by the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. Entry to the GMS Scheme for general practitioners is normally through open competition and interview following advertisements in national and medical newspapers. All suitably qualified persons may apply for these positions.The HSE is required, under the terms of the agreement negotiated with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), when deciding to fill a vacant GP patient panel or to create a new patient panel, to take account of the potential viability of such a panel under a range of headings including:The number of GMS patients on the listThe age/sex profile of the patients on the listThe geographic area in which the practice is situatedThe number and age profile of the GMS doctors in the area, and their list sizesThe private practice profile of the area in question, including the ratio of private to public patients in the area.The population size in the area and surrounding areas.The factors advanced by the applicant doctor in support of his/her application.The particular public health needs of the area in question.Under the terms of further agreements reached in the context of the extension of medical card coverage to all persons aged 70 and over, and the introduction of the GP visit card, arrangements were made permitting GPs who at that time did not hold a GMS contract to obtain a contract in respect of providing a service to such patients, with an option to become eligible for a full GMS contract in due course.Under the terms of the agreements with the IMO, the number of persons whose names may be placed on a GP's panel may not exceed 2,000 save where the HSE, in exceptional circumstances, and after consultation with the IMO, decides to apply a higher limit.I regard these existing arrangements as unnecessarily restrictive and it is my wish, therefore, that new contractual arrangements which are to be developed for the provision of publicly funded general practitioner services should ensure that HSE contracts are open to all suitably qualified and equipped doctors.

In response to concerns regarding labour shortages, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions to 2015 in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists (Bacon Report).The report was published in 2001 and arising from its recommendations additional courses in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy providing 75 places in each discipline were established in three universities.  UCC, NUIG and UL each established courses in both speech and language therapy and occupational therapy with 25 places on each of the 6 courses.  The first cohort of graduates from the UL masters level courses in both speech and language therapy and occupational therapy courses graduated in 2005 and the first cohort from the bachelor degree programmes in both disciplines in UCC and NUIG will graduate this year.  This investment represents an increase in training capacity of 300% in speech and language therapy and 240% in occupational therapy.  The total number of speech and language therapy and occupational therapy training places now stands at 100 and 103 respectively, the level at which the Bacon Report recommended as being sufficient to meet current and future demand to 2015 for both professions.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.

"A Vision for Change" highlights the importance of mental health promotion in the prevention of mental health problems through the development of coping and problem-solving skills, help-seeking and resilience.  It also recommends that mental health promotion should be available for all age groups, to enhance the protective factors and decrease risk factors for developing mental health problems.In March 2006, I appointed an independent monitoring group to monitor progress on the implementation of all the recommendations in "A Vision for Change".  In addition, the Health Service Executive recently established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and to guide and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in "A Vision for Change" a reality.  Both of these Groups will play an important role in ensuring that the recommendations are implemented in a co-ordinated and timely manner.The Health Service Executive now has responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, including health promotion programme development and implementation.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention is planning, in conjunction with voluntary organisations, a national mental health promotion campaign to impact on the stigma of mental health and to encourage help seeking.  The campaign is currently being developed and is to be launched in the coming months.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that it is not intended to provide this development under its co-location initiative at the hospital.It is my objective and that of the HSE to see the earliest delivery of the Plan in the best interests of cancer patients throughout the country.  In December last year I met with the Chairman and Chief Executive of the HSE and discussed the timelines for the delivery of the National Plan.  The HSE is examining options to speed up the pace of delivery and will make recommendations to me shortly.  In the interim, a service level agreement was signed on 1 February between the HSE and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre Whitfield Clinic in County Waterford.

Over the period of the agreements, which run to 2010, it is expected to achieve savings of the order of €300 million across the GMS and community drugs schemes, and in the cost of drugs to hospitals, through off-patent price cuts of 35% for drugs with substitutable alternatives.  In addition to the savings quantified, there will be further savings as generic manufacturers respond to the lower price of branded drugs.  This will allow the State to invest in new and innovative treatments for the benefit of Irish patients.There will also be savings through the use of a wider basket for pricing new medicines, along with two price reviews for new medicines over the term of the agreements.  The new basket includes some traditionally lower priced countries, including Spain and Belgium, which will benefit the consumer over the medium term.  Finally, for the first time, reimbursement of new drugs in Ireland can now be informed by pharmacoeconomic assessment, in line with other EU countries.These agreements are the first stage in a process approved by the Cabinet Committee on Health to examine all aspects of the drug delivery system, from the manufacturer to the patient, in order to achieve greater value for money from the State's spending on drugs and medicines and in the operation of the drugs schemes, consistent with patient safety and continuity of supply.Investment decisions are a commercial matter for the company concerned.  There has been no indication by the company concerned to my department that there is any connection between this negotiated agreement and the event referred to by the Deputy.

An Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern T.D. will announce the signing of service level agreements between the OMC and the three projects at An Cosán, Tallaght West on Friday 23rd February 2007.The Prevention and Early Intervention Programme will examine innovative methods for improving outcomes for children in an integrated way.  The intention is to ensure that local services connect effectively with one another, making them more focused on the multiple needs of children and families.  The strategy will also provide for some new services and the re-orientation of existing services in the identified area to meet the specified needs of the community.  Apart from the impact on the community in Tallaght, the monitoring and evaluation of this and related projects should help to guide the development of services into the future.

I am determined that the HSE will deliver on this Plan in 2011 as originally scheduled.  The Board of the HSE is considering how best to procure the radiation oncology facilities and associated equipment, including procurement by PPP, within this timetable.  The Executive will make recommendations to me shortly on the earliest delivery of the Plan in the best interests of cancer patients throughout the country.A Service Level Agreement is now in place for the referral of about 50 radiation oncology patients annually from Donegal to Belfast City Hospital (BCH) and a number of patients have been referred for treatment.  It has also been agreed that the number will be increased if there is sufficient demand from patients in Donegal.  In November 2006, I met with the Minister for Health for Northern Ireland and we discussed progressing consideration of a satellite centre in the North West linked to BCH.  Further discussions will take place at official level involving both Departments.The provision of cancer services in Letterkenny General Hospital is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to this matter.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

As a first step it is important that the concept of front of pack labelling be fully considered; such considerations include, inter alia, the objectives of such labelling, whether it should be provided on a mandatory or voluntary basis, the nutrients which might be included and the basis of such labelling (100g/100ml or serving size).  It is only following these considerations that the merits and demerits of different approaches e.g. traffic lights / GDA based schemes can be examined, and progress on a harmonised approach achieved.The Irish position on the review is informed by responses received to the national consultations on the ‘Review of Food Labelling Legislation' and ‘Nutrition Labelling: Review of Technical Issues' which were undertaken by the FSAI last year, and other labelling research undertaken by Government Departments and agencies.  Officials of my Department are also in regular contact with officials in other Government Departments and agencies in order to ensure that the broad Irish position is represented at the discussions.While I have no proposals at present to commission research on the lines suggested, I do not rule out the possibility that it may be worthwhile to consider such research at some later stage.

This year, the sum available for expenditure in health under the Health Service Executive's capital plan is €657 million.The HSE has responsibility for the planning and management of capital projects in the health sector, including the development referred to in the Deputy's question.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	768	I propose to take Questions Nos. 359 and 371 together.There has been a significant increase in acute bed capacity in recent years.  The average number of in-patient beds and day places in public acute hospitals has increased by approximately 1,200 since 2001, the year of the publication of the Health Strategy.The increase is continuing.  For example, in the current year the Health Service Executive (HSE) has indicated that it will be commissioning over 100 additional beds across the following hospitals — Galway, Tullamore, St. Vincent's, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin and Wexford. We are also creating a further 1,000 public beds through the building by the private sector of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals, thereby freeing up additional beds for public patients. The provision of the 1,000 beds will result in no direct capital cost to the Exchequer as the capital costs will be met by the private sector.Improving the delivery of Accident and Emergency services is the Government's top priority in health.  Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A & E and do not require admission.  The HSE continues to report significant improvements in the number of patients in A & E departments who are awaiting admission to an acute bed as compared with the same period last year.  The average number of patients awaiting admission during December/January was more than 50% lower than the equivalent period twelve months ago.In terms of A & E capacity the HSE has developed admission lounges at a number of hospitals in 2006 and further lounges are being fast tracked  to come on-stream in 2007.  These admission lounges alleviate pressure on A & E and enable patients awaiting admission to an acute hospital bed to be managed safely while preserving their right to dignity and privacy.Last year the HSE introduced a target of 24 hours within which all patients should be admitted, following the decision to admit.  This target is being achieved by the vast majority of hospitals. The HSE has announced that it will be introducing a revised target of 12 hours within which a patient should be admitted, following the decision to admit. It is also to introduce a monitoring system to record the total time patients spend in A & E departments, from the time they arrive to the time they are either discharged or admitted.Finally, a HSE led Steering Group is reviewing our acute hospital bed requirements  up to the year 2020.   This review will be completed over the coming months.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	770	A combination of agency nurses and overtime working provides an additional input of nursing resources to cope with difficulties arising in the provision of services while employers continue the recruitment process to fill vacancies. Agency workers are used to cover unplanned leave e.g. sick leave, force majeure leave, "special" patients (one to one nursing care  to manage  acute episodes) and to deal with service pressures. The Health Service Executive has responsibility for managing nursing resources including agency nursing. I understand that the HSE is closely monitoring the usage of agency nurses and it is working with a number of the larger hospitals to establish a pilot project aimed at reducing reliance on agency nurses. This project will involve the establishment of a Nursing Bank for the DATHs hospitals. Letterkenny General Hospital has had a Nursing Bank system for in operation the  last three years. An audit undertaken has demonstrated significant savings in terms of the requirement for overtime and also enhanced flexibility for staff in terms of the types of shifts they work.Given the nature of the health services there will always be some requirement for agency nursing, however, it is important that HSE continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the optimal use of resources in the interest of service users.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	771	I would like to put on record that I hold the nursing and midwifery professions in high esteem and view the care they provide to patients as a critical component of our health services. In recent years the role of nurses and midwives has expanded to meet the needs of health service users. Over the last decade the pay of nurses and midwives has increased significantly as the role of the professions has been expanded and enhanced. A table sets out the pay increases for a sample of nursing grades.GradeMax of Scale 1st January 1997Max of Scale 1st December 2006Cumulative IncreaseCumulative % Increase€€€%Staff Nurse24,88343,43018,54774.54Clinical Nurse Manager 227,96355,58827,68998.79Director of Nursing (Band 1)42,14380,909*43,276102.69*Directors of Nursing (Band 1) are also eligible for performance related bonus of 6,556 on top of basic pay giving a total salary of up to 87,465.Nurses and midwives' salaries will increase further in the medium term. The current national agreement Towards 2016 provides for pay increases of 10% over 27 months. Two unions which represent nurses — SIPTU and IMPACT — have signed up to this agreement and their members are being paid the first phase increase of 3% with effect from 1 December 2006. It remains open to the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Psychiatric Nurses Association to sign up to the agreement thus allowing their members to access the associated pay increases. The Government has agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions a basis on which pay and conditions for the public service as a whole should be managed and the second Benchmarking Body has been established to provide an objective means of assessing the appropriate pay for particular groups or professions. SIPTU and IMPACT availed of the opportunity to make submissions to Benchmarking arguing for pay increases for nurses and midwives. In December 2006 the Labour Court recommended to the INO and PNA that the Benchmarking was the appropriate mechanism for processing their pay claims. I would urge these unions to give further consideration to the Labour Court Recommendation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	772	There is not a large scale exodus of Irish trained nurses from the profession. Health service employers have been successful in recruiting and retaining additional nurses in recent years. The number of nurses and midwives employed in the public health service is at an all time high. The most recent personnel census found that there were 36,730 whole time equivalent nurses and midwives in the public health service at the end of December 2006. This represents a 42% increase in the number of nurses and midwives over the last ten years. There are of course some Irish nurses and midwives who wish to work abroad — nursing along with other health care professions operates within a global labour market. The fact that an Irish qualification is recognised internationally is an attraction to some people considering a career in nursing. Australia appears to be the most popular destination for Irish trained nurses who wish to work abroad. However, it should be noted that Australia is a very popular destination for Irish people generally in their 20s and 30s. It is my understanding that many of the Irish nurses who work abroad return to Ireland having gained valuable experience in overseas health systems.

These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	774	As part of the ongoing roll out of the Health Reform Programme, my Department has divested itself of involvement in the operational delivery of health and personal social services. It is now responsible for overall organisational, legislative, policy and financial accountability for the health sector. The Health Service Executive (HSE) was established in January, 2005 and is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.Policy in the delivery of health services has been determined by Government as the development of health services in all regions of the country, capable of providing safe, high-quality services that achieve the best possible outcomes for patients in primary care settings or when accessing a hospital service. My Department has developed a broad range of strategy documents and associated policies to guide it in its work.The Health Reform Programme comprehends Quality and Fairness — The National Health Strategy, The Primary Care Strategy as well as the Prospectus, Brennan and Hanly reports. These reports are guiding the future of the health service in that they lay out the overall direction for the major changes in the health services and how they should be addressed and delivered. These reports culminated in the enactment of the Health Act, 2004, which abolished the health boards and established the HSE in January, 2005, as a mechanism for unitary service delivery in the area of health and personal social services.Under the Health Act, 2004, a core responsibility of the Department is that of holding the HSE to account in relation to its financial performance and performance of service delivery, as well as the effective implementation of Government policies. A number of Expert Advisory Groups (EAGs) have also been established by the HSE and are located within its organisational structure in order to provide strategic leadership and expertise in the development and interpretation of national policy, strategies and service design in the delivery of health and personal social services. The EAG's are made up of a wide range of health professionals and will verify compliance with policy and legislation, monitor appropriate resource utilisation and ensure national consistency in implementation and service delivery.Another contributor to the way in which policy in the delivery of health services is being determined will be the Health Information Quality Assurance body (HIQA). The Health Bill 2006, published in December, 2006 and currently before the Oireachtas, will establish HIQA and the Social Service Inspectorate on a statutory basis. HIQA will provide an independent review of quality and performance, and its analysis will inform policy development within the Department. It will also undertake health technology assessments and will evaluate information on health and social services and the health and welfare of the population. HIQA will advise the Minister and the HSE on deficiencies identified.

The study identified a number of areas which require further analysis including the ability of such processes to secure adequate payment for their exports, a review of connection standards and processes for smaller generators, and the implications of the Single Electricity Market for small-scale electricity generation.These technical and administrative issues are currently being addressed, and my Department is working with the relevant agencies, including SEI, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), ESB Networks and the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland in this regard.As part of the ongoing work to progress this area, the Commission for Energy Regulation issued a consultation paper on micro generation with a view to establishing appropriate administrative and technical mechanisms. This paper discusses issues such as the technical standards to apply to such generators, the installation process for micro generators, and the metering and commercial arrangements for such generators.Last year, I raised the issue of planning guidelines for domestic renewable technologies with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with a view to ensuring a common national approach on such issues. Following a public consultation the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has drafted new regulations for the amendment of the exempted development provisions of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001. These amendments will permit the installation of solar panels, wind turbines and other micro-renewables, without planning permission in certain circumstances. Last Month, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Development approved the draft Regulations and this week I understand that the Joint Committee intends to report back to both Houses.We are working with all relevant agencies and the CER to ensure that the appropriate administrative, technical and safety standards and practices are in place to underpin programmes for the widespread deployment of micro generation technologies. I am confident that appropriate solutions suited to the context of the Irish electricity grid and for non-grid connected technologies will be developed with a view to progressing this emerging sector.

I am aware that, despite Government and private investment in broadband, there are areas of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Accordingly, I have announced a new scheme which will aim to provide a broadband service to these areas. This scheme will be confined to areas of the country that are not yet served by any broadband service provider, currently thought to be 10-15% of the population. This scheme will, when it is fully rolled out, ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in these rural areas are met.A Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently considering all elements of the proposed scheme and work on the design of an appropriate tender will commence in the coming weeks.

My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. However, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband. My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under Phase One and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity.Phase Two of the MANs Programme includes the towns of Athy, Clane, Kilcock, Kilcullen, Kildare, Maynooth, Monasterevin, Newbridge, Prosperous and Rathangan in County Kildare. The Invitation to Tender for a design consultant was issued in late December 2006 for the design of these MANs. The closing date for responses is the 23rd February 2007. Kildare County Council will then review the tender submissions received and the appointment of a design consultant will be announced shortly afterwards.It is expected that all the MANs will all be completed during 2007 and 2008.

No 628 of 2006) that the licence fees payable in respect of commercial salmon fishing licences would include a salmon conservation levy equivalent to 50% of the licence fee.  The levy will apply to all harvesters of fish (commercial and recreational) in 2007. In the case of draft net fishing licences, the fee has increased from €190 to €380 for the season.  The proceeds of this levy will be invested in wild salmon management initiatives designed to rehabilitate wild salmon stocks and habitats.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that it is important that we do all that is possible to contribute to restoration of stocks following the cessation of mixed stock fishing at sea.

There was a critical shortage of appropriately skilled people to meet our energy research needs.The approach taken was to design and implement a scheme of funding awards for energy research projects and researchers to address this gap.  Accordingly the Charles Parsons awards were developed specifically to accelerate the build up of research capacity, in line with the key importance with which Government views the energy area.  This initiative is also closely aligned with the Government plan to double the output of PhDs by 2013, which is a key objective of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation.Following the call for applications for funding last October 22 applications were received from 11 organisations located both North and South.  The applications were evaluated using a panel of International Experts located outside of Ireland.  The funding awards were announced in December. Funding has been provided for a total of 208 researchers and students over the period of the Awards, which have a total value of €208 million.This expansion of Irish energy research capacity will provide vital knowledge and skilled individuals that are so important to the development of Irish energy-related industry.  The Awards will significantly increase Irish energy research capacity by providing funding to the third level institutions.  This helps them to build sustainable research teams comprising senior researchers, PhD studentships and undergraduate summer placements. International mobile researchers should be attracted to Ireland as a result.  The scheme will also raise the awareness of Ireland as a good location to carry out research, an important step in the attraction of energy related investments.The Awards have been made to: National University of Ireland Galway, Microbial Bioenergy Group; Queen's University Belfast, Electrical Power and Energy System Research Cluster; University College Cork, Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre; University College Dublin, Bioresources Research Centre; University College Dublin, Electricity Research Centre; University of Limerick, Charles Parson Research Institute & Graduate School; and University of Ulster, Centre for Sustainable Technologies.

The Plan will set out a cohesive strategy for the development and deployment of indigenous bioenergy resources, in the electricity, heating and transport sectors.  I have already introduced a number of measures to stimulate demand for bio-energy in Ireland, including the €26m bioheat programme, the €47m Greener Homes programme, the €11m Combined Heat and Power (CHP) programme (which will include biomass CHP), the Renewable Electricity Feed in Tariff programme which focuses particularly on biomass, the two biofuels excise relief programmes valued at almost €220m, and a biofuels obligation which will be introduced in 2009.  The National Bio-energy Action Plan will address land and waste resources issues and the development of demand-side measures together with the establishment of targets for individual sectors.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	789	As a member of the International Energy Agency Ireland is required to maintain emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports of crude oil equivalent in the previous year.  The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption.  The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) is responsible for holding Ireland's strategic oil reserves at a level determined — at least once a year — by the Minister.Ireland meets its oil stockholding obligations through a combination of: oil stocks wholly owned by NORA; stocks ‘ticketed' by NORA under commercial contracts with an option to purchase in the event of an oil emergency arising during the period of the contract; and operational stocks held in Ireland by the oil industry and large consumer companies.  This method of compliance is fully in line with accepted international practice.At 1 December 2006 Ireland's oil stock reserves were estimated at 129 days net imports of which NORA stocks accounted for 81 days — 38 days stored in Ireland and 43 days stored abroad in a number of other EU Member States under Bilateral Oil Stockholding Agreements.  The Government considers that the volumes of NORA-owned strategic stocks should be maximised having regard to storage availability and value for money and its indicating steps to achieve this.My Department has contingency arrangements in place to deal with major oil supply disruptions. In the event of a significant global oil supply crisis, Ireland's oil reserves would be released over an extended period to supplement commercial supplies which would continue to be available, albeit at a reduced level, in the normal course.  In this context reserves provide cover for periods far in excess of their expression in terms of number of days.I should add that there would be no question of Ireland or any other IEA or EU Member State attempting to deal on its own with an international oil crisis.  If such a crisis were to occur, the response, including the release of emergency stocks and the identification of alternative sources of supply, would take place primarily within the framework of the formal emergency regime developed and maintained by the IEA.  Under the regime, Member States would be entitled to a share of available IEA oil stocks in the event of a reduction of at least 7% in normal global supply levels.  There are also provisions for a coordinated international response to an emerging crisis, without the oil-sharing component, in advance of the 7% trigger.I am satisfied that Ireland's emergency oil stock levels are sufficient to ensure that we would be in a position to participate effectively in any internationally coordinated response in the event of an international oil supply disruption, or manage any short-term disruption specifically impacting on the Irish market.As regards natural gas supplies, some 87% of which is imported, currently Ireland has a well-developed framework to ensure adequacy and security of supply.  This has been underpinned in recent years by substantial investment in the transmission network and BGE planned investment programme in the gas network of over €1.7 billion which will enhance security of supply.  Recent expansion in gas interconnection between Europe and the UK as well as LNG facilities in the UK and Europe will also deliver tangible benefits in terms of regional market development and supply security.The Irish gas transmission system is designed to cope with a 1-in-50 peak day, or the coldest day likely to occur once in 50 years.  A Unified Code of Operations introduced by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) sets out standards for the protection of non-daily metered customers (including households) in the event of disruption of supply or extreme climatic conditions.  This is a robust standard which takes account of the scarcity of indigenous resources.In addition, the CER has issued a licence to Marathon Oil Limited to operate a storage facility at the depleting gas fields off the Kinsale Head in Co. Cork. This facility, with a storage capacity of 7bcf, is currently in operation.  The CER has the statutory function of licensing natural gas storage facilities. In carrying out its functions, the CER must have regard to the need to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the natural gas system to enable reasonable expectations of demand to be met, and to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas.One of the strategic objectives of the All-island energy development framework for natural gas is a common approach on natural gas storage and LNG. An All-island study will shortly be commissioned by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise Trade and Industry to assess the medium to long-term position with regard to security of natural gas supply and consider the scope for a common approach on storage and LNG. It will also have regard to industry views, any existing capacities as well as to planned or proposed developments for storage on the island.  In the case of coal there are abundant coal reserves in the world which are projected to last for at least 200 years and there is unlikely to be a shortage of this fuel.  The ESB maintains levels of coal reserves to ensure security of supply for coal generating plant in the event of a temporary disruption to supplies.

The relatively small size of the Irish electricity market underlines the need for greater interconnection as a means of enhancing security of supply, promoting competition and integrating the Irish electricity market into the wider European market.  The Government is committed to deliver enhanced interconnection on the island of Ireland as well as with Britain as a priority. This is also the way forward envisaged at European level.The Government has approved plans to secure the construction of a single 500 megawatt electricity interconnector between Ireland and Wales. The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has been requested to proceed with a competition to select a developer to secure the design and construction of this interconnector as quickly as possible.  The CER has also been requested to arrange for EirGrid and ESB to expedite the technical work of route selection and necessary grid reinforcement works.  The Government decision provides that the interconnector will as a key strategic asset remain in public ownership and will be owned by EirGrid.EirGrid has commenced investigation as to the current state of technology and has held a number of meetings with converter station manufacturers, cable manufacturers and utilities. It is currently collating and reviewing sea-bed survey work previously carried out with a view to its currency and availability for use for this project.  While work is progressing on the technical specification of the interconnector, the CER, in conjunction with EirGrid, is also finalising the competition structure and related contractual arrangements with a view to going to market as soon as possible.  To underpin the development process, new arrangements have been made in respect of the construction and operation of future interconnectors in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006.  The Act provides that the CER may, with Ministerial consent, secure the construction of an interconnector by one or more means, including by competitive tender. Such consent will be contingent on final Government approval.In addition to the interconnector with Wales, the Government, working together with the Northern Ireland authorities, is progressing electricity interconnection initiatives in the context of the All-Island Energy Market.  In this regard, the two transmission system operators, Northern Ireland Electricity and EirGrid, are progressing a second North-South electricity interconnector which will more than double the existing cross-border electricity transfer capacity to over 600 megawatts to be completed by 2011.Planning for decisions in relation to further interconnection with Britain or potentially with the European mainland will be developed in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Energy Policy.

The main strategies in support of this policy are regular opportunities for exploration licences through licensing rounds and attractive licensing terms.  This year the frontier Porcupine Basin is open for licensing.  The planned closing date for applications is end-October, with the award of licences before the end of the year. In addition to such licensing rounds the Celtic Sea is licensed by an ‘open door' system under which applications are accepted at any time.  My Department also carries out intensive promotional activities directed at encouraging an increased level of exploration in the Irish offshore by participating in major conferences, exhibitions and other promotional events.My Department is finalising a review of licensing terms at present and I will bring forward my proposals in the coming weeks for the future of the licensing regime.Bord na Móna plc produces c.3 million tonnes of milled peat annually for supply to the existing three peat-fired electricity generating stations and a further 0.5 million tonnes for the production of peat briquettes.  The Government is supportive of the development of co-fuelling existing peat-based electricity generation with biomass. While there are no proposals to increase the use of peat in electricity generation, co-fuelling could extend the use of indigenous peat in the energy mix and introduce indigenous biomass as a co-fuel.In addition, the Government is promoting renewable energy sources in order to reduce our dependence on imports, with a target to achieve 15% of our electricity requirement by the year 2010.

The Asset Strategy formed the basis for the Commission's authorisation to ESB on 6 February 2007 for the construction of a new power station at Aghada.The Strategy is reinforced by the fact that my approval for the relevant capital expenditure to be undertaken by ESB on the new unit at Aghada is contingent on the company meeting all the terms and conditions accompanying the authorisation by the CER.  I should also point out that, in accordance with a recent Government decision on the matter, the output from the new unit at Aghada is to be ring-fenced and sold to suppliers other than ESB PES.The CER-ESB divestment package is in keeping with policies put forward in the Green Paper on Energy, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, and is a viable first step in the development of a competitive electricity generation sector within the context of the development of the All-island market.

A series of grant-aid programmes are being rolled-out over a five year period and are providing funding for the domestic, commercial, services and industrial sectors as follows: the €47m ‘Greener Homes' domestic renewable heat grants programme is providing grants for householders for the purpose of installing renewable heating including wood biomass boilers and stoves, solar panels and heat pumps; he €26m Bioheat grants programme provides grants for commercial scale wood biomass boilers aimed at the business and services sectors and is currently being expanded to enable the community and voluntary sector to avail of grants and to include other technologies such as solar; and the €11m Combined Heat and Power grants programme is providing funding for the commercial sector to switch to more efficient electricity and heat generation.A number of other financial initiatives have also been introduced: In June 2006, I launched the Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff which is providing a fixed feed-in-tariff for renewable electricity over a fifteen year period which will assist in achieving a target of 15% electricity consumed from renewable sources by 2010.  In July 2006 I launched a five-year excise relief programme for biofuels, valued at over €200m.  There were sixteen successful applicants under this scheme.  The programme builds on a pilot initiative rolled out in 2005, in which eight biofuels project were granted excise relief over a two-year period. In addition to the excise relief programmes for biofuels on 12th February I signalled my intention to introduce a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, which will require all fuel suppliers ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  The obligation will deliver a target of 5.75% market penetration in 2009 and 10% in 2020.The Bio Energy Action Plan, to be published shortly, will set out a cohesive strategy for the development and deployment of indigenous bioenergy resources, in the electricity, heating and transport sectors. Strategies for renewable heat, electricity and transport will also be addressed in the forthcoming White Paper on Energy Policy.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	794	The Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Europe presented by the Commission last October sets out a comprehensive range of proposed policies and measures aimed at realising at least 20% savings in EU energy consumption by 2020.  The overall thrust of the Plan was endorsed by EU Energy Ministers in November last.  The objective is to deliver for Europe energy efficient infrastructure, buildings, appliances, processes, transport and energy systems. Energy efficiency has the potential to be the most effective and economical means of delivering on the challenge of reducing Europe's dependence on energy imports, reducing energy demand and reducing CO2 emissions.The Plan sets out 10 priority actions for transport, built environment power generation, economic sectors and individual consumers. The actions are underpinned by a programme of 57 measures which the Commission will progressively propose to Council and Parliament up to 2012.  It is essential that we have effective synergies between National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and action at European level. I have made clear that Ireland's ambitious approach to energy efficiency will fully reflect and underpin the comprehensive European Action Plan.  An Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Ireland is being finalised by my Department working with SEI and other relevant Government Departments. I intend to publish the Plan for consultation in April.  In September 2006, I launched the national energy efficiency awareness campaign, the Power of One. The campaign involves building awareness of the types and sources of energy we use; raising awareness of the impact of inefficient use of energy in terms of increased costs to the user, the economy and the environment; informing and empowering the general public on best practices in terms of saving energy at home and at work; targeting individual sectors (e.g. industry, SMEs, schools, the public sector, the transport sector) with specific energy saving strategies; and building on existing programmes and initiatives on the island of Ireland and taking full account of EU developments.Eight television and seven radio commercials have been produced, each with a specific energy efficient message for the consumer. There is also an extensive press campaign to complement TV and radio, an online presence through www.powerofone.ie as well as regional and sectoral modules.  The campaign has benefited from the involvement of EirGrid as well as ESB, BGE and other energy suppliers.The reach of the Power of One campaign has been very significant with follow up research showing the television advertisements airing a total of 3,298 times to date with 84% of all individuals having seen the ads at least 5 times and the average frequency being almost 20 times.  Similarly, follow up research shows the radio message has been heard at least 5 times by 81% of all individuals, average frequency being up to 23 times.  Tailored energy efficiency messages in the national press have reached almost 2.5 million people with a further 1.5 million in the consumer press.  The outdoor campaign has been seen by 948,000 individuals with advertisements featuring in 190 sites across the country.  The Power of One message has also been seen by over 2 million people in cinemas nationwide.  The dedicated website www.powerofone.ie has been visited by over 35,000 people and over 25,000 information packs have been despatched from our mailing centre. The majority of the population has been exposed to sustained energy efficiency messages and advice over the past 5 months.Yesterday, I launched the Power of One Street which will track the energy usage of 8 families from all over the country.   Each month the participants will be set a challenge to improve their energy efficiency and their progress will be monitored and reported on over the next 6 months.  This initiative will drive home to everyone the simple changes that can be made to improve their energy efficiency and save on energy costs. Progress of the Power of One Street will be featured in media nationwide throughout the coming months.Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) promotes and assists the development of sustainable energy. Many of the SEI programmes have a strong energy efficiency focus.  Within the built environment, SEI targets the residential sector, small companies and public buildings such as local offices and schools in its promotion of energy efficiency.  Various supports are provided to promote sustainable energy practices in Irish housing.  These include model demonstration projects that have the potential for market influence and replication.  Emphasis is placed on the pre-1980 housing stock, with accompanying measures for low-income householders and the promotion of building energy rating.  Public-good research is conducted to guide policy and identify deficiencies and barriers to energy performance improvements.Focus is in the following areas: House of Tomorrow: This programme stimulates the widespread uptake of more sustainable energy planning, design, specification and construction practices in both the new home building and the home improvement markets.  The House of Tomorrow Programme funds demonstration projects to create a nationwide network of accessible, replicable model examples of more sustainable energy practices in Irish housing.  A total of 131 projects have been supported to end 2006, including social housing new build projects, private housing new build and social housing refurbishment projects. 4,854 houses were built under this programme by the end of 2006 which is nearly 200% higher than the NDP target of 1650 houses completed.Home Energy Rating: The primary focus of this programme is to prepare for and enable the successful implementation of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) in Ireland.  A key element is to address the need for a comprehensive, nationally recognised building energy rating system aimed at making energy efficiency an explicit factor in building transactions and renovation decisions.  As the designated Issuing Authority, SEI's priority now is to ensure that there is an appropriate system and process in place to deliver on the legislative obligations and meet early market demand for Building Energy Rating Certificates.Public Sector: This programme promotes energy-efficient design, technologies and services in new and retrofit public sector projects.  Under this programme, the energy performance of public sector buildings is enhanced through improved design, investment and management. In the period up to August 2006, 79 design studies, 71 model solutions and 2 energy management bureaux were approved for funding. 54 model solution projects have been completed with the remainder well advanced.  High profile examples of projects funded as demonstrations under this programme are Limerick County Council offices as well as recently completed Kildare County Council.Low-Income Housing: This programme was set up to help establish and implement a national plan of action to address this problem systematically.  Core delivery is through its Warmer Homes Scheme aimed at improving the energy efficiency and comfort conditions of affected homes. The total number of houses substantially addressed to end 2006 was over 10,700. There are 15 community based organisations that are approved for funding to complete homes in 2006.  The service is now available in Dublin, Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Westmeath, Roscommon, Cork, Kerry, Wexford, Cavan, Limerick and Leitrim.SEI also works in co-operation with Irish industry to reduce the energy intensity of the enterprise sector and helps Irish industry to adopt new and more effective approaches to managing energy costs. Industry programmes support measures to address market failure through provision of information, verification and demonstration, and certification and benchmarking. SEI hosts initiatives for medium-sized industrial enterprises on the acceptance of best practice by way of recognised standards and supported by certification.Focus is in the following areas: Agreements: The objective of this programme is to support firms in protecting their competitiveness in the context of high and rising energy prices.  The programme provides firms with the opportunity to apply a structured approach to reducing costs through an agreed schedule of energy efficiency measures over a three year period.  The initial group of 10 companies recruited in May 2006 is expected to collectively save up to €20 million over the next three years.  The programme is to be expanded to incorporate a further 40 (14 already recruited) of the top energy users in Ireland. Savings of up to €50 million could be made over a 3-year period upon reaching that target level of participation.Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN): LIEN is a voluntary networking initiative comprising 85 of the largest industrial energy users in Ireland.  LIEN members recognise that a structured approach to energy auditing and management is a valuable tool for driving energy efficiency.  As published in its most recent annual report during 2005, members avoided €27 million in energy costs and achieved a saving of 173,647 tons of carbon dioxide.Combined Heat and Power (CHP): The programme strategy incorporates elements such as the evaluation of district heating potential in Ireland and feasibility studies/pilot plans for innovative CHP projects. It provides support for the regulatory and legislative treatment of CHP and assists the Government in the development of a CHP policy.  In 2006 I launched an €11m CHP grants programme aimed at increasing deployment of this energy efficiency technology over a 5 year period.SEI also provides targeted information to heighten consumer awareness of the environmental impacts of energy use and to provide information on options for greater sustainability.  The Consumer Information Programme aims to motivate consumers to become more energy efficient in their daily lives by making them aware of their energy usage and informing them of the simple actions they can take. An education programme brings the topic of energy use into the classroom in an interesting and engaging way. It enables pupils to develop an awareness of where energy comes from, the environmental impacts of its use and the responsibilities that individuals bear to reduce consumption.  Over 450 interactive workshops take place throughout Ireland annually reaching in excess of 13,000 primary school students.  The workshops are divided into two levels: Guzzler Workshops and Energy Challenge Workshops.Energy Efficiency and energy saving strategies are a key priority for the Government and this will be reflected in the forthcoming White Paper on Energy Policy which will be underpinned by the National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency.

The independent Transmission System Operator (TSO), EirGrid, monitors the adequacy of generation capacity over time and reports to the CER accordingly.In line with international norms, the generation system in Ireland is designed, planned and monitored such that it meets a standard which requires it to meet all reasonable demands for supply.  This is designed to ensure that, in designing the system, the appropriate balance is met between protecting security of supply and the cost of building and running the system.  At my request, the adequacy of electricity generation is being kept under consistent collective review by my Department in consultation with the CER and EirGrid. The most recent advice to me from CER and EirGrid is that the generation system is currently adequate to meet demand, and provides a sufficient margin to meet the security standard.  The CER has also advised that there is sufficient generating capacity, both installed and planned, on the system to meet the predicted demand in the short term.  The CER advises me that this assessment is predicated on planned developments in power generation including the addition of almost 550MW of new generation capacity in 2006, (at Tynagh, Co. Galway and Aughinish, Co. Limerick), the expected commissioning of a second new 400MW plant in Autumn of this year (at Huntstown, Co. Dublin), the further development of almost 900MW of new plant in the South West by the end of 2009 and planned improved interconnection on the island of Ireland and with the U.K.  The Government has conveyed to CER its view that additional mid merit capacity should be put in place in the short to medium term.The CER is taking measures to facilitate the development of the system such that it remains adequate to maintain the security standard. Significant levels of investment have been made in the Irish transmission system in recent years with plans for continued investment to the end of this decade. Between 2002 and 2010, almost €1 billion will be invested in the Irish transmission system, which will ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that the system is capable of handling exceptional circumstances.The Government is also concerned to ensure that adequate provision is also made to encourage the development of an electricity portfolio, which can support and complement the ambitious targets which we have now set for renewable growth. Decisions in this regard by the CER, EirGrid and the Government will be informed by the need to ensure capacity and competition in the generation sector while reflecting the overriding consideration of security of supply.

The Government has indicated plans to further increase that target to 33% by 2010.The support programme operated by my Department to complete the increased 2010 target is commonly referred to as REFIT,  (Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff).  Every project submitted in REFIT to date which has complied with the essential requirements regarding a connection and planning permission has been accepted into the support programme.REFIT is designed to support proven technologies primarily. Other renewable energy technologies which remain in the research or developmental phase can access the "research, development and demonstration programme" operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland.  The development of an Irish biofuels market and the increased development and deployment of bio-energy resources in Ireland is a key priority for the Government. A range of initiatives are in place to support the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland.On Monday 12th February I signalled my intention to introduce a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, which will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  In announcing the obligation, I have also committed to achieving 5.75% market penetration of biofuels by 2009, in advance of the date proposed for such a target in the EU Biofuels Directive. I have also committed to achieving 10% market penetration of biofuels in Ireland by 2010.The introduction of the Biofuels Obligation will build on the success of the two biofuels excise relief schemes which were rolled out in 2005 and 2006.

The generally peaceful and orderly conduct of the 2006 Presidential and Parliamentary elections "the first democratic elections in more than forty years" was a tribute to the strong desire of the Congolese people for an end to conflict and a return to democracy. Major challenges remain if the transition process is to be successfully completed. The elections themselves have left divisions which will need to be healed through an inclusive approach to opposition concerns. In December 2006, the European Council expressed the EU's intention to continue its support to the Congolese authorities in tackling security sector reform, including through the ongoing work of the EUPOL Kinshasa police mission and EUSC RD Congo civilian mission.Ireland does not have a resident diplomatic mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Embassy of Ireland in Pretoria, which is responsible for Ireland's relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been in contact with EU diplomats, and through them the UN mission (MONUC) and the EU police mission (EUPOL Kinshasa) in DR Congo, in recent days to enquire into the well-being of the opposition party leader Étienne Tshisekedi.The Embassy has not been advised through these contacts of any specific threat against Mr. Tshisekedi. We understand that there is a permanent presence of CONADER, the Government's army demobilisation agency, in the neighbourhood of Mr. Tshisekedi's house, which would inevitably lead to a certain military presence in the area. We have also received reports that on 15 February 2007, in celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of Mr. Tshisekedi's Party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), there was a small gathering of party members outside the gate of his residence, but that the atmosphere was not threatening. However, given that the security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo has not yet fully stabilised following the transition period, the Embassy of Ireland in Pretoria will continue to monitor the situation.Ireland helped to fund the Presidential and Parliamentary elections in Democratic Republic of Congo in 2006, and has also given financial support to the demobilisation and reintegration process in the wider Great Lakes region. Ireland is a significant humanitarian donor to the DRC. Already in 2007, Ireland has committed €7 million in humanitarian aid funding to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Ireland's total support to the country since 2004 totals over €23 million.

This is scheduled to take place during the second half of 2007 and will involve the relocation to Limerick of 124 posts.At present, 54 posts in the Directorate are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. Five of these officers transferred from provincial locations to the Directorate's offices in Dublin.In addition to these 54 posts, a further 15 officers who are serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, will be taking up duty in Irish Aid in advance of the move. Furthermore, 19 officers from other Departments who have applied to decentralise to Limerick, most of whom are currently based in provincial locations, will transfer to the Department closer to the date of the move. Once these officers take up duty in Irish Aid, 88 posts (71% of the 124 posts scheduled to move) will be in place.In addition, a small number of staff at entry grades will be recruited for direct assignment to Limerick in the months preceding the move.In order to help effect the smoothest possible transfer to Limerick, plans are in train for an advance party move involving approximately 50 staff members which is scheduled for late May 2007.Sixteen Dublin based officers of this Department have transferred to other Departments with a view to moving to a provincial location under the Decentralisation Programme. Most of these officers initially transferred to Dublin- based offices of the respective decentralising Departments.

It is understood from the Council that there are 143 works in the CIE collection, which were jointly funded under the Arts Council's Joint Purchase Scheme. An examination by the Arts Council of its records identified all of the works which CIE had purchased between the 1950s and the 1970s. Refunds had been paid in respect of four of the works, two of which were returned, one which was given on retirement to a staff member and one which had apparently been stolen. At the time of the examination 46 works remained with CIE and were not in the possession of the Dublin Airport Authority or the Great Southern Hotels.In September 2006 91 works were transferred by the Dublin Airport Authority into the care of the OPW. Ten of these works were not purchased under the scheme. I have designated the Crawford Art Gallery Cork, which is now a national cultural institution, under the aegis of my Department, as the home gallery of this Collection.

This commits the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) 180 member states worldwide to respect the principles inherent in the core labour standards and to promote their universal application.  The Declaration emphasises that all Member States of the ILO have an obligation to respect, promote and realise, in good faith and in accordance with the constitution of the ILO, the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of those Conventions namely:(a) freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;(b) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour;(c) the effective abolition of child labour; and(d) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.Ireland has ratified all seven ILO Conventions and core labour standards embodied within the Declaration. Ireland only ratifies an ILO Convention where we can accept every single provision and where our legislation is fully in conformity with the relevant Convention.In June 1999, the International Labour Conference adopted Convention No. 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour.  Ireland registered its ratification of that Convention on 20th December 1999 and was the first European Union country to do so.In addition to the international conventions on child labour which come within the ambit of the International Labour Office, I would also refer the Deputy to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which falls within the area of responsibility of my colleague, Brian Lenihan T.D., Minister for Children.

Accordingly, Ireland cannot impose restrictions that are outside the Common Commercial Policy rules.The EU has a long-standing commitment to the promotion of core labour standards and social development; the charter of fundamental rights of the EU confirms the aim to fully integrate these standards in all its policies and actions. In line with that policy, cooperation agreements between the EU and other countries include, as a matter of course, human rights and core labour standard clauses as set out in International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions. The abolition of child labour is one of those ILO core labour standards.The EU also uses its trade policy mechanisms to encourage other countries to improve standards by offering additional preferential access dependant on adherence to ILO conventions.  Furthermore, within the World Trade Organisation, the EU, with our support, has been pursuing improved international regulation in the area of trade and labour standards.Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to promote core labour standards.  In 1998, we supported the adoption by the ILO of a Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date of late 2009, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are progressing an earlier move to Carlow. The OPW have advised my Department that negotiations on the procurement of interim accommodation to facilitate an advance move are nearing completion.I expect this advance move option to allow for the movement of approximately 80 decentralising staff to Carlow during the second quarter of 2007, on a voluntary basis.  The number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow, as at 19th February, is 280.

It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone. It was introduced in 1977 at the rate of £1.00 (€1.27) per week.  The policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension, rather than focusing on payments such as the living alone increase.  This approach ensures that resources are used to improve the position of all pensioners and is subject to regular review.  It was decided in the context of Budget 2007 to continue this policy with maximum increases of €16 and €18 per week granted on personal rates giving a the maximum rate of the state pension (contributory) of  €209.30 per week and a maximum non-contributory pension paid at €200 per week.

Amounts held in Special Savings Investment Accounts are treated in the same manner as other capital.In 2005 the amount of capital disregarded for means test purposes for all schemes (except supplementary welfare allowance) was increased from €12,694.38 to €20,000, an increase of over €7,300. The enhanced disregard applies to all capital regardless of where it is held, be it in an SSIA, a Credit Union, with An Post or any other account with a bank or other financial institution.

The new pension replaced the Old Age Non-Contributory Pension and, for recipients aged 66 and over, Blind Pension, Widow/er's Pension, One Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife's Allowance and Prisoner's Wife's Allowance.All these schemes currently featured a common means disregard of €7.60 per week, which applied to means from all sources, including those derived from capital. This disregard was increased to €20 per week from September 2006 and further increased to €30 per week with effect from January last.  The new capital assessment arrangements introduced in 2005, combined with other means disregard improvements introduced in 2006 and 2007 for the State Pension Non-Contributory, mean that a single non-contributory pensioner, with no other means, can have capital of up to €40,000 and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.  These arrangements were designed to ensure that social welfare means testing arrangements do not act as a disincentive to claimants to become savers or to penalise those who have been regular savers in the past.

There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.  The Dublin/Mid-Leinster Area of the Executive have advised that no application has been received from the person concerned for an exceptional needs payment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	825	From September 2007 people in receipt of another social welfare payment who are also providing full time care and attention to a person will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent of a half rate carer's allowance. A person currently in receipt of a carer's allowance who may have an underlying entitlement to another social welfare payment will be able transfer to that payment and receive up to a half rate carer's allowance. This does not apply to persons in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or benefit, given the nature of these payments.In order to qualify under these new arrangements people will have to satisfy all of the qualifying conditions which currently apply to carer's allowance. These include the requirement that applicants must be providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care, be aged 18 or over, be habitually resident in the state and satisfy a means test. In addition, the person being cared for must need continuous supervision and frequent help throughout the day with their personal needs or continuous supervision to avoid danger to themselves and require full time care and attention for at least 12 months. It is estimated that approximately 18,000 carers will benefit from this measure at cost of some €57 million in a full year.

In these cases, a once-off payment of an additional days pension is being made in recognition of the changeover from a Thursday payday (for State Pension Transition) to a Friday payday (for State Pension Contributory) on reaching age 66.This legislation was implemented in January 2007 in the case of customers being paid their pension by electronic fund transfer.  Customers being paid their pension by means of payable order book will have the change implemented on the 30th March next.  The rate at which the additional days pension is paid depends on the date the customer reached the age of 66, and the transfer to State Pension Contributory became effective.   In those cases where the customer reached the age of 66 prior to the 1st January 2007 (when the 2007 Budget rates became effective), the additional day's payment is based on the pension rates which applied at that time, ie 2006 rates.  In the case of customers reaching the age of 66 from 1st January 2007 (when the 2007 budget rates came into effect) onwards, the additional day is payable at the 2007 (post-Budget) rates.

Up to €75 of weekly earnings is disregarded in the rent supplement means test to ensure that a person gains financially as a result of taking up a CE place, part-time employment or other such opportunities. Additional allowances with the CE payment are also disregarded.The Health Service Executive was contacted concerning the case raised by the Deputy and has advised it is satisfied that the person concerned is receiving her full entitlement to rent supplement based on her current income from participation on a Community Employment scheme and her one-parent family payment.  However, the one-parent family payment does not take account of her earnings from participation on community employment and now falls to be reviewed in the light of her new circumstances.  In the light of any reduction to her one parent family payment arising from the review, it will be in the interest of the person concerned to have her rent supplement again reviewed by the Executive to ensure that she continues to be €75 per week better off for having taken up a CE place.I am conscious of the need to ensure that people on social welfare payments have an incentive to take up employment to improve their situation and I am anxious to take any possible measures to facilitate this. In Budget 2007, I provided for additional welfare to work measures including an increase in weekly earnings disregard.  I also introduced an additional measure which will allow existing rent supplement tenants awaiting accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme to take up full-time employment and remain eligible for rent supplement subject to the standard means test.  These measures are provided for in the recently published Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill 2007.

To qualify for Jobseeeker's allowance a person must also be available for and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned applied for jobseeker's allowance on 19 January 2007.  A Deciding Officer assessed his means at €329.00 from 19 January 2007, derived from income from self-employment.  This assessment exceeds the maximum weekly rate of jobseeker's allowance payable which in his case is €185.80.  He is not, therefore, entitled to jobseeker's allowance.  It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision and a form for this purpose was issued to him on 13 February 2007. The person concerned is currently in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

These customers collect their payment at post offices, using their social services card. In general, the response to the change in payment method has been positive. From 16 February 2007 some 580 widowed persons, the remaining one-parent family payment cases, transferred to the EIT payment method.Under the EIT system, payments are held at the Post Office and are available for collection for 12 days from the due date.  The twelve day period allows the customer the flexibility to collect the payment at a suitable time in the given period. If the payment is not collected within the 12 days, it is returned to my Department.  In circumstances where the customer has been unable to collect the payment, for instance due to illness, work commitments, holidays etc, arrangements are made to have the payment reissued by cheque to the person's home address as soon as possible.Payment by EIT provides for enhanced services to our customers as changes in their circumstances (change of address, change of payment rate, etc) can easily and quickly be applied to their claims.  Similarly changes to rates of payment arising from budget increases can be implemented more efficiently under electronic payment methods.  One of the features of the EIT payment method is the Household Budgeting facility.  This is a facility provided by An Post whereby a regular amount can be deducted from social welfare payment and transmitted by An Post to utility companies and local authorities to offset bills and rents.In the light of experience of the EIT for one parent family payment my Department is reviewing the encashment patterns for the last 12 months and the situation regarding the 12 day limit will be examined in light of this review.

A letter issued to the applicant on 13 February 2003 setting out details of the overpayment.  The overpayment was recorded under the name of the person who was the registered herdowner up until 13 April 2001 following which the persons named became the registered herdowners.  The overpayment was not subsequently deducted because of the change in the registration details of the herdnumber.  A further communication regarding the overpayment was issued automatically to the applicant recently.  However, my officials have since reviewed the original decision to raise the overpayment and have concluded that the overpayment should not have been established.  I very much regret therefore that the most recent communication issued erroneously to the applicant.  My Department will now write to the applicant confirming that no overpayment exists.

The European Commission has expressed the gravest concern at any further planting within these areas until it is possible to fully assess the impact of forestry on the species.  In order to do that, it is necessary to work out what type of management regime needs to be put in place to accommodate both forestry and the hen harrier in the areas being proposed as Special Protection Areas.  The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has established a working group, on which the forestry and farming interests are represented, as well as my Department, to help with the development of such a management regime.

It sets down the conditions for the transport of all vertebrate animals, including greyhounds, throughout the European Community.  The Regulation has been given legal effect by the European Communities (Animal Transport and Control Post) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 675 of 2006).  Provisions in the legislation include, inter alia, requirements that transporters must ensure that the animals are fit for transport and are accommodated to avoid risk of injury or unnecessary suffering.  Animals must be provided with adequate ventilation and space to stand in their natural position, unhindered and to lie down.  Food and water must be available to the animals so that they can be fed at intervals not exceeding 24 hours and watered at intervals not exceeding 12 hours (8 hours in the case of dogs).  Any person transporting animals, including dogs on distances in excess of 65 km in connection with an economic activity must be authorised by my Department.  In addition vehicles used to transport animals on long journeys (over 8 hours) must be inspected and approved.The legislation also requires that transport of animals by air must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the latest edition of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) live animals Regulations.  These Regulations relate to international standards for containers, pens or stalls appropriate for the transport of live animals by air.  The IATA is a self-regulating body that represents airlines in promoting safe, reliable and secure air services.  Provisions regarding the training and certification of personnel involved in the handling of animals during transport will come into effect in January 2008.  I believe this Regulation will further improve the conditions under which animals are transported throughout the European Union.

Accordingly, I do not have the discretion to raise this age threshold as I would wish to do in view of the major progress achieved here in relation to BSE.  I have been making repeated efforts to have the age thresholds for the various categories of animals changed, based on the results of surveillance carried out here.  Under the recently amended TSE regulation there is provision for a revision to member states' monitoring programmes (including changes to the age at which healthy slaughtered animals for human consumption must be tested for BSE) on the basis of applications by Member States in response to their improved BSE situation.  Such applications will have to be assessed according to criteria for evaluating the improvement of the epidemiological situation that has yet to be laid down.  The matter is under discussion at TSE working group level in Brussels and will take some time to finalise.  Any request for such changes would require to be approved by the European Commission and the other Member States within the framework of the Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain.  I will, of course continue to press for a change in the age threshold at every opportunity.

Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or postgraduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, and nationality.The assessment of means under my Department's Third Level Student Maintenance Grant Schemes is based on gross income from all sources, with specified social welfare and health service executive  payments being excluded from the calculation. Under the schemes reckonable income is defined as income fromEmployment/Pensions;Self Employment/Farming;Rent and income from Land/Property;Deposit/Investment Accounts;Maintenance Arrangements;Gifts/Inheritances and Disposal of Assets and Rights;Social Welfare in certain circumstances.A P21 is a statement of total income, tax credit and tax paid for a particular tax year.  A P60 cannot suffice as an individual may have more than one source of income or may be jointly assessed with their spouse which means that a P60 from one employer would not give the full information required.The Deputy will be aware that through the Revenue Online Service (ROS) an individual can avail of the interactive facility offering business and individuals a quick, secure and cost effective method to manage their Tax Affairs, including the acquisition of a P21 on-line.

The census for the current school-year (2006/07) is currently being worked on and data are not yet available. Data at sub-county area are not generally available due to the inordinate amount of work involved.Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there were 4000 more primary teachers, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes. As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.

However, it is recognised that the very nature of self-employment is the risk factor that is the uncertainty/fluctuating nature of the income and expenditure.  This is the essential distinguishing feature from employment.Officials of my Department contacted the Higher Education Grant Section of Limerick County Council concerning the candidate referred to by the Deputy.  Limerick County Council confirmed that the candidate was not eligible for the grant as the reckonable income exceeded the prescribed limit for the academic year 2006/2007.  I regret that it is not possible to allow grant aid where the reckonable income exceeds the prescribed limits irrespective of the particular circumstances.While I understand that the portion of the candidate's parents' income from the chicken enterprise has now ceased due to the closure of Castlemahon Poultry Products, this drop in income will be reflected in their accounts, as they are self employed, in the relevant tax year.Apart from the Schemes of Student Support and the Free Fees Initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees in approved colleges at undergraduate level, my Department also provides funding to approved third level institutions to operate a Student Assistance Fund to assist students in a compassionate and sensitive manner who may otherwise have to leave college due to financial hardship.  Information on the fund is available from the Access Officer at the college being attended by the candidate referred to by the Deputy.

The purpose of this Team was envisaged as helping identify problems of student behaviour in second-level schools, leading to the development of strategies to resolve these problems and to facilitate the implementation of these strategies in practice.Since then, and over a short time-scale, a National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) has been established which is based in Navan Education Centre. A multi-disciplinary professional team has been recruited and appointed to the NBSS which consists of a National Co-ordinator, four Assistant National Co-ordinators, eight Regional Development Officers and twenty part-time Associates. In addition, a senior psychologist and three psychologists have been assigned to the team. A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.At this moment there is sufficient staff employed for the Behaviour Support Service.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	878	I can inform the Deputy that the number of psychologists in the Department has increased from 43 since the establishment of NEPS in 1999 to a current figure of 127, including 4 psychologists assigned to the National Behavioural Support Service. There are also a further 16 Whole-time-equivalent educational psychologists providing service through the Dublin City and County VECs. Taken together, there are currently 143 educational psychologists working in services paid for by my Department.I announced recently in this connection my intention to expand the number of NEPS psychologists by a further 31 in 2007. This will represent a significant increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS and bring the total number of psychologists in the system to 174.At this time 6 of these psychologists are in the process of being appointed and officials of my Department will shortly engage in discussions with the Public Appointments Commission with a view to recruiting the remaining complement as expeditiously as possible within 2007.  Decisions in relation to the actual placement of the extra psychologists will be made in the context of existing and developing priorities for the National Education Psychological Service.This budgetary allocation for NEPS amounts to €17.7m in 2007.  In line with the Government's ‘Towards 2016' commitments, the number of NEPS psychologists will be increased even further in each of 2008 and 2009, to a total of 193. At this point, including the 16 psychologists in the Dublin VEC areas, it is expected that the number of educational psychologists in the system as a whole will be 209.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The latest data published by my Department on retention rates in second-level schools relate to the cohort of entrants to the first year of junior cycle in 1996. Students in this cohort would have sat the Leaving Certificate in either 2001 or 2002, depending on whether they took the Transition Year Programme.The published data for the 1996 cohort indicate an average "unadjusted" retention rate to Leaving Certificate of 72.1 for the Dublin area (combining the four Local Authority areas) as compared with a national average figure of77.8%. The term "unadjusted" relates to the fact that the figures cited have not been adjusted to allow for factors such as emigration, death or cases of departure to privately aided second level colleges. The national adjusted Leaving Certificate retention rate for the 1996 cohort was81.3%.  The ‘unadjusted' rate of retention for males in Dublin was 67.1 compared to 77.5% for females in Dublin.  The corresponding national averages were 72.1 and 83.8%, respectively.As regards those who depart from second-level education prior to the Leaving Certificate, the available statistical evidence indicates that the increasing range of further education and training opportunities available for these students is having a positive impact. CSO data show that the educational profile of 20-24 year olds in Ireland has improved steadily over the last five years, as increasing opportunities have been made available in the further education and training sector. By 2005, 85.8% of 20-24 year olds had attained upper second-level education or equivalent, up from 82.6% in 2000 and putting Ireland way ahead of the EU average of 77.5%.Given the clear link between leaving the system without formal qualifications and continued socioeconomic disadvantage in adult life, the Government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that children and young people get the opportunities and supports they need to enable them to complete their education and secure their future economic and personal well being. Against the background of our continuing economic success, our increasingly well educated population (with over 40% of 25-34 year olds having a third-level qualification, among the highest in the EU) and inward migration, those who leave school early without adequate qualifications face serious difficulties and challenges.My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving. We established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school. We have widened the range of curricula available to students by promoting the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme in addition to the traditional Junior and Leaving Certificate curricula.We have also put preventative measures in place such as the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL). Under the School Completion Programme children at risk of early school leaving are targeted for a variety of extra supports, educational and non-educational, during and outside of school time — all aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme helps to get parents involved in their children's education, which as we all know is a crucial component of convincing young people of the value of education.Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which is being implemented at present. The action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multifaceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3-18 year olds in this country.In relation to second chance educational opportunities for young people who left school early, this Government has shown a sustained commitment to providing greater opportunities in the adult and further education sectors. Many such young people take up places in Youthreach centres, while others pursue options such as FÁS apprenticeships.I would like to assure the Deputy that we have greatly intensified our efforts in recent years both to keep more young people in school and to provide increased educational opportunities for those who left school early. I will continue to prioritise further progress in this area.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	880	Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of this Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.  Otherwise, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.On a general note, at post primary level, students have increased mobility as evidenced by the fact that a large number of pupils from the area in question here travel outside of their immediate vicinity to other schools. While I am satisfied that there are sufficient post primary places available both within the immediate area or within a short commuting distance to cater for demand currently, I am conscious that there is also significant on-going housing development in the area.  The Department is examining the need for another post primary school on this basis.To ease pressure on places in the area overall, I have given the go-ahead for the delivery of a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school in Phibblestown and sites have been reserved for further post primary schools in both Tyrrelstown and Hansfield.With regard to the proposed PE Hall project for the school referred to by the Deputy, this was included in my announcement of May 2006 to progress to tender and construction.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	883	The recent investment priorities under the ICT in Schools Programme have been the provision of networking grants to schools and the Schools Broadband Access Programme.  Schools were invited to submit proposals for the development of their networking capability in June 2004 and grants totalling some €23m have since issued to schools.The roll-out of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools is being undertaken in partnership with industry, in the context of the joint Government — IBEC — TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) three year Agreement to fund local connectivity at school level. The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, in order to provide managed Internet access, email, security controls and content filtering. A broadband support service is being managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network. The overall costs of the Schools Broadband Access Programme, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the three years, are in the region of €30m.The National Development Plan contains a provision of €252m for ICT in schools, the essential purpose of which is to advance the embedding of an e-Learning culture in teaching and learning in our schools. I intend to publish a new ICT strategy this year covering the period of the National Development Plan.  As part of the development of this new strategy, it will be necessary to consider and address a wide range of issues including teacher education, teacher professional development, curriculum developments, the maintenance of the national broadband network for schools, the upgrading and renewal of hardware and the provision of software and digital content for learning. The planned investment will also address maintenance and support requirements. It is my intention to build on the recent investment in networking grants to schools and the Schools Broadband Access Programme in developing the new ICT Strategy, based on the investments outlined in the NDP.Furthermore, at post-primary level the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus at Leaving Certificate level will be introduced with effect from September 2007.  Some €25 million has been distributed to approximately 500 post-primary schools to upgrade their facilities to enable them to provide these subjects.  The funding will be used to provide top spec hardware such as PCs, laptops, printers, scanners, digital scanners and data projectors which will be integrated into daily teaching and learning.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	885	A decision was taken by the Trustees of the school to which the Deputy refers that it will close in June 2007.  This decision was taken because, in line with demographic changes in the area, the school has experienced a steady decline in enrolments in recent years. Current enrolments in feeder primary schools indicate that this decline will continue. In fact, a general decline in enrolments in the area where the school is located has resulted in considerable spare capacity at post primary level.Coupled with the decline in enrolments, the Department was also concerned about the ability of the school in question to offer a broad and balanced curriculum given the relatively small number of pupils enrolled. In all of the circumstances, the Department concurred with the Trustees decision to close the school.When it closes, ownership of the school property, which is currently vested in the trustees, will revert to the Department. In the period leading up to the closure, the Department will consider all available options with regard to its future use.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	886	The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network. My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children have greatest opportunity mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration.My Department's ongoing commitment is to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs. In this regard my Department has established:181 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools.5 special classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome.16 preschool classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum.14 Stand alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodologies on a pilot basis — 2 of these facilities have yet to be established.Children on the autistic spectrum may, depending on their individual needs, attend mainstream school on a fully or partially integrated basis or attend special autism-specific classes or units in mainstream schools or special schools.  My Department does not accept that all children on the autistic spectrum require one-to-one support. The staffing complement in special classes for children with autism is one teacher and a minimum of two SNAs to each class of six pupils. Additional SNA support may be provided on the basis of the assessed needs of individual pupils.The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 requires that all children with special educational needs are educated in inclusive environments with children who do not have such needs unless the nature or degree of those needs is such that to do so would be inconsistent with the best interests of the child as determined in accordance with any assessment carried out under the Act or the effective provision of education for children with whom the child is to be educated.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	887	Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school-year (2006/07) is currently being worked on. Details on class size in primary schools will be available for Counties. Data by sub-county areas are not generally available due to the inordinate amount of work involved.Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	888	Since September 2003 Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is taught to all pupils in primary schools. Its aim is to foster personal development, health and well being of children, to help them create and maintain supportive relationships, and develop the skills and attitudes for responsible citizenship.From the beginning of their primary schooling children learn, in an age-appropriate way, how to identify, explore and express feelings and emotions, how to communicate with others, to resolve conflict and to respect difference, the importance of caring for one's body, treating oneself and others with dignity and respect, and how to identify people, places and situations that may threaten personal safety.SPHE has been compulsory in the junior cycle of post-primary schools since September 2003.  The modules at junior cycle deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, bullying, dealing with peer pressure, coping with stress, emotional health and well being, influences on decision-making, and relationships and sexuality education. In third year, an awareness of the range of agencies who can help students in difficulty is promoted, as well as the skills of knowing when and how to seek help. SPHE is designed for implementation in the context of a caring whole-school approach which is supported by the pastoral care structures in schools.All post-primary schools provide a guidance and counselling service for their students and they receive ex-quota hours from the Department for this provision. The service includes the provision of individual guidance and counselling for students either at critical stages in their education or at times of personal crisis.Schools also use Mental Health Matters, a resource pack on mental health for 14 to 18 year olds developed by Mental Health Ireland on an optional basis as a module in the Transition Year Programme, an element of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme, a component of the SPHE programme or an element of other subjects such as Religion or Home Economics.The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) operating within my Department provides a range of services both direct and indirect which support the personal, social and educational development of all children in primary and post-primary schools. NEPS provides access to psychological assessment either directly from the National Educational Psychological Service of my Department or through the Scheme for Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. The Service provides for a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  A child is referred for individual psychological assessment only where this approach does not result in reasonable progress.For those who have left school early, my Department offers a second chance programme of integrated general education, vocational training and work experience through Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training Centres, while FÁS offers a similar programme through a network of Community Training Workshops. These services all offer guidance, counselling and psychological services to students.There is no psychological service for adults availing of adult education, but the educational adult guidance services offered by the VECs and the guidance and pastoral care services in third level colleges operate referral services as appropriate to other agencies.

Over 134,000 children are carried each day on school transport to primary and post-primary schools. It is a major logistical operation which involves the planning of bus routes in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible pupils have a reasonable level of service while, at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and effective manner.In general a school transport service is organised to ensure the maximum travel and waiting time does not exceed 2.5 hours. The school transport service referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, is operating within the guidelines of the school transport scheme.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	898	I propose to take Questions Nos. 507, 509, 510 and 511 together.In order to meet the language needs of students in our schools whose first language is not English, additional support is given to their schools which can take the form of financial assistance, additional teaching posts or portions of posts.The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled. The additional language support to an individual pupil is generally given for a period of two years.Under current arrangements, schools with 14 newcomer pupils, who are eligible for language support, are entitled to one language support teaching post while schools with 28 or more eligible pupils are entitled to two posts.I indicated at the conference of the Irish Primary Principals Network on 26th January, 2007 that the two teacher rule and the two-year rule will no longer apply.There are now approximately 1,250 language support teachers in our schools. More than 400 of these teachers have been allocated in the current school year alone. As I announced last November, 200 extra posts were approved by the Government for 2007, bringing to 1,450 the number of language teachers that will be working in our schools this year. This compares with just 262 posts in the 2001/02 school year.In line with the Government's commitments under the ‘Towards 2016' partnership agreement, a further 350 language support teachers will be provided between 2008 and 2009. In allocating additional teachers, I will be addressing in particular the position of those schools catering for significant numbers of newcomer children.

In particular, all students undertake a course to prepare them to teach English in accordance with the revised primary school curriculum. Two modules of this course are taken in each year of the three year B. Ed. and it includes the teaching of English as an additional language for students. In addition, the Colleges of Education address the specific issues involved in the teaching of students whose first language is not English in a variety of ways. These include intercultural education, language acquisition and specialised courses in second language teaching. St. Patrick's College provides an elective course with a specific focus on teaching English as a second language. Coláiste Mhuire Marino and Mary Immaculate College Limerick are developing a specific and targeted elective programme to addresses the issues involved.My Department also funds Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT) to provide specific language training to language support teachers and school Principals. Between 2004 and 2006, nearly 1,800 primary teachers attended these training courses.Additional downloadable material is available from the Integrate Ireland Web site at www.iilt.ie

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	906	The mainstream staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year is outlined in Primary Circular 0023/2006 which was issued to all primary schools.In the current school year (2006/07) the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises a Principal and three mainstream class teaching posts, based on an enrolment of 85 pupils at 30th September, 2005 as submitted by the Board of Management of the school. The school also has the services of 2 Learning Support/Resource teacher posts.In addition, under the DEIS programme, the school has access to a teacher/co-ordinator, serving a cluster of schools, whose functions include the development of home, school and community linkages, literacy and numeracy measures and planning supports.  The school will continue to retain this service for the duration of the DEIS Action Plan. My Department is planning to evaluate the efficacy of this service and the long-term arrangements to be adopted in the area will be the subject of a review, aimed at determining whether the particular model of support involved is the most appropriate in this context.The Board of Management has submitted a report indicating that there were 73 pupils enrolled in the school on the 30th September 2006. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2007/08 school year will be determined on that figure and in accordance with the staffing schedule for the 2007/2008 school year which will be finalised as soon as possible.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	907	The person referred to by the Deputy is seeking payment of arrears under the Part-Time Workers Act 2001.Arrears entitlements conferred on casual/non-casual teachers under the terms of the Act apply to qualified teachers only. A teacher in a voluntary secondary school is considered qualified if they can be registered as a secondary teacher, i.e. they must have a degree with teaching subjects and a Higher Diploma in Education.In this specific case, the person applied to the Registration Council for recognition of her qualifications on the 30th May, 2005. The Registration Council assessed the applicant's qualifications and found that certain shortfalls existed.  She has been given a three year adaptation period within which to address these shortfalls and was granted provisional recognition taking effect from the 30th May, 2005.Teachers who have been granted provisional recognition may be employed in a second-level school at the rate of pay and conditions equivalent to that of a probationer teacher in the period permitted by the Registration Council for compliance with its decision.As the period the person referred to by the Deputy carried out the casual/non-casual teaching work was prior to the date of provisional recognition, she cannot be considered to be a qualified teacher and therefore, has no entitlement to arrears of pay.

Preparations are currently being made to accommodate the class within the school campus.The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism, receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post primary school network where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration. My Department supports an eclectic approach to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods can be applied specific to the needs of individual pupils.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	909	Caretaking staff in schools are employed by the individual school authorities.  My Department provides funding under two separate schemes towards the cost of employing these staff.  One such scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of full-time caretakers in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of pay.In 2006 I introduced, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, pension arrangements for caretaking staff employed under the 1979 Scheme.  These arrangements provide that membership of the pension scheme will be effective from 1 September 2001 in the case of eligible caretakers in service at that time.  The pension scheme will be  a contributory, defined benefit scheme and will provide standard public service pension benefits.Deduction of ongoing contributions commenced from eligible personnel with effect from 7 March 2006.  Arrears of contributions are payable in respect of the period from 1 September 2001 to the date ongoing deductions commenced, or the date membership ended if earlier.  Eligible staff will be notified in due course of the arrears due in respect of that period.  In accordance with standard public service arrangements, there is also provision for reckoning service given prior to 1 September 2001 subject to verification of the service concerned and payment of the appropriate contributions.Eligible staff and school authorities were informed of the introduction of the pension scheme prior to the commencement of deductions from pay.  A circular setting out further details regarding the scheme is being finalised and will be issued in the coming months.The calculation of retirement pension and retirement gratuity for a small number of eligible caretakers, who were in service on or after 1 September 2001 and who have recently retired,  is currently under way in my Department. It is expected that the first such payment will be made in the coming weeks.The 1979 Scheme is being phased out.  It has been superseded by an extensive grant scheme now referred to as the Ancillary Services grant.  The Ancillary Services grant provides funding for primary schools towards the cost of  secretarial and caretaking services.  The Scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.  Staff engaged by schools under the Ancillary Services grant are paid by the managerial authorities of the schools and are non-pensionable.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	910	Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school year (2006/2007) is currently being worked on.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this Government has halved the number of children in Longford in classes of 30 or more and has reduced the number in classes of 35 or more by 75%.The details of average class size in Co. Longford for the previous 10 years are included in the following table.Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.At the beginning of the current school year there were 4000 more primary teachers, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	911	Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The census for the current school year (2006/2007) is currently being worked on.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this Government has significantly reduced the number of children in Westmeath in classes of 30 or more and has cut the number in classes of 35 or more by 75%.  The details of average class size for the previous 10 years in Co. Westmeath are included in the table provided.CountyYearTotal PupilsNo. of ClassesAverage Class SizeWestmeath2005/20069,23837824.42004/20059,03437823.92003/20048,92337024.12002/20038,73536623.92001/20028,69635624.42000/20018,37334324.41999/20007,96532524.51998/19998,28233224.91997/19988,49033325.51996/19978,70133825.7Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there were 4000 more primary teachers, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.  Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next September this will reduce to 27 children per classroom teacher.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	912	I propose to take Questions Nos. 524 and 525 together.I wish to advise the Deputy that the information sought in respect of the number of newly appointed resource teachers in each of the past five years in primary schools in Counties Westmeath and Longford is not readily available in my Department.As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.My Department implemented a new scheme for allocating resource teachers to all mainstream primary schools in September 2005. The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs and those with learning support needs.Pupils assessed as having low incidence disabilities, such as autism, may be eligible for an individual allocation of resource teaching hours following submission of an application by the school to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO).At primary level, there are now more than 5,500 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to approximately 1,500 in 1998.At second level, approximately 1,868 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 533 whole time equivalent learning support teachers in our second level schools.The Deputy will also be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of the Department of Education and Science but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.

The compilation of information regarding the number of SNAs appointed to individual schools would require an inordinate amount of administrative time in my Department.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	916	At the outset, I want to assure the Deputy that the Department is anxious to provide a long term accommodation solution for the school to which he refers.In this regard, the Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, was asked to explore the possibility of acquiring a site for the school.Following an advertisement seeking proposals in relation to possible sites a number of responses were received. Six sites have been visited and their technical suitability as a location for the school was considered.Following this process, a site on the existing Tipperary Rural and Business Institute, TRBDI, campus emerged as the preferred option. This site is in the ownership of the Institute.The TRBDI, however, has proposed to the Department that its campus be relocated to a large-scale technology park. Expressions of Interest were sought by TRBDI from the private sector to determine what exactly could be provided at the technology park in exchange for the Institute's current property in Clonmel.  The Expressions of Interest sought required the incorporation of a suitable site for the school on the current campus or on an alternative site approved by the Department and the Office of Public Works. The Expressions of Interest received by TRBDI have been evaluated and detailed negotiations will now be entered into with the company that has submitted the tender provisionally identified as being the most economically advantageous.When this process has been completed, the Institute will be in a position to make a final proposal to the Department for consideration and approval.  At that point the situation in relation to a site for the school in question will be clearer.  It would be more appropriate to meet with the school authority at that stage.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	920	The Deputy will be aware that my Department implemented a general allocation system of learning support/resource teachers to mainstream primary schools in September 2005. The system is intended to cater for children with high-incidence special education needs such as mild general learning disability and learning support needs, including dyslexia.It is a matter for each school to identify the pupils with learning support and high-incidence special education needs that will receive supplementary teaching support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. My Department issued a guidance circular to schools which contained detailed information on how the new system operates.The needs of the child referred to by the Deputy fall to be meet from within the school's existing general allocation and the school in question has been provided with a general allocation of 17.5 resource teaching hours per week. The Deputy may be interested to know that the pupil has access to special needs assistant support in the school.

The current position regarding the site acquisition is that the Office of Public Works (OPW), which generally acts on behalf of the Department on the acquisition of sites for schools, has been asked to source a suitable site for the school in question. At this stage a number of sites have been identified and the OPW has commenced negotiations on the most suitable of these sites.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	922	A school is entitled to payment for 37 hours supervision per annum for each full-time teaching post (including temporary full-time teaching posts), or to a minimum of 122 hours per school, whichever is the greater.The number of full-time teaching posts allocated to a school on 30 September in a particular school year determines the number of hours supervision due to a school in that year.Sections 14, 15 and 23 of the Education Act,1998 assigns each Board of Management and Principal Teacher responsibility for the day-to-day management of the school concerned.The terms of Circular 16/73 provide that the Principals of primary schools should organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of the pupils during school hours.  In particular, s/he should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks, lunch-breaks, assembly and dismissal.Rules 121(4) and 124(1) of the Rules for National Schools and Section 23(2) of the Education Act 1998 oblige teachers to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when the pupils are on school premises, during school time and/or on school activities. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of all teachers individually and collectively to provide a duty of care at all times towards the pupils in the school in which they teach, including periods of supervision.While my Department does not issue specific guidelines on requirements for supervision of different age pupils, it acknowledges that the degree of supervision required of school authorities varies with the circumstances, including the age of the pupil. This duty, in the case of very young pupils, might include an obligation to ensure that such pupils do not leave the classroom without appropriate supervision.In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. The Statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The Safety Statement should be reviewed on a regular basis.I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on where the liability would lie in the type of situation to which he refers.

This information is available as it was known to my Department when these transfers were arranged. There are no records in my Department regarding the current location/assignment of a further 14 officers who transferred from its Dublin offices to other organisations in Dublin to await relocation to their location of choice as records are not maintained on officers in my Department when they transfer elsewhere.Five percent (5%) of the 41 officers who have transferred to relocate have had a previous transfer within a two-year period of the decentralisation transfer.  No officer from my Department has transferred from a non-Dublin office to a Dublin office to await relocation elsewhere.

Kildare.  A total of 200 staff will move to the new location.While the site upon which the new office accommodation will be built will be sold by Kildare County Council to the Office of Public Works and the preferred tenderer to construct the building has been chosen by that Office, it is not anticipated that any staff will move to Newbridge prior to the completion and fit-out of the new building which is scheduled for late 2008.  Therefore, no Newbridge-bound staff have transferred to offices outside the Dublin region as yet, but staff currently working in the Dublin region are being transferred to this Department in preparation for the relocation to Newbridge.  There have been no transfers of staff based in offices outside Dublin to the Dublin offices of my Department.In addition to the relocation of my Department to Newbridge under the decentralisation programme, the Civil Defence Board completed its relocation to Roscrea, Co. Tipperary in May 2006.An advance party of 12 staff of the Civil Defence Board moved to temporary accommodation in Roscrea in September 2004 prior to the final move.  12 of the 22 staff currently serving in the Civil Defence Board transferred from my Department, with the balance transferring to the Board's new offices in Roscrea from various other Government Departments.

The application of the polluter pays principle, as required by the EU Water Framework Directive, entails the metering of non-domestic consumers so that a volumetric charge can be applied, with the cost of meter installation being borne by the metered consumers.In response to concerns expressed by farming representatives in relation to the cost of metering and following a pilot billing project in one local authority area, I arranged for billing guidance to issue to local authorities in December 2006 to including a request that authorities consider the necessity for special discounting arrangements in the case of multiple water meters on fragmented small farm holdings.  The guidance recommends that the total metering charge in such instances should not exceed 180% of the cost of the first connection irrespective of the number of meters. This represents a significant concession to farm holders with fragmented holdings.

One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers. The appointment of the insurance company and the terms of the scheme were negotiated by the Mortgage Protection Committee, which is a sub-committee of the County and City Managers' Association (CCMA). The Committee is representative of the CCMA, the Housing Finance Agency and a representative of my Department.Under the existing mortgage protection arrangements, the purchased equity of a shared ownership transaction is covered for mortgage protection insurance purposes.  The feasibility of extending cover to the rental portion is being examined by the scheme administrator in conjunction with the underwriter and the matter is due to be considered by the Mortgage Protection Committee when this examination has been completed.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	937	Responsibility for national roads is a matter for the relevant road authority and the National Roads Authority which operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Transport.The provision and improvement of non-national roads is a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.There have been significant increases in recent years in the level of State funding provided to local authorities for the provision, improvement and maintenance of non-national roads.  State funding in 2007 for non-national roads, at over €607.5 million, is at its highest ever level, and represents a very substantial increase of 9% on last year's record allocation, or an increase of almost €50 million.In determining the annual non-national road grant allocations, the overall objective is to resource each local authority appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs. Non-national road grants are allocated under a number of grant categories. The only grant categories which are calculated by reference to length of road are the discretionary improvement and maintenance and restoration maintenance categories.Details of the 2007 grant allocations to each county council for the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads, the total length of non-national roads in each county council area and the funding per kilometre allocated to each county council under the discretionary improvement and maintenance and restoration maintenance grant categories are set out in the following table.County CouncilsTotal 2007 grant allocation for the improvement and maintenance of non-national roadsTotal non-national road length in county council area2007 allocation  per km under discretionary improvement and maintenance and restoration maintenance grants€km€Carlow County Council7,432,1501,1531,523Cavan County Council16,844,6162,8761,523Clare County Council20,142,7833,9401,523Cork County Council58,016,88211,5741,523Donegal County Council40,660,9676,0221,523Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council14,841,6506523,044Fingal County Council7,119,2391,0222,285Galway County Council31,509,5566,0721,523Kerry County Council22,281,8004,2241,523Kildare County Council23,531,0542,0901,523Kilkenny County Council14,476,9002,8501,523Laois County Council12,188,6821,9731,523Leitrim County Council11,869,1502,0531,523Limerick County Council17,574,2053,4041,523Longford County Council8,441,3201,4661,523Louth County Council8,614,7001,1471,523Mayo County Council27,274,6255,8781,523Meath County Council29,486,2002,9251,523Monaghan County Council15,099,6502,3741,523North Tipperary County Council12,340,7002,4311,523Offaly County Council11,125,8171,9431,523Roscommon County Council17,197,7503,7201,523Sligo County Council14,246,5032,4991,523South Dublin County Council12,594,3807922,285South Tipperary County Council14,217,7062,7361,523Waterford County Council15,701,9832,4571,523Westmeath County Council15,892,0602,0041,523Wexford County Council16,877,8503,1881,523Wicklow County Council19,590,0331,9841,523

Like all local authorities Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown prepared their Action Plan in 2004 for the period 2004 to 2008.  Action Plans are based on the overall analysis of need as established by the local authority housing strategy, and outline the proposed response in terms of new social and affordable housing, address regeneration and remedial works together with the proposed arrangements for management and maintenance of the stock.  Details of individual local authority Action Plans are available from the local authority.

This is administered by local authorities who assess and prioritise applications and approve individual grants. The scheme is aimed at assisting owners and occupiers to carry out conservation works on structures of architectural significance in the Record of Protected Structures which the local authority has listed under the Planning and Development Act 2000.It is intended to review the scheme in 2007 and consideration will be given to the level of grant assistance available to structures in an Architectural Conservation Area.Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, my Department will also administer a scheme of grants for the restoration and conservation of buildings of significant architectural heritage merit and which are in public ownership or open to the public generally.The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, also runs a Buildings at Risk grant scheme. Criteria for this scheme are available directly from the Council.

I have no plans, therefore, to commission, or to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to commission, similar research.

Following the responses to the consultation paper, I laid draft exempted development regulations for approval before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 January.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Local Government considered the draft proposals on 15 February and are due to report their approval to this House and to the Seanad today.  I intend to sign the Regulations as soon as possible after formal ratification of approval by both Houses.

While it has not been possible to provide funding for this station as part of the 2007 fire services capital programme which I announced last week, funding has been provided for various other priority projects which have been advanced in County Waterford since 2001.  These include replacement stations and extensions or upgrading works at stations in Ardmore, Cappoquin, Dungarvan, Dunmore East and Tramore.The provision of funding for a replacement fire station in Tallow will be considered under future fire services capital programmes having regard to overall resources and priorities under the programme.

Much of this expenditure is operated through projects managed by voluntary bodies. My Department has not to date received specific proposals from South Tipperary County Council for funding of a tenancy support worker and an outreach worker for the Simon Community. However, any decisions on funding for such a service would be a matter in the first instance for the local authority concerned.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	944	The EU Nitrates Directive aims to protect all waters against pollution from agricultural sources.  Particular care is required for the protection of public health in the case of waters which serve as the source of drinking water. The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 implement the Directive in Ireland and provide statutory support for good agricultural practice to protect waters against pollution from agricultural sources.Article 17(2) of the Regulations includes a prohibition on the application to land of organic fertiliser or soiled water within specified distances from watercourses. In the case of lakes generally, the specified distance is 20 metres from the lake shoreline. Additionally, Article 17(2) of the Regulations prohibits the application to land of organic fertiliser or soiled water within specified distances from drinking water abstraction points: in general the specified distance for larger water supply schemes is 200 metres and for smaller supplies is 100 metres or 25 metres, depending on the size of the supply.  These distances are measured from the actual abstraction point.  These prohibitions are considered essential for the protection of sources of drinking water generally.  However, in the case of specific abstraction points which are the subject of prior investigations, Article 17(5)(a) of the Regulations provides that a local authority may, following consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, specify an alternative distance where the authority is satisfied that it is appropriate for the protection of waters being abstracted at that point.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Prelude	946	I refer to the reply to Question No. 64 of 8 November 2006.Under the Government's decentralisation programme all Dublin based operations of my Department are being decentralised, with the exception of Met Éireann, ENFO, the Private Rented Tenancies Board and a small co-ordination section which it is proposed to retain in Dublin to assist with the Department's Dáil and other business. The programme involves the relocation of my Department's operations to four locations in the South East: Wexford, Waterford, New Ross and Kilkenny.As outlined in the most recent Progress Report (September 2006) from the Decentralisation Implementation Group, the indicative timescales for the completion of the Department's offices in Wexford, Kilkenny, New Ross and Waterford are Quarter 3 2008, End 2008, Quarter 4 2009 and Quarter 3 2010 respectively. To date no civil servants from my Department have decentralised to any of these four locations. My Department is, however, establishing an advance office in Wexford comprising about 40 staff; it is anticipated that this office will be established in the middle of this year.
