#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I extend sympathy to the family of the late Senator Patrick O'Reilly who passed away last week at the fine age of 93 years. He was a Member of the Seanad from August 1944 to August 1969 and served on the Agricultural Panel. He served in seven consecutive Seanads under Governments of various political persuasions, yet was returned to office each time.Mr. O'Reilly was a native of Aughavas, County Leitrim, where he was a farmer. He then moved to Farmullagh, Moyne, County Longford. None of us seems to have definite information on him but it is wonderful that he served continuously in the Seanad for such a long time. All of us who have contested Seanad elections know how difficult it is to be elected once or twice. However, to be elected on seven occasions is remarkable.It appears Mr. O'Reilly was a most avid attendee at debates in the House and spoke frequently on various matters. From what I have read, he was deeply committed to health issues. Reading what he said provides one with a picture of the period during which he served in the House. He spoke strongly about tuberculosis on three separate occasions and about wishing to secure a higher average attendance in the Seanad on a debate on the subject. That occurred over 50 years ago, which is interesting. I am not implying anything in saying this but he must have been a very good public representative and very assiduous. Moreover, he had strong views on speeding on our roads.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	3	He said, during a period when speeding was not as pronounced as it is today, that it was not fair to say motorists were the most dangerous road users, that pedestrians were equally dangerous. He also spoke forcefully on agricultural issues. In practically every debate on these issues his was the strong voice.I sympathise with the family of the late Mr. O'Reilly who had a daughter who worked in Oireachtas committees and has been seconded to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. He had other family members also. Having served in seven Seanads on the Agricultural Panel over a period of 25 years is indicative of great service to the State, the House, the people of counties Leitrim and Longford and all others whose lives he touched. I express the sympathy of the House at his passing.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I wish to associate the Fine Gael Members with the remarks of the Leader of the House on the death of former Senator Patrick O'Reilly. He ceased to be a Member of this House in August 1969, the month of my birth, which is why my recollection of him is not as clear as the Leader's.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	6	He was clearly a substantial figure in the House, having come through seven successful elections to give long-standing service exceeding 24 years, a record nearly as fine as that of the Cathaoirleach.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	8	My colleague, Senator Bannon, has told me that Senator O'Reilly was much loved in County Longford, which was not his native county, and he was noted for his service to the community there. As the Leader said, it is rightly our normal practice to recognise the contributions of former colleagues to both Houses and it is clear from the speeches she quoted that Senator O'Reilly was ahead of his time in terms of the policy arguments he made and the positions he took.I wish to associate my party with expressions of sympathy to the Senator's family and to his Fianna Fáil colleagues. He represented the very best traditions of public service within the Fianna Fáil party and it is proper to remember him on this sad occasion by recording our sympathy at a difficult time for those who knew him. After 93 years, he can be said to have lived a wonderfully full life which contributed a great deal to politics.

At a time when we are trying to attract people to politics, which is held in lesser and lesser regard by the public, it is important to single out role models. The Independent Members wish to associate themselves with the expressions of condolence to Senator O'Reilly's family and to recognise his contribution to the House. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.Recently I read in Irish Press reports from September 1946 that there were 36 road deaths in July and August of that year. It was, in fact, a much bigger problem then than it is now.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Labour Party also wishes to be associated with the expressions of sympathy. I was struck by the Leader's references to record of the House which can be used to identify the qualities of someone whom none of us really remembers. As with Senator O'Toole, 1969 was a major time in my life. It is said of the 1960s that if you can remember them, you were not there. I cannot remember where I was in the summer of 1969, but I remember a certain election slogan I will not mention which promised something that did not materialise.A person who gives 25 years of public service is, by definition, somebody who is worthy of respect and remark. It is a long time, but after that the former Senator O'Reilly experienced another 34 years of life. It is a great tribute to him. To give 25 years of diligent service in the pursuit of serious issues is the sort of fine model of citizenship the country needs. On behalf of the Labour Party, I express our wish to be associated with the sympathies of the House to the late Senator Patrick O'Reilly's family.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	13	On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join with the other groupings in the House to express sympathy to the family of the late former Senator, Patrick O'Reilly. His achievements have been enumerated by the Leader, as has his remarkable 25 years of continuous service in this House. It is significant that he volunteered to leave early and at a relatively young age. He was elected when he was young and after serving for 25 years he went on to do other things at a time when I suspect the pensions were not as generous as they are now.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	14	He got married.

His history of public service was significant and ought to be saluted by the House. The Progressive Democrats express their sympathy to his family, his party colleagues and his friends.
#EddieBohan	unknown-#EddieBohan-party	unknown-#EddieBohan-dob	unknown-#EddieBohan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	16	As a Longford man, I extend my sympathy to the O'Reilly family. While I was born and reared only a few miles from the home of the late Senator, I never had the pleasure of knowing him. Given the difficulty of getting into this place for even one term, 25 years of service is an outstanding achievement.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	17	As a fellow county man of the late Senator, I join with the Leader and others in expressing my sincerest sympathy to his family. I have a family connection to the late Senator, whose daughter Mairead is married to a cousin of mine. He was a dedicated family man who took a great interest in the welfare of those around him. He took particular interest in science, education and agriculture, the last of which was a great love of his. He farmed all his life on the Longford-Leitrim border where things were tough and he was a vocal promoter of agriculturalists. He was involved in the establishment of the much acclaimed Moyne Community College and he was a member of Leitrim County Council from 1942 to 1955.Patrick O'Reilly was first elected to this House in 1944 and returned in 1948, 1951, 1954, 1957, 1961 and 1965. He retired in 1969 after contesting the election which his family often tell me he lost by one vote. He sat on the agriculture panel and was extremely popular in his local area where his quiet, unassuming manner was acknowledged by all who met him.Paddy knew every lane and road in counties Leitrim and Longford, both of which he served in the course of his political life. He took a keen interest in community activities and was very involved in the GAA. He took great pride in his nephew, Colm O'Rourke, who played for Meath and whose achievements on the field Paddy would honour by presenting you with a glass of whiskey whenever you went to visit. Paddy was a gentleman and a kind and caring person. He is survived by his wife Una and his six children, Maura, Una, Claire, Mairead, Therese and Sean, to whom I offer my sincere sympathy.

Mr. O'Reilly was an extraordinary man, a humane and intelligent person who had a broad vision of life in Ireland. I offer my sympathy to his wife, Una, his five daughters and only son. His daughter, Una, lives in Roscommon town where I come from. She is carrying on the family tradition in Fianna Fáil politics.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy and tributes paid to the late former Senator Paddy O'Reilly who retired in 1969, the year Senator Brian Hayes was born. I also have memories of 1969, the year I unsuccessfully contested a Dáil election. When canvassing for election to the Seanad, I was offered the example of Paddy O'Reilly who always asked for a No. 7 preference vote. Whatever about No. 7, he always received plenty of No. 1s because he was elected. I offer my sympathy to his wife and family.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I am sure all Members would want to take this opportunity of thanking the staff of the House – the ushers, reporters and everyone associated with its proceedings – in respect of the late sitting last night. It was a substantial debate in which every member of the Opposition contributed. I also thank the three Government Members who contributed and hope no one sat on them. We are now seeking a significant period of time between the taking of Second Stage and Committee Stage. The Opposition needs a significant period of two or three weeks in order to consult all interested parties. I ask for a guarantee from the Leader of the House that there will be no guillotine imposed on Committee Stage and that a senior Minister will be in attendance. We have already spotted at least seven drafting amendments. Senator O'Toole made the point last night that the Bill was being rushed through. There are significant defects in the legislation over which we need to take our time if the Government intends to push it beyond Second Stage. I ask for a commitment from the Leader on these matters.On the Order of Business, motion No. 24 is in the name of Senator Terry and one of the most reforming that the House will have discussed since the new Seanad came into being last July. It is customary that the Government tables an amendment but I do not see any. May I take it that the Leader is in agreement with the Fine Gael proposal and that, accordingly, there will not be a vote at 8 p.m.?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Senator should be sensible.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I agree with the points made by Senator Brian Hayes about the late sitting last night and the pressure put on the staff of the House. It was absolutely unnecessary because we could have finished that business on Thursday afternoon but the decision of Government in the matters was different. It is a pity that the House had to sit late to deal with its business. It is not an efficient manner of doing business but I recognise that the Government calls the shots in this regard and that the Leader of the House was given instructions on the issue.Yesterday's debate took place at the same time as very important discussions were taking place in the North. In the words of Mitchel McLoughlin this morning, people were trying to work through history and their differences. We should be very sympathetic. The difficulties we have seen on this island have to do with bridging differences and trying to establish parity of esteem, ensuring cultural equality and respect for people of different cultures and backgrounds, especially minorities.I was absolutely horrified and taken aback last night by a comment from a Government Member who in referring to a Member on this side of the House, in this group, said, "His accent is not particularly Irish" or words to that effect. Personal comments are unacceptable at any time. The remark was made when Senator Ross had finished speaking. I found it particularly objectionable at a time when we were trying to present ourselves as not being mono-cultural. I do not wish the Government side to respond in a defensive manner because the remark could have come from either side of the House. I am not suggesting that it represents a viewpoint of Members on the other side because I know it does not. It may have been uttered unthinkingly. It is, however, damaging and wrong and should be corrected. I ask the Leader to consider this request in an appropriate way.On a completely different matter, one of the greatest sports events in the world, the Americas Cup, concluded in Auckland this week and was won by Switzerland. It brought €1 billion into the economy of Auckland in recent months and will be held next in Europe. It is likely to be hosted by either the United Kingdom, Portugal or Ireland. When Deputy Kenny was Minister with responsibility for sport, he managed to bring the Tour de France to this country. I ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to consider making a huge investment to bring the Americas Cup to Ireland. The sailing grounds in Dingle Bay off the south-west coast would be spot-on as a venue. There are marinas in Caherciveen, Dingle, Fenit and Kilrush and the event would bring €1 billion into the economy of the west. Switzerland cannot host the event on Lake Geneva. As this news is only one day old, there is time for us to make a strong case to bring the greatest sailing event in the world to the constituency of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	24	On the point made by Senator O'Toole about remarks made last night in the Chamber, rulings of the Chair have consistently stated that remarks of a personal nature are not in order. A debate should be confined to specific issues before the House and Members must not indulge in personalities. I have consulted the records and I will be asking the Senator to withdraw the remarks.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I am very pleased to hear that and I am sure other Members will welcome it. I am also sure that the Senator who made the remarks will take the Cathaoirleach's advice and withdraw them.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I thank the Cathaoirleach for his ruling. It contributes greatly to the dignity of the House that he has dealt with the issue in this manner.I support Senator O'Toole's remarks in regard to the Americas Cup. I want to raise a related matter on the Order of Business. A report in this morning's edition of The Irish Times states that an alarmingly increased percentage of tourists surveyed last year were unhappy with their holidays in this country. Some 56% were less than satisfied and the figure increased to 80% for visitors from continental Europe who were unhappy about the quality of their holiday here. This sounds serious alarm bells for Ireland and it is an issue which is worthy of considerable reflection. If we are to undertake the sort of projects to which Senator O'Toole referred, we will have to consider how we operate that business. For hoteliers to be demanding further Government supports and subsidies is not a solution to the real issues. I am not saying there are solutions. However, tourism is one of our biggest industries and if 81% of customers from continental Europe, one of our largest markets, are unhappy with what we are doing, it is up to us to change it.I would like to make a number of suggestions to the Leader. On the question of policing, I am intrigued that the London Metropolitan Police has decided, after approximately 20 years, that putting officers on the beat – as distinct from having super-duper Z cars whizzing around the place – is perhaps the best way to reduce crime in a community. Most politicians from across the spectrum believed that all along, but they were fed management-speak and so on by various consultants who persuaded them differently. The basic instinct of public representatives is that having gardaí visible and on patrol in communities is the best way to reduce that sort of crime identified by the London Metropolitan Police as a nuisance to communities. Public order offences and petty vandalism impinge most on ordinary people's lives. I request a debate on the way we operate the policing service.The other issue I wish to raise relates to the current war, the threat that it will escalate and the extraordinarily brave decision by the Turkish Parliament, which listened to its people, in the face of the most extraordinary levels of bribery. This issue must given further consideration. In the context of what the Turkish Parliament has done, I wish to place on record my view – I believe it is that of most people – that the deliberate destruction yesterday of a Mosque in Gaza by the Israeli armed forces was about as offensive and wrong an act as any country in the democratic world has ever carried out. I do not care what are the reasons or excuses, bulldozing people's centres of religious practice is about as offensive and as close to racism as one can get. It was an appalling act.It is time someone with influence reined in the Israeli Government. No one justifies suicide bombings because they are appalling. However, it does not justify the actions of the Israelis. We should have a serious debate on what is happening in Palestine and Israel because the threat of war in Iraq is diverting attention from that issue. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the matter in the immediate future.I also want to raise an issue to which I have referred on previous occasions. There are approximately ten Seanad Bills on the Dáil Order Paper. The Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill was introduced in the year 2000, which is almost three years ago. We spend a great deal of time – we were here this morning until 2 a.m. – dealing with legislation which then goes to the Dáil. I note that the Immigration Bill, which some people – not the Leader – wanted to rush through the House before Christmas is still on the Dáil Order Paper and we are now in the third month of 2003.

This House should formally approach the Committee on Procedures and Privileges of the Dáil to find out why people insist that Bills introduced here should be dealt with in an expeditious manner when they are merely added to a queue of legislation waiting to be introduced in the other House. The Lower House should learn to do its business in the same way the Seanad does.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I am conscious of the fact that we are subject to a sessional order and that we must conclude the Order of Business within a specified period. In that context, all of us need to be aware of the fact that some people may wish to speak and if we keep speaking on the Order of Business, they will not have an opportunity to do so.I congratulate the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on the work done yesterday in Northern Ireland. It seems strange that the British Prime Minister, who is confronted by the possibility of a war in Iraq, remained at the talks while the leader of the Unionist Party felt the need to return to Westminster for a committee meeting. Leaving that issue aside, I believe progress was made. Perhaps it is somewhat disappointing that matters were not brought to a conclusion. I am confident, however, that with goodwill on all sides – and if people remember the Good Friday Agreement is the template on which everything is based – it will be brought to finality in the coming weeks. I wish everyone involved well in that regard. It might not be appropriate to debate the matter now, but perhaps we can do so later when a clearer picture emerges.I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling, which I do not dispute. The debate last night was quite heated and it needs to be seen in that context. Unparliamentary words were used on all sides. One term was used quite late last night, which I thought was very unparliamentary. The standard that might apply to those of us who have been here for a long period might be different to that which applies to those who have not been here long. I am confident that the import of the words was not intended to be offensive. Notwithstanding the fact that I can understand why offence might be taken, I hope the matter might be seen in that light. The context of the debate and the fact that it was quite heated at times should be taken into account.I support Senator Brian Hayes's remarks in regard to the contribution of the staff who were here late last night. One thing that needs to be said is that there were criticisms several years ago about the length of time it took to produce the record of the proceedings. The Editor of Debates and the staff must be congratulated on the speed and accuracy with which they now produce the record of the proceedings.

As nine Ministers will visit the United States for St. Patrick's Day, could they do something about the position in which these illegal emigrants find themselves? Will they ask Mr. Bush to consider an amnesty for these people, particularly those who are genuine and who have been working in the United States for many years? This would lift the cloud which hangs over these people on a consistent basis.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I was not in the Chamber last night when the unfortunate remark was passed. I understand Senator O'Toole heard the comment, read it and listened to it again this morning. I was present in the House and spoke immediately after Senator Ross and heard what he said. I did not consider what he said to be inflammatory. I do not agree with Senator Dardis.

These remarks are unfortunate. If some people have difficulty with hybrid ancestry, I do not. My father was English, but I can go back much further than many Members on my Irish pedigree. That kind of remark does not bother me. I am glad my colleague has attended the House. He will probably be able to address these matters himself.I support Senator Ryan's call for a debate on the situation in Israel. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs conducted an important debate on the issue. Elements in the treaty of association between Israel and the European Union require that if Israel is to derive economic benefit from the treaty, certain standards of human rights should be maintained. In view of this, and as a friend of Israel, I requested the attendance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the committee to examine the possibility of triggering these mechanism as a punishment for the misbehaviour of the Israeli Administration. On the other hand, if we are concerned with religious matters we should also, in an even handed manner, direct our minds to the way in which the Christian minorities are treated in all the Arab and Muslim countries.I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on transport, with particular focus on the proposed metro for Dublin. During a debate, this House produced the amendment that helped to create the idea of the metro. The Minister for Transport recently visited Madrid and Copenhagen to see if a system can be constructed in Dublin much more efficiently and cheaply. I believe that is possible and the Minister will be in a position to advise the House of the results of his researches. This is especially important given the enormous cost over-runs on the construction of the Luas light rail system, which will not make the slightest difference to traffic congestion in Dublin.

This is illustrated by a case in the United Kingdom this week where a 13 year old schoolgirl submitted an essay written in text shorthand. Will the Minister for Education and Science take a stand on this issue?

There are serious health implications and the public has expressed deep concern. The Protection of the Environment Bill will take powers from elected members of local authorities on matters including the question of waste incineration and transfer them to an executive. It is important to debate the issue.

Those of us close to that event still remember the deaths and disabilities suffered. Recently, three horrific fires have occurred at night-clubs world-wide, in Rhode Island, Chicago and South Korea. I call on the Leader to ask the responsible Ministers to ensure that the required vigilance in this area is maintained. This issue should attract the same kind of attention given to road deaths, a subject on which the House recently held an excellent debate. Unfortunately, however, the incidence of road deaths jumped again last weekend just as the public was beginning to relax.

There are facilities around the coastline for this purpose and the country's excellent amenities, including those at Dingle and Kilrush, have not been fully exploited. The former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources was aware of the importance to the economy of maritime recreation and business activities. This matter should be taken seriously because it is of vital importance that Ireland should join the international league in terms of the promotion of international maritime leisure and recreational events. I support Senator O'Toole's request regarding the holding of the Americas Cup.

However, it is deplorable that Dúchas rangers are threatening people in rural areas with prosecution for engaging in the age old tradition of cutting turf. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to attend the House and explain if he intends to redraw the boundaries to facilitate this activity. The tradition of turf cutting has never affected the environment, nor will it do so over the coming 1,000 years.

It could be of enormous importance to the country and it should be pursued.I do not like to disagree with a Senator who requests a debate, but the Minister for Education and Science should have more to do than be concerned with text messages. They are a wonderfully inventive form of communication. We may be producing a race of cryptographers and code breakers and we should not take seriously concerns about this issue.

It would be excellent for the country if the Americas Cup were held here. Tourism should be addressed in tandem with a review of internal aviation. Flights should be able to come from Farranfore to Carrickfin without having to go through Dublin. In welcoming the Americas Cup we should bring tourists to Knock, Carrickfin and Sligo.

We have asked for this many times and it is now quite late in the academic year. There have been threats and hints about what will happen next year. It is not fair that prospective students and their parents do not know whether they will have to pay fees. It is our duty to call the Minister to account and to get him to reveal an up-front policy and tell us what the situation will be. Middle income PAYE earners have a particular concern. The Minister's ideology in regard to fees seems to be to hammer the middle income group.

The Senator asked for a guarantee that there would be a senior Minister present on Committee Stage of the Bill. We regard all our Ministers as excellent and whoever comes in will do an excellent job. He also wanted a guarantee that amendments would be accepted. He must wait until the debate happens for that.I agree with those who want to thank the staff. Through the Cathaoirleach I formally thank the staff in the House and those who produce the reports for the massive work they have put in following our long session.Both Senators O'Toole and Brian Hayes agreed with the comments made in regard to the North. Senator O'Toole made an imaginative proposal in regard to the Americas Cup. I thank Senator Dardis for informing me the winning boat is owned by a woman. It would be wonderful to get the event to come to Ireland. I have a modest knowledge of boating and sailing from Lough Ree, which is not making a pitch for it. I remember what an event it was when the tall ships came to Ireland. I will convey the Senator's suggestion to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, and perhaps something will come of it.Senator Ryan remarked that 56% of tourists are unhappy with their experiences here and the percentage rises to 80% for some tourists. That is worrying. He also spoke about policing. We would all agree that policing works most efficiently by having gardaí on the beat. We must make the best use of our resources. He mentioned the Turkish Parliament and also the deliberate destruction of a mosque in Gaza. He suggested that the Dáil should learn to conduct business as well as the Seanad does.Senator O'Toole raised a matter upon which the Chair has ruled. That is the best way to deal with the matter and I thank the Chair for its intervention on the issue. Senator Dardis spoke of the general context of last night's debate. The debate was not of an amiable nature but personal comments should not be bandied to and fro. The Cathaoirleach has decided he will deal with that.Senator Finucane asked if the nine Ministers going to the US for St. Patrick's Day would make a case for an amnesty for the "illegal" Irish emigrants there. There have been a lot of cases of people in that situation coming forward. I will put the issue to the Taoiseach's office.Senator Norris called for debate on Israel and on transport. Senator McCarthy is worried about the spelling and grammar of young people who send text messages. I agree with him. As a former teacher I can imagine how the habit of texting would continue in written work and grammar and spelling would be neglected.Senator Bannon raised the issue of the incinerator. He will have the opportunity to speak tonight when the environment Bill is before the House. The Local Government Bill will also be before the House today. I note that the Fine Gael leader would do away with An Bord Pleanála.

He asked if the same attention could be paid to this issue as is given to the penalty points system for the roads. We were all filled with foreboding when we heard how many died last weekend.Senator Coghlan asked what Bills were due to come before the House. The Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill are the major legislation due before Easter. I will inquire about the Tánaiste's Bill. He also supported Senator O'Toole's suggestion for the Americas Cup. Senator Daly supports that and further activity and events in the maritime area. Senator Feighan spoke about the Dúchas rangers frightening rural people. People should stand up to them.Senator Maurice Hayes does not take too seriously the issue of text messaging because he considers it helps people to communicate and keep in contact. He too is in favour of having the Americas Cup here as it would support tourism. Senator McHugh also raised the issue of tourism and mentioned an air route from Farranfore to Carrickfin. Perhaps not many tourists would want to take that direct route.Senator Tuffy wants the uncertainty clouding the issue of third level fees to be cleared. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, is right to examine matters and review them to see how best the resources we have can be used to help those who are disadvantaged to access third level education.I thank Senator Bannon for the vivid picture he gave us of the late Senator O'Reilly.

This debate provides an opportunity for the House to consider the important issues contained in the Bill. These issues relate to the television coverage of events of major importance to the people of Ireland. Senators will have the opportunity to express their views on these issues. I am interested in hearing those views.Irish television viewers have traditionally enjoyed access to major events, both sporting and otherwise, on free television services. In the past, given the demands on the radio frequency spectrum for broadcasting purposes, the number of broadcasters has been necessarily restricted. In the past ten years, however, the emergence of digital broadcasting services, operated on an almost entirely commercial basis, has changed the broadcasting map considerably. For example, we have seen the emergence of dedicated sports channels. These channels often acquire exclusive broadcasting rights to major sports events and this exclusivity is a key driver of uptake of their services. It is undeniable that these channels have provided increased choice to those fans who are interested and can afford to pay the price of such services.The potential of digital broadcasting to vastly increase the capacity for the provision of broadcasting channels has caused revolutionary change. Commercial services have discovered the importance of sport to their schedules. Indeed, the market for any kind of programming with popular appeal is becoming more and more intense, leading in turn to increased costs in acquiring broadcast rights. There is clear evidence of coverage of sports events migrating to pay-television services.The European Union's Television Without Frontiers Directive – Directive 97/36 EC – recognised that member states should have the right to take measures to ensure that events that are regarded by a member state as "events of major importance to society" should continue to be available on free television services. Under the directive it is open to each individual member state to decide whether it wishes to designate events in this way. A cornerstone of the directive is that it requires each member state to take measures to protect the interests of other member states who have decided to designate events.The Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 incorporated into Irish law the provisions of Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive. The Act provides that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources may designate certain events as events of major importance to society for which the right of a qualifying broadcaster to provide coverage on free television services should be provided in the public interest. The 1999 Act provides that the Minister must first consult with event organisers, broadcasters within the State and members of the public. The Act sets out the procedure which must be followed by the Minister in relation to the designation of events. Specifically, the Act requires that the Minister must consult with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, event organisers and broadcasters. The Minister must also publish a proposed list of events, invite comments on the proposed list from members of the public and lay a draft of the order designating events before each House of the Oireachtas for approval.When designating events the Act requires that the Minister must have regard to the extent to which the event has a special general resonance for the people of Ireland, as well as having regard to the extent to which the event has a generally recognised distinct cultural importance for the people of Ireland.Following the enactment of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999, a process of consultation was initiated in December 1999 when sports event organisers and broadcasters were circulated with a copy of the 1999 Act and asked for comments in relation to the designation of events. Arising from that process it became clear that the designation of sports events was a complex matter and that the main sporting organisations were opposed to their events being designated.Shortly after my appointment as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, announced that it had sold the live exclusive rights to broadcast Republic of Ireland home European Championship and World Cup qualifying matches to the British Sky Broadcasting Group. I immediately ordered that the consultation process should be recommenced.In July last, I received Government approval to publish a draft list of events that I proposed to designate as events of major importance, which should, in the public interest, continue to be available on free television services. Immediately following the Government's decision I met with representatives of the FAI, the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Gaelic Athletic Association to inform them of the decision to proceed with the designation process.My officials held further meetings with these organisations and also held meetings with representatives of the International Rugby Board and the Association of Irish Racecourses. A notice, giving details of the proposed list and inviting written comments from members of the public, was published in four national newspapers on 19 July 2002. Members of the public had until 16 August to submit comments. At the same time my Department wrote to sports events organisers and broadcasters to formally seek their views on the proposed list.In order to further enhance the consultation process, an on-line forum was established on my Department's website and I hosted a public meeting held in Dublin Castle on 26 August 2002. That meeting was addressed by RTE, the Irish Sports Council and myself. The IRFU, the FAI and the GAA were invited to make presentations at the meeting but they declined the invitation to speak or attend. I had further meetings with the FAI, the IRFU, the GAA and the Irish Sports Council on 28 August 2002. Having concluded the consultation process I then proceeded to finalise the list. As required, I also sought the opinion of the EU Contact Committee established under Article 3a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive.That committee considered at its meeting on 31 January the measures proposed to be taken by Ireland and gave the opinion that it had no objection to the measures proposed. The only remaining step is for the draft order designating the events to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. I have laid the draft order before both Houses and will separately seek the approval of the Seanad and the Dáil for the draft order. I considered it important that the Bill being debated today should be published before a decision is taken on the order.From the consultation process it was clear that there was a strong case for amending the 1999 Act. Throughout the designation process I tried to adhere to the principle of being proportionate. While acting to protect the public interest, I also had to take account of the interests of event organisers and of broadcasters. I believe that the list of events to be designated reflects a balanced and proportionate approach. The amending legislation also follows this principle.The amending legislation provides for the following: an arbitration process for event organisers and qualifying broadcasters in relation to the terms for broadcasting rights to a designated event; a fast-track mechanism through the High Court to fix terms for broadcasting rights where the date of an event is close at hand; and a mechanism to deal with circumstances where a qualifying broadcaster has not acquired broadcasting rights to a designated event, but a non-qualifying broadcaster has.The question of arbitration arose a number of times during the consultation process. Some of the sports organisations argued that competition in the domestic market for Irish television sports rights is limited by the number of qualifying broadcasters in the State. The Act provides that a broadcaster can be deemed to be a qualifying broadcaster if it provides coverage to over 90% of the population of the State on a free television service. I am working on the assumption that both RTE and TV3 are qualifying broadcasters. Notwithstanding that there are two qualifying broadcasters in the State, sports event organisers argue that RTE remains the only real potential purchaser of television rights. They also argue that until now they had been able to use the possibility of a sale of rights to a non-qualifying broadcaster as leverage for securing a reasonable price from RTE and as a means of securing coverage for their domestic games.Some of the sports organisations expressed the view that designation could negatively impact on their negotiating power with a qualifying broadcaster. They argued this on the basis that non-qualifying broadcasters are less likely to be interested in purchasing the rights to their events if those events are designated as events of major importance that should continue to be available on free television services. Accordingly, sports events organisers argue that they will, in effect, be forced to deal only with RTE and that designation will weaken their position in future negotiations with RTE. This would in turn reduce the level of funding available for the development of their sports. Several sports organisations, in referring to the provisions of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999, point to the fact that it does not provide for arbitration between an event organiser and a qualifying broadcaster.During the public consultation process a number of the sports organisations put forward the idea of an arbitration mechanism to determine a fair price for a listed event. I had to consider these concerns seriously. Given the limitations of the Irish market and my wish to be proportionate in relation to the extent of State intervention in that market, I decided that the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 should be amended to provide for an arbitration process between event organisers and a qualifying broadcaster to determine a fair market price.Section 5 of the Bill provides for a non-binding arbitration mechanism. The next important matter which the Bill provides for is a fast-track mechanism through the High Court to fix terms for broadcasting rights, where the date of the event is close at hand. Section 4 of the Bill provides this mechanism. I believe that this is an important provision if the over-riding objective of ensuring that the designated events continue to be available to be carried on free television services is to be achieved.Section 4 of the Bill also deals with circumstances where a qualifying broadcaster has not acquired broadcasting rights to a designated event, but a non-qualifying broadcaster has. This provision provides for circumstances where a contract with a non-qualifying broadcaster is already in place at the time of designation and also provides for future contracts. The Bill also sets out the criteria which the High Court must have regard to in determining reasonable market rates.In addition, the Bill provides that the Minister may, in the public interest, require an event organiser to provide the Minister with a copy of any agreement entered into by the event organiser with a broadcaster. The provisions of the Bill are designed to strengthen the existing statutory provisions contained in the principal Act for the purpose of ensuring that a substantial proportion of the Irish population is not deprived of the opportunity of continuing to watch designated events on free television services.Section 1 is the interpretation section and contains the definitions used throughout the Bill. Section 2 provides that the Bill applies to all events designated under the principal Act and to any contracts in relation to those events entered into after 13 November 1999, which was the date on which the Principal Act was enacted. Section 3, for the purposes of clarification, amends the definition of "the Minister" as defined in the 1999 Act to read the "Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources".Section 4 provides for a fast-track mechanism for determining terms for broadcasting rights in circumstances where no deal is in place with a qualifying broadcaster and the date of an event is drawing near. It provides that the High Court may fix the terms upon which the event organiser must give rights to a qualifying broadcaster. Subsection (1) provides that where an event organiser has not, within 28 days of the event taking place, entered into a contract with a qualifying broadcaster, then a qualifying broadcaster may request the High Court to direct that the event organiser give it rights to the event.Subsection (2) allows for the possibility that the High Court may not have sufficient time to make a final decision in relation to the terms upon which rights are to be given. This subsection provides that the High Court may direct that rights be given to a qualifying broadcaster even though the terms, including price, have not yet been fixed. It is important that the High Court be given this flexibility. If faced with a very short period to make a decision, the court might not have sufficient time to make an informed decision as to what would constitute "reasonable market rates". This should not stop the court from taking steps to protect the public interest by determining that a qualifying broadcaster may secure rights to the event.Subsection (3) establishes the principle that an event organiser can decide that an event is not to be televised. The provisions of section 4 will not apply where an event organiser has decided not to sell broadcasting rights and has informed me of its decision before a qualifying broadcaster makes an application to the High Court under subsection (1). While there was a time when event organisers might have decided not to have their events televised to ensure good attendance, it is difficult to envisage circumstances where this would apply in relation to the events to be designated.Subsection (4) provides that the High Court may appoint an arbitrator to assist the court with the computation of reasonable market rates. This provision is designed to be of assistance to the High Court in making a determination as to reasonable market rates for the acquisition of broadcasting rights to a designated event.Subsection (5) provides that the High Court may give procedural directions to the arbitrator, including the fixing of the period in which the arbitrator must issue the award. This provision is designed to be of assistance to the High Court in making a determination as to reasonable market rates for the acquisition of broadcasting rights to a designated event.Subsection (6) provides that after reasonable market rates have been set, but before the court makes its final order, a qualifying broadcaster may withdraw its application to the High Court under subsection (1). In these circumstances the High Court may award costs as it considers appropriate.The purpose of designating an event is to prevent an event which has been traditionally available on free television services from migrating to pay-per-view or subscription services on an exclusive basis only. This is achieved by ensuring that qualifying broadcasters have an opportunity to provide coverage of an event subject to the payment of reasonable market rates to the event organiser. The decision to pay the asking price for an event was and will continue to be the prerogative of the broadcaster. If the qualifying broadcaster decides not to pay the price fixed by the High Court, then the event organiser is free to sell broadcasting rights to any broadcaster.Subsection (7) provides that the High Court may, from time to time, issue such directions in relation to arbitration under this section as it considers just and proper. This provision is designed to be of assistance to the High Court in making a determination as to reasonable market rates for the acquisition of broadcasting rights to a designated event.Subsection (8) addresses the possibility of more than one qualifying broadcaster applying to the High Court for access to a designated event. As long as the event is made available to a qualifying broadcaster the event organiser should be free to choose to which qualifying broadcaster it sells rights.Subsection (9) recognises the fact that an event organiser may be a party to an existing contract with a non-qualifying broadcaster. This provision would apply in the case of the existing contract between the FAI and Sky and would also apply to any future case where an event organiser has a contract with a non-qualifying broadcaster. It provides that where the High Court is considering an application made under subsection (1) and where there is an existing contract with a non-qualifying broadcaster, that the court shall decide to whom and in what proportion moneys in respect of reasonable market rates should be paid.Subsection (10) provides that the High Court may adjust, as it considers appropriate, the terms of an existing contract between an event organiser and a non-qualifying broadcaster. Subsection (11) provides that the High Court may when considering an application under subsection (1) make any interim or interlocutory order as it considers appropriate.Section 5 of the Bill provides for a voluntary and non-binding arbitration mechanism to assist event organisers and qualifying broadcasters agree terms for broadcasting rights to designated events. This section provides a framework for the two parties to agree terms where negotiations have failed to result in an agreement.Section 5(1) affirms that the arbitration process provided for in section 5 relates to circumstances where an event organiser is willing to sell broadcasting rights to a designated event to a qualifying broadcaster and where terms have not been agreed. Subsection (2) provides that either party may request the other to agree to the appointment of an arbitrator for the purposes of fixing reasonable market rates. Where the parties are unable to agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, this subsection provides that I may appoint an arbitrator within 21 days of being notified.Subsection (3) provides that the Arbitration Acts 1954 to 1998 apply to an arbitration under this section. Subsection (4) provides that the arbitrator shall issue an award in writing which shall be a provisional award. The arbitrator shall notify the parties of the award. Subsection (5) sets out the steps to be taken by an event organiser and a qualifying broadcaster if they are to agree a contract on the basis of the terms of an arbitrator's award.Section 6 provides for the criteria which the High Court or an arbitrator must have regard to when determining reasonable market rates under sections 4 or 5 of the Bill or under section 5 of the Principal Act.Section 7 provides that I can require an event organiser to provide me, as Minister, with a copy of any agreement it has entered into with any broadcaster in respect of a designated event, where I consider it in the public interest to do so. Section 8 is procedural and sets out how the directions and notifications required under the Bill may be served. Section 9 provides for the Short Title.There is widespread support among the people that certain events, which are of major importance to society, should continue to be available on free-to-air television services on a near universal coverage basis. Full participation in society requires that individuals should not be excluded from following events of major importance to society on the basis of inability to pay. I have no doubt the people will welcome and support the provisions in this Bill.Senators will agree that, given the important role that sports plays in the life of our country, it is essential that sports events of major importance to Irish society are accessible to the widest possible number of viewers via free television. Access to such events should not be restricted only to those who can afford to pay the rates demanded by subscription or pay-per-view television services.I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and Members for allowing the Bill to be taken promptly. Members will appreciate there is a time limit on this legislation. It is the Government's desire that it should pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible. I recommend this Bill to the House. Molaim an Bille seo don Seanad.

The events to be designated cover a wide range of sports. I do not have to state how important sport is to the people and we all have our favourite sport.The Minister said the Bill is being taken promptly in this House but there has been much procrastination on this issue for many years. It is important to bear in mind that the 1997 EU Directive, Television Without Frontiers, was designed to keep major cultural and sporting events on free-to-air television. The directive, issued on 30 June 1997, states:If it does so, the Member State concerned shall draw up a list of designated events, national or non-national, which it considers to be of major importance for society. It shall do so in a clear and transparent manner in due and effective time. In so doing the Member State concerned shall also determine whether these events should be available via whole or partial live coverage, or where necessary or appropriate for objective reasons in the public interest, whole or partial deferred coverage.2. Member States shall immediately notify the Commission of any measures taken or to be taken pursuant to paragraph 1. Within a period of three months from the notification, the Commission shall verify that such measures are compatible with Community law and communicate them to the other Member States.The legislation was introduced in 1999 and was piloted through both Houses by the former Minister responsible, Deputy de Valera. She was praised by many people who were enthusiastic about the Bill, yet there was a considerable delay. The former Minister gave a commitment that the timeframe for consultation would be two months. An amendment was tabled by Deputy O'Shea to the effect that a time constraint of six months should be in place for the implementation of this measure. The Minister said she did not want to be put in a straitjacket and wanted to be flexible, but she gave a commitment of two months.The consultations which the former Minister intended should take place ran into the sand because the various sporting organisations resented the fact that their commercial mandate was being interfered with. She did not, therefore, proceed. One must ask why. If one goes back to the late 1990s and to early 2001, there was a period of turbulence in relation to sporting activities. There was the ambitious Abbotstown project and Eircom Park, which had been sabotaged. South Dublin County Council had given planning permission for Eircom Park but the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, objected to An Bord Pleanála citing aviation concerns at Baldonnel, despite the fact that the FAI had already produced two aviation consultancy reports. To appease the FAI and to get it to withdraw its interest in Eircom Park in favour of Abbotstown, it was given generous grants.The evening before a crucial congress meeting, the GAA was offered a great financial inducement by the Taoiseach to ensure a motion was not passed by congress to open up Croke Park. There was only one vote in the difference. Given that the sporting organisations were unenthusiastic, I understand why the former Minister did not grasp the nettle on this issue. An unstable relationship existed for many years. That was unfortunate because Ministers should show leadership.There were other constraints because the Government knew there would be a general election in 2002. It did not want to alienate the sporting organisations or Rupert Murdoch of Sky Sports because it became known in January 2002 that the Taoiseach had dinner with 20 executives from Sky Sports. When it was announced that Sky Sports had paid over €7 million to the FAI for television rights for four years, the two newspapers which enthusiastically greeted this announcement were the  News of the World and The Times, both newspapers owned by the Murdoch organisation. Of course Sky Sports was enthusiastic about getting involved. Why would it not be? It already had 200,000 subscribers and the Ireland v. Spain match shown on RTE had over one million viewers.There has been much procrastination on this issue yet we are fortunate that the events have been scheduled and are in place. Are we sure those events which have been scheduled will not result in subsequent court challenges? I am not so sure. In the debate in the other House on 30 October 1999 Deputy O'Shea stated:The legislation does not address the situation where broadcasters have acquired the rights of certain events into the future. I am not aware of the extent to which they have obtained the rights to such events but I am sure the Department has considered this. Is it the case that under the terms of the legislation, certain events will be outside the remit of orders made by the Minister because of contracts entered into, either before now or before the legislation is enacted?The former Minister responded briefly to the Deputy's question and said there cannot be retrospection.The Minister has now moved retrospectively to designate the forthcoming home internationals. Consider the Government's procrastination on this issue when countries such as Italy, Germany and the UK have designated the entire European Championship and the World Cup. Denmark went even further, adding the qualifying matches to its list – exactly the games Sky has acquired in the Irish context. We have been very slow in regard to this process compared to other countries. The UK designated its events in 1996.In August 2002 the Minister held a sports forum which the IRFU, the FAI and the GAA did not attend. They were the same bodies which told the former Minister, Deputy de Valera, in 1999-2000 that they would not co-operate with her. The person chairing the forum, Mr. Raymond Snoddy, media editor of The Times, asked why the Government was acting only now when it had the power to designate events since 1999. Need I say more about why the Government procrastinated on this issue?The main sporting organisations stayed away from the forum, at which the Minister said it was quite possible that designation would be applied retrospectively, which it has been. He would not comment on whether it could be the subject of a legal challenge, which was understandable. Is he confident that the FAI, which has entered into a contractual arrangement with Sky Sports, can walk away from this project and will not seek legal compensation from the State? It is unclear whether it can.RTE cannot be absolved of blame. At the forum Cathal Goan said disingenuously that the sale of broadcasting rights for Ireland's home international matches was a retrograde step. Until 1996 RTE had paid no paid rights fees to the FAI. It had paid the FAI around €635 per annum since 1998. In September 2001 when renegotiation began, it offered €508,000 for the rights. This was €127,000 less than what was offered more than three years earlier. It is, therefore, a bit rich of RTE to be overly critical of the FAI for going to Sky Sports, given the doubts cast over the seriousness of RTE's intent by its offer.Mr. Philip Browne, chief executive of the IRFU, stated in a letter that RTE had been guilty of ruthless exploitation of the IRFU for years. I have explained what happened in the context of serious negotiations between RTE and the FAI. It was clear that the FAI would move in another direction, and we know what happened.When it was announced in July 2002, conveniently after the general election in May, that Sky Sports had bought the rights from the FAI, we heard the usual mantra from Ministers about how disappointed they were. The Minister was disappointed, as was the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. The Taoiseach, who sees himself as a great supporter of Manchester United and Dublin, also expressed his disappointment and said it would was unfair that people in the west had to traipse down from their houses in the hills to watch Sky Sports in the local public house. However, it was convenient to say this at that stage. The general election was over and, regardless of what Sky Sports thinks, it is well known that the Rupert Murdoch organisation has enunciated its support for Fianna Fáil over a period of time.I noticed an editorial in the News of the World recently which lavished praise on the Taoiseach for influencing British policy not to proceed with nuclear stations in the future. We know about processing at Sellafield. However, it is a bit rich to read that the Taoiseach seems to have more power than the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in making a fundamental decision on whether Britain should proceed with nuclear stations. I give that as an example. If one reads such newspapers as the News of the Word over a period of time, one sees sycophantic tributes to various Fianna Fáil Ministers and soft profiles of them. Now that the general election is over I wonder whether that enthusiasm will prevail.Whether Sky Sports will decide to mount a legal challenge or Mr. Murdoch will change his editorial policy, we do not know. My point is that the backdrop to indecision on this issue during the years has been a situation where the sports organisations were not enthusiastic about what was on offer. I note that some of rugby events have still to be designated. Action has come late in the day and there is a question about whether there could be a legal challenge to retrospection. It should never have happened. The Government should have been decisive in 1999.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I very much welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on taking an action which will copperfasten the availability of major public events to the general television viewing public. We are all only too well aware of the circumstances which necessitated the Bill, namely, the loss of international soccer matches to the general public. Worse still is the fact that those matches were available to a small minority of viewers who were willing to pay a considerable fee to view the type of event which for the past 30 or 40 years was available free to those who had a television set.The Bill is an honest and honourable attempt by the Minister to prevent this situation from happening again and, in the process, to be fair to both the event organisers and the television companies, both of which have a legitimate right to make money from the event. It must be said, however, that RTE, the primary and only realistic domestic bidder for the event, did not play fair with the FAI. Whatever its faults and failings, it was most unfair to the FAI to have made it an initial offer for a new contract which was one third lower than what it was paid before.By virtue of our relatively small population, Ireland is not similar to countries like France, Germany, Spain and so on, which have plenty of TV competition for the available events and where that competition establishes a definite market value. With only one bidder in the process, it is difficult to establish a market value. However, with the entry of Sky Sports to the bidding process, the market took on a whole new life. I do not wish to rake over old coals but it would have been crazy and unrealistic for the FAI to turn down the extra money on offer from Sky Sports which could have been spread around the lower echelons of the organisation to help with development. Suddenly, we were deprived of what we had come to expect as a right and naturally looked to the relevant Minister as an all-powerful father to restore the picture on the broken television. This is what the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern is proposing to do in this welcome legislation.Naturally, given the sensitive manner in which this set of circumstances came about, much of this debate will centre around the sport of soccer. In the past decade and a half the sport has captured the imagination of almost every person on this island who has reached the use of reason. Even those too young to understand what was happening on the pitch were able to at least contribute to the chorus of "Jackie's Army". Those infants are now doing their leaving certificate or at college and are part of the huge audience who dash to a television screen whenever possible when an international match is being played.Some of those matches have provided us with memories which we will take with us to the grave. Who could forget Ray Houghton's goal against England which not only kept us alive in the competition but was also looked on by the fans almost as a blow for Irish freedom? Who does not feel a warm glow when they recall those heady days and nights of Italia 90 when we almost confounded the opposition and the experts and made it to the last eight in the World Cup? Who does not recall the shiver in the spine when David O'Leary stepped up to the penalty spot in that all-important shoot-out against Romania, or the magical moment when Packie Bonner brought off his wonderful save to deliver us into the quarter finals?Those are times when we felt a national invincibility, when we took a new pride in our team, flag and country and when the national spirit was at an all-time high. It is easy to understand, then, that when this entertainment was taken away or at least delayed by several hours, members of the viewing public felt, quite reasonably, that they had been deprived of something very essential, like the air we breathe. It was their right, they felt, to be able to watch not just football heroes playing a match but also Ireland as a nation going out to take its rightful place among the nations of the earth. I do not think I exaggerate the situation in the least.Let us take another major benefit which has, partly at least, derived from our international soccer campaigns. For as long as I can remember, as a child and youth, the flying of the national flag, our tricolour, was almost a reserved function. In some respects it was almost dangerous to fly it because if a tricolour flew from a bedroom window or on a pole in a garden, there was an immediate and an automatic assumption that the householder was a supporter of extreme republicanism. That was far from the truth but we hardly realised that we had been robbed of our flag. When just about every other country in the world could take pride in waving theirs at every opportunity, we had to do it almost covertly. Then along came Jack Charlton and the boys in green with tricolours flying everywhere, draped around shoulders and paraded in the streets, often with more enthusiasm than respect. However, we had recovered our flag. Today it is available to all our citizens and the days when we needed the respectability of a political meeting or a GAA match to fly the tricolour are long gone.Soccer may be the main source of major events requiring free-to-air TV coverage for the wider public. However, Members should also recall the other sporting events by which we have been thrilled in the past. I refer, for example, to the performances of John Treacy, who hails from my county and who competed in the most demanding event of all, the marathon, at the 1984 Olympic Games and returned with a silver medal. Those who saw Mr. Treacy win a second successive world cross country title in the mud at Limerick racecourse in 1979 and Eamon Coghlan overtaking the Russian athlete to win his world 5000 metres title in Helsinki in August 1983 will always have fond memories. The list seems endless and includes the victories of Sonia O'Sullivan, the Rugby World Cup campaign and the weekly thrills of domestic hurling and football games. All of these cannot be designated as events which must be brought to the viewing public free of charge. However, the most important must be provided for and that is the purpose of the Bill.The Bill is made possible under the European television without frontiers directive adopted on 3 October 1989 by the Council, and amended on 30 June 1997 by the European Parliament and under Council Directive 97/36/EC. It establishes the legal frame of reference for the free movement of television broadcasting services within the Union, in order to promote the development of a European market in broadcasting, and related activities such as television advertising and the production of audio-visual programmes.The measure before the House broadly provides for qualifying broadcasters – in this country, RTE and TV3, which are brought into our homes without extra cost – to have access to events designated by the Minister as major events as defined in the legislation. It provides for these qualifying broadcasters to secure a High Court order ensuring that Government designated sports events are carried on free-to-air television services.Last October, the Government approved a draft list of sports events for designation as events of major importance under section 2(1) of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999. I am pleased to learn that the Minister has wasted no time and this week has laid the list in front of both Houses of the Oireachtas, as required. The list includes: the summer Olympic Games; in Gaelic games, the All-Ireland senior inter-county hurling and football finals; in soccer, Ireland's home and away qualifying games in the European football championships and the FIFA World Cup tournament and its games in the finals phase of both; in rugby, Ireland's games in the Rugby World Cup finals tournaments; in horse racing, the Irish Grand National and the Irish Derby; and, in equestrian events, the Nations Cup at the Dublin Horse Show.I realise this is a first position, but the Minister might consider adding the provincial finals of hurling and football. The Munster hurling final is one of the greatest sporting spectacles in the country and commands a respect and attention from its fans normally reserved for religious events. Dublin people would claim the same for the Leinster football final, particularly when their team is taking part.The negotiations for coverage should, perhaps, also cover a package of events rather than simply dealing with them on a one-by-one basis. For example, with regard to the European soccer championships or World Cup qualifying matches, should Ireland lose a number of games early on and effectively end up out of the competition with matches left to play against teams with no hope, there would be little interest among the public and little demand for television coverage. The package should include all either games or none.I note that Six Nations rugby games are listed for deferred viewing, which suggests that soccer is the mainstream sport most imposed upon. I am mystified as to why these games should be designated for deferred viewing because there would be, for example, far more interest in Six Nations games than in Rugby World Cup games.The Minister might clarify whether, if an event is offered to the two terrestrial channels and both refuse to cover it because they feel it is too expensive or not attractive enough, the organiser will be at liberty to offer it to the highest bidder elsewhere. This would seem the logical course because it would at least have the advantage of getting it on to a screen somewhere. From my reading of the legislation, the position in that regard was unclear but the Minister has since clarified matters.Like Senator Finucane, I am uneasy about the principle of retrospection contained in the Bill. It reaches back to nullify agreements concluded before the October intervention by the Minister. The principal Act of 1999 may have covered this situation, but further clarification is required. It is well known that the FAI will lose €6 million because it concluded a deal with Sky Sports for €7.5 million over four years—

That €6 million is a huge deficit for the FAI.I welcome the provision for the intervention of an arbitrator in the event that the parties cannot agree on what is a proper fee for the right to broadcast a game or series. It would be the function of the arbitrator to set a fair market price. Section 6 makes provision for the method of calculation of a fair market price, providing for reference to previous fees paid. That may be acceptable at a time when a market and competition are well established, but it is only in the more recent past that there was any realistic negotiation between event organisers and television companies. As yet, anything near a fair market price has not been established here. The recent Sky-RTE difficulties in regard to the FAI are an example of this. RTE started with a ludicrously low bid while Sky eventually paid five times what the Irish channel had offered. History will not indicate a fair figure because there are too few precedents to consult.I ask the Minister whether we have the right to designate events held abroad. A case in point is the summer Olympic Games, which the Minister has wisely included as highly popular but which are always held outside this jurisdiction. Another problem might arise in the case of a major event being held in Ireland, covered by one of our qualifying broadcasters and also by a satellite channel from outside the State. The overspill of the Irish signal may remove the possibility of the satellite or cable operator being able to sell its signal in Northern Ireland, Wales and the west country of England. The Ryder Cup would fall into that category and I want to know if there is a way to deal with this problem. I would also like to know why the Ryder Cup has not been designated because, as I understand it, Sky has done a deal with the organisers and it will not be available on terrestrial television in Ireland.The intent of the original directive may have been to cover events other than sporting events, though it is difficult to foresee anyone wishing to corner the market in the case of a papal or presidential visit, a European summit or a victorious team homecoming. Perhaps, a free concert by Bono and U2 would generate the necessary interest but, not being a scheduled or annual event, that would come too quickly to be included.No one wants a repetition of the events of last autumn. The measure before the House would cater for any difficulties before they arise. I am pleased that the Opposition, by and large, has chosen not to contest the measure because it is a provision which has the good of the citizen genuinely at heart. The passing of this measure will also have the effect of showing the Government's clear intent in the matter of these public events and that it is prepared to act in the people's interests.I regret that the FAI has lost a certain amount of cash due to the quashing of its contract with Sky, but that will be made up for in some measure by the contribution of RTE. Equally, I have no doubt that, when match time comes around, a great deal of goodwill will accrue to the organisation by reason of the availability of widespread television coverage. This goodwill is sometimes more valuable than cash and that is the case in respect of the designated events.I commend the Bill to the House.

When the Bill came into my possession, I checked whether other countries had done something similar and discovered that some have done so. I then checked the record of Denmark, which decided not to do this because it did not wish to interfere with the free market economy. It was thought that if a sports organisation created such a demand for its product that people would want to pay for it, it should not be restricted.I am an enthusiast of Gaelic sports. The Minister will be pleased to note that I attended the all-Ireland final in 1957, which was won by Louth. I have a colleague in the office, Mr. Damien Carolan, who comes from the same town as the Minister and dates everything from 1957. If one mentions 1967, he will say it was ten years after Louth won the all-Ireland final.When I started thinking about the Bill, I was in two minds about it. I have no doubts about its popularity or the genuine feeling that gave rise to it, particularly in the aftermath of the FAI and Sky Sports deal last year. Any follower of the Irish soccer team over the past ten years or more will have felt short-changed by that deal and that his or her rights were taken away in some way. However, the notion of rights to look at a soccer match for nothing must be examined carefully. For instance, nobody suggests that we should be allowed go to a game for free. If we accept that we have to pay to enter a stadium, whether the game is soccer, rugby, Gaelic football or hurling, why are we saying we should see it for free on television? Nobody would argue that television rights to international games should be given away for nothing.The problem arises when we allow the market to dictate the terms on which an event is televised, which is what is happening. If we allow the market to decide, it automatically means that the winner will always be the highest bidder. In today's circumstances the highest bidder will almost always be a television provider which makes money by selling access to programmes by way of a subscription channel. The problem is that the providers which provide free television, TV3 and RTE in this case, will always be the losers.As a result of this system, viewing of events is restricted to those prepared to pay for them, either by taking out a subscription to the relevant channel or by going to a pub where they can pay for them by buying drinks. If we leave the emotional dimension aside, it is hard to see this as anything but the free market economy in action. Experience tells us that it is wise to interfere with the operation of the free market only when it is necessary to avoid an outcome that is definitely not in the overall public interest. That is clearly what the Minister is attempting to do.It is quite clear that the matter under discussion is not one of public desire. I am in the grocery business and everybody would like free groceries. The Government cannot intervene in such circumstances. The GAA, IRFU and FAI have, during the years, built successful ventures for which there is public demand. Does that mean they must suffer because of their success and end up having to accept a smaller price than they would otherwise have taken? That is criticism of success. If they had done a poor job and were not very popular, the law would not apply to them.We must be very careful not to equate public desire with what is in the public interest as the former could lead to mob rule. Any argument for restricting the operation of the free market must be based on the idea that the content of programmes in question is, in some way, related to national, rather than purely private, property. One could build such a case based on the popularity of the major events in question.One could and should argue that national support for an event gives it a special, non-commercial dimension or a dimension that reaches beyond the purely commercial, such as that associated with the Irish soccer team. I am reluctant, however, to swallow the argument whole. It is like saying one must pay a special tax just because one is popular; that the more business one attracts in the normal way, the more money one is entitled to make but only up to a certain point; that when one becomes so popular that one is a national institution, the State is entitled to place limits on how much one can make. That seems to be flying in the face of the free market for all the wrong reasons.I see no reason for interfering with the free market just to satisfy public demand. However, my approach is based on the assumption – this is where I lose my argument – that the major events are run entirely as part of self-sustaining, free market operations. If that is the case, I can honestly see no reason for arbitrary interference. However, what makes the case under consideration different is that the sports organisations which run the events are not fully self-sustaining. They are, without exception, dependent on the State for some support. That is true of the GAA, FAI, IRFU and even Horse Racing Ireland. In every case, the organisations look for and receive State support, either on an ongoing basis or in respect of a particular project. This is the only basis on which a Bill such as this can be justified.If a sports organisation needs to call on State support, the State is entitled to call the tune for that very support. Making certain events available on free-to-air television can be a quid pro quo on which the State is able to insist in return for supporting a particular sports organisation by way of funding. I hope the Minister understands the point I am making. In other words, if the State supports the organisation, it has a right to interfere. If not, it has none. If that is the correct approach to take, we should be up-front about it and say so. It then becomes a simple matter of give and take. If an organisation says, “Please support us and please give us money,” we can interfere.We should be very slow to compromise what should be regarded as the basic principle of our economic life because we have confused public interest with public desire. Having read the Bill I am not sure that point has even been inferred. I hope the Minister will take it into account, in which case the Bill will be healthier, as will our attitude to the success stories we have seen.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I am very grateful to my colleague, Senator Quinn, for affording me this opportunity, particularly because I disagree with most of what he said, apart from his final statements in which he seemed to be getting onto the right track. I speak from the point of view of somebody who does not watch sport on television. While I would not turn over in bed to watch any of the programmes about which people are worrying here, I regard the issue as one of citizens' rights, particularly because of the malign intervention of Sky Television and Mr. Rupert Murdoch. I warned the House about this five years ago.It is worth noting Mr. Rupert Murdoch's own sentiments regarding sport. With engaging honesty, he acknowledged his interest in buying up viewing rights to games and said it was the thin end of the wedge. The other end of his wedge is an extremely nasty phenomenon which is evident in America where he is buying television stations and newspapers. He has persuaded the Bush Administration to loosen up regulations in order that he can control not only television media but also print media outlets.I have just come back from the United States where I noticed that the way in which Fox TV and other Murdoch-owned stations are treating the war in Iraq does not reflect American public opinion. Rather, it reflects the very narrow view of the war of the Administration. That is extremely dangerous. I am very sorry that RTE has caved in to Sky Television in various arenas, thus resulting in a very black day for this country. I support the Minister in everything he does to avoid further intrusion by people like Mr. Murdoch into the media in this country.I want to address the issue of free market economies raised by Senator Quinn. My heart is in my mouth because he is such a distinguished business person and has practical experience. However, I do not believe there is a free market in the sense Senator Quinn alluded to because there is intervention by monopoly media kings like Rupert Murdoch who simply use their economic muscle to buy into markets.We are not given something for nothing. The ordinary people pay their television licence fees and, as Senator Quinn acknowledged towards the end of his speech, are taxpayers. I gasped at the arrogance of the IRFU, FAI and GAA, which were invited by the Minister to a meeting and declined to attend. Do they not know who is paying the piper? Consider the grants and lottery funds being allocated. They amount to tens of millions of euro. We paid for Croke Park. What gives sports organisations the right to sell rights to the likes of Rupert Murdoch on behalf of the people? It is completely outrageous. The market is not free and nothing is being given away.The second reason for interest in sporting fixtures is the mass audience which means vast advertising revenue. One pays licence fees and taxes on top of viewing fees to watch events and one provides an audience for advertising. They get a damn fine deal.As I indicated, I do not bother watching the sports events in question but at the gym I attend I hear that unless parents subscribe to pay-per-view channels, their children will not be able to follow and identify the great sporting heroes. The sporting ethos will be denied to them through class based discrimination predicated on the possession of wealth. I object strongly to this, particularly since it favours Mr. Rupert Murdoch.I support the Government's actions in this regard and I am pleased Senator Kenneally raised the question of retrospection, which worried me. While retrospection is a flawed principle in law, I am fully in favour of it in this instance. The provisions must be tested as I understand from an excellent departmental briefing arranged by Senator O'Toole that many of the powers involved derive from a European Union instrument of 1999 rather than subsequent legislation. We must be sure there is nothing constitutionally questionable about the operation of this law.I am glad the legislation is being introduced and hope it results in the increased public availability of sports events. As citizens, we are entitled to the products of our culture which it would be obscene to allow Sky television to buy. It would make a cat laugh to imagine the GAA selling to Rupert Murdoch when it blanches at the prospect of a so-called foreign game. Since it appears not to mind selling out its entire ethos to scoundrels like Rupert Murdoch, I am pleased to see this Bill before the House. I wish it had been brought forward earlier and that we had been tougher with those of Rupert Murdoch's ilk. The more Rupert Murdoch and his like inch their way into this society, the more we will learn to rue the day. I take up this matter, not out of an interest in watching sport, although I will play anything once, but because there is a significant political point to be made about the way in which people like this insinuate their way into our public life.We should be warned by the words of Dennis Potter, that brave spirit who wrote the wonderful television plays, "Blue Remembered Hills", "The Singing Detective" and "Pennies from Heaven". Nearing his last gasp, he sustained himself through an interview by drinking liquid morphine from a flask and averred that Rupert Murdoch had single-handedly debased the currency of political and social dialogue in Britain. Let us ensure he does not get the chance to do it here by sticking his ignorant, Australian foot in the door of Irish sporting culture.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I join colleagues in welcoming the Minister and his officials. I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a few brief points on the Bill which, as we have heard, is primarily designed to amend the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999. I welcome the Bill which will have positive implications for all citizens in terms of free live television access to sports events of major and significant importance to our society.With the evolution of information technology over the past decade and the introduction of digital television and pay-per-view programming, sporting aficionados have become aware of inequities which threaten their access to certain live televised sports events which are critical to the social fabric of the nation. The circumstances we find ourselves faced with are the result of the exploitation of the genuine needs of sports event organisers by the material greed of pay-per-view and subscription broadcasters. This scenario emerged last year with regard to access to international soccer matches. I congratulate the Minister for his speedy action to ensure all sports events of major national importance are available to the vast majority of citizens, not just those with the means to afford subscriptions to pay-per-view television channels.One of the primary functions of the Bill is to ensure qualifying broadcasters are in a position to secure access to sports events intrinsic to Irish life and air them to the public without additional charges. The legislation will allow qualifying broadcasters to make an application to the High Court, whether an exclusive contract is in place with a non-qualifying broadcaster, to guarantee live access to national sports events. The Bill provides for an arbitration mechanism to determine reasonable market rates and conditions where a qualifying broadcaster and an event organiser have been unable to agree a price. Extensive work, consultation with relevant bodies and liaison with the European Commission have been undertaken by the Minister in bringing the legislation forward to ensure the public is not denied live access. All citizens are entitled to view and enjoy notable sports events and live access should not be determined on the depth of one's pockets and the level of one's affluence. Thanks to this legislation, we can all enjoy and, let us hope, celebrate future Irish sporting successes live on television, from the Olympic Games to home and away qualifying games in the European Championships and the FIFA World Cup and from the Grand National to the Derby.I understand Ireland's Rugby World Cup games are to be included as special events of national importance, which I welcome. I ask the Minister to explain the reason each of Ireland's games in the Six Nations Championship is only to be covered on a deferred basis. Surely, there is a greater public demand to view the Six Nations Championship, rather than the World Cup, which is the reason we should revisit the Bill's provisions in this regard. Appropriate steps should be taken to ensure each of these matches is accessible live by the public.The Bill represents an attempt by the Minister to achieve a balance between the competing interests of event organisers and qualifying broadcasters in line with the EU television without frontiers directive. Balance has been achieved by providing for arbitration to agree a reasonable price which is fair to the event organiser and by providing for a legal course of action for a broadcaster should an organiser refuse to allow it access to a designated event. I commend the Minister for his swift action in formulating the Bill and the designated lists of events but reiterate my slight disappointment that Six Nations matches have only made it to the deferred list.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I cannot resist commenting on the free market. Perfect competition is one of the great myths of the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries since it demands, among other matters, that the departure of any market participant will have no effect on the marketplace. Given its scale, the closure of Senator Quinn's wonderful chain of supermarkets would have a significant effect on the market. Once a market has been established with five or six participants, free competition becomes distorted, a fact every economist recognises.John Kenneth Galbraith described such a market, not as monopoly but as oligopoly, a concept I do not intend to pursue too far. I apologise to the people who have to keep a record of this House for using words like that. Free markets have always been an interesting concept by which to make interesting mathematical models. Even Adam Smith recognised over 200 years ago that wherever the possibility existed people in a marketplace will attempt to fix prices.There are many areas of life where healthy competition provides the best for both vendor and customer. There are also very interesting stories about big multinationals such as ICI at its height, who decided to introduce concepts like "internal markets" and ran into problems. Every time a new drug was to be made, everybody was to compete to tender for its production and that still happens a bit. The problem was that when any branch had a new idea, they held on to it themselves because it gave them a competitive advantage over the other branches of the multinational company. In the process this meant that the multinational parent only benefited from innovation in one location because every other location was deprived of that new idea.I have no problems with markets and I was making the same point 20 years ago when I arrived in this House. I have never had a great enthusiasm for nationalising everything, any more than I have a great enthusiasm now for privatising everything. One must be a pragmatist in these matters. I do not think there is an argument here based on concepts of market economics that is capable of dealing satisfactorily with all the issues.There are many things in life which are of huge importance and which have no market value. Economists have argued for 200 years about, for instance, areas of great beauty that nobody visits because they are inaccessible. What is the economic value of a wilderness that nobody can access? I think it is beyond price but most conventional market economics will suggest that it has no value because nobody has been prepared to spend any money accessing it. The first thing to do is to build a super highway to an area of outstanding natural quality.I do not mean to move away from the topic of the Bill but there are lots of areas where one simply cannot use the mechanism of price as the means of distributing a resource. This is universally true in the area of health care. The United States spends on average 50% more on health care as a percentage of GDP than anywhere else in the world, even though it has the most competitive health care market in the world. I do not think a single example proves anything. I spent two years in a religious order and it taught me the rudiments of logic, in spite of the fact that people in this House might not think I have any.I have no problems with this Bill. I am intrigued with the list of events and even more intrigued by what is not listed. Senator Kenneally said that of all events, perhaps the most uniquely Irish is the Munster hurling final and I know that people in Leinster take great exception to this. There is something in it that touches the spirit of most Irish people. I am not sure if it is a compliment to the power of the GAA that the Minister decided to go gently around the GAA and pick the two most obvious major events. I would be interested to hear in a later debate the process by which he identified events. I wonder why the six nations rugby championship has been categorised in terms of a deferred basis. Every time I open the sports pages I am saturated by coverage of golf. When I go to my other place of employment on a Monday morning I must be careful where I go for coffee to avoid being saturated by a discussion of the weekend golf. I am intrigued by the absence of golf because it seems to be a universal and popular game.I used up most of my ire against the Government last night and I am in better humour this morning. We have moved very slowly on the issue of new broadcasting technology and I am frustrated by the slowness with which we do everything in this country. The Dublin tunnel is five years late, the metro will be five or six years late, our development of a decent road infrastructure will be at least ten years later than planned. We seem to be incapable of doing things at a pace consistent with the speed of change in the world at large.There is no sign of a digitial terrestrial broadcasting service. There is no sign of a digital radio service and there is not even legislation to deal with its introduction. The major digital broadcaster in this country is now Senator Norris's favourite person, Rupert Murdoch. We have allowed Sky to become by default the provider of our digital services and that is a matter of great regret. A combination of ideology and some incompetence is what delayed it. We are now only catching up.I was intrigued by the Minister's mention of the details of consultations that had been undertaken subsequent to the passing of the 1999 Act. He said: "Arising from that process it became clear that the designation of sports events was a complex matter and that the main sporting organisations were opposed to their events being designated." This sentence is followed by a full stop and a new paragraph which begins, "Shortly after my appointment". There is a whole hiatus of history between the full stop after "designated" and "Shortly after my appointment". There is literally nothing in between. The Government of the day sat there and did nothing until the FAI did a deal with Sky Sports and the roof caved in. That is not good enough. The House was lectured yesterday about the complex and difficult work of Government which necessitated changes in the Freedom of Information Act. In this case, it was pushed to one side because it was complex and difficult.If at some stage in the future RTE becomes as impoverished as it was until the Minister made his welcome decision to increase the licence fee or if TV3 continues to be as underfunded as it appears to be in terms of home-produced programmes, it is quite conceivable that in a few bad years neither RTE nor TV3 will be able to afford the fee which is regarded as being a reasonable market price. That means that Sky will win anyway. The whole emphasis is on free television services. The 1999 Act defines a free television service as "a television broadcasting service for the reception of which no charge is made by the person providing the service". I do not know if anyone who watches RTE and pays €150 a year for the privilege – knowing that this fee goes to the station – believes they do not pay for the service provided. If someone decides to take the Minister to court on the issue, that particular definition could be a problem.The Minister referred to 90% minimum coverage. I have a vague recollection that the 1999 Act refers to lower percentages. The Minister is correct because the 85% coverage expired on 31 December. When the original legislation was going through the House, it was made perfectly clear that TV3 had no intention of extending coverage which was then 80% or 85%. Does the Minister have satisfactory evidence that the station has done what it said three years ago it would not do, namely, extend coverage? I have not heard that things have changed in places such as parts of the Dingle Peninsula and the environs of Cork city, where the topography is difficult and where TV3's signal cannot be received. Is the Minister satisfied that 90% of the population can receive TV3's free-to-air service?When this issue was being dealt with approximately three years ago, TV3 said there was no chance it would invest in these areas. One reaches a stage of diminishing returns in terms of investment to expand the service. I would like the Minister to tell us how he knows with certainty that TV3 offers 90% coverage when we accepted three years ago that it could not do so. If Gaelic games were to be covered by TV3, all the matches Kerry play would not be received in parts of the county from which a quarter of the team come. That seems to defy logic. Therefore, I would like to hear how the Minister knows it has extended its service.That is all I want to say on the issue. Other Members raised the question of designated sports events, and there is no point in repeating what they said. I admire the Minister's ingenuity because he had to deal with a fait accompli. He had to draft legislation with retrospective effect, which is always difficult. The ingenuity he displayed is to his credit and I support the principle that events which are beneficial to the collective good should be freely available to everyone. My only quibble is with the level of the designation and the omissions in some instances.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I thank Senators for their contributions, which I found interesting and incisive. The latter is probably due to the fact that people were given an opportunity to receive a briefing from my officials.My ability, as Minister, and our ability, as a nation, to become involved in this issue derives from the EU directive. There is often criticism in Ireland that EU directives have a negative effect on issues. In this instance, the directive sought to address the conflicting questions of broadcasting across frontiers while simultaneously protecting nation states and their desire to retain some of their own identity. From that point of view, the directive is to be welcomed.The directive asks that we should be proportionate in anything we do. I understand the views expressed on both sides of the House with regard to why some things were included and others were not. I assure Members that all the arguments were teased out, not just at governmental or departmental level, but in the consultation process, which was totally transparent. The relevant documents are available for public viewing. They were previously on the Department's website but I am not sure if that is still the case. The documents show what was said by the representatives of those organisations which participated. I thank Senator Norris for his comments in relation to some people who did not appear. I would have thought that, in the circumstances, if there was an argument in regard to this, those organisations would have participated. To be fair, representatives of Sky Television appeared at the event and, if I recall correctly, intervened.Like Senator Quinn, I am a strong advocate of a free market generally, but not absolutely. One can see what happens in regard to a free market. There are cartels and price fixing. In regard to the price of petrol throughout the country, there are dramatic changes in the free market as a result of cartels.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Because of competition.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	73	It is because people get together and try to fix the price for their benefit. There was a time when petrol in my area was the cheapest in the country. The reason for this was that people were going across the Border to buy petrol at lower prices. My area is now one of the most expensive in which to buy petrol because the price in the North has risen to such a degree. No matter how much the price of petrol in the Republic increases, it is more expensive in the North and, therefore, I must drive to Ashbourne to buy cheap petrol. I am in favour of the free market, in principle, but not absolutely. I concur with the sentiments expressed by other speakers, particularly Senator Norris, in this regard.Some Senators raised the issue of delay. Since becoming Minister, I have acted as expeditiously as possible in all the various steps we took. I said at the outset that I was a reluctant intervener in this area and that I had other issues on my agenda which I wanted to address. I also stated that I did not think Governments should intervene in this market. However, we were given the ability to do so by the EU directive.To a large extent, the people who intervened or distorted the market went into the situation with their eyes wide open. It was not as if they were not forewarned because the legislation was well debated. Senator Finucane said that the directive referred to timely action. The fact is that just five states have acted in relation to this matter. I understand others will be acting, some on the same basis as Ireland. These include the UK, Italy, Germany, Austria and Denmark. The latter has decided to withdraw because of its situation.In fairness to my predecessor, the Act was passed and consultations took place afterwards. There was outright opposition by the sporting organisations, which was a factor. It was not a question of our favouring one organisation over another. They expressed their opposition on the basis that designation would affect their ability to deal with sporting rights.However, there was a general and clear understanding that the organisations would not sell to an outside broadcaster. Some Members have questioned why certain GAA games have been included while others have been excluded. During the public consultation process, the GAA made it clear that it did not intend to deal with an unqualifying broadcaster to the detriment of a qualifying broadcaster within the State. In view of this, intervention was not required.Some Senators, especially Senator Finucane and Senator Kenneally raised the question of possible court challenges. The designation is not retrospective, but will apply to forthcoming events. It refers to contracts entered into since November 1999. That is covered by the Bill. Retrospection is not abhorrent to legislation. While it cannot apply in cases involving criminal sanction, there are a number of instances where it can take place. We are satisfied that in this area the legislation is proportionate and will withstand legal challenge.The issue of existing contracts is taken care of in section 4(9) and (10), which provide that the High Court can deal with circumstances where there is an existing contract. It will have the power to adjust it on certain conditions. These relate to the question of a reasonable market rate and to whom it should be paid. The court can also designate the reasonable market rate.Senator Kenneally referred to the stated view of the sporting organisations that RTE had not been fair over the years. I do not wish to intervene on the merits of that argument. However, the organisations will welcome the arbitration mechanism, which will independently monitor the price. The question of adding live or deferred events was considered. The Government decided on a list of events and while arguments will be made for additions or deletions, many of the issues in this area were addressed during the public consultation process.Senator MacSharry referred to the question of rugby football. During the consultation process and in consultation with my Department, the IRFU made cogent arguments regarding its circumstances, which differ from the GAA and the FAI. The IRFU sells its rights as part of a pool comprising the Six Nations group and it does not have the ability or the right to sell exclusive matches. In view of this, designation would have had a hugely adverse effect on its circumstances. Furthermore, although rugby football is a popular sport, it would not have the same huge appeal as GAA sports or soccer. The IRFU demonstrated that the funding it gets from the Six Nations pool would be multiples of what RTE pays for televising the Six Nations championship games.Senator Quinn referred to the question of the free market. Free viewing does not mean that event organisers are not paid. They are paid by RTE or TV3. The core of the issue is the rationale behind the EU directive, which provides that events covered must be of major public importance. The qualifying broadcaster must pay the reasonable rates. This means that while there is free viewing, a payment is made by the broadcaster.The views expressed by Senator Norris take issue with those of Senator Ryan. Senator Norris's position is understandable, especially as he is concerned with a small market. Senator Kenneally asked if international events can be designated. The EU directive and the 1999 Act control the exercise by broadcasters of the rights required to broadcast international events. Showjumping events were included at the request of the relevant organisers.Senator Ryan referred to coverage provided by TV3, which has increased with population movements and transmission improvements. The independent regulator has expressed the view that TV3 reaches an audience of 92% of the population. It is recognised by all broadcasters that the station has the required coverage in this State.I thank the Senators for their views and I look forward to Committee and Remaining Stages. I appreciate the speed with which the Bill was introduced to the House. I hope it will be passed within a reasonable time period.

#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I welcome the Minister once again and commend him for his commitment to the passage of this important Bill. Senators appreciate the time and commitment he is giving to our deliberations on it.Certain cynics have put it about that this is a minor step compared with what was flagged but we know to the contrary. The Bill is a significant step in the process of local government reform. However, I welcome it with some regret. I was elected to the Oireachtas in 1981 and to a local authority in 1985. I sharpened my teeth, politically speaking, in the council. I concede that the Leader of the House also helped me to sharpen my teeth in the Dáil as her Minister of State when she was Minister for Education. The Minister will, therefore, understand when I say I welcome the Bill with a tinge of regret.Another related reason there should be a tinge of regret is that since 1981, even when I was not a councillor, up to 75% or 80% of my work would have involved the local authority. It is understandable that Members like me who have unashamedly used the local authority to enhance the quality and quantity of their input to political life would find that having to withdraw from direct local authority involvement would create a lacuna for us in our political careers.In that regard I am encouraged by the Minister's commitment to build into the legislation regulations to copperfasten the input of Oireachtas Members to local authority business. That is welcome and the Minister is to be commended for the manner in which he has listened to Members express their concerns and anxieties that the input should be strengthened by way of regulations.The Bill, although short, is significant at national and local levels. It deals with the process of devolution of local government. During the past ten to 15 years there has been a phenomenal development in the level of activity of politicians within the Houses and at local authority level. Those of us who have been Members during those years will be aware that the extent of committee involvement is huge compared to what it was in the 1980s and early 1990s. There has also been a phenomenal expansion in the range and complexity of activities and involvement at local level. With that simultaneous development at national and local levels the break was inevitable.It has been well flagged by a number of developments, through legislation, since the early 1990s, when initially ceann comhairligh, cathaoirligh and Ministers were barred from taking part in local government politics. Subsequently in 1999 Oireachtas Members were barred from becoming chathaoirligh, leas-chathaoirligh or mayors. This Bill provides for a further follow up. It is logical, sensible and rational, as we progress this development towards a distinct role for local government that the dual mandate at national and local levels should come to an end.The response of a few scribes in the media has been ambiguous. Some have said that on the one hand the Minister and the Government flagged something huge and on the other hand all we get is this. It is clear to me they do not know what they want or, if so, they want to be the moulders of progress and evolution in local government. As the Minister has rightly said, the sensible approach is to take one further step, that is, to separate national politics from local authority politics. The plans he has in train will prove significant and effective in the further development of local government. I welcome the commitments the Minister has put on the record today as being sensible, logical approach and well-staged towards what he has ultimately in mind. I shall comment on that later.I referred to the simultaneous developments in the work and input of politicians at national and local level but concentrated mainly on national level. Before coming in I tried to prepare a list of the demands on local government today compared to ten or 15 years ago when I was first elected to the council. It is amazing how many aspects of work are involved today as distinct from then in terms of range and flexibility. There is the development plan which is becoming more difficult, given the rapid economic expansion and the concomitant demand for private and public housing. There are many planning related matters, private and public housing, infrastructure, tourism, local economic development, environmental services, environmental enhancement, social inclusion, community development groups, health boards and various related committees, education at community level in terms of vocational education committees and school management boards. The list is huge and it is increasing. One has commitments in terms of time, travel, expense and huge sacrifice in foregoing other interests. A impressive duty of service is being performed by local councillors.I am in favour of the idea of full-time councillors which the Minister has flagged. Effective and efficient local government cannot come cheap. The Minister has his critics, but they are few, who say they want effective and meaningful local government. However, one or two have been quick to scoff at the idea of a councillor's role being that of a full-time local politician. There is little or no justification for that view. I am supportive of what the Minister has proposed and it is a logical and sensible thing to do. In its absence one will not get the quality and efficiency of delivery of services at local level. The Minister's proposal to move towards full-time paid councillors is fully justified. The huge plethora of activities and the boards associated with them warrant full-time, properly remunerated councillors for the future.The Bill which provides for the ending of the dual mandate also repeals the legislation providing for directly elected mayors and cathaoirligh. I was never enamoured of that provision. While there is a case for it in the future, the level and quality of activity at local authority level does not warrant it now. I can understand the justification for continuity on the part of a chairman or a mayor, but I cannot understand the claim that locally elected representatives do not have the collective wisdom to decide on a chairperson to lead them forward for the term of that council.That is not to say the previous legislation implied a slur on the ability or competence of councillors to make such a decision. I know where the previous legislation was coming from in terms of continuity, but I do not necessarily accept the process to achieve that continuity by way of directly elected mayors. I laud the Minister on the decision he has taken to repeal that legislation.Given the renewal which will take place at the next local elections, taking into account the outgoing councillors who will not run again, that new councils will be elected and the changes arising from the ending of the dual mandate, there will be a refreshingly new collective voice at local government level. I am confident that the new voices will make wise decisions at various councils. I ask the Minister to consider the idea of continuity for a chairperson or mayor in the future. There is much to be said in its favour.I referred earlier to the regulations the Minister has flagged which will allow for an input by Oireachtas Members into local authority matters. Oireachtas Members will be called upon to get involved in many activities at local level for the foreseeable future. I have no doubt the regulations the Minister proposes will be enabling, providing them with the means to perform those functions.There is a cynicism in certain quarters regarding the necessity for this. Those who hold such views fail to realise the ongoing link between national and local politics. That link will be there into the foreseeable future and mechanisms should be in place to enable it to continue for as long as is logical and reasonable. To attempt to wrench the two systems apart – which this Bill does not attempt to do – would be to fly in the face of reality. The Minister is not doing that and I commend him.The connection between Senators and their electorate was raised by a number of colleagues. That connection must continue. We are the natural national representatives and voice of councillors, and the Minister will say he is too in another respect, which I accept. We are the direct spokespersons in that councillors are our electorate. A case has been put to the Minister to provide a mechanism to enable Senators to attend the four or five major conferences of local authorities, such as the general council, the Local Authority Members Association, the health boards, the vocational education committees, etc. I too urge the Minister to ensure there is a mechanism to enable Senators to be officially present at such conferences. It could only enhance the continued connection between Senators and their electorate. I have no doubt Senators will seek to maintain that connection but I see no reason the Minister could not facilitate them now that there is no longer the dual mandate facility for Senators.I commend the Minister on taking this important step. He has a range of ideas and initiatives to be brought forward in future legislation, which is appropriate. In the review of strategic policy committees and so on, the Minister has promised to look at the idea of continuity for chairpersons and mayors. He will take account of our collective wisdom in regard to legislation he will bring forward.

I thoroughly approve the ending of the dual mandate but I regret the opportunity to elect mayors and cathaoirligh of city and county localities has been removed. I tabled a motion a number of years ago seeking this measure until my co-signatory joined Fine Gael and ran for the council. That was the end of that motion but I continued to believe the dual mandate was a bad thing and that it weakened politics in a number of ways.As was pointed out by a colleague, perhaps I am speaking against my own interest when I say that one of the difficulties is that it is impossible to hold meetings on Mondays and Fridays because councillors are away doing their work. When I said this to a colleague in this House, he asked me if I really wanted to meet on Mondays and Fridays as well and said that it was rather nice to have that time to spend in the office. A balance must be struck. However, if one is committed to the Upper House of the national Parliament, it should be a greater commitment than one which puts council business first. On occasions I have seen Members of this House put council business first. That is an insult to a national Parliament.I welcome the ending of the dual mandate. I am sure the Minister would agree that the ground was prepared for him by the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and that he took a toss over this because the so-called grassroots rebelled against it for their own mercenary reasons. We chided the Americans on the Order of Business on the way they use cheque book diplomacy and we were pleased the attempt to bribe their way backfired on them in the Turkish Parliament, but the Minister has had the same experience. He has had to offer sweeteners –€5,000 or €7,000 to people to get off the council. It has taken an awful lot to budge these people.I am absolutely dumbfounded at the gall of some councillors who are attempting to take to themselves the right to nominate their wives in their place when eventually hoofed out of the place. All I can say is shame on them. They have damn all regard for the intelligence of the electorate if they think it will put up with that.

There is something incestuous in it. It is not just that they arrogantly wanted to appointed their wives or husbands. Do they think they are in the House of Lords?

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	110	There is something incestuous in it, not only because some wanted to appoint their spouses or relations but also because in the nature of things and the way the Seanad is composed, exactly as has been pointed out by Senator Fitzgerald and others, councillors are the electorate for the Senators. That tends to create a distortion because of the intrusion of sometimes important but also quite petty local affairs into the business of the national Parliament. That is not a good idea because it tends to bring matters to a fairly parochial level, which is regrettable.This is an argument for looking at further local government reform and at further Seanad reform as well. When dealing with Seanad reform, we should not only look at the easy target of the university seats which have between 40,000 and 120,000 voters who are ordinary citizens. Let us look at the whole Seanad and at whether only councillors should elect Senators. It was interesting to hear Senator Fitzgerald say he was the voice of the councillors. That is admirable in its way, but I prefer in a Republic to be the voice of the people on all sides. Those holding university seats accept this needs to be broadened, but we cannot really deal with regenerating the whole House by simply looking at those six seats. It must be much broader. The link, which has sometimes served us well, between the Seanad constituencies and the councillors should be looked at.I regret that it has not been possible to continue with the measures aimed at introducing directly elected chief officials, such as lord mayors, cathaoirligh and so on, because that is real democracy. The reason this is not being proceeded with is not a matter of principle but rather a question of patronage. In Dublin, for example, the job of Lord Mayor is parcelled out by party agreement in a process that is accompanied by a great deal of undignified horse-trading. It would only strengthen Dublin as a city if – like certain American cities – it had a kind of chief executive elected by direct popular vote.I have no ambition to be Lord Mayor of Dublin. I say this because the former environmental correspondent of The Irish Times has a bee in his bonnet about this matter and has been saying that I want the job. He eventually included the claim in a book, although in the second edition he printed a disclaimer in which I said it was a job I would not touch with a barge-pole. Let not fear of Norris be a reason for introducing—

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I welcome the Minister, who has been very good about coming before the Seanad. I do not know whether that will last because, after a period, he may become fatigued by being obliged to travel from one Chamber to the other. Nevertheless, we are happy that the Minister has been prepared to come here on several occasions in recent weeks.This week should see us pass two important items of legislation, namely, the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 and the Local Government Bill 2003. We tend to call the latter the "dual mandate" Bill because that is the issue with which it deals. Last week, when the heat was on and the parliamentary plinth was again called into service as a very useful venue for expressing veiled antipathy to particular legislation, I was reflecting on the amenable way in which a Minister such Deputy Dermot Ahern – and, if I may be so immodest, I when I held office – can be relied upon to listen what Deputies and Senators have to say. On behalf of the Senators on this side of the House, I thank him for meeting them and also Deputies last week.There can be little argument about the abolition of the dual mandate. I became a member of urban and county councils at a very young age. I was in my early thirties when I became the only woman on the council and, with two children, I had to try to make arrangements for babysitters, etc. I will always remember my first day as the only woman among 23 members in the chamber. I had read a magazine article the night before which advised that if one was going to an important meeting, one should speak up at the first opportunity. I trotted off full of dread to the first meeting of the county council where the leader, a very nice man, told all the new young councillors not to contribute until we got to know our way around. Having read that I should speak up on the first day, I was now being told not to do so. A matter on housing came up for discussion and that was something I knew about, so I put up my hand and spoke and have not stopped since. It was, however, a useful exercise.There is no doubt that local government is a terrific form of democracy. Some of us were councillors when the rate of pay was £2.58 per month to cover travel to Mullingar from Athlone, a distance of 30 miles. Decimalisation had just been introduced and I recall my husband telling me I should give back the £2.58 because he thought the county council was hard up and that I should not be getting the money when I was earning a salary from teaching. The amount in question was not sufficient to have one's hair done at the time.Like many others, I cut my teeth on local authorities. However, it was a juggling act to try to balance home, teaching and the county council. I cannot understand how Members of the Oireachtas can manage their Dáil, Seanad and local authority work, although I did so for two years after I was elected here in the early 1980s.Local government has become increasingly more complex as a result of having to process European directives and translate them to local level. Given that councillors must deal with areas of special conservation, SPCs, planning and many other aspects of running a county council and carrying out their duties as local representatives, the dual mandate is a huge contradiction. It means representatives must compartmentalise their time and deal with the various facets of their work, such as agendas for local council, health board, VEC, and many other matters.There is no doubt that local government is extremely fulfilling. Giving that up to move on and fulfil a national duty, while retaining strong connections with the local council, is an important concern. The Minister has expressed a willingness not just to make regulations, but also to include a clause in the Bill to strengthen the connection between Members of the Dáil or Seanad who are giving up the dual mandate and their local authorities. I have no doubt that there are many county managers and county engineers who will be glad to see the back of Deputies and Senators. Local managers and engineers are fine and wonderful individuals in many cases, but it remains a fact that the less they are approached by people, particularly those with knowledge of legislation and the system in the Oireachtas, the better they like it.At a meeting of my party, a certain Senator told us that a county engineer had said to him on the previous day that he would not be seeing much of him when the dual mandate was abolished. I, therefore, stress that there is a great need for proper regulation – detailed and documented in legislation – to ensure access and proper consultation for Deputies and Senators as representatives of the people. It is hugely important that provision should be made for this. It should not be done in a grace and favour way or on sufferance, but properly legislated for so that the mandarins at local level will be clearly aware that Senators or Deputies have every right to meet them and put forward their points of view.I regard this legislation as part of a transition for local authorities, the Dáil and the Seanad. This House is reforming its business and I am sure the Dáil, to a certain degree, is doing so as well. The Minister is going about his business, namely, reforming local government, but this will not be achieved overnight. Many esteemed Ministers, from various political parties, who had responsibility for local government trod the same path and made various and good changes. However, change does not happen overnight. It takes time.This is an important step which attaches far greater importance to the work of local councillors and, equally, greater emphasis on the importance of the work of the Seanad and the Dáil. In order to attend meetings of committees of the Houses, Members are obliged to ration their time; they arrive late and leave early. It is nearly impossible to manage. In 1982 Deputy John Bruton, a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, implemented great changes in the committee system. The system is really only now finding its feet, but committees cannot meet on Mondays or Fridays because to do so would conflict with health board and county council meetings. This Bill will, therefore, attribute much greater importance to each role. When the cat is away the mouse will play.

However, when they settle down to their roles and when ways are found of making contact with local people and working with them, it will receive its due measure and will be leavened into a middle way. That will take time and this is an important step towards that. I agree with Senators Fitzgerald and Norris that the then Minister, Deputy Dempsey, paved the way even though he was knocked at the last hurdle by a Kerryman we all know.

That man played a blinder – as many Kerrymen do – at the last joust, and he won the day. However, a change of mind began to set in after that as people asked what strange animal the dual mandate was and what its reform would mean. That paved the way for this Bill.I was in favour of directly elected chaothairligh and mayors of town councils and county councils. It is an interesting idea to bring in people who are a bit different, thought I realise there is a zany aspect to it and that it could be quite disruptive. The jury is still out on Mr. Ken Livingstone; if his congestion charges work, he will be seen as a dream but not if they do not work. He remains a formidable person and I foresee equally formidable people leading local areas here. That would provide a fresh touch.There is a well-founded fear that a charismatic person forwarding a particular cause would gain notoriety and publicity for that cause, then arrive on the local scene and become a mayor but would not have the guts to carry through the role required in a local democracy sense. It is a far different thing to be popular because of a cause than to have to spread oneself across a variety of modes and models in the work of the caothairleach of a local authority.It is an important Bill. Members are grateful that the Minister is present in the House and will continue to be here during the passage of the Bill. If he can get two Bills under his belt before Easter – that may not be possible – he will have done well in his first year in office. I wish the Minister well in his work.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I welcome the Minister to the House. This is wide-ranging legislation and there have been many fine contributions. There has been much debate about this matter in recent days and weeks.Two years ago, there was massive opposition when the then Minister, Deputy Dempsey, attempted to introduce this legislation, especially from three Independent Deputies – one in particular – and that drove this issue out of the legislation. It was easy at that time to be in Opposition and to pledge support for a Government that wanted to abolish the dual mandate because it was known that the measure would not come in, and that a particular Deputy from Kerry was driving the issue. On that occasion, the opponents of this measure were successful.I made my view known in the council chamber long before I had parliamentary status. I was a strong supporter of abolition of the mandate. One council area in Cork had two Deputies standing for three county council seats. That left just one seat uncontested by well established, hard working and high profile Deputies, which was grossly unfair to anybody who wished to come up through the system.There is an argument that Senators should not be debarred from being members of local authorities, and I do not say that as a self-fulfilling prophecy. There is an intrinsic link between local government and the Upper House of the national Parliament.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Minister should recognise this. The electorate for the Upper House largely consists of members of local authorities. Those who went through the rigours of meeting councillors around the country prior to the election picked up on a lot of issues. There was a sense that those contesting the Seanad election might be in a position to improve local government.A particular issue was severance for long serving members, which goes back many years. Some retiring members of local authorities have served for up to 30 and 40 years. It is unfortunate that their length of service will not be recognised under the gratuity scheme. That brings home the role that local government plays across the country. This is expected to be a superior form of local democracy and it is incumbent that this is looked at in greater detail before the legislation goes through.There has been much recent talk about the constitutionality of abolishing the dual mandate. It was interesting that yesterday, not many miles from this House, a meeting was attended by a noted senior counsel. He was asked for a legal opinion on whether a Deputy, who intends to take this matter to the Supreme Court if it leaves both Houses successfully, had a chance of testing its constitutionality. The senior counsel thought that the Deputy in question stood a good chance.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	124	It should be looked at in greater detail by the parliamentary counsel. I was elected to Cork County Council three years ago at the age of 22. One soon cuts one's back teeth sitting on a council; one learns the hard way as one is dropped in at the deep end and it is a case of sink or swim. Council chambers could be seen as dodgy waters full of sharks.The many areas in which local authorities function – from roads to housing, education and the health boards – play a vital role in the context of the workload of a councillor. The majority of councillors harbour ambitions to be Members of the Lower House, and the Upper House in some cases when the first plan does not work out. Local government is a fundamental part of the passage into national politics and the system has operated in that way since the foundation of the State.There is genuine fear with regard to the abolition of the dual mandate. In some cases, there is too much concentration on whipper-snapping and people biting at the heels of others. If Members of the House are cute enough, they will make sure that they keep their work rate up on behalf of their constituents and need not be afraid.Nonetheless, the abolition of the mandate divorces Oireachtas Members from what is happening on the ground. They are divorced from residents' committees; if there is an issue concerning lighting on a public estate, the residents do not care whether one is looking for a council vote or a Dáil vote. They want their local politicians to work for them. There was a good system in place which allowed for issues to be brought to roads meetings, for example, in the form of deputations. There were many other areas where the role of the councillor allowed for facilitating people in their communities, staying in touch on the ground and working for the electorate. It is understandable that there is opposition to the abolition of the mandate.One issue is of particular concern to me. I know the Minister had a meeting on this matter with some of his party members last Thursday but if this legislation is passed and deemed constitutional by the Supreme Court, I doubt that we will continue to receive the same level of service from council officials after the abolition of the dual mandate. I know one can argue this is covered in the legislation and that officials will be obliged to liaise with Members but we have not examined the issue sufficiently and the guarantees that have been provided are not set out in sufficiently strong terms.I am concerned that, in some cases, county managers will be delighted to see the back of Oireachtas Members. While I am only a member of the council since 1999, I have noticed that some of the finest contributors at our meetings have been Members of the Oireachtas. They were aware of what was happening at national level and were able to apply their knowledge to local government in the council chamber. They teased out information with county managers in a different way from ordinary councillors. Therefore, it is important that we get strong assurances from the Minister that whatever system he puts in place is 100% foolproof because we need to be guaranteed access to vital information in our constituencies through our councils and to officials if we want to see them.There are many difficulties in many local authorities in respect of the planning process which concern logistics, staffing, the rate of refusals and the external influence of the heritage organisations and others who have an input into planning. Planning takes up most of my time as a councillor in Cork, as well as that of many of my colleagues.The same will be expected of Members whether they are members of a a council. Therefore, it is vital that there be provision in the Bill entitling us to due access to officials. Access should not only apply in theory but also in practice. It is frightening to think of circumstances in which requests for information or to meet officials could be met only on a limited basis or on a basis that would not be sufficient to meet our needs and, more importantly, the needs of those who elected us.Consider how the role of councillors has expanded. My predecessor was elected to Cork County Council in 1974 at which time there were very few issues to be addressed. Housing applications and medical cards had to be dealt with but planning was a very minor part of his role. Economic success and the actions of many good Ministers with responsibility for the environment have resulted in the role of a councillor becoming multi-functional. There is a host of reasons people approach their councillors. I refer not only to the old reliables such as potholes and medical cards which in a sense do not have anything to do with local authorities, although they are expected to address the issue, but also to social work, for example. In many cases, one feels like a social worker when listening to people who come with their queries, idiosyncratic as they can be.The level of remuneration for councillors needs to be examined. The remuneration I received did not compensate for what I was losing in my ordinary occupation. I lost out heavily. If I had not been elected to this House, I would have seriously considered not standing in local elections again. It is not such a problem for the self-employed such as publicans or farmers, although I acknowledge that they have time constraints also. However, those in the PAYE sector in local authorities are under considerable pressure because there is no legal provision for them to get time off to attend meetings. The number of meetings of the council and sub-committees can amount to 16 or 20, apart from the meetings one is asked to attend in one's constituency. It is crazy to think that people who are giving up so much of their time are losing out personally. I lost overtime benefits, allowances and promotional opportunities. I have been raising this issue for ages. To be fair, a particular individual in the General Council of County Councils was always very helpful and provided advice and guidance.It is not worthwhile financially for PAYE workers to be members of councils if they are not given a certain number of hours off per week or month. That would be difficult to achieve but it is far more difficult for a councillor to balance the demands of work, the council and his constituency. It puts considerable pressure on him or her in an era in which there is too much pressure exerted already. People who are regarded as leaders in society should be setting an example in this regard. I welcome a positive proposal from the Minister because I feel very strongly about this matter. The length of service of people who have devoted so much of their time to councils and will not be standing in the next elections should be considered fully to ensure they receive adequate financial compensation when they retire from the council.I look forward to the next Stage of the Bill on which we will table amendments. I hope the Minister will take on board the points I raised in respect of councillors who will be standing down after long service and councillors in the PAYE sector who do not get time off to attend meetings and their duties as councillors.Will the Minister state who demanded the abolition of the dual mandate? Was it the councillors' associations, county managers or somebody at the Cabinet table?

The many contributions to the Bill illustrate clearly the interest Members of the Houses have in local government. The issue most frequently discussed in respect of the Bill concerns the abolition of the dual mandate, on which there are various views. Like many Senators, I have served on a local authority for many years. Obviously, I would like to retain my position but it will have to be conceded—

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	128	—that the betterment of both the Houses of the Oireachtas and local government is probably best effected through the abolition of the dual mandate. The Minister has displayed courage in advocating this change. However, that is not to say there are not identifiable benefits in the circumstances that now obtain. It is important that changes do not occur at the expense of the beneficial aspect of the dual mandate because this would work to the detriment not only of Members but also local government. The Minister is right to ensure there will be an entitlement to proper notification from county councils and that we will be as informed as we are at present through literature we will receive.There are two parts to being a national politician, of which the first is the legislative role while the second involves representation of one's constituents. The second part is equally important in respect of which a controlled flow of information from the local authorities will assist. In the South Eastern Health Board area all communications to the members are copied to Members of the Oireachtas who are not on the board. This is very informative and helpful in making us aware of the issues and perhaps allowing us to lend our support at crucial stages on issues to do with our own locality and region.I concur with Senator McCarthy's comments regarding the necessity for the Minister to ensure that representations made by national politicians to their local authority are properly dealt with. I made this observation during the lifetime of the last Dáil to the Minister and some departmental officials when I said that it was sometimes difficult to get responses from county managers. They told me that the Department encountered the same difficulty. It was consoling but not very helpful. If Better Local Government is to mean anything, people should be given an acknowledgement and a response to communications. I ask the Minister to acknowledge in the legislation the importance of liaison between national and local politics.I listened to Senator Norris's contribution earlier and I thought both his tone and language displayed quite an ill-informed basis for some of the points he was arguing. I do not believe that any inducements would be an encouragement to people either to stay or to go. My experience over the years in local government has been that if one is not imbued with some philosophy of public service then one would not do it. Most people in politics suffer financially because of the time devoted to politics rather than making an gain from it. In that regard I welcomed the introduction in 2000 of a salary payable to councillors. Modest though it was, at least it was a start, a step in the right direction.The democratic process should be made accessible to as wide a range of people as possible. There can be a preponderance of self-employed, unemployed and retired persons in local government because of the amount of time involved. The representative associations raised this issue during the preparation of the Local Government Bill in 2002 and the Minister raised the matter with the social partners. Employers' representatives objected to having a statutory entitlement for people to participate.I am mindful that there have been dramatic changes in local government. I welcome the Minister's recent comments recognising that because of the functions and duties of those participating in local government it is no longer just a part-time position; it is becoming full-time. The preparation of a development plan is a huge undertaking and councillors must also examine retail strategies, wind farm strategies and a plethora of other matters that are part of the overall county development plan. Only a small proportion is being read thoroughly because it is so voluminous and as a consequence the system is not enjoying the benefit. Local councillors have insufficient time to deal comprehensively with all their responsibilities.I ask the Minister to make the necessary changes to ensure that local government continues to play a pivotal role commensurate with the needs of a more modern operation of local government. If the Minister makes a serious attempt to change our centralised system he will be applauded for transforming local government.There is a failure to recognise that the rates of remuneration and expenses for those participating in local government are inadequate. Further changes are required. Councillors will have to make a decision about whether they will go forward again for election. Many of them will have served for more than 20 or 30 years. They will walk away with only four years' gratuity, which is inadequate and does not recognise the service they have given. There is an arrangement in the Houses of the Oireachtas whereby a Member moving from this House to the Lower House can buy back service as in pension schemes. Because of the structures in local government, people are staying on longer than they need and this is not conducive to the renewal of local government. I suggest that councillors should be allowed participate in a scheme for buying back pension contributions.I readily admit that mine is a minority opinion regarding the direct election of cathaoirligh. That provision had the potential to effect a significant transformation in local government. I readily concede that most councillors did not welcome the change. I have been chairman of a local authority on ten different occasions and I valued that opportunity. The job is changing almost on an annual basis. It would have been far more effective to hold the chair for a period longer than one year. That lack of continuity retards and inhibits local government. The annual rotation is not a good practice. Anybody who has been chairman of a county council or a city council will readily acknowledge that it is no longer just a part-time position but an onerous and a full-time job. If these two tenets are recognised, it will just be a question of who elects the chair.If local government is to move forward in the future, the Minister put his finger on it when he said one must consider full-time councillors. Obviously, the chair should be a full-time position. In another interview the Minister drew an analogy between directly elected cathaoirligh and the way the Taoiseach was elected. Perhaps we will follow through on this in the case of local government because we are just a little more than 12 months away from the next elections. Going into a general election, everyone knows who the alternative Taoisigh are likely to be. Perhaps parties will nominate in advance of the elections who the chair should be. If we do this, we will put the focus on local government.I listened with interest this morning to reports that Fine Gael had launched a discussion document. Many of the headlines are worthy of consideration. It would be ideal for local government if Government and Opposition could work together. I have seen changes made in local government which had more to do with political reasons than with better local government. If we could harness consensus as to the best way forward for local government, serious and effective improvements could be made. I say to the Minister, "Carpe diem,” seize the day, if there is an opportunity do so. There is no better man. I wish him well.

I am thinking of County Cork where councillors travel 100 miles from Castletownbere to attend county council meetings.

The words "public service" are very important. The amount involved is not important. What is important, however, is the fact that they should be acknowledged for their service during the years when there was no pay, very poor expenses and much inconvenience both to their family and personal lives. The Minister should consider this aspect in the context of the Bill.I listened with amusement to Senator Norris's contribution. I thought it ironic the way in which he attacked the localisation of issues by councillors in the light of the fact that he is well able to speak about Dublin, his local turf, at every opportunity. I do not apologise for speaking about Carlow or the south-east, the area with which I am familiar. I assure Senator Norris that Fine Gael Senators will not be nominating their wives to positions because, as far as I know, half the Fine Gael Senators are young eligible bachelors. Unless we all get married very quickly, that will not happen.I listened with amusement to Senator O'Rourke on Today FM on Sunday morning and the Chief Whip and Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, the previous week. They spoke about the busy schedule of the Dáil and Seanad and the fact that the Houses could not sit on a Monday and Friday because of county council, town council and health board meetings, which all sounded very plausible. However, if one looks at the calendar for Dáil and Seanad sittings, one will realise that we got our Christmas holidays on 13 December last and did not resume until 29 January. I recently spoke to Ms Avril Doyle, MEP, who told me that they went back on 6 January. We should be totally honest with the electorate. While the point is valid to some extent, we could sit far more often. The fact that we are off during the months of July, August and September is crazy. As a teacher, I was used to long holidays but the fact that I now have three months holidays does not reflect well. There could be give and take on both sides if we sat for longer during the summer and had a far shorter Christmas holiday. I am not sure about the Easter break.I am very cynical about the Government. Since taking office, the first effect of Dáil reform has been to ensure the Taoiseach is present in the House one day less per week. In the future that will make whatever Taoiseach is in office less accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I question the sincerity of the Government in this regard.Since I became a member of the council, I have seen an erosion of power from town councils whereby responsibility for sewerage and water works has now been transferred to county councils. I can understand centralising the service in one local authority rather than sharing it between two but query the main reasons for doing so. Why has the Minister not tackled the anomaly between town and county councils? Perhaps we should move towards having one local authority in an area. People are confused as to the reason they can vote in local elections for one person in a county council area and then vote for a person in the town council area. This means they have two votes in the same area. There is overlapping. The issue of borough councils and corporations should also be looked at. The Minister should consider the idea of qualifying conditions for town councils versus borough councils. By definition, they are entitled to greater funding. Carlow is a rapidly growing town, which I hope will be upgraded in the future.Concern was expressed last week by Fine Gael Members about the constitutionality of the Bill. We did not do so to be mischievous but for genuine reasons. It might be helpful if the Attorney General's advice on the Bill was published because it seems likely that we will be going to the Supreme Court on the issue. In the light of the fact that either President McAleese or Deputy Ring, together with Fianna Fáil backbenchers and Senators, will refer it to the Supreme Court, it might save everyone time and money to get a ruling on it. It might clear up the issue involved.I was confused by Senator Fitzgerald who spoke about not having directly elected mayors but continuous chairpersons on councils. Either there is one or the other, he cannot have both. Fine Gael believes we should have directly elected mayors, particularly in the cities. Perhaps we should see how it would work in the main cities of Cork, Dublin, Waterford, Galway and Limerick and then extend it. The idea is worth pursuing but the Government is scared of the topic.Compulsory voting is not mentioned in the Bill. It is outrageous in this day and age that people do not vote, particularly as our ancestors fought for the right to do so. We know our history. Therefore, people should vote. There is no excuse for not doing so. A turnout of 40% or 50% in local elections is outrageous. Invariably, the people for whom we do most work do not vote. This happens across parties. The reality is that people come to us the next day, clap us on the back and tell us that but for their vote we would not have been elected. However, if one checks the register of electors, one will often find that they did not even vote.

How we would implement it is another question, but I believe there would be cross-party support for it in the House. It would encourage people to vote and would explain why they should do so. In England, a turnout of 20% is expected in the forthcoming local elections. We might be more democratic if we could emulate Saddam Hussein's turnout of 99.5%.The Minister was disingenuous in pretending that he is giving us concessions in the Bill in terms of the fact that agendas will be made available to us. He also said that he would bring forward further legislation in respect of making county managers and other council officials reply to us. It is a pity that such provision is not made in the Bill in order that we would know where we stand. It is like agreeing a price for a second-hand car with a dealer and being promised the car in the future. A person would like to know what exactly he is buying and would like to get the car there and then.

The agendas are already available on websites, but I would be more interested in the outcomes of meetings. I would be interested to know what decisions were made.Why are city and county managers so keen to see Oireachtas Members off the councils? Do they perceive us as a threat because we have a fair idea about legislation passing through the Houses? Oireachtas Members bring something extra to council meetings that perhaps ordinary councillors cannot. We have the experience of enacting legislation week in and week out. Many people have informed me that the councils will be the poorer for the withdrawal of the Oireachtas Members.The issue of being full-time politicians has been mentioned by many speakers. We should not have full-time politicians at local level. Politics is an extremely volatile profession and there is a huge turnover of those involved in it. The average life of a Deputy in the Dáil is 11 years. If a Deputy spends three terms there, he or she is doing well. If we move towards having full-time local politicians, what will happen when some of them lose their seats? Will they be unemployable? People in other employment can bring their daily experiences to council meetings. Before becoming a Member of the Seanad I was a teacher and was aware of education issues which I could raise at council meetings. That experience is a benefit. A nurse on the council could raise health issues from first-hand practical experience. We would lose that benefit if we decide on having full-time council politicians.We seem to have gone to the extreme on the idea of having full-time politicians. It is almost a sin now to be a part-time one or to have an interest in any other area. This sends the wrong signal to business people. It says that they should not get involved in politics or they will have to give up their business. That is unfair. If someone has spent 20 years building up a business, why should he not be entitled to retain that business and earn money from it just because he has entered politics? Some businesses are more suited to politics than others. We should not go to the extreme of having full-time politicians at local and national level. We still need to get out among the people and bring with us to the Chambers – Dáil, Seanad or council – our experiences.The more people are paid, the less they do on a voluntary basis. Money can be the ruination of all and does particular damage in the voluntary sector. We have seen that with the passage of time. If people are appointed on a full-time basis to voluntary charities, it is guaranteed that the number of volunteers involved will drop. Why should they volunteer if someone is being paid full-time? We must be aware of that danger. We should be careful about paying people because it might have the wrong effect.I have heard rumours about MEPs. Will they have to stand down as Deputies or does this legislation apply to them? If Senators and Deputies have to resign from local authorities, will the same rules apply if a Deputy is elected as an MEP? Will he or she have to resign from the Dáil immediately or is it appropriate for them to have a dual role as Deputy or Senator and MEP?We have missed the opportunity to initiate serious local government reform in the Bill. However, I am glad the Minister said that he will bring forward further details in this regard before the Bill is enacted. I hope he takes my advice and tests the constitutionality of the Bill now, rather than being forced to do so later.

The main issues are the dual mandate and directly elected mayors. I am a holder of a dual mandate because I was elected as a councillor for the first time in 1999. I have strong feelings on the subject. I fully support the abolition of the dual mandate. That is something I have felt strongly about for some time.If we are to be serious about government at national and local level, we must set about the process of differentiating between legislators and local politicians. There is a major fundamental difference between the two. Those of us who have stood in general elections are aware of the number of local issues that become topical when we are seeking office as legislators. We not only have to educate politicians about the change, but must also educate the public about their politicians' responsibilities and what they can expect from them. This will take time because it involves a major change to the culture that has obtained in recent years. Traditionally, Deputies filled out forms for people and performed other simple tasks these people could readily do for themselves. People became dependent on Deputies for the smallest of things. In my opinion, this has detracted from the proper legislative role we, as Members of the Oireachtas, should play.It would be interesting if a survey was carried out which would provide information on the amount of time that is spent by national legislators on fulfilling the duties of local politicians. We do not need such a survey because we all know what it would contain. It would, however, make interesting reading. I understand the concerns of certain holders of the dual mandate, particularly those who have come to the Oireachtas by that route. I understand that they may be concerned about what they see as their power base. I ask them to look at the long-term view and see what can be achieved to improve the political process in this country. This legislation is a step in the right direction towards improving that process. Such improvement, will, however, take some time.In our own party structures we can put in place mechanisms to separate the two rules. I encourage parties to do this. I am not trying to place barriers in people's way, but I want to encourage and facilitate the change that is necessary. This change can be brought about by selecting people for different strands, namely, those seeking nominations, those seeking election to be legislators and those seeking to be local politicians. In doing that one can in some way counteract the fears that have been expressed by certain Members. Basically, one must make a career choice to be a local politician or a legislator and one's party will facilitate that. Should one wish to change direction one can do so by opting out of one stream and moving into the other.I agree it is important for Oireachtas Members to have access to local issues. The bigger parties will have access through their councillors with regular meetings and briefings. Those of us in smaller parties who do not have a team of councillors behind us in our respective local authority could have a bigger problem in this regard. I am glad the Minister is to look more closely at providing greater access to local authority decisions, agendas, meetings, etc. I encourage Oireachtas Members to set up regular briefing sessions with their city or county managers. This will have a twofold purpose; the first is to be briefed and brought up to date, while the second will allow for a Deputy to work at national level, bringing forward issues that pertain to the area he or she represents.Reference has also been made to the way the voting register is administered and the inaccuracies it contains. As someone who ran in the recent general election I have to say that even in this modern electronic age there are serious concerns in this regard. In some cases deceased people are still on the register and people who change houses within local authorities are still shown as residing in houses they no longer occupy, even though the local authority is privy to this information having been involved in the house allocation. There is a need for a serious approach at national level to insist that the local authorities bring the register up to date.It is one's civic responsibility to vote. I am appalled when I contrast what happens here with television images of people elsewhere queuing for miles, some having walked overnight to exercise their democratic right. We tend to pay lip service to that right although we spent a long time trying to achieve it. I urge the Government to redouble its efforts to encourage people to vote. We should go so far as to make it compulsory to vote. With the advent of electronic voting easier access should be promoted so that people could exercise their democratic right even if they were not in their constituency on election day. We should be moving in this direction. Given how working life has changed, people are not always in their constituency on polling day. Equally, I recognise the right of people to register a protest vote, but that is not the same as not voting at all. There is a subtle difference there and we should look more closely at this matter.In principle I do not have a difficulty with the notion of directly elected mayors. However, I have difficulty with the fact that this office was brought in without giving it any firm responsibility in the sphere of local government. I regard that as a retrograde step. We have to examine the responsibility of county managers in legislation and when we re-visit the issue of directly elected mayors we should do so in an all-encompassing manner. While we are not ready for it yet, we should come back to this matter in the future. I have a difficulty with electing someone into a primarily ceremonial role without giving him or her some serious managerial responsibilities as well. This is not a reflection on existing county managers. We need to look at the separation of authority between executive powers and directly elected mayors or chairpersons.A question has also been raised in regard to full-time politicians at local level. We have come a long way in regard to the introduction of salaries. The current salary is insufficient to allow somebody to give up his or her job in order to become a full-time politician, which is a problem. Equally there is a difficulty for people who cannot get time off from their workplace to enter into local politics. They need to hold their job. We cannot have it both ways. If we encourage full-time politicians at local level they must be paid. In so doing we are not disenfranchising a person who has an existing job from taking on such a role. Having said that, I would not advocate that we have full-time politicians at the level of town commission or urban district council, although we are heading fast in that direction at city and county council level. There is some way to go before we reach that point.Reform of local government is both necessary and welcome. Although there is more to be done, we have come a long way. Some of the outstanding issues include the implementation and working of SPCs, area committees and so on. They are working well in certain local authorities but have not been embraced in the same way by all. I hear varying reports on this. We must introduce reform on a step by step basis. The bottom line is that there must be a fundamental shift in the thinking of politicians and in the public perception of politicians and what they should do for their communities. We have to be more conscious of our responsibilities as legislators, which will take time.I urge those opposed to the abolition of the dual mandate not to think in a short-term way. They need to ask themselves if it will result in better local government and national government in 15 years' time. They need to ask if local politicians of the future will be more focused, better rewarded and more capable of representing their local communities.This is the right step and I congratulate the Minister on taking it. I am sorry the measure did not come forward before now, but we all know its history. We should embrace the Bill as a positive step and not allow fears in regard to our personal political survival to get in the way of progressing the governance of the country at both national and local level.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Local government reform deserves a much wider debate than we are having in regard to the Bill before the House. There are two Bills from the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the Order Paper of the House; the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 and the Local Government Bill 2003, which is currently being discussed. One takes away the power of local authority members and gives it to county managers, while the other takes away the dual mandate with the intention of totally reforming local government.I cannot see where the reform is in the Bill – apart from the abolition of the dual mandate. When the last local government Bill came before the House, I supported an Opposition amendment proposing the abolition of the dual mandate. I also supported the direct election of mayors. I still think that is a very good idea. However, directly elected mayors would have to have more than mere token powers, as local authority chairmen have at present. That is the reason we need a wider debate on local government reform.We have had better local government in recent years. I have yet to meet a local authority member who has said that better local government makes it better than it was. It is not working. In our county two or three months after a strategic policy committee meets it meets again to adopt the minutes of the previous meeting. At that stage its decisions go before the next full meeting of the local authority which deals with the decisions taken by the SPC three months previously. This is how the work of SPCs is filtering into the system. No one can say the system is working effectively or efficiently. It is holding up progress. This year the decisions of my local authority relating to local improvement schemes were dealt with by an SPC which had to send its decisions directly to the main body of the council before being referred back to another meeting of the SPC to be ratified. A decision which had been ratified by the main council could be changed by a subsequent meeting of an SPC. I ask the Minister and his officials to examine this matter. SPCs are holding up progress within local authorities and slowing down the process of local government.Of the representatives of outside bodies brought in to SPCs, some have good ideas but the majority are not working at all. In fact, the majority do not even turn up at meetings. Why should they when they cannot attend the meeting of the main council when concerns of their SPC are decided? Better local government is a step backwards and means less power for councillors. In the Protection of the Environment Bill the Minister proposes less power still for local authority members. Where is the reform and when and how will it happen?I have heard Senators say the job of local government members should be full-time. The Minister has said he will bring this about. I do not know how it will happen. Ratepayers and taxpayers are paying the wages of local authority members. Will the Minister provide a bigger financial allocation to allow councillors to be full-time? Will a teacher or solicitor give up his or her job to become a full-time local authority member? If this is what we want, we must begin a bigger and wider debate about how it is to be funded.The Bill proposes that Members of the Oireachtas be given special powers to get information from county managers. This section of the Bill is quite flimsy, although the Minister has promised to say more about this measure before the evening is out. If he says something, he will have to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to strengthen it. The Bill now merely states that if a Member of the Oireachtas writes to a county manager, his or her letter must be answered within one week, ten days or a number of weeks and that he or she is entitled to have the agenda of local authority meetings, if requested. He or she will probably receive the agenda one week after the meeting has been held. I would like the Bill to contain a provision granting Oireachtas Members the right to have questions answered by county managers in the manner of parliamentary questions and within a specified time. Otherwise, this measure will be a waste of time.How will the Minister deal with health board members? The Minister for Health and Children appoints a number of persons to health boards. Can they still be Members of the Oireachtas? The Bill is an attack on local authority members. Almost every Bill establishing a State or semi-State body includes a provision precluding local authority members from membership of the board of the body in question. The Bill also precludes local authority members once they have been elected to the Oireachtas. What is so wrong with being a local authority member? When the Taoiseach appoints his 11 nominees to the Seanad, do the people concerned have to give up their jobs in order to be Members of the Seanad? I do not know of anyone who has given up a job to be a Member of Seanad Éireann. Very few did so. Why should a local authority member have to give up his or her job? As membership of a local authority is a part-time job, why should we have to give it up when elected to the Oireachtas?

I am talking about a much wider debate on total reform of local government which we do not find in the Bill. Can the Minister of State show me local government reform? While the Bill speaks about reform of local government, there is nothing in it about reform. The Minister says he wants to make local authority members full-time. He says he wants to do this and that but none of his reforms is contained in the Bill. Of the two Bills before the House, one is taking power away from local authority members while this one is doing away with the dual mandate. There is no reform. I am surprised that the Minister of States asks such a question. The Bill should be called the abolition of the dual mandate Bill because that is what it is.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Of course it is. We are moving one step forward and two back. We have seen U-turns on most of the proposals of the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government. We have passed legislation after legislation to change what Deputy Dempsey did as Minister. He wanted to have directly elected mayors. That proposal has been discarded. There were huge changes to his planning measures. I am disappointed because I am in favour of local government reform.While there should be a local and a national system I am disappointed at the narrowness of the Bill because the Minister could have broadened it. There is no point in his broadening it out in his contribution if appropriate provisions are not contained in the Bill. He is telling all Oireachtas Members he will do this but the Bill does not provide for it.I have been a member of a local authority for many years and I see problems with the dual mandate. It involves a huge workload. Part of the workload arises from Better Local Government. There are meetings and more meetings, all of which clog up the system, and none of them does one damn bit of business. That is the reality. Business is done only at the annual meeting, the roads meeting or at full meetings of councils. The Minister does not have his head in the sand and must be aware of this from listening to councillors.I am disappointed with the Bill. I hope the Minister will table an amendment to section 3, which provides for the guidelines, and strengthen the provision for Oireachtas Members to ask questions and get answers from county managers.

In 1999 I was honoured by the people of the Cavan electoral area in my native county of Cavan to have been elected to serve them on Cavan County Council. Having failed by a narrow margin in 1991 I worked hard for the following eight years and used as a model the way Senator Brian Hayes, the leader of the Fine Gael group in the Seanad, campaigned to get elected to the other House.I would like to remain a member of the council and to continue to serve the people of the Cavan electoral area, the village of Ballinagh and the townland of Blenacup. These are placenames that have never been heard before in the Seanad but I am not ashamed to mention them. However, we must face reality. The Bill will pass through both Houses and will be enacted.

The general council, with its representation from each of the county and city councils, is well placed to channel concerns between national and local government and vice versa. It has the resources of its experienced chairmen down through the years and an executive committee who can react at short notice to emerging issues, while the plenary body which embraces representatives of all counties and political parties is another effective sounding board.All of the 883 members of the General Council of County Councils should in future be consulted in relation to any legislation concerning local government. I firmly believe in that. The GCCC has made important inputs to the construction of the main Local Government Act, part of which we are discussing today. It also prepared a thorough review, in writing and verbally, of the SPC system, which is being furnished to the Minister. The general council was the only local government association to make an input into the national spatial strategy. As a Cavan man I thank the Minister for including my native county and the other town in my constituency, Monaghan, in the national spatial strategy. I am proud to say that.

Regulations should be put in place to allow these workers time off to attend council meetings.The term of the council should be extended from five to seven years. As one who was elected only in 1999 it took time to get to grips with council business. When I became a Member of the Seanad it became even more difficult. Colleagues on all sides will agree. To run the local elections in conjunction with the Presidential election would be helpful but would probably require a constitutional referendum. It is worth considering and would help increase the turnout for local elections.The Minister's intention to consider the question of full-time councillors is welcome. In the meantime, will he increase the amount of money being paid to them? It is costing them dearly to maintain their phones, cars and attend meetings all over the place. That they have to run around the country to conferences to make a few pounds is not acceptable and I ask the Minister to examine that matter.I ask the Minister to also consider the gratuity for long-serving councillors, some of whom have held their positions for almost 40 years. When they retire, they are entitled to €7,800. This is not acceptable, it is a disgrace. Senator Browne referred to introducing legislation to compel people to vote. Perhaps that is something at which we should look.I understand we are not allowed to mention Members of the Lower House, but I would like to mention that well-known, boisterous Deputy from Westport who claims he will challenge the constitutionality of the Bill.

I agree with much of what Senator Wilson said. He spoke about consistency, party loyalty and so on, but the word "hypocrisy" sprang to mind when I was listening to him because he will be voting in favour of the Bill. That is disappointing, but it is what we have come to expect. In that past week Fianna Fáil backbenchers stood outside the gates of Leinster House and said they were opposed to this legislation, but, miraculously, they will vote in favour of it when the time comes. It is nothing new for politicians to say one thing at home and another in the House. It is good to see Fianna Fáil is keeping the old traditions alive.I am not persuaded one way or the other in regard to the abolition of the dual mandate. As somebody who was proud to be elected to Kilkenny County Council in 1999, it is with regret that I will not be able to stand at the next local election. I would prefer to remain a member of the county council, but it is an argument on which I have an open mind at this point. I am not sure of the procedure in regard to MEPs, whether they are allowed to remain as Deputies and Senators once elected to the European Parliament and whether they are allowed to remain as members of—
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Not from 2004.

Will they have to resign their membership of that organisation after the European election? If there is to be consistency in the legislation, it should cover more than Deputies and Senators who are members of local authorities.The legislation is entitled the Local Government Bill, but it is really all about the abolition of the dual mandate and does not reform local government. That is my main objection to it. I agree with Senator Wilson's comment that the Minister has taken many good initiatives in his time in office and, thankfully, he reversed many of the decisions of his predecessor. I urge the Minister to look at membership of MEPs on other bodies as well as the membership of Deputies and Senators on local authorities.Better Local Government was mentioned by Senator Paddy Burke. As somebody who was elected to the council in 1999, when the old regime was in place, and who saw the transition to the new set up under Better Local Government, I note there has been a considerable decline in the operation of the county councils since the introduction of Better Local Government. Large numbers of county council employees have been promoted to senior management positions for which they earn large salaries, but, ultimately, this only creates an extra layer of bureaucracy.We have moved from the position where county managers were more accessible. I am glad Senator Wilson has no difficulties in Cavan. Our county manager is quite an amenable man but when Oireachtas Members or councillors approach him, they are inevitably sent to the nearest director of services with their queries.The introduction of the new layer of bureaucracy to which I refer has not helped local government. Before its introduction, it was clear that the manager was the man in charge, the engineer was the person who whom one went if one had a problem in regard to roads, sewerage, water or planning and the county secretary was the legal adviser to the council. Their roles were clear, but those of the directors of services are far from clear.Senator Paddy Burke mentioned the operation of the strategic policy committees. I am a member of two SPCs on Kilkenny County Council. It is very much a mixed bag. One of the SPCs, that which deals with the environment, works well and many good decisions are made. It leads the way in the county in terms of awareness of environmental issues, increased recycling and other initiatives. The other SPC of which I am a member, that which deals with planning, is somewhat toothless and does little, if any, productive work. I also agree with Senator Paddy Burke in respect of the delay in SPC decisions being carried through to county council meetings. It is often a couple of months before something discussed at a SPC is brought before the full county council. It would be better if there was no delay.Contrary to the ethos of Better Local Government, we have seen a continuous erosion of the powers of county and city councillors. The most recent example is contained in the Protection of the Environment Bill, which seeks to limit the role of councillors in the area of waste charges. I have spoken about that issue previously and my views on it are widely known.Local authorities are becoming a rubber-stamp for decisions made by central Government and that is a retrograde step. As somebody involved with a local authority, I have become increasingly disenchanted with its workings because county councillors have little say in what local authorities do. That is something we should try to reserve rather than speed up. Unfortunately, the two most recent Administrations have been accelerating the decline of local government.I agree with Senators Wilson and McCarthy that there should be a statutory provision enabling people to get time off work to attend county council and city and town council meetings. In Kilkenny there are a number of councillors who have difficulty in getting time off. If we are serious about encouraging people to involve themselves in local government, such provision should be made.I would be concerned about the idea of full-time county councillors. There are six councillors in my electoral area. I was elected as a student. There was a retired teacher, farmer, factory worker, bar worker and chef on the council, all bringing a different perspective to the role of county councillor. There are many different professions represented on local authorities. I would not like to see this made difficult by turning council positions into full-time ones, depriving local authorities of the vocational influence of people practising as farmers, solicitors, teachers and so on. Having them as members of local authorities adds something to county council meetings. If that was to cease, it would be another retrograde step for county councils.I am glad Senator Wilson raised the constitutionality of the Bill. I do not know if it is unconstitutional. It would be worth examining the constitutionality of prohibiting a person from running for election to local government. It is a question that needs to be answered and I am sure it will be asked in the course of the next couple of months.I oppose this legislation because it is simply about the dual mandate and not, ultimately, about reforming local government. In recent years we have seen a continuous erosion of the role local councils play in society. We should be trying to reverse that decline rather than hastening it. Local authorities will be diminished without Oireachtas Members who can bring another dimension to local government. I am a new Oireachtas Member and have been a council member for three and a half years. The membership of the council included four Oireachtas Members and I never felt they were overpowering or that I could not stand up and express a different view to theirs at a meeting. They brought another dimension to local government. I question the validity of the abolition of the dual mandate and remain to be convinced one way or the other. I oppose the legislation on that basis.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Like my colleagues on all sides of the House, I welcome the Minister. I also applaud him for his reforming zeal. He follows in a very impressive tradition because his predecessor was and remains, within his new portfolio of Education and Science, a politician of vision. I have often felt that because of the clientist nature of our political system we have not appreciated those who have shown vision. There are many politicians across the political spectrum with whom one might not necessarily agree but whom one cannot but admire for the deep thought they bring to the parliamentary process. On the Fine Gael side, there was the late John Kelly and, currently, Deputy John Bruton in his various roles and, on the Government side, without casting any reflection on anybody else in the context of local government reform, the current Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey and Deputy Cullen, Minister for the Environment and Local Government.That is the good news. The bad news is that I stand here as a loser, having lost the argument. Like my colleague, Senator Wilson, I will vote reluctantly for this legislation. I will do so because, the argument having raged within my political party for the past four years, the majority view prevailed. That is the democratic process. My main reason for opposing it was narrowly focused. It was because I was elected to this House by county councillors and, therefore, had a rather unique relationship with them and local authorities in general. I felt we should have been treated separately but, unfortunately, no Minister can do this constitutionally. The two representative Houses cannot be separated. What goes for one goes for the other in legislative terms.I share the opinion of Senator John Paul Phelan that Oireachtas Members enhance rather than diminish local authority business by their presence. Perhaps the Minister will clarify something on which we have corresponded, which is not contained within the legislation but is, I presume, part of the regulatory process he will initiate once the Bill is passed. I refer to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and appointed members of statutory bodies and sub-committees of local authorities, for example, the vocational education committees, library committees and SPCs, in which they play a very valuable role. I am the only Oireachtas Member on Leitrim Vocational Education Committee. I am an appointed member and value my presence on the committee. In a political sense, my colleagues on all sides of the House see my involvement in education matters as essential, because it links the local county committee and the national Parliament which means that on any national policy or impending national policy they get the inside track, given that many initiatives and policy areas are discussed here before they reach local authority level.It has never been adequately explained – I will not ask the Minister to explain it – why it was felt necessary at this moment in our political development to implement the proposal to abolish the dual mandate. I say this period in our development because we are really in a half-way house. Reference has been made to the local government reform document, the publication of which resulted in the establishment of the SPCs. It also, as alluded to on all sides of the House, created a bureaucratic jungle, a maze, which has benefited civil servants. It has created a whole layer of new jobs and also given local authority members a little bit of status and a few bob in their pockets. Sometimes the priorities are the other way. People see it as an extra few bob rather than as a job. When one thinks about it, they may not be too far wrong because not one comma of the County Management Act has been changed. County managers still retain the power they have always had.In that context, I welcome the repeal of the proposal to elect mayors directly. In the earlier internal debate, which Fine Gael, the Labour Party and other parties will also have had, a strong argument was made for electing mayors directly. It was argued that it would be very democratic and give the people a direct involvement in the process. However, behind the public relations and spin, all it would do is provide a platform for people with other agendas, who were not part of the local government system and have no experience of it to come into the system but with no extra powers. It was essentially a cosmetic exercise. I argued for the creation of an office of mayor or cathaoirleach with its own staff and resources. I am sure the Minister or one of his successors will revisit this at some point because the principle is not a bad one. In the original Bill, what was offered with regard to directly elected mayors and chairpersons was status and a few bob. It was not giving anything positive to local government. I am glad the Minister has gone down this road.Politicians in the Oireachtas have been pilloried in various editorials in national newspapers for opposing elements of this Bill as if it is a crime to do so. One broadsheet newspaper, in particular, had the cheek to complain about what goes on in the Oireachtas despite rarely reporting its proceedings, certainly not those of this House, except for tabloid purposes. The editorials took the high moral ground and pontificated about how dreadful it was for democracy that politicians wanted to hold on to their power at local level. That shows a lack of understanding of the role of the Oireachtas and local government which needs to be further defined. I realise the Minister is working on a rolling reform programme but it is not enough to take this in isolation. There is a need to marry it with real power and influence for Oireachtas Members.Some years ago at the beginning of this debate a Fianna Fáil Deputy, now a Minister, asked the then Minister whether he would outline what the brave new world for Deputies would be like. He asked what the role of Deputies would be when the dual mandate was taken away. That is the reason I say we are only at the half way stage of our development. There is a real need to consider urgent reform of the Houses in the context of how legislators can directly influence policy in the way that happens in other countries.We have yet to discover the Minister's thinking on this but I will not labour the point today because I want to focus on the legislation. That is our side of the equation but there is also a need to consider how local authority members – stripped of Oireachtas involvement and provided with a framework for further development – will respond to the new challenges presented to them. The omens are not good. The Minister has had to intervene with regard to waste management because certain local authorities did not implement proposals. It is an emotive issue but the nettle must be grasped.Because of the size of the country and the close relationship between locally elected councillors and the electorate, a small but vocal and highly motivated group can influence national policy to the extent that a county councillor looking over his or her shoulder towards the next election will go with the flow and bow to the political cliché that, "I am the leader of the people, I will follow the people," when leadership is required. It is sad that a Minister has had to take away the power of local authorities in a key area because policies are not being implemented in the national interest.That is the challenge for local authority members in the brave new world that will follow the passage of this legislation. Local authorities will be on their own in their administrative areas, with a range of powers but with responsibilities also. From conversations with previous Ministers for the Environment and Local Government – not just from my party – I know that this is a real concern among those drafting reforming legislation to provide more power for councillors. How will councillors rise to the challenge? How will they separate their electoral interests from the wider public interest? It is not enough to provide an administrative or legislative framework to give power to local authorities unless they are prepared to implement policy and take necessary decisions in the public interest. That is the dilemma facing local authority members because of the unique nature of Irish society.Ireland has no tradition of devolving power downward. It has one of the most centralised administrative structures in western Europe. Those who have seen how structures work in other EU countries will testify to this. It is a new ball game for local authorities as well as legislators.I endorse what has been said about the need to recognise the commitment made by county councillors and the greater commitment that will be expected as we move along the road of reform. It is not right that employers should hold, like the sword of Damocles, the threat of dismissal or diminution of a person's responsibilities in his or her job because he or she has decided to seek election – there should be no discrimination in that regard.The Minister should consider the possibility of compulsory voting. I accept that it would not be an easy road to travel but voter turnout has declined in recent local and national elections and there is a disconnection from politics.This afternoon I attended a meeting at Kilmainham of the National Economic and Social Forum, of which I am a member, where there was a report on the most recent plenary session held at the end of January, the theme of which was the national anti-poverty strategy. Over 300 people attended and the main point of consensus that arose among a very disparate group – from those representing the elderly to the hard of hearing to mentally and physically handicapped people – was a sense of disconnection from the centre of power, despite the architecture put in place, both from the perspective of locally elected representatives who meet voters daily, to national legislators who hold clinics on a variety of levels, to all of the social partnership structures put in place. In spite of this many in society feel disconnected and do not vote, because of which democracy is the poorer.There is a need to consider how this sizeable group can be encouraged to feel more included. The Minister is attempting to bring power to a local level – the purest form of democracy – in which he should be encouraged. While I am reluctant to act like a turkey voting for Christmas, I accept that the argument has been won and lost. On this occasion, I bow to the inevitable.

This is my first opportunity to wish him well in his portfolio. It is important in the interests of local government that he does well and gets this legislation right, although I have reservations about it. I also compliment Senator Wilson on his excellent contribution and hope he has the courage of his convictions, does his mother proud and votes as he feels, against the Bill.

#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	196	With regard to the Bill, the Minister is putting the cart before the horse. He spoke earlier in the context of two items of legislation, namely, the Protection of the Environment Bill, which will take powers away from councillors, and the Local Government Bill, which will give them powers. Essentially, this is double-speak. I and many of my colleagues would love to support the Bill if it was accompanied by genuine reform of local government and of this House, in particular.It has been stated, and I have no doubt, that the Minister, like many of his predecessors, has great reforming zeal. Previous Ministers embarked on campaigns to reform local government, but they all made the fatal mistake of failing to reform the financial aspects. Local government is totally starved of funds and unable to deliver the services that are so necessary to the public. There are some examples of this which never cease to amaze me. In the economic boom that has just passed, a decision was taken by the Minister to cap the rates pertaining to local authorities at a time when ratepayers could have afforded to pay an increase and when local authorities could have garnered money to deliver services. When there was an economic downturn and when things started to go wrong – I am not suggesting that this is because of Government mishandling – the first thing the Minster did was to lift the cap and put an onus on members of local authorities to pass on increases in rates to the public. The latter happened this year. If that is reform of local government, I do not understand it.In north Tipperary, for example, the physically disabled person's grant, to which Senator Mooney alluded, is now frozen because the funding required to enable applicants to draw down the grant is not available. The local authority does not have the money and is not in a position to raise it. The same applies to housing aid for the elderly. Applications made in 1998 and 1999 are only being dealt with now. The message is clear: old or disabled persons should not live in north Tipperary under this Government because there is no help for them.There is a national housing crisis. The waiting lists in my county are getting longer and people are losing faith. They wonder if they will ever receive a house from the local authority. The funding for the repair of local authority houses to keep them in respectable condition is also gone.There are many more examples. When I was first elected to the county council in 1991, we had a county manager, a county engineer, a county secretary and a finance officer. Now we have five directors of service and a county manager – six managers, in effect – each of whom has adequate staff. However, most of the money is being spent on administration and we do not have enough staff on the ground where services are being delivered. How long is it since the Minister was on the Ennis road where Mike Murphy used to see the council worker leaning on the shovel? There are no longer any council workers to deliver the service the community wants.

It is regrettable that we do not have them now. I would support the Bill if it was accompanied by genuine reform of local government. I have outlined the instances in which this is lacking. I have presented the facts and the Minister can correct me on them afterwards if he wishes.

#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I will provide another example. I was already double-jobbing on two authorities before I became a Senator. The NRA has responsibility for national primary and national secondary roads. The N62 runs through the heart of the jurisdiction of Templemore Town Council, which I represent. The council cannot spend money on improving streets or footpaths. It has to get permission from the NRA if it wants to do so, but the latter will not provide funding. The same applies in respect of improvements to the town square. As an elected member of two authorities, I have no say in the matter and must depend on the NRA. I do not know who are the members of the authority. They are certainly not elected by or accountable to the public.Senators, more so than Deputies, will be particularly adversely affected by the Bill. If the Bill was accompanied by genuine reform we could certainly support it. Senators do not have the facility to put down parliamentary questions and do not have the same access to Ministers and Departments as Deputies.

#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	204	—fails to reflect the issue raised.The Minister should consider the fact that councillors elect many Senators. When he abolishes the dual mandate, we will no longer be able to serve on councils or attend conferences. Where will we meet councillors? Does the Minister propose to put in place a mechanism that will maintain the link between Senators and councillors so that we can continue to serve our electorate until the next Seanad is elected? That is very important.The promised right to access to information, officials and documents is not very explicit and I hope the Minister will enshrine it in the Bill because it would go some way towards alleviating our concerns. It is also important that he would assign a director of services, if not the manager, who would be responsible for responding to the needs of Senators. Then, when Senators contact councils, the issues they raise will be taken on board and addressed promptly and not, as another Member observed, after a week or three months.When the scrappage scheme was introduced in 1999 the leadership of Fianna Fáil encouraged Senators and Deputies at the time to stay on and contest their seats in the local elections because of their ability to attract votes and bring other candidates in with them. In other words, the party's taking control of various local authorities was a power and money exercise. The party must be congratulated for this because it has great tacticians and always seems to get it right.However, one of the motives for introducing the Bill is reversing the trend because the last election was won – it was bought rather than fought – on the pretext of promises and commitments made on the doorsteps. These promises and commitments, even though they have not been honoured, have been abandoned. The Minister and his colleagues know they will get a rollicking during the local election campaign when they knock on doors. The Minister's tactic is to remove the people who made the promises and put in fresh blood. The new candidates will be able to make the age-old plea of Fianna Fáil: "We knew nothing about those promises. We had nothing to do with them".

He has lent credibility to the Senators by listening to them. There was merit in the proposal when mooted two years ago by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey. However, it was withdrawn due to the influence of Independent Members and deemed not to be a good idea. The then Minister was roundly condemned by some of his own backbenchers. The current Minister is in a better position because he does not have to bother about his backbenchers.

However, the ending of the dual mandate will not save money. All it will do is add an extra layer of local representatives who will be paid from the public purse. It will not deliver better local government. Senators and Deputies from all parties have made excellent contributions to and helped reform local government. The Bill may well be bad for local government because it will take away what those representatives have to offer. While it will encourage more people to become involved in local government, I genuinely believe it is the electorate which should decide who should represent it. If I stand for election, it is up to the people to elect or reject me. They are the ones who will decide whether I am failing in my duties locally by being involved in national politics. It is the right of the ordinary citizen to elect whoever he or she wishes to represent him or her.I thought the Minister would have had better regard for Senators and Deputies. The only persons debarred from contesting local elections are those who are insane or declared bankrupt. The Minister is putting us in with lovely bedfellows.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	209	There are a lot more than that. I will tell the Senator about them.I thank Senators for their contributions to the Second Stage debate. It has been a learning experience listening to the diversity of views and perspectives and in terms of the genuine high regard in which local government is held. It has a relationship with central government, While this proposal defines a clear separation, it is also a move to recognise the strengths of each system and their complementary roles. In recent decades there has been a substantial move in this direction.Ten years ago we decided that Ministers and Ministers of State would no longer be allowed to serve on local authorities. This rule was then applied to the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, the Cathaoirleach of this House and MEPs. Judges, holders of EU office, gardaí and civil servants are also debarred. Therefore, it is not just the mad and insane who are debarred; there are a large body of persons from all walks of life who are precluded. There has been a progression leading to this point. We have been moving for many years to get to this position today.I never suggested that the contribution of Oireachtas Members at local authority level was anything but important; it has always been significant. That is not to say, however, that the contribution of local authority members is not equally important and significant. It would be reasonable to suggest that in some cases -certainly not all – the role of the Oireachtas Member has been somewhat dominant or allowed to be dominant by virtue of the office he or she holds in the national Parliament. We are dealing with this matter in the context of ending the dual mandate.With regard to the issue of the constitutionality of the Bill, there is nothing for me to say. Any issue of constitutionality, as with any legislation, is a matter for the courts. I have confidence in the drafting of the Bill which, like all legislation, passed through the Office of the Attorney General. It stands up to scrutiny; otherwise, I would not be standing here if I had any doubts.It is a bit of a ruse by those who oppose the Bill to say it might be constitutionally dangerous. I will always accept an argument from any side. I have had great and very detailed discussion and debate with my party colleagues and respect the views expressed to me. They made a positive contribution in terms of my formulation of regulations. Moving from guidelines to statutory regulations is good. I hope to flesh out the proposals by the time the Bill passes through this House. I am always open to Opposition amendments and hope I am known as a Minister who has accepted many such amendments, as demonstrated when dealing with the Protection of the Environment Bill. I have never suggested that I am the font of all wisdom on any particular issue. The same applies to any one individual or group of individuals in the Department. The process of bringing Bills with great care through so many Stages in the Houses is designed to ensure we tease out what can be improved or remove measures that clearly were not thought through. I am always happy to discuss and debate.I am really confused by the Opposition parties' view on the Bill, particularly that of Fine Gael. I do not say this lightly other than to wonder why it has qualms when it actually proposed the ending of the dual mandate. It is still my view that the public position of the leadership of Fine Gael and Labour Party is that their parties are in favour of ending the dual mandate. To my knowledge, neither of the party leaders has suggested that there has been a reversal of policy.I did not present this Bill or suggest it last year. Neither Fianna Fáil nor the Government ever suggested that it was being brought forward as part of a huge reform package. I said last year that we would deal with this issue. There was no demurring from Fine Gael or Labour Party at the time; they congratulated and encouraged me. Not too long ago Fine Gael with great fanfare published a policy statement entitled, A Democratic Revolution – A Thorough Overhaul of the Institutions of the State. It is worth quoting from it:Dual mandates for councillors and Oireachtas Members will be prohibited. Sitting Deputies or Senators will not be allowed to seek election to a local authority. Sitting councillors will be deemed to have resigned their seat on election to the Dáil or Seanad.

We are giving it its own raison d'être in the context of its members. Its members will be just local authority members and we will be just Members of the Dáil and Seanad. We are making that separation and the system must be fair and efficient. I will not give Members of the Oireachtas a superior position to that of elected councillors because it would not be acceptable to anyone.The issue has been about access, responses and how we deal with the situation. I am confident I will be able to meet the challenges posed fairly and openly by colleagues in my own party and by other Members of the House. Before the Bill finishes in the Seanad, I propose to make changes to it. I will tease it out with colleagues and we will have a clearer picture of what is involved, which Members deserve. I have given a lot of time to the Bill which reflects my interest in local government and my respect for the Seanad. The debate has been of enormous help to me in clarifying what the real issues are in regard to the relationship that must exist at local level.I would say to Members of the House that this is important legislation which will expand the political representative base throughout the country. By bringing more people into the system, we will increase the general stock of politicians available to serve the people, which is our primary focus. We can then move on to the point made by Members on all sides regarding real reform. This is a defining moment.I listened to what Senator O'Rourke, Senator Mooney and others said earlier. This affords us a three pronged approach in some respects. We can now look at the whole local government structure. The Seanad has already decided to look very closely at strengthening its role, including its operational functions, judicial review, legislation and so on. The same applies to the Dáil in terms of sitting times. We have been frustrated for a long time in terms of expanding our role, times of sittings and so on. Much springs forth from the ending of the dual mandate which will benefit the three democratically elected Chambers, that is, local authorities, the Seanad and Dáil Éireann.I commend the Bill to the House and thank Senators on all sides for their positive, helpful and well thought out contributions.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I move:That Seanad ÉireannRecognising– the important role the prison visiting committees should play in ensuring that the high standards of prisons in Ireland are maintained and that prisoners' rights are protected;– the need for greater transparency with regard to the operations of Government and political appointments in particular;– that there should be no objection to the appointment of political people to political positions;Concerned at– the phenomenal increase of 66% in the total cost of the prison visiting committees over the past three years and the 9.3% increase in the first ten months of 2002 alone;– the massive divergence in the costs between committees and the inconsistency in the rates of increase;– the propensity of committee members to live far from the prison they are assigned to visit;Deploring– the obvious party political bias in making appointments to committees;– the clandestine manner in which appointments are made;Demands that– vacancies on prison visiting committees be advertised to the public;– candidates be nominated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the basis of their skills in the areas of administration, law, criminology, human rights, social work, education and medicine;– all nominations to prison visiting committees be vetted and approved by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights before they are confirmed;– efforts be made to reduce the cost of prison visiting committees by examining the expenses regime and nominating persons to visit prisons in reasonable proximity to their abodes;– the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights be asked to investigate the spiralling cost of the committees and to make recommendations for their fundamental reform.I welcome the Minister to take part in this debate.Prison visiting committees have long been in need of a radical overhaul to enable them to fulfil their potentially valuable role in ensuring the highest standards are maintained in the prisons service. As constituted, they fail to perform the task they have been appointed to carry out at considerable expense to the taxpayer. The result is that politicians are held in lesser esteem by the public. The problem is a cross-party one. Prison visiting committees were in place when Fine Gael was in government, the reason the motion should not be understood as critical of any individual here or any member of a prison visiting committee. We seek long-overdue reform. The Minister must seriously examine the committees and institute the necessary corrections to the system.Our ineffectual and inefficient prison visiting committees represent a poor use of resources which could be otherwise allocated within the prisons service. The committees should be localised, cost effective and accountable and appointments to them should be made transparently. They were established on a statutory basis a long time ago in 1925 and the only attempt to re-examine the relevant legislation was made in the Prison (Visiting Committees) Order 1972. The Minister, who has been in office for a number of months, is known for his views on the failings of the prisons service and I hope he will soon make the changes needed to create an efficient prison visiting committee system.The prison visiting committees are venal in composition and their membership reads like a roll call of Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats activists from almost every corner of the country. They include no less than five former Fianna Fáil Ministers of State, two former Deputies, including one from the Progressive Democrats, and a former Cathaoirleach of this House. The Wheatfield visiting committee comprises one former Minister of State, six Fianna Fáil county councillors and one Progressive Democrats county councillor. Four of its members come from County Kerry, at least two of whom are Fianna Fáil associates of the last Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. None of the committee's 12 members is from Dublin and only two come from adjoining counties. Fine Gael does not contend that politicians should be barred from membership of prison visiting committees, nor does it demand the placing of a cordon sanitaire around members of political parties in terms of these appointments. However, the committees should not be populated exclusively by party hacks who criss-cross the country to pick up expenses.While there should be room on prison visiting committees for public representatives and those involved in politics, natural justice dictates that membership should also be open to professionals such as sociologists, social workers, criminologists and psychologists who are genuinely qualified to assess the well-being of prisoners. Penal reformers should also be included as persons who really care about the conditions in which prisoners live and about their prospects for rehabilitation. Doctors and teachers are in a position to accurately assess prisoners' educational and medical needs. However, it is not possible to do this because persons from these backgrounds do not sit on prison visiting committees as a matter of course. It is a joke to expect prisoners to make complaints to associates and appointees of the Minister who is ultimately responsible for the workings and failings of the prisons service. Prison visiting committees are a classic example of the Establishment investigating itself. This injustice demands reform. I ask Senators to accept this.While it cost €656,500 to run prison visiting committees in 2002, we have seen very little for our money. Aggregate costs have soared by 77% in the last three years. However, certain committees have far exceeded the average. The costs for the prison visiting committee in Cork have soared by 192% in the last three years, while those for the committee at Mountjoy Prison have soared by 122% and by 192% for the committee at the Curragh. Given that it is the very one the Minister wishes to close, it is ironic that the most frugal committee is that at Shanganagh which has seen its costs increase by only 19%. As with the Government's operation of the health service, there is nothing to show that initial and ongoing expenditure on prison visiting committees over the last three years represents money well spent.An answer to a parliamentary question reveals that between 1997 and 2002 the committees raised only one matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In effect, it cost over €2 million to raise. How effective are those committees if over five years they ask one question of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? They have cost €2 million in those five years, a sum that would be better spent within the prison service by providing rehabilitation and suicide prevention services. This is a disgrace to the State and a disgrace to all of us who allow it to continue.According to the 1972 order, prison visiting committees should inspect the diets of prisoners, select library books, organise lectures and addresses and ensure that reasonable steps are taken to ensure that prisoners do not relapse into crime after their release. I ask the Minister if any of the visiting committees is doing these things. Will the Minister say how often he has asked the prison visiting committees to use their powers to hold inquiries into charges against prisoners? I do not expect it to be a very long answer.To make matters worse, since the creation of the prisons inspectorate the supposed work of the prison visiting committees has been duplicated by an equally bizarre body with no statutory basis, made up of a judge, former prisoner governor and an official. Does this confirm the failure of the visiting committees to do their job or is it just another layer of bureaucracy?It does not make sense to have people living in Kerry on the Mountjoy visiting committee and people from Dublin on the visiting committee for Cork. This is not an effective and accountable way of doing things and it will have to change. There are 23 members of the visiting committees who are resident in Dublin and not one of these has been appointed to institutions in Dublin such as St. Patrick's Institution, the Training Unit or Wheatfield Prison. We propose an end to this system. I ask the Senators on the other side of the House to support our motion. Reform of the prison visiting committees is long overdue.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I second the motion and I congratulate Senator Terry on her comprehensive argument to the House on this prisoner welfare issue. I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House and I thank him for being present, given his onerous responsibilities relating to meetings in Northern Ireland in the past 48 hours. I wish him and his Government colleagues well in that matter.This motion is straightforward and does not need to be debated for two hours. The truth is that all political parties and all Governments have engaged in this abuse since 1925. I ask that all colleagues on both sides of the House address this reality. I want to quote from a recent article by Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a former Taoiseach and leader of my party:In my view there is also a possible problem relating to abuses of expense claims, including the appointment of political supporters to various bodies, for instance, to prison visiting committees far away from where these appointees live. Through this process such supporters may be enabled to claim unvouched standard subsistence and travel amounts which may be substantially in excess of their actual disbursements.He was referring in the article to the issue of standards in public life. This issue has not been dealt with by any Government in recent years, including my own party.The Minister claims to be a Minister for reform and I ask him to take this issue seriously. No one on this side of the House is suggesting that he as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should not have the power to appoint people to prison visiting committees and we are not suggesting that there should be no prison visiting committees. We are suggesting that where decisions are made in respect of appointments to these boards a system of public advertisement should be used and those who do not come from the party political base should be appointed. I am not suggesting that politicians should not be members of the board but the large predominance of party political appointees, be they councillors or others, leads one to the inexorable conclusion that there is abuse in the whole procedure.Senator Terry correctly pointed out that the vast majority of members of these prison visiting committees do not live in close proximity to the prisons they visit; they live 200 or 300 miles away. Section 3(1)(a) of the 1925 legislation states that the fundamental task within the responsibility of the prison visiting committee is to hear any complaints that may be made by the prisoners. If I were a prisoner, would I be satisfied in having my complaint heard by a group of people who were appointed exclusively by the Government, who are in effect supporters of the Government? There is a natural opposition regime in respect of complaints made by prisoners. Will the Minister confirm in his reply if it is good enough that over the past five years just one complaint has been made by the 15 prison visiting committees?I receive regular complaints from prisoners in my constituency work. I communicate these complaints to the governor of the prison. I ask the Minister to tell the House the number of complaints he has received in the past five or ten years. If the answer is one complaint that is a shocking indictment and it undermines the very function of the visiting committees as set out in the 1925 legislation. It is time for change. I ask that the Minister consider this motion.I note that the Leader has put down an amendment to the motion which supports the status quo. The current situation is unworkable because it undermines the principle enshrined in the 1925 Act and it is open to abuse. Substantial sums of money are being given out to people who simply go to a prison on a monthly basis, claim for their expenses and then go home. One could argue that a person on a prison visiting committee in Dublin could also do some shopping while they are here. I imagine this is the type of abuse that is taking place.The Inspector of Prisons has a substantial number of staff at his disposal. What is the fundamental distinction between the work of the Inspector of Prisons and the work of the prison visiting committees? The office of Inspector of Prisons is not yet established on a statutory basis. If this office had a role throughout the prison system as a whole, there would be no need for the prison visiting committees. They are a vestige of the jobbery, abuse and hackery of the worst type in which all political parties have engaged. I would ask the Minister, on a cross-party basis, to begin to do something about it.Prison visiting committees have allegedly been watchdogs for a number of years. As Senator Terry rightly pointed out, substantial sums of public money go into this. Of more than 180 members of the various prison visiting committees throughout the country, at least 60 are known party members – in effect, Government supporters – which is one third of the total membership. That is not good enough in a modern democracy. We need to reform this whole area. If the Minister wants to put his mind to it he can do so.We are saying on this side of the House that there is cross-party support for this fundamental reform which, in essence, is an issue of prisoner welfare. As Senator Terry pointed out, many people would like to serve on prison visiting committees, including doctors, teachers, people involved in training and rehabilitation, people who have a real contribution to make, notwithstanding the contribution political appointees can make. However, we must get the balance right, which is the substance of the motion before the House tonight.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I welcome the Minister to the House for this debate. Like Senator Brian Hayes, I extend to him, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs my good wishes on their efforts during the recent talks on Northern Ireland. I have no doubt his commitment, and that of others, to the process will prove successful and lead to greater harmony and a much healthier situation on this island. He deserves the gratitude of everyone for that.I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Seanad Eireann" and to substitute the following:"recognises the important role of Prison Visiting Committees in ensuring continuing high standards in prisons and the protection of prisoners' rights;notes the value to Prison Visiting Committees of the diversity of background of their membership;acknowledges the due consideration given by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in making new appointments to Prison Visiting Committees to all relevant factors, including background, interests and experience;recognises the commitment of the Minister to the effective and efficient discharge by Prison Visiting Committees of their functions: andwelcomes the appointment of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention as a further safeguard for the rights of prisoners."There has been an effort to decry the work of the prison visiting committees, which is a pity. These people work on a voluntary basis and it is fair to say that if they were not imbued with such a sense of public service, they would not be involved in this work. They receive no remuneration, bar expenses, which would not compensate for the time and effort they put in.Committees to which Senator Terry referred are appointed under the 1925 order. They meet on a monthly or bi-monthly basis and must have a minimum of six and a maximum of 12 members. They are an important plank and play an important role in the operation of our custodial system. They hear prisoners' complaints, report to the board, and assist in the selection of books for the libraries, which is important for the rehabilitation of prisoners. They also have powers to grant privileges, providing it does not compromise security. They have a special responsibility – this is referred to in the order – for prisoners who are about to be discharged in order to avoid a relapse into crime. Some of them take that role particularly seriously. They are involved in organising lectures and addresses for prisoners. They may give extra visitor rights to certain prisoners and they make an annual report to the Minister. This is important because it focuses on accommodation, catering, medicine, educational welfare and recreational facilities.While doing research for the debate, I discovered that since 1998 they have established a committee of chairpersons to deal with matters of general relevance and treatment of prisoners generally. There are some good proposals and suggestions coming forward from that cross-fertilisation of ideas.I read an annual report from Castlerea, which I am sure would echo like-minded reports from other committees. It indicates that the work of the committees is effective and worthwhile. It deals with drugs free policies and acknowledges that Castlerea is attempting to be a drugs free prison. It expresses satisfaction with drugs testing methods, which are carried out on a regular basis. As we know, the drugs problem in prisons throughout the world is causing difficulties, which are being addressed.The report also deals with the dietary requirements and kitchen facilities for prisoners. It also comments on educational facilities. It is interesting that courses from junior certificate standard to leaving certificate standard, as well as Open University courses, are available in the prisons. It would be very unfair to denigrate the work these committees are doing.They also have industrial workshops in carpentry, laundry, fabric moulds, leather crafts and so on. The reason is to encourage personal development so that when prisoners are released they will have better prospects of securing employment and not re-offending. It also gives a sense of value to individuals. If that type of self-esteem can be engendered while people are in prison, it may offer an inducement not to offend again.Unfortunately, suicides in prisons have been a factor, some of them probably as a result of drug addiction and other reasons. The report comments on that problem. There was an unfortunate incident in Castlerea and it suggests that proper psychological counselling should be made available when this happens. It also suggests that new methods to monitor high risk offenders are needed. It refers to offender after care, including the availability of half-way houses or high support hostels to ensure people integrate back into society.I contacted some members of the prison visiting committee, some of whom live adjacent to the prison. These people are very enthusiastic about the work which goes on and what they would like to see happening in order to improve the lot of prisoners, particularly after care for prisoners. There is a perception that, because of a feeling of disorientation from society generally, prisoners will come under the bad influences of the past. As a consequence, they will find themselves becoming involved in crime and going back into prison. They are suggesting that accommodation be provided. One member of the prison visiting committee is actively trying to identify accommodation to be made available in their own county in order to rehabilitate prisoners for a period to allow them to integrate into an environment where there are certain supports. Very often when prisoners are released, their families are alienated from them and they cannot reintegrate into society through the family, which would be the ideal situation. Consequently, there is an onus on us to try to provide alternative ways of doing this.If properly handled, a certain percentage of prisoners will not recommit crime. Obviously, it is important to identify these people and to give them the necessary after care supports to avoid that happening. The Encounter project in Cork was mentioned. A range of activities is taking place in which the committee has taken an interest.The motion indicates that very little homework was done in regard to what these committees do. While it has been recognised that there should be no objection to the appointment of political people to political positions, there is criticism of it. The criticism is partly motivated by virtue of the fact that politics in general is a numbers game. The Taoiseach is elected on the basis of the numbers returned to the Dáil. Government Ministers are appointed accordingly.Unfortunately, when in Opposition, it is not possible to exert control. That is the purpose of the motion. It is ridiculous to imply that members of prison visiting committees should have a university education. If anything, prisoners would be more likely to empathise with those whom they would classify as ordinary people within their communities.The role of prison visiting committees should not be undermined for political purposes. They do valuable and excellent work which should be recognised. The question of political affiliation or lack of it should not be a matter of concern to the House to which I commend the amendment.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I have visited prisons on many occasions. I first visited one approximately 20 years ago. One of Nuala Fennell's first visits as Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs was to the women's prison at Mountjoy Prison. She was shocked by the conditions, especially the lack of medical care. She asked me to visit the prison with her to see what could be done about getting a woman doctor, a general practitioner who lived locally, to attend.When I visited the prison I had never seen anything like it. It was like something out of a Dickens novel. There was a huge laundry where the girls congregated. The rattling and screaming were appalling. The first thing one notices on visiting the prison today is the lack of screaming. It is extraordinary how an improvement in the condition of inmates, in prison for similar type of crime, encourages them to behave in a different way. That taught me a huge lesson. If people are placed in conditions where they are more likely to be, and feel they are, treated better, their behaviour will greatly improve, both when in prison and, we hope, when they leave.There is a need to consider the regrettably high rate of recidivism which I am sure the Government wants to reduce. In view of this I regret the amendment. We need to see how we can improve conditions in prisons, which regrettably now hold more than before. Very few members of the public get a chance to enter prisons unless they are visitors or work in them. In view of this we must rely on prison visiting committees to conduct matters on behalf of the public.I am intrigued by how few politicians have visited prisons. The authorities are not reluctant to accept visitors, on the contrary. They are anxious to show the facilities and explain what is happening. I am also surprised at the small proportion of those in the legal profession, including judges, who have visited prisons. This has improved. I recently attended a lecture in the Law Society and was pleased to discover that it organises tours for students to visit prisons.Our prisons have improved. While I would not wish to visit the prisons at Wheatfield or Clover Hill for a short holiday, improved facilities allow for a much more productive environment for prisoners and staff. I, therefore, applaud the efforts being made in this regard.Every year Mountjoy Prison produces a play. Last year it produced "The Field" and this year it is producing "Moll". They are first class productions. Tickets should be booked in early April and I encourage Ministers and Senators to attend. It is well worthwhile because it enables visitors to get a feel for what is happening in the prison and what can be done for the inmates. When the production of plays first started, it was difficult to get anybody to audition for the parts and actors had to be employed. Today, there is a great demand to get a part. At the end of the play enthusiasm sags because there has been such enthusiasm about being involved in the production, including the staging, costumes and lighting.Prison visiting committees were established under old legislation. One of their purposes is to hear the complaints of prisoners. Their annual reports must also offer policy suggestions to management, in this case the Government. The reports are not automatically published and in some instances it is difficult to access them. For many years I pressed for the early release of the reports of the inspector of mental hospitals and eventually they were published reasonably quickly. Visiting committee reports should likewise be published and made accessible as soon as possible.Usually, a prison officer acts as secretary to the prison visiting committee and he or she sometimes writes the report. This is unsatisfactory. Traditionally, the officer is present when prisoners are interviewed, which is also unsatisfactory. It means that the prison authority and the committee are working together and prisoners feel they cannot make proper complaints. Mountjoy Prison has managed to stop this procedure but I am not sure about the position in other prisons. It should be easy to discourage this undesirable practice. Prisoners do not want the authorities to know about their complaints.In recent years it appears to have become almost impossible to be appointed to a prison visiting committee unless one has a close political association with the party or parties in government. This is regrettable. It is also ridiculous and expensive to have members of committees travelling all over the country. While prisoners and committee members sometimes express concern that committees may be too closely associated with prisons in their area, it should be possible for them to visit prisons in adjacent or nearby areas, for example, visiting committees from Limerick should visit Cork and so on. The current system of visitation is very expensive and unproductive. While those with political affiliations should not be ruled out for membership of committees, many view committee members as supporters of the Minister. That is a mistake because it makes the Minister vulnerable to accusations of undue influence. It would be better if Ministers accepted criticism.Membership of prison visiting committees should not be confined to those with a university education. The most practical appointments could be former prisoners as they could give an idea of the best way for a committee to proceed. Perhaps consideration should be given to this, especially the appointment of former prisoners who have done well after their release.Visiting committee members should also receive training. Senator Terry pointed out the various areas they are supposed to investigate. In the United Kingdom, prison visiting committees do get training. The attitude here is not professional and the committees do not have a proper understanding of what they are supposed to be doing.Prison visiting committee members should have a fixed term. Some people have been on committees for 20 years or more which is not a good idea and some are on two committees or more. It is hard to meet people who will criticise the system but it is worthwhile doing so. About ten years ago the visiting committee in Mountjoy Prison gave out hell about members of my profession and the medical treatment of prisoners. Treatment was transformed as a result. Criticism does work. It is depressing to hear from prisoners that they have little faith in the visiting committee and that they would prefer to complain to the chaplain.The prison Bill is expected some time but we have the Criminal Insanity Bill and Members may have noticed the great excitement with which it was greeted. We should have the prison Bill here as soon as possible. It would be worthwhile discussing it because it has been a long time since it was reviewed as Senators Terry and Hayes have said. Prison visiting committees can be useful but we need reformation of the system.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I too welcome the Minister to the House. He is mentioned so frequently here that he must have a permanent red ear.I have some background knowledge of the prison system. I was not on a prison visiting committee nor was I a prison inmate but in my former career I spent some time working in prisons. Prison visiting committees are a necessary part of the prison structure and they play an active role. Having said that they do need to modernise their brief and remit. We now have a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who takes on board that challenge and commitment. He is a reforming Minister and we will see more of those reforms.The legislation and the remit that prison visiting committees will have in the future need to be more reflective of our society. Some valid points have been made on the opposite side of the House. Mr. Justice Kinlen is undertaking a review at the moment of the whole prison area. In that context he will also review prison visiting committees. We should not be too quick to pre-empt the reform that is under way but should wait until the review comes forth. I am confident the Minister will bring reform before the House for implementation before long.

Mr. Justice Kinlen's brief was established in April 2002 and I am not aware of any interim report from him. The motion before us tonight is a little tongue in cheek in the sense that there is merit in it, but it is disingenuous in that there are political overtones coming from the other side of the House. Whereas I want to support necessary reform, I do not support the tone of the motion.

I am sure it will be looked at as part of the review in progress at the moment. People can apply to be appointed to prison visiting committees.

I accept the need for modernisation. I have total confidence that this Minister will modernise the prisons service and the training programmes. There is no doubt but that it must move forward just as we must in many other areas for which we are responsible.To pre-empt the reform would be a mistake. Fine Gael's motion has made some clear points which actually weaken the motion because while its members recognise the positive aspects of the visiting committees and are concerned at certain aspects, they are also deploring it and demanding more. We cannot have it every way. While I support certain aspects of the motion I cannot support the motion as currently constituted. I am happy to support the amended motion put forward by the Government.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	253	The Fine Gael motion is a good one which I and my Labour Party colleagues support. It is a good idea that those appointed to prison visiting committees should have relevant expertise such as legal, medical, trade union, employment or education expertise. I would make an even more extensive list of relevant experience than that proposed by Fine Gael.In reply to Senator Walsh I point out that a committee member would not require a degree. The relevant section of the motion refers to skills. People do not require a business degree to have business skills. I agree with the requirement that people would be from the local area. The Labour Party has been looking for that reform for some time. We do not want prison visiting committee members to only serve on them for the expenses. In terms of expertise and what people can bring to the committee it would be better if the members were from the local area with local expertise and an interest in the locality. What happens in a prison in Clondalkin, for example, will be of more interest to a person living in the area. One restriction that could be imposed is that people should not be on a visiting committee outside of their province. Then we would not have someone from a county such as County Kerry coming to visit a prison in Dublin.The idea of advertising vacancies for committees is important. It is more open and would encourage people to consider becoming involved in this area. It also gives the message that it is a positive aspect of voluntary work in which to become involved.Comments have been made about Fine Gael's motivation in bringing forward the motion. The party is being upfront and not saying its track record is better than anyone else's in this regard.

This would be a good reform. Everybody had the notion that the Minister would be a breath of fresh air, that he would be reforming and different from old-style politics. Why will he not take this on when he has the opportunity do so? I would have thought that this would be an issue close to his heart. This is an opportunity for the Minister to take the initiative. Although the suggestion has been made by Fine Gael, I do not see the reason the Minister cannot bring forward these new reforms.I agree with the suggestion in the motion that it would be a good idea for the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to be involved with the Minister in making these decisions. We should have an overall review of the system, in particular the value of prison visiting committees, to see how we can improve it.

I identify somewhat with Senator Minihan's point about the tone of the language used in the motion, which is slightly surprising in the factual matrix from which it emerges. If we get to the point of recognising, being concerned, deploring and making demands, the question is when did this moral insight suddenly strike with such forceful clarity that it requires such language to be used?On the other hand, I accept that Senators speaking in support of the motion have, in general terms, been fair in their description of the matter and have not behaved like another individual whom I shall not name, for charity's sake only, who announced to the media that he would harry, pursue and humiliate me in public until his own letter writing indicated that he was very much a poacher turned gamekeeper at a very late stage in the whole enterprise. I will not say any more because I wish to be constructive and when we get into political point scoring, we do not do ourselves any good collectively.I will begin by outlining the provenance of the 1925 legislation. It is interesting to note that it was introduced by the then Minister for Justice, Kevin O'Higgins, whose title was Minister for Home Affairs. He introduced it in circumstances which were quite interesting because, up to then, prison visiting committees provided for some jails and institutions were appointed by local authorities or grand juries, on the one hand, or directly politically, on the other.The Minister justified the legislation to the Oireachtas at the time as a measure necessary because of the disappearance of certain institutions such as the grand jury. It is interesting to note that both the then leader of the Labour Party, Thomas Johnson, and the then Minister actually spoke strongly on the basis that existing and former Deputies and Senators would be eligible for appointment to these bodies. I say this lest anyone think that there was, in the dim and distant past, a highly apolitical system which has degraded in recent years into something radically different. This does not appear to be the case. The Act actually makes provision for Senators and Deputies to be appointed to the committees.It is also interesting to note that in the debate at the time Thomas Johnson proposed that there should be at least two women, in the case of a women's prison, and a medical doctor, in the case of each institution, on every committee. For various reasons these proposals did not find favour. In fact, there were no women's prisons at the time as women were incarcerated in wings of men's prisons. The Minister of the day explained that most men would find it embarrassing to serve on a prison visiting committee because they might find themselves at variance with the prison doctor and in some professional embarrassment. It is also interesting to note that there was to be no remuneration – it was to be high-minded service not motivated by any more venial consideration.Since being appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have been concerned by the public perception that prison visiting committee appointments are made with a view to maximising tax free income for the recipients rather than on other criteria. As a consequence, whereas I have not engaged in a wholesale bloodletting in regard to the appointments that have come up for renewal, I have been careful to ensure that, of the appointments I have made afresh, that they come from the county in which the institution is located or an adjoining county.I have, on occasion, though not in every case by any manner of means, reallocated members from more distant prisons to ones closer to them. The reason I do this is that in the spirit of the Act somebody should be available, not merely for monthly meetings, but also for random visits and that it should be the right and entitlement, as it clearly is under the statute and the rules made under it, of members to present themselves when they are not expected to make sure all is in order in the prison. It seems prima facie that the closer one is to a prison the better position one is in, subject to the remarks made about not being exposed to local embarrassment in carrying out one's duties. Subject to this and living in the kind of society we do, it seems the policy I have adopted in regard to the new persons I am appointing is correct and that it is desirable that persons should, in general terms, be appointed to prisons not too distant from their own homes.Looking at the provisions of the Act in regard to reports, it does not seem that there is any basis on which they can or should be suppressed for any period of time or kept locked in a departmental drawer. It is required that they are made publicly available to anyone who wishes to see them, which is a good idea.It has been suggested that prison visiting committees are somewhat of an anachronism bearing in mind that we now have a prisons' inspector, Mr. Justice Kinlen, the first person to be appointed to this position which currently has no statutory function. In the fullness of time, his position will require statutory underpinning, an issue to which I intend to give my attention as soon as the other very pressing matters in the justice portfolio allow me to do so.In Britain, where a statutory inspectorate has existed for some time, prison visiting committees were not abolished and the two systems were left to operate in tandem. The mere fact that there is another way of appointing a prisons watchdog on behalf of the public does not mean we would have to get rid of the prison committee system in the future were we to give a statutory basis to the activities of the Inspector of Prisons, who at present is operating on a non-statutory basis.Mr. Justice Kinlen wrote to me recently and indicated that he is concerned about racism in Irish prisons, an issue about which I am concerned and on which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, through the prisons service, commissioned a report, which I hope to publish soon. I am concerned about this matter and I have replied to Mr. Justice Kinlen asking him to draw to my attention any instances of racism he comes across in the course of his duty. The most recently published report of the Irish Prisons Service, for the year 2001 – the report for 2002 should be available in the near future – shows that a significant number, approximately 14%, of prison occupants are non-EU nationals. If there is an indication of racism, it is something I take seriously.Senators will be aware that Amnesty International recently asked for access to our prisons to carry out research. The reason I refused this request is that, having advertised for a project on this issue to be carried out by an independent body and having awarded the contract, I did not then propose to put in place a competing Amnesty International and Irish Penal Reform Trust study to simultaneously traverse the same territory. However, I have indicated to the Irish Penal Reform Trust that I will be quite happy for it to carry out a follow-up study in relation to the racism issue when the report is published and when we are in a position to act upon it.We need a new statute for prisons. In case Members think I am delaying on this subject, there were proposals that the prisons service be put on a statutory basis and there was an internal debate as to whether the probation and welfare service should be set up as part of the same statutory series of bodies or be entirely separate. The view previously expressed was that the probation and welfare service should be separate. I am not so convinced about that. Regardless of how good are people's intentions, if one sets up bodies under statute and gives them functions, they are inclined to be careful about their own patch.There is, to some extent, a public interest in welding the probation and welfare service with the prisons service, rather than making them into competing snouts at the Exchequer trough. When money is put into the general areas of rehabilitation, it should not be the subject of undue competition between two separate agencies which are not co-ordinating their activities to the best extent. This is not to say that I propose to subjugate the probation and welfare service to the prisons service, which is larger. It is merely to say that there is an argument to be made for looking at them as two bodies whose activities should be co-ordinated, with a common intelligence driving their activities, rather than having two separate organisational structures and two separate sets of policies, one for incarceration and the other devoted to rehabilitation in the aftermath of punishment.I am not sure I am attracted to the notion of advertising for prison visiting committees. On the occasions when I have gone hunting for people to put on committees – this is not often necessary because one sometimes finds oneself inundated with people wanting to be appointed – I have found that many people who are offered positions are reluctant to take them because of the interference the duties will cause in their own lives. Advertising positions carries with it the implication that one would have to carefully assess everyone who applies and ask why they are doing so.I am not sure it is a good idea that prison visitors should possess, as preconditions, skills in administration, law, criminology, human rights, social work, education and medicine. A criminologist who applies to be on a prison visiting board is, in some sense, using the prison board to test out his own ideas and to be an activist. Do we want people who have an agenda coming into prisons rather than people who have the statutory agenda, although this may need review, to do the best for the prisoners and to bring an ordinary person's common sense approach to the issues? Do we want people with pre-existing theories or a political or sociological agenda to apply?As Senator Henry stated, there has been a dramatic improvement in the area of prison supervision. The picture she painted of the women's prison she visited is in dramatic contrast to the Dóchas centre that exists now. I have already visited a number of prisons and intend to see them all. No matter how one organises a prison, it is, by no means, as the more credulous readers of some newspapers are persuaded, a holiday camp. By the same token, in relation to such things as education, counselling, diet and occupational training, the transformation which is taking place in our prisons service deserves fair recognition. On the debit side, I confess that when I visited two prisons early in my tenure and discovered the real nature of the padded cells and their use, I was so taken aback by that experience that I immediately decided that they would have to end.I have already taken action, although it will not have instant effect, to end the use of padded cells in prisons. There are other things on the debit side which people might find much more serious, For example, I have no hesitation in saying I found slopping out by prisoners, many of whom are occupying cells on a multiple basis, degrading. I am doing my best to ensure that, instead of waiting for some ultimate reform of the entire structure of our prisons over a period, every possible step is taken as a matter of urgency to introduce in-cell sanitation. Some Senators may be aware that when Mountjoy Prison was originally built, sanitation facilities were provided in every cell. It was not a very satisfactory system because it entailed having continuous running water through a privy in the corner of every cell. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that the Victorians could install a system of in-cell sanitation while in the beginning of the 21st century we are told there is a technological or financial barrier to putting modern sanitation into prison cells. That is a bad thing.I welcome the fact that this motion has been tabled this evening. I echo Senator Minihan's question mark about its slightly ringing and declamatory tone bearing in mind that, as Senator Terry said, we were waiting 21 years. During much of that time parties who have spoken tonight in support of this motion were in office and did nothing to address the issue, not even to the modest extent that I have done in the few months I have been in office.If there is a perception that these positions are to be held by people who ought to be tame, house-trained, unobservant and docile members of prison committees instead of independent members, I will not use the term "deplore" but I am unhappy with people feeling that is what is expected of them by me, as Minister. I want to see any criticism of our prisons service, that is reasonable, intelligent and constructive, and not agenda driven. I do not want to see anodyne reports furnished to me which do not even correspond with my own impressions of visiting a prison as Minister. I do not want to have less observant reports put in annually than I would make if I committed my own thoughts to writing in the course of a visit. It does not impress me. Just in case anybody listening to this debate is a member of a prison visiting committee it would not incline me to re-appoint a person who had been unobservant or convenient in their own mind or who lacked independence in relation to the work done. Therefore, if people want to be re-appointed – I am not inviting them to go wild with criticism or whatever – they do not do me any favour by being unduly docile.Having said that I pay tribute to the people who serve on these committees. They do useful work. In our political system in Ireland, there are very few positions handed out on a discretionary basis by any Minister. Sometimes it is right to recognise the contribution people make to democratic life through party politics by not disqualifying them or being overly sensitive to the point of refusing to appoint them to bodies, purely because they are involved in the democratic political process.

I have put my mind to wondering how best that could be dealt with. One possibility would be to cap the amount of expenses anybody could get. Another possibility is to do what I am doing, that is, to ensure travelling expenses will be reduced because people tend to be clustered in institutions. A third possibility is to replace expenses completely and to pay a flat allowance, although the Revenue Commissioners would doubtless tax it if it is not seen as expenses. Nonetheless, there would be no incentive for people to seek appointment to institutions solely for the purpose of maximising their expenses. No doubt, there are other possibilities as to how it can be done but I share Senator Terry's view that at a time when there is financial pressure on the prisons service in every direction, it is not acceptable that valuable resources should be spent unnecessarily on travelling expenses. We do not live in circumstances where there is money for everything and there are huge financial constraints on what is being done. I think I can claim with some degree of credibility to be the first Minister to have taken some steps in the right direction. Therefore, I welcome the moral support which the Fine Gael Party is offering me on this matter.

That is a remarkable provision for its time. I believe the committee system should be encouraged. Some of the prescribed activities for prisoners have largely been taken over by the probation and welfare service. One of the functions of the prison visiting committee was to arrange interesting lectures and entertainment. There are not many people who would like to undertake that obligation in relation to a large prison. Others are to ensure, for example, that people on release are introduced to prisoners' aid societies. While that was well intentioned it is now a high-minded way of dealing with matters. We should acknowledge that the probation and welfare service should carry out that kind of function as of right for every prisoner, rather than have it done by grace and favour of the members of a prison visiting committee. I do not want to throw out the baby with the bath water. There is some rather murky bath water in this particular tub. I do not want to get rid of the idea but I do not want to make it unduly complicated.For example, I do not want hearings before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on the suitability of any person. Who in their right mind would undergo such a process except somebody who is a zealot with a mission, which would make them suspect in the first place? Who would expose themselves to being torn apart or having their credentials and their party affiliations carefully questioned by a group of politicians if they were not going to be remunerated for the position? Most people with intelligence would not go through some ritual humiliation that is not required.What we need are people with common sense and intellectual integrity and who are of independent spirit to become members of these bodies and report fairly about what they observe. There is no point going on one of these committees if one has wholly unreasonable expectations about what, bearing in mind the budgetary restrictions involved, the governor and the staff of a prison can do. There is no point turning one's committee into a participant in a civil war in public administration if the result is that people in my position and officials of the prisons service end up regarding the committee as the enemy rather than as something which is there to help. We must take a balanced approach.The underlying inspiration of tonight's motion, if not its linguistic tone, is that prison visiting committees are a valuable resource and that this House, presumably through the Fine Gael motion or the Government amendment, is inviting me to strengthen and develop the system of prison visiting committees and to make them as effective as possible in discharging their functions and to avoid any tendency to make appointments which might discredit them. That is advice which I willingly take on board as representing the consensus of all the contributions made this evening. In that broad, liberal, cross-party spirit, I prefer the language of the Government amendment, although I do not entirely dispute some of the points made, even in such arched tones, by Fine Gael.I understand the House wants me to return to discuss crime, which I will do. I apologise if, on this occasion, I am being unduly wet and non-combative. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that I only got three or four hours' sleep in the past 48 hours as a result of flying around the country. On that point, I thank the House very sincerely for the good wishes it sent to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and me for the enterprise in which we are engaged. Without breaching any secrets or making any inappropriate remarks, the time spent at Hillsborough during the past 48 hours was time well spent.I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to address the House on this subject. Some of the points in this motion are well made, while others are better made in the Government amendment. In that cross-party spirit, I ask the House to support the Government amendment.

I am glad our good wishes were conveyed to him.In the House last week, members of the Minister's party expressed concern and demanded better management systems and more financial accountability in the health service. I presume the same applies to the area of justice, particularly as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a member of the Progressive Democrats. On his appointment, he was cast in the role of a reforming Minister – a role he was glad to accept. He now has the opportunity to do something positive.I welcome his contribution and the fact he has acknowledged that he is not prepared to stand over and is not satisfied with the figures and statistics so ably provided by Senator Terry in proposing this motion. The figures were certainly damning. Senator Terry also outlined what visiting committees should be doing. Are they performing the duties with which they are charged? The Minister did not address that issue.We are not asking for university professors to be appointed, we are requesting that people with skills in the areas outlined in the motion be called upon. The Minister hit the nail on the head when he said we need decent, upright people with common sense. I was delighted to hear there is a difference between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.

We were forced to remain here until 3 a.m. to debate the legislation. The Senator said there was a danger that democracy and confidence in politics would be eroded by motions such as this. I suggest that what happened yesterday was a greater negation of democracy than anything else we have witnessed in this House for some time.A number of excellent suggestions were made and I am glad the Minister is prepared to accept them and that he might even be prepared to appoint people from this side of the House.

The motion and amendment recognise that an excellent contribution has been made by the visiting committees regarding the welfare and protection of prisoners' rights throughout the State. I had the pleasure of serving on such a committee in the late 1970s. This motion contains an undertone – whether or not people on the other side accept it – that this is some type of gravy train. While I was working in the Mater Hospital and living in Drumcondra, I was appointed to St. Patrick's Institution. I am feeling somewhat cheated that no bonanza of expenses existed in those days.I have always felt such committees are very worthwhile. I achieved a great deal of personal satisfaction in that one is seen as someone who can play a meaningful role in the lives of people who have fallen foul of the system. It was acknowledged and accepted that even though the committee was part of the bureaucracy of the prison system, it was still a body of people to whom prisoners could look for assistance. The committee was the catalyst which enabled people to convey their point of view.The motion also seeks greater transparency regarding political appointments. I do not understand from where this has come given that Members stated in their contributions that they are happy with the Minister of the day making the judgment call on those appointed to such positions. I am sure he receives assistance and recommendations when making these appointments and that he takes into account the diversity of background of the people involved. That is the case in relation to some of the people already appointed to such positions.A great deal of play is made of people from Kerry and Cork sitting on committees in Dublin. I do not think that is a dreadful thing. Not everybody in a prison in Dublin comes from Dublin, they come from all over the country. A prisoner from Galway grew very attached to me during my time on the visiting committee. I was a source of comfort to him. He saw me as someone who came from a similar background and latched on to me. I am not saying that is the case in all instances but there is a good chance that a prisoner from Kerry will find a way to make contact with a Kerry man serving on a visiting committee in Mountjoy Jail.

#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I am not suggesting that would be the case. Let us look at the appointments made by the Minister since taking office. Since the end of October, the Minister has appointed six people to Arbour Hill, three from Dublin and three from other regions. That is a 50% representation from the Dublin region. That, in my opinion, is a fair proportion. Great play was also made of the €600,000 expended in the first ten months of 2002. There are currently 200 people on visiting committees. If we take the €600,000 figure over 12 months, that works out at €3,300 per person. Some people are not claiming but most of them are. A sum of €3,300 per annum is not a massive amount to pay those who drive from all areas of the country using their own petrol and car having taken a day's leave from work and, perhaps, losing a day's pay. I am surprised, given those payments, that so many people put themselves forward for positions on such committees.

We are also told of the political bias in regard to such appointments. All parties do this. Senator Hayes was honest enough to admit it is something all parties do. It may not be the best way to do things but I am sure the Opposition has many good people it could appoint to such committees just as we have.

He also stated that many people were appointed not to committees of prisons geographically convenient to them but as far away as possible. The same person was reported in a letter in a newspaper as suggesting a good friend of his from west Cork might be appointed to a position in north Dublin or further north if possible. We are merely looking for consistency.

Ordinary people make up juries. They are the ones who put many of the people into our prisons. Why then should they not be good enough to adjudicate on their welfare while they serve their sentence? I do not agree with that point. I welcome this debate. Debate is always good and if the system is reformed as a result of our contributions that, too, is good. I do not say everything about visiting committees is perfect, it is not. There will always be need for reform and strengthening of positions.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I congratulate Senator Terry on tabling this opportune motion. I listened on my monitor to the Minister when he said he hoped this debate would be constructive and that there would not be point scoring. There must be a maturity in the Seanad which does not express itself in the Dáil. Having read the debate on the justice motion regarding alcohol tabled last week by Fine Gael I do not think the same constructive tenor applied. The Minister came across as arrogant, particularly in the way he admonished those from other parties, particularly younger Members, for expressing points of view. He used soundbites such as "Horlicks" while the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, used the words "Complan" and "crackers". The Minister was acting as a senior counsel and expressing himself as if he was in more hallowed places such as the Four Courts.The Minister seems to be grappling with the issue of prison visiting committees, which is timely. It would be a measure of respect for the motion, which reflects much of the Government viewpoint, if Members opposite supported it. There is concern, in the House and among all political parties, that appointments to the committees seem to be made to maximise the distance members must travel to the prison they serve. With regard to Arbour Hill Prison, three of the 11 members of the committee live in County Dublin while eight live over 200 kilometres away. With regard to Cork Prison, three of the 11 members live in County Cork while six must travel more than 200 kilometres. With regard to the Curragh, two of the 11 members live in County Kildare while six must travel more than 200 kilometres, which is common because the famous Minister for zero tolerance, Deputy O'Donoghue, appointed probably the highest number of criminologists within the prison visiting service. He dispensed his largesse throughout County Kerry. South Kerry is 200 kilometres from many of the prisons involved.

#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I am not saying anybody from County Kerry would be involved. There are plenty of places closer to home such as Limerick Prison and Spike Island to accommodate them. As Senator Kett said, he was accommodated in a prison in Dublin, where he served.In the year this measure was introduced, 1925, Stalin removed Trotsky from his power base in Russia, Tennessee banned the teaching of the theory of evolution, drink driving became an offence, the first traffic lights were erected in Piccadilly, William Butler Yeats sat in this Chamber, Hitler's Nazi Party disavowed violence and Germany signed the Locarno pact promising never to invade France. This issue was revisited in the Prison Visiting Committee Act 1972, some 31 years ago. The motion is, therefore, timely and constructive.The Minister should look further. On 20 December 1998 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, then Attorney General, made a scathing attack on the prisons service. He said prison officers were holding the State to ransom, overtime was out of control and the prison system was a scandal. He said only political determination would bring this to an end. He now has the opportunity to put this into effect. When will we have a new prisons Bill to deal with this area?The Minister is eight months in office. Members know of the pre-election commitment for 2,000 extra gardaí on which we await developments. We would like more action from the Minister. I will not highlight other issues regarding the breakdown of law and order because they have been highlighted often in this House. However, much of the Minister's profile is based on chasing immigrants and Operation Hyphen. He is excellent with soundbites on issues such as these but, if he wants to prove himself in his position, he will need to do something more tangible to deal with crime. He has the opportunity which his experience as Attorney General will support.An excessive amount of legislation passes through this House while the people are crying out for action from the Minister and the Government. I trust action will be taken. I do not want to return to points made by previous speakers with regard to justification as they were well made. This is a constructive motion. I hope some of the points made within it will be reflected in the Minister's future thinking. He has already started in that direction with his earlier comment that he is considering the appointment of prison visiting committees to which he is appointing people from adjoining geographical areas, which is a constructive move.The other points made were well expressed in Senator Terry's motion which I call on the Government side of the House to support. I am confident that it will. Members opposite understand that it will help to spread respect for this Chamber.A Senator mentioned harbour authorities. I know a lot about the one in my area.

Not alone will he be a reforming Minister but a dedicated one also. The Prison Visiting Committee Act was introduced in 1925 by the then Minister, Deputy Kevin O'Higgins. It was set up to be an independent prison watchdog on behalf of the public and a defender of offenders' rights. Senators Walsh and Kitt have outlined the areas covered by the Act and I am satisfied that the needs of prisoners are met and understood.Prison visiting committees are to meet once per month. When I was carrying out research for this debate, I contacted some board members and asked when they would meet. I discovered that meetings were held midweek or early on a Saturday morning. I applaud the dedication of committee members. Civil Service rates for travel expenses are not great and I am not sure that I would leave a job midweek to travel to one of those boards, or get up early at the weekend. Committee members should be commended.I am perplexed by the Fine Gael motion, although I am fond of Senator Terry. She and I have asked on several occasions on the Order of Business for the Minister to come to the House to discuss juvenile crime and the level of beatings and muggings of our youth. However, I do not understand the reasoning behind the motion. Fine Gael had a similar motion in the other House last week where Deputy Richard Bruton sought information. The party is, perhaps, trying to work very hard and point out inadequacies but I do not see any with regard to this motion. There must be very little wrong if Fine Gael is highlighting this aspect of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's portfolio.Senator Brian Hayes mentioned the appointment to prison visiting committees of people who live far from prisons and I was glad to hear the Minister's response. The Minister does not act on his own, but as part of a Cabinet which makes a collective decision. There are two parties in Government. Senator Hayes pointed out that one third of the members of prison visiting committees are political appointees.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	327	At least one third.

Senators Terry, Henry and Tuffy have referred to political hacks criss-crossing the country to collect expenses. I would hate to think that the Senators would classify councillors as political hacks. All Senators know that councillors are the people who work hardest in the community. I do not need to remind Opposition Members that they are quick to defend councillors when they are criticised in this House.

The Minister has outlined why he would not like criminologists and similar people to be on the boards. The areas of education and medicine are covered by the prison service. We all know that prisoners can be very well educated after they have finished their prison sentences.I would like to leave this motion aside for a moment to highlight some of the constructive areas that have been covered in the area of justice. Some 900 extra prison places have been created by this Government and its predecessor. When the former Minister, Nora Owen, was responsible for this area between 1995 and 1997—
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Does this relate to prison visiting committees?

I refer to the coalition that was led by Fine Gael. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, might confirm that the relevant figure is now about 7%.

Can I point out the importance of the visiting committees? They had an important role when Nora Owen was Minister, as they highlighted overcrowding and drug problems in the prisons. One does not hear of such problems today as a consequence of the good leadership of this Government. There would be an outcry from the Opposition if we were to abolish prison visiting committees in the morning.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	339	The Senator must be joking. Does she want to test us?

My interpretation of the 1925 Act is that any person may apply for a place on a prison visiting committee. I cannot give names, but I assure the House that I know of one or two eminent people, who are not politicians and are not associated with any political party, who have served on such committees. It gives me great pleasure to support the Government's amendment to this motion.

While I welcome a number of the points made by the Minister, I would like to raise some other issues. The Minister has said that he favours retaining the inspector and the visiting committees, but I am concerned that there may be some conflict between them if they are doing the same job. I asked the Minister if he does not trust the visiting committees to do the work they are supposed to do, but he did not answer. Why is an inspector needed if he trusts the committees? I welcome the fact that the inspector has pointed out to the Minister that there is a problem with racism in the prisons. We have heard that prisons have had to segregate prisoners because of racism. I wonder if the issue has been raised by any of the visiting committees? It is a serious indictment of the committees if this problem has not been raised.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	371	Perhaps I will have to rethink my position in relation to the inspector. The Minister has already taken the steps to implement some of the suggested reforms by appointing people from the county in which prisons are situated or from adjacent counties. That is a welcome development. I ask him to continue making such reforms and to publish the prisons service Bill that he states is necessary. It is inefficient and ineffective to have people criss-crossing the country. I am glad the Minister accepts that and is prepared to make the necessary change.I fully support what Senator Henry said about the need for the visiting committees to publish their reports in order that we can peruse them. The Minister stated that they are available on request, but why not publish them? They should be published on an annual basis, or at least presented to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. I will be asking the Minister to supply them to me.I welcome the fact that the Minister is open to receiving applications for positions on visiting committees.

These people will not have to be followers or supporters of the Government. If they were all Government supporters, a good service would not be delivered and the committees would be at one regarding how things work in the prisons.The Minister called for the prisons service Bill to be published when he was a mere Deputy. Now that he is a Minister, I call on him to publish it as soon as possible because it is urgent and necessary in order to bring in the reforms we have outlined in our motion. I know he supports these reforms and I call on every Senator to support the motion.

In a sense it is a contradictory position that he now wants me to force another provision on local authorities rather than leave the decision to them. The Senator knows very well that the waiver system has worked for many years. I am not proposing to undermine the position as it exists. It would be wrong of me to take the action the Senator wants in the context of this Bill. It is important that the system of waivers operates in an unfettered way. The decision is taken locally and it should remain so. I will not accept this amendment.

It is a further erosion of the powers of local authority members, a step backwards to the dark ages for local democracy.

The next step will be the construction of the incinerator without consulting local people. We are a democracy and we believe—

It was very high-handed of the Minister. In 100 years of local government there has never been such an erosion of the powers of the elected members. This is shameful and disgraceful.The Local Government Act 2001 was hailed as a wonderful document because we thought it would create better local government and more powers to the locally elected members and that there would be a real decentralisation of powers and reform of local government. This Bill is quite contrary to that. It is eroding the powers of the elected members and bringing in more stealth taxes. The Bill proposes to give county managers the sole power to impose refuse charges. It is the greatest con job imposed on local authorities for many years, a huge attack on local democracy.The Minister has cut funding and he has now cut power. He is on a loser on this issue. A great opportunity to implement some real reform in local government management was lost. The Bill suggests that councillors are incapable and cannot be trusted with the overall responsibility of a council and the Minister has given this power to managers.His predecessor introduced an amendment which at the time was only to last for three years, in order to accommodate some of the people putting together the regional waste management plans. The elected members listened to their constituents and in a few cases made better proposals than the people who put together the plans. The proposals from the members for the minimising and recycling of waste would not be as damaging to the environment. Incineration is more dangerous than landfill.It was always the case that officials were accountable to councillors and councillors were accountable to the citizens. This ensured that the views of the people were taken into account at every opportunity. This section threatens the future of democracy. Local self-government is the very basis of democracy and the Minister has thrown it out the window. The State wants to be responsible for everything and yet deliver very little. That has been the case since this Minister took office. He has introduced legislation that has eroded the powers of elected members.There is dissatisfaction among councillors. Members of this House on the opposite side said they were voting for the Bill against their will, that they were coerced into voting for the Government because the whip was imposed.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	389	My party also opposes this section, my views on which are well known. I have a fundamental difficulty with any move that would lead to the denigration of the role of the councillor. That role is already restricted and limited enough and that is the view of many councillors across the political divide throughout the country. It is one of the perennial issues which councillors raise.Councillors go to the county manager and advise the manager so that he will make a favourable decision. That is the executive function being exercised. I am not suggesting that managers are not making decisions based on what they perceive to be the wisest choice. This is an issue of critical significance to councillors. The proposal to transform the imposition of a waste collection charge from a reserved function to an executive function is a retrograde step.We had a good debate in the House earlier in relation to where local government is going, the dual mandate and the role and functions of councillors and councils. This section goes against the spirit of what was a very healthy debate.I know many local authorities have had difficulties in trying to agree a particular fee for waste collection. This led to internal party splits and in some cases councils being threatened with abolition, as happened in Dublin. That is democracy and if democracy is to mean anything then an issue such as this, no matter how much we do not agree with the outcome, is consequential.I saw a flyer about the Dublin issue being handed about last week. It contained a quote from the present Minister from a time when it was an issue in Waterford in 1990 or 1991.

The councillor from Waterford was being gung-ho but that in itself is local democracy at work. The fact that people can take these stances in regard to decisions is what local democracy is all about. One of my biggest fears in regard to this section is that waste collection charges next year will be much higher than they are this year, and there is a significant increase this year on last year. Apart from the issue of waste, if one considers the revenue associated with it, we will be funding benchmarking and, therefore, more money will be required next year. Managers will be able to set whatever charge they like and council members will not be able to do anything about it. That is a retrograde step for local government. Any reasonable person, particularly those who have had dealings with local councillors, would agree with that statement.My party and I oppose this legislation. I ask the Minister to reconsider the issue because it is pushing the role of councillors further down the agenda. Under this section, the role of councillors is being denigrated, which is not healthy for democracy. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the provision.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	394	This section is a retrograde step for local democracy. To hand over this power to county managers and take it away from locally elected representatives is a retrograde step. I do not know how the Minister will implement these proposals. He said on Second Stage that he will decide the charge commensurate with what people can pay. This leads me to believe that when the Bill is passed he will call in all the county managers and decide on a national waste policy, rather than letting each local authority make its own decision. He also said that local authorities were not nearly reaching what was expected of them in regard to waste management.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	401	Some local authorities have advanced more than others by using their own resources and by borrowing. They have received no help from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Minister's predecessor levied a charge of €25 per tonne of waste dumped at landfill sites, which has gone into the State's coffers.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	402	It has gone into the environment—
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	403	Only a small amount of it has come back out. The 15 cent levy on plastic bags has been very successful. All this money should have been channelled out, including extra funding. Local authorities are strapped for cash and cannot make progress, yet the Minister had the audacity on Second Stage to blame public representatives for a lack of recycling facilities and a proper waste management system throughout the country. It is as a result of a lack of funding. The Minister is now handing over responsibility to county managers who will impose hefty penalties on the public. In light of what the Minister has said, he will call them in and demand this.A proper waste management plan for the whole country will require proper funding which the Department of the Environment and Local Government must provide. I am very disappointed by the avenue the Minister is going down. The majority of local authorities have passed regional waste management plans. A Senator, who is a member of a local authority, said they have gone down that road. The Minister is now giving the ultimate power to county managers and no one other than him will be able to question their decisions. He will be able to call in county managers and tell them what to do. What will happen if a county manager cannot borrow without the imprimatur of members of the local authority? If local authority members will not sanction borrowing, will the Minister for Finance provide funding? Will county managers have the power to introduce a poll tax? We will not be able to describe it in any way other than a poll tax. It appears from what the Minister is proposing in the Bill that he is getting the county managers to implement a scheme to sort out the waste management problem. There is no doubt the problem needs to be sorted out, but he will allow county managers to use a heavy hand in relation to the matter. What will happen if local authority members do not allow county managers to borrow money?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	404	The comments of Opposition Senators almost fill me with despair because this is the sort of argument to which I have been listening throughout the country for the past ten years. The trouble with the argument is that there is not a semblance of leadership emerging either from the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party on these issues. Both parties know that the law of this land and the European directives make it quite clear that the polluter pays principle is what underpins the waste management strategy. All parties supposedly signed up to this, which means that each individual is responsible for the cost of disposing of his or her waste.

No Minister has given more time to this House recently and when I respond to Senators, I know what the issues are. The Senator berated me about his own county the other day. However, I did some research and found that all the issues he brought up were the responsibility of his own inertia and ineptitude when making decisions locally. He came into this House and blamed me for not providing funding. I am the first to acknowledge that councillors made difficult and fair decisions on waste management.

The Senator and his colleagues write to me each day seeking money for X, Y and Z facilities. My Department and I are willing to put enormous resources into this strategy.Senator Burke referred to the €15 million paid out last Christmas when I disposed of the entire fund. I am happy to confirm that the fund is now more than €50 million. Every penny will be disbursed to local authorities in coming months. Out of the €15 million in funding I provided to the local authorities last year, less than €3 million has been drawn down. I cannot get them to take the money.We need to bring reality to this debate. All the regional authorities have introduced the integrated waste management strategies based on a hierarchical system, which is recognised by the best environmentally friendly countries to be the one we should adopt. Senator Bannon suggests that I will visit incineration on the public. I will not.

These are prevention and minimisation, recycling, landfill and thermal treatment or incineration. That is now in place and the Senator need not think that after years of struggle to achieve it I will allow every local authority to overturn it by the end of the year as they engage in fancy footwork in anticipation of the local elections next year.Members of the public are fed up with the hogwash uttered by the Senator in the House. They know there is a crisis and they want technological and cost-effective solutions.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	413	The Senator is part of the local government system that has put these plans in place. When I was appointed Minister last summer an option put before me was the immediate establishment of the national waste management board. I could have done that but it would have meant a delay of another two or three years during which more reports would be commissioned and more appeals would be made. I decided not to proceed on that basis but to give the issue the political leadership it deserves. The people elected us into Government on that basis.That is what underpins this strategy. We do not have the time or the luxury to restart these debates. We must deliver a facility to the satisfaction of the people to ensure that their environment, which they cherish as much as I do, is left in the kind of condition they expect for the next generation. That will not be done by talking hogwash in this House or in council chambers throughout the country.There are over 1,400 bottle banks in the State and an additional 600 have been provided since I took office. Many local authorities are now proceeding with the segregation of waste and recycling. They are using the resources I am giving them. However, it should not be pretended to the public that these services are free. They are not. Waste management is expensive. I intend to proceed with charging by weight to provide that those who do not wish to do anything about waste will pay dearly for their inaction, while those who want to recycle will pay less. I hope the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party will support this strategy because it is the fairest way to deal with those who are concerned for the environment and want to make major decisions regarding the quality of their life.We have a strategy and a large number of local authorities are working hard to implement it. Senator Bannon may check to see how much money his local authority has drawn down. I told each local authority to provide me with projects on which they could immediately deliver. Despite guarantees that they would draw down the money immediately, I still have €50 million in the fund which I want to disburse. I also wish they would take out the €15 million in funding I have already allocated so we can proceed to the next stage.I must deal with the European Union, which is concerned that we are not obeying the laws, and I am working with local authorities to ensure they have the resources and the political leadership to proceed. It is a frustrating exercise. However, we are getting to the point where the waste issue will be resolved, in spite of those who see waste, and its importance as an issue, as nothing more than a political football. They have no real interest in those they represent. I will not allow them to obstruct me for as long as I am Minister for the Environment and Local Government.

#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I withdraw the word. The Minister has contacted all 28 local authority managers in the country and has pestered them to spend €15 million when they have only spent €3 million. I sympathise with his position, but part of the fault could lie with his Department. Heretofore, the Estimates for the local authorities were agreed in November or December of every year, but this year the Minister extended the date to allow local authorities complete their Estimates by the end of January 2003. That delayed their deliberations. It was a backward step.The meetings on local authority Estimates usually took place in March and April of each year. A former Minister for the Environment, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, decided to change that and provided that meetings on the Estimates would have to take place before the end of November or December each year. For some reason the date has been put back.I cannot understand why the Minister has been unable to get the county managers to spend the funding of €15 million he has provided. Mayo County Council spent €30 million on two landfill sites.

He now says he has another €50 million. It is ludicrous to blame the local authorities for this.The Minister has spoken rubbish because he has not a single proposal to put to any local authority. Yet he now proposes to give powers to the county managers to implement waste management plans that have been agreed and adopted by the regional authorities. That is being done. The county managers cannot be persuaded to spend any more than €3 million, yet they will be given more powers. Are they getting more power to do as they say or as they are instructed?

The Fine Gael contribution could be described as a waste of time, or more accurately, a time of waste. It is important that this side of the House should register its support for the Minister and that there is no equivocation about it. The Minister was described as "arrogant" in a phrase which has been withdrawn. He simply told the truth about this issue.There has been more damage done in the last 50 years to the environment than in all our recorded history. That damage has been caused by society which has a serious obligation to rectify it. The Minister spoke about what we must pass on to succeeding generations.There is an even more fundamental issue which is to do with the economy, our exports and the image of our food products. It is to do with the totality of the economic life of the country. It comes with a cost which we must bear. As a result of this evening's debate I never again want to hear rhetoric from the opposite side of the House about the need to protect our environment for tourism or as an absolute in its own right.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	421	Everything I have heard so far in this debate is a contradiction of the need for society as a whole to protect our environment or the need for the polluter to pay. The standards we are attempting to apply are ones which have been applied on the Continent. We must apply them here as we have no discretion about the matter. Even if we did have discretion we should still apply the standards.It is important that the Minister should know that some members of local authorities recognise the importance of what he is doing and the need for it. We must admit that there has been continuing vacillation by some members of local authorities. The only way forward is the way suggested by the Minister.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	422	Can the Minister dish out blame as he has done this evening and at the same time reconcile himself with the situation where people throughout the country, particularly in County Galway, are making a genuine effort to recycle? The Minister has never shown support for their endeavours. There is no market for the mountains of paper and cardboard for recycling. All that happens is that it is taken and dumped in Kill. The Minister's Department has never shown any initiative to cater for facilities where people have made an effort to recycle. Rehab is the only organisation to have shown some initiative and it has collected and segregated various types of waste. We all know of the debacle to do with glass recycling.The key to many of the difficulties local authority members have had is the identification of a landfill site. We know what happened in Ballinasloe, which provided the only landfill site for both Galway city and county. The licence to accommodate landfill there was extended by the Minister and his predecessors time after time. It is now a crisis. The work the local authority in Ballinasloe has done, in creating a new landfill concept, is a credit to it.The reason the members of Galway County Council rejected the Galway waste management and the Connacht waste management plans was simple. National consultants came to Galway and identified nine sites through a desk top process. They then made a shortlist of three. The suitability of these sites was questioned by everybody and is still under question.A group of councillors tried to encourage the consultants to come out and look at particular sites but they refused. The Minister should not imply that we were irresponsible or shirked our responsibility. The Minister knows why they refused to look at those sites. They were not even considered, not because they were not suitable but because the consultants thought better of other areas. As long as the Minister has and supports such an attitude he is distancing himself from local authority members and is creating a barrier to good local government. The sooner the Minister comes down from his pedestal the better.I do not know how many members of local authorities are present tonight but all of us cringe at what the Minister has said and is about to do. He intends to give the power to local managers who have already, through powers given by the Minister's predecessor, accepted the waste management plans against the wishes of the local authorities. The foundations are creaking. The Minister is not capable of redirecting positive local government.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	423	County Sligo signed up to the Connacht waste management plan a number of years ago in the belief the plan would be implemented. The only landfill site we had in the county at that time has now been closed. Since then we have been held to ransom between counties Donegal and Mayo and wherever else we have to take our waste. We have four licensed refuse collectors in the county who are paying €168 a tonne to dispose of it. A 25 tonne load would therefore cost over €4,000.Costs have risen substantially over the past few years. The last annual charge was €458 per annum. We did not go for the annual charge but decided to go for a bag system, €10 and €5 bags. As a result of introducing the bag system we cannot keep supplying bottle banks for people who wish to recycle their waste. We have no waiver system in the county either. Any county that has such a system is lucky.Some people are composting their waste. I was talking to a man with a family of six who manages to get three weeks' waste into one €10 bag because he breaks down the waste. That is the way forward. Waste management plans must be put in place for everybody's benefit because the costs are—

We are well aware that waste management is not at the level it should be. Successive Governments have not done what they should have done in this regard.Nobody on this side of the House made frivolous accusations. In speaking about this section let us refer to its fundamental aspect – that the power of councillors is being taken from them and given to county managers. The Minister is well aware that this is setting a very dangerous precedent. I urge him to look again at this section before we drive the role of the councillor further into the ground. This section of the Bill deals with the denigration of councillors, as any councillor across the range of councillors' organisations will testify.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	436	In reference to the comments about County Galway, it is only fair to say that the Department of the Environment and Local Governement has been very positive in helping our county, and indeed other counties. Environmental grants have been provided to tackle litter and the Department has had a role in the tidy towns competition. This should not be overlooked and it should be commended for the great work that has been done.Senator Ulick Burke may not have heard about the green town award. A town near where I live, Mountbellew, is to be awarded this honour. It is not true to say the Department has been negative when, in fact, it has been very positive in regard to environmental issues.Landfill proposals, by the private or public sector, have to go through the planning process and I am confident that this will happen in regard to Galway and the Connacht regional waste management plans.

The Minister has stamped on and smothered local government by taking powers away from the elected members and giving them to the manager, who is being allowed to dictate to them. Councillors are most vexed and angered by what is taking place. How would the Minister like it if officials from his Department took over and ran the Department of the Environment and Local Government?
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	440	Maybe that is what is happening.

The real problem with local government today is reform of the funding structures. The Minister has failed to recognise that. Successive Ministers in the Department took power from the local authority in regard to rates and other types of charges. These powers have been centralised and the Minister is continuing the process, which is shameful and disgraceful. This is not happening in any other country in Europe.It is time for the Minister to get his act together and give the power back to the local authorities. Local government must be decentralised. This is what is being demanded. We oppose this section tooth and nail.

There is no such thing as a free lunch. Either we recognise that there are laws which we must all adhere to, and that we are going to do something about the waste crisis or we are not.None of the Senators referred to the fact that they would not have much confidence in their own ability at Estimate time. The Estimates is the process that is the absolute reserved function of the members. I will be interested to see what Fine Gael and Labour will do when the charges are part and parcel of the Estimates process.

When we talk about waste management – and I have said this in my own area in Waterford and to people in the south east – they should be alert to the fact that investment in this country is going to be based substantially on those regions that have proper integrated waste management facilities. Companies are no longer able to come to a country unless it can deliver the waste management facilities which enable them to adhere to the law. The regions appear to want to talk about it until the cows come home, while Dublin and Cork are moving ahead. I am not from either of those counties.We now have a challenge and an opportunity to fully support the waste management plans that are fully adopted for each region. There is a massive economic spin-off not alone in terms of the environment but also for the food industry and all other areas of industry, which desperately need integrated waste management facilities so that they can survive. If we want investment we should remember that the basis of it will be proper integrated waste management facilities as one of the key elements. We should move away from the spurious arguments and deal with the issue properly.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I welcome the Minister of State, who was present on the last occasion I raised a matter on the Adjournment. I achieved some success on that occasion and I thank him. I hope he will be able to deliver for me again on this occasion.I seek a guarantee from the Minister of State that the school at Castaheany will be built and ready to accept pupils in September 2004. The people of Little Pace Paddocks were extremely disappointed that the school was not included in this year's building list. The people of the area have worked hard to get the school built. They live in a new area which has insufficient facilities to cater for their needs. These people have had to fight tooth and nail to get a temporary structure in place, but they fear it will become a permanent prefabricated school. That is not good enough for a growing area such as that to which I refer.The school recently received new prefabricated classrooms which will be adequate until September 2004, after which time they will need three more classrooms. Each year there has been a huge increase in the numbers enrolling in the school. By 2004, they will need 14 classrooms and, by 2005, they will need 17 classrooms. It is essential that the Mary Mother of Hope national school in Little Pace Paddocks is given the necessary funding to start construction in March 2004. As I said, the people are disappointed that it will not begin in March of this year.I ask that this school is made a priority because at present children are being housed in cramped conditions and they have no PE hall. There is no community centre in the area either. Such a centre will only be constructed when the school is built because a joint effort is being made by the Department of Education and Science and the local authority to provide it. In a very innovative development, the PE hall will also serve as a community centre. The school will not close down at 3 p.m., but will be available to the community. I hope the Minister of State will give me good news and will say the school will be ready and open by 2004.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I thank Senator Terry for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The Department's current position regarding the allocation of funding for school projects was outlined by the Minister some time ago and is available on the Department's website. In addition, the capital programme has been published. Full details regarding individual projects, including schools being provided with temporary accommodation, are available on the website. I accept that this seems somewhat cold. While I take on board the Senator's strong case regarding the lack of facilities and permanent versus prefabricated accommodation and the provision of an additional three classrooms, I am not in a position to tell her that this will definitely happen.The programme has been designed to give maximum information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects have also been published for the first time. This year's building programme amounts to €342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. I know the Senator will say that her area needs only a small percentage of that amount. The 2003 programme will deliver more than 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, more than 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and of course all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grant scheme for minor works.The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects at schools currently in the advanced stages of architectural planning such as the permanent building projects for Mary Mother of Hope national school in Castaheany. The Department has provided grant aid for the provision of additional temporary accommodation to which the Senator referred. This project is currently nearing completion. The management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety matters.I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House. I will bring her views to the Minister's attention no later than tomorrow. I regret I do not have a more favourable reply for her. I have no doubt that she, the board of management, the principal and all involved will continue to make a strong case in this regard.

#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I welcome the Minister of State. As a Deputy representing a Gaeltacht area, I am sure he will sympathise with the case I am making for Gaelscoil uí Cheithearnaigh. I invite him to visit Ballinasloe to see the accommodation crisis at the school, which featured on RTÉ's "Six One News" programme this evening.The school was founded 13 years ago with just six pupils. In September 2003, 195 pupils will be registered there. Accommodation is in four separate buildings, all of which are rented at a cost of €4,250 per month. Seven years ago, the school received priority one status for funding from the Department. On 1 December 1998 the school received written confirmation of funding for purchase of a site and building of the school as follows, "Is féidir liom a dhearbhú go mbeidh airgead ar fáil le suíomh a cheannach agus an scoil a thógáil."The school authorities were recently informed that the site for the new school will not be purchased this year and that it is not now possible to know when it will be purchased. It is sad that this school may lose a site with planning permission for a ten teacher school. The school has a vibrant staff, enthusiastic parents and eager pupils enduring difficult conditions which pose constant health and safety problems for all concerned. I will emphasise the unsafe nature of this school for children.Children are taught in chronically overcrowded classrooms, the exits from four of which lead out to a busy street. The school is located in four separate buildings with five separate ESB bills, five separate standing charges and three telephone bills. Children have to walk down a busy street to access the schoolyard. To get to and from games, drama or dance lessons, they must walk up and down Society Street in Ballinasloe and then cross the road and a busy bus park. Each child makes between two and eight of these trips each day. The classrooms lack proper lighting and ventilation, which is hazardous to the children's health. The toilet facilities are totally inadequate and it is difficult to maintain basic hygiene with boys and girls in five of the rooms having to share one toilet. The confined play area leads to many accidents and old buildings close by require constant repair to ensure their safety. That is a major concern for the school community.Three of the classrooms, former shops, are now housed in an apartment complex. Three dressing rooms and a kitchen in the town hall double up as classrooms and this inevitably leads to disruption for all concerned. The local musical society, which performed Oklahoma for seven nights last week, had to use the children's classrooms.Every year, during the great October fair, the car park is closed for up to four weeks, leaving parents with no parking facilities when collecting their children. There are no staff toilet facilities. Male and female staff and children from resource classes share one toilet. As the units are self-contained, it takes five staff to supervise eight classrooms on wet days.The Department of Education and Science's architects and inspectors have confirmed the unsuitability of the current accommodation, but no progress has been made in providing those involved with a suitable, safe school building. The school's growth and very survival is threatened by the operational unsuitability of the current rented accommodation. The lack of normal educational facilities and amenities deprives the children of the education to which they are entitled and leads to unnecessary pressure and stress for teachers, parents and children. The massive physical and financial support from the parents for the running and upkeep of the school cannot and should not be expected to continue. Parents are asking where they go from here.I will quote for the Minister of State a letter dated 11 February 2003 from the Chief State Solicitor acting on behalf of the Department of Education and Science to Ballinasloe County Council:Dear Madam,I refer to the above matter.I have taken my client's instructions in this matter and I have been informed that it is not possible this year to make provision for the acquisition of a site for Scoil uí Cheithearnaigh. My client further informs me that they do not know when they will be in a position to progress to site purchase.Yours faithfully,David J. O'Hagan,Chief State Solicitor.I am disappointed with that reply and I hope the Minister of State will take some action in this regard and perhaps visit the school with some of his colleagues. I know that, as a native of a Gaeltacht area in Donegal, he is very interested in Gaelscoileanna.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I thank Senator Kitt for sharing time and I welcome the Minister of State. I fully endorse what Senator Kitt had to say in this instance. I do not think we should treat the endeavours of parents, boards of management and teachers who have laboured so willingly and desperately for many years to improve conditions at this school in this way.The importance of this matter cannot be over-emphasised. Senator Kitt outlined the fact that many of the school's classrooms are in disused shop units, which are dangerous in the extreme. The goodwill among the community in promoting the Irish language has provided many children with an excellent educational service through Gaeilge. Whatever the website might say or whatever numbers game might be played, it is important to realise that this is a situation of utmost and greatest need.I do not wish to make a political point, but even the Taoiseach said the required funding to build this school would be given. The parents, board of management and every public representative responded in a positive and genuine way to the Taoiseach because they thought their problems had been solved at last. Whatever can be done to acquire the necessary funding to allow this project proceed will be welcomed. Even at this late stage, having been disappointed so often in the past, people will warmly welcome it with open arms. We should allow for the positive and enthusiastic reception given to this project to be rekindled.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-05 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I thank Senators Kitt and Ulick Burke for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science the Department's current position regarding the allocation of funding for schools building projects. The capital programme has been published and full details are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, principals, parents, students and public representatives and the criteria used have been clearly outlined.The building programme amounts to €342.9 million. Senator Kitt, like Senator Terry with regard to a different school, believes that very little of that budget would be needed to provide for a new school at Gaelscoil uí Cheithearnaigh, Ballinasloe, County Galway. The programme will deliver over 140 large scale projects at primary and post primary level, and over 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme. The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects at schools currently at architectural planning stage, including that referred to by the Senator. If that were to be approved early next year, it would be foolish to suggest that the school would be up and running soon after with proper facilities provided for the 195 students.Some 13 years ago, there were only six students at the school, whereas that has increased to 195, an amazing record. The school is a victim of its own success. Parents clearly have confidence in the staff, despite their having to work in poor conditions and over-crowded rooms as outlined by the Senators. Pupils also have to cross a dangerous street, which I am familiar with, to get to and from the school.I regret that I am unable to be more positive. I have a particular interest in gaelscoileanna because they are vital to the promotion of our language in areas such as Ballinasloe and around the country. I will bring the views of the Senators to the Minister with a vivid description of the conditions in which the school staff and students operate. If I have an opportunity to visit Ballinasloe in my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, I will do so and bring my views on it to the Minister for Education and Science. When I meet the Minister tomorrow, I will make the views of the Senators clear to him on the provision of a new school for the children of Gaelscoil uí Cheithearnaigh, Ballinasloe.The Seanad adjourned at 10.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 March 2003.
