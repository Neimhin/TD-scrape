I have selected the matters raised by Senator Colette Kelleher, Frank Feighan, Maura Hopkins Fintan Warfield and they will be taken now. Senators Catherine Noone and Tim Lombard may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise. Senators Frank Feighan, Maura Hopkins and Fintan Warfield have withdrawn their Commencement matters that I had selected for discussion.  The Minister for Education and Skills will deal with the matter tabled by Senator Colette Kelleher. I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of a former Member and a good friend of mine, Mr. Charlie O'Connor, who comes from a little village called Tallaght. He is most welcome.

I wish to ask him about the levels of educational attainment among Travellers and specifically what is in place to address the stark figures that have been published. I start by restating that the position for Travellers is dire when it comes to education and that action is urgently needed. The same applies to health, housing and employment. I wish to focus on education and employment.  Less than two weeks ago, on 12 October, the CSO released the 2016 census data for Travellers. Shockingly, they show that 60% of Travellers have received a primary education only. Just 13% of Traveller women and girls have been educated to upper second level or above compared with 69% of the general population. The figure that really stands out for me and which I feel is staggering is that 167 out of a total of 30,000 Travellers have a third level qualification. These statistics are intrinsically linked with the rate of employment among Travellers, of whom 80% are listed as unemployed. If one has not received or only received a primary education, if very few complete second level and only 167 have a third level qualification, it comes as little surprise that the rate of Traveller participation in the labour market is so low.Findings by the ESRI show that Traveller participation in the labour market increases sharply as levels of educational attainment increases, rising from 9% among those with only a primary education to 57% among those with a further or higher education. In the Behaviour & Attitudes Traveller community national survey recently published, 85% of Travellers stated that unemployment among Travellers has got a lot worse or no better over the past five years. This is very disappointing, particularly because when the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton was in his previous role, the creation of jobs in Ireland was a great success story. It is a real pity that many in this particular group of people, because of poor education, are also unemployed. Education is key to improving the employment and life outcomes for the Traveller population and I want to know what measures the Minister is working on or what new measures he will introduce to increase Traveller participation. The State's track record on this issue is very poor. As the Minister will be aware, in 2011 all addition educational supports aimed at Travellers specifically were eliminated. The Travelling with Austerity report shows us that State spending on Traveller education fell by 86% between 2008 and 2013. This should be compared to the overall reduction in Government spending of 4.3% over the same period. I struggle to think of any other section of society that has suffered such a high level of withdrawal of resources. It is a stain on the record of the previous Administration. The cuts included abolishing the visiting teachers for Travellers posts, additional resource teachers and resource hours for Traveller children and closing specialised training centres for teenage and adult Travellers. The 1995 Report of the Task Force on The Travelling Community acknowledged that few initiatives in the area of Traveller education have been as successful as the appointment of visiting teachers, a scheme that was introduced in the bleak 1980s. These visiting teachers worked across the generations, from adults to toddlers. They had a range of roles, from providing support to encouraging attendance, acting as an advocate and ensuring progress from primary to secondary and beyond. We need new initiatives similar to this to support the Traveller community through education. Some 60% of Travellers are aged under 25. The time for action to help these young Travellers is now. What are the current measures in place and can the Minister give an update on the education points included in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, which was published in July? The strategy includes very specific education orientated actions. In light of the CSO findings that the educational attainment among Travellers continues to lag very significantly behind that of the general population, I want to know what the Minister is doing now and any new measures he might propose.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23600	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	2	I thank Senator Kelleher for raising this issue. No doubt this is a challenging and complex area. As the Senator will be aware, in June-July of this year the first National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy was published and the education committee within that has met in the intervening period. The strategy involves, as the Senator stated, a number of important education elements. At a general level, it proposes the need to support in areas including education, employment and economic development. The Senator raised the issue of the extent to which the Traveller population has participated in the fall in unemployment from 15.1% to 6.1%, which is a dramatic improvement. I do not have data on that. The Intreo offices of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have been very successful. It was one of the successes under the former Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, that the work of the then Department of Social Protection was reoriented to help develop the unemployed to get into employment positions. Long-term unemployment is now down to 3%. We have been very successful in that area. I do not know to what extent Travellers have benefitted from that change, but certainly the focus of that policy is to assist the unemployed in finding pathways back into work. Another element was to ensure that the curriculum resources gave consideration to the culture and history of the Traveller and Roma population for use within the education settings and work is under way on that by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA. In the area of SOLAS and the ETBS planning for the needs of disadvantaged groups, including Travellers, that is very much a part of what is being done. As the Senator can understand, with unemployment very high, there was a huge emphasis on delivering a scale of opportunities. Now there is greater focus on identifying needs and pathways and ensuring that those programmes are of benefit. The latest figures I have show that there are 500 persons who declare as Travellers who are in programmes such as VTOS and Youthreach, and those programmes have in the past reported very good impact. We will be conducting a review of each of them shortly. We will look specifically at their success in bringing along groups, such as the Traveller and Roma groups, and successfully finding pathways for them. The other area was to focus, in particular, on attendance. A two-year pilot programme is being initiated, mainly driven by Tusla, which is responsible for the home school liaison and the school completion policies. That two-year pilot programme will target attendance and participation by Traveller and Roma children. It will involve the appointment of additional home school liaison teachers and other supports to try to achieve high levels of attendance and completion. As the Senator correctly stated, there is a real problem with the fall-away as Traveller children progress through the education system. I attended the recent meeting that the former Taoiseach held in the context of the recognition of the ethnicity of the Traveller community and there was uniform support for education as being a key gateway. This pilot programme has built on the work there and it will be very much embedded with the Traveller community to try to achieve a big step up in the participation. Another element obviously is trying to address what the Senator correctly pointed out was a very poor level of third level participation, with only roughly 1% of the adult Traveller population having third level education. Our performance framework for the higher education system has for the first time included an explicit target for enrolment of Traveller students. Obviously, we will be looking to see if can we use the programmes that we have rolled out, which include particular college bursaries worth €5,000 for 600 students from non-traditional backgrounds, as a gateway for Traveller students to come through. We have, as the Senator will probably be aware, a call out to the higher education institutions at present to develop their access policies and we will be keen to see that there are explicit attempts by the third level sector to ensure that its access policies include Traveller students. There is work in progress and there is a new policy being developed, but I share the Senator's view that this is an area of very substantial challenge. The figures for education progression are, as the Senator correctly states, dismal and they are ones that we have to address. There is a determination in the committee that has been recently established in the education area to progress that.

Education is key. The Minister correctly stated it is dismal. I referred to the levels of participation right across the system, but particularly in third level. The baseline is so low that we surely can raise our game. It is good that there is a committee looking at it. However, I was also looking at the measures in the strategy. A network of peer support and mentoring is one of them. That is a great idea, but what is happening? The strategy includes good practice initiatives but again they are pilots. These are all aspirational. There are few concrete proposals here. On school enrolment, are schools discriminating against Travellers?We have had some high profile cases. I noted that No. 11 in the strategy states that a review will be published in early 2017. I do not know if the review has been published. If not, it would be helpful if the Minister came back to the Seanad in this guise, as a Commencement matter, or as part of our debates to consider this matter further. This is a matter of urgency.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23600	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	5	I agree. The two-year pilot will be rolled out shortly. I think it is in a position to go live very soon and it will involve Tusla. It will enhance Tusla education welfare supports and additional home, school, community liaison co-ordinators, which we will fund. In addition, it will also fund the Traveller community workers in pilot areas to work with Tusla staff where Traveller children are enrolled. It focuses on the biggest thing, namely, retention within the school system. If we cannot develop policies that work in that area, then we will not achieve anything. The policy position is that Travellers should not be educated separately. It is an established policy that Travellers should be in mainstream education and not separated out. The old system of visiting teachers and so on, which the Senator referred to, was a separate strain. To be fair to the Department of Education and Skills, over those years the investment in resource teaching, which is designed to meet the needs of children who come to school with particular difficulties, has been increased by 50%. We now have close to 14,000 teachers in resource teaching. They are available to pupils, be they from a Traveller background or any other background, who exhibit particular difficulties in dealing with the education programmes. That is a very substantial resource that has gone in. Funding was increased by 50% even in those very difficult years. It is hoped that this integrated model, if we can improve attendance, will mean that the resources are available within schools to address some of these needs. That is why the focus has been on attendance, in particular. Also, it is the first time that targets have been set for progression to third level. We are trying to ensure that a coherent pathway is developed over time. I note the Senator's concern. I will ensure that reasonable progress reports are provided to the Oireachtas so that we can see how we are progressing in this area, which is rightly a matter of considerable concern.

I have come to the conclusion that while the all-party committee which is chaired by the Deputy Leader is sitting to deal with the issue and doing its business, following which a report will be presented to both Houses before the end of the year, I will not encourage and will disallow any debate on the matter. It is also inappropriate for members of the committee to direct comments at each other in the Chamber and for others to defend such comments. The committee should be allowed to do its work. I have made that decision and hope it will be respected. Some people made complaints against a certain Senator. There is a mechanism for the making of complaints against Members of this or the other House. It can be triggered if anybody feels he or she needs to so do. It is not the job of the Cathaoirleach to referee on this issue and I do not intend to do so. I expect the House to come on board and accept my decision.
#CatherineArdagh	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-party	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-dob	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	9	I would like to raise two issues, the first of which is health care, while the second is leniency in sentencing. According to the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, the State and the Government are condemning acutely ill patients to unacceptable delays which will result in avoidable deaths in acute hospitals because of a chronic lack of capacity. Speaking at its annual conference in Limerick, Dr. Tom Ryan, president of the IHCA, said the evidence that we needed more acute hospital capacity was compelling. Despite a growing and ageing population, more than 1,400 inpatient acute hospital beds were closed in the past decade. The number of elective surgeries has declined by 50% in the past four years. There has also been a persistent policy from the Government of rationing health care by the State as it has systematically decreased the number of inpatient beds in public hospitals. Successive Governments have failed to address this issue in successive budgets and health capital plans. This is the root cause of waiting lists and the treatment of patients on trolleys. I have previously referred to the delays about which we hear anecdotally, as well as to patients not receiving chemotherapy on time and the rationing of imaging scans in cancer treatment. The Government promised 1,500 more nurses, but the reality is that only 13 of those positions will be filled. There is a serious issue across the public sector in the recruitment and retention of State workers, specifically nurses and members of the Defence Forces. We need to examine it seriously. The State needs to consider how it will recruit and retain staff. My second issue is leniency in sentencing. It is stated on page 101 of the programme for Government that more serious legislation will be introduced to deal with those who abuse and groom children. This issue is urgent and should be at the top of the agenda. I respect the Judiciary and the discretion judges have. They are given certain guidelines, but it is incumbent on the Government to act on the commitment given in the programme for Government and introduce more stringent legislation. Another small item I would like to mention is flu jabs. It is the time of year when we should all receive the flu vaccine which is made available to us in the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is incumbent on us to lead by example and have the flu jab because the benefits outweigh the negatives. Herd immunity to protect ourselves and others is vitally important. I, therefore, urge everyone in the House to have the flu jab.
#VictorBoyhan	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-party	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-dob	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	10	I would like to raise three issues. Teagasc's statement of strategy for the period 2017 to 2020 formed part of a briefing for Oireachtas Members today. The briefing was very informative. It is worth acknowledging the enormous support available, based on science, innovation and research in agriculture, forestry, horticulture and the food sector. What was particularly important about the briefing was how Teagasc shared what was happening in its food innovation hub.I wish to acknowledge, as Teagasc did this morning, the enormous support given by the Government to fund the food hub. That is positive news and news that we should share. The next issue I wish to raise is not particularly good news for anyone who listened to "Morning Ireland" this morning. Yesterday, the official bed count showed that 524 people were either on trolleys and, where no trolleys were available, the people were in wheelchairs. The issue was discussed in great detail this morning on "Morning Ireland". I ask the Deputy Leader to raise the matter with the Minister for Health. Senator Ardagh mentioned the flu jab. The reality is we have no flu currently. We have no flu epidemic or major illness. Our climate is pretty good for this time of the year so we have not seen a major demand placed on hospitals. Last night, however, 524 people across this country were on trolleys or, as confirmed on the news, in chairs awaiting beds. The situation is clearly unacceptable and is expected to worsen. I am afraid that we will have to talk about this issue time and again.  Finally, I want to raise the issue of fast-track planning. Last year, the Government referred to fast-track planning legislation in the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. We were assured, as part of this legislation, that people would have the capacity to lodge objections or observations on strategic planning applications with An Bord Pleanála. I spoke to officials in An Bord Pleanála this morning and it was confirmed that the board was not in a position to receive applications online for critical infrastructure applications or even for appeals anywhere in the country because, as I was told, no legislation has been put in place to give effect to the promise in the legislation. I ask the Deputy Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. The option is a very important element. The Minister gave a commitment to this House that critical technology would be put in place that would allow members of the public, and public representatives alike, to engage with An Bord Pleanála. Yet today the board has confirmed that it is not in a position, and cannot and will not accept submissions online. That is not good enough. The matter needs to be addressed.

First, I wish to refer to yesterday's sentence in the Tom Humphries case. It has been pointed out today that this is not a unique issue just because of its high-profile nature. There is a real issue with the sentencing that is being handed down, particularly to people who have been found guilty of sex offences. Two years ago I introduced to this House the Sentencing Council Bill which sought to bring into practice in Ireland what has been the practice in England and Wales. I refer to a system where a clear range of sentences is provided to the Judiciary. In those jurisdictions the majority of the councils are comprised of the judiciary but they are also representative of a range of stakeholders in English and Welsh society. However, there is accountability when it comes to sentencing. The judge in question must publish and explain the sentence that he or she has handed down. Most importantly, there is consultation with the public on what is an acceptable sentence for a particular category of crime. Clearly, a wide range of people believe that yesterday's sentence was not in keeping with the wishes of Irish society. I want to again put my Bill forward. It has been reintroduced by my colleague in the Dáil, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien. I would like to see the Bill and the council advanced.

I am concerned about reference being made to a particular case because there is still a possibility that an appeal will be lodged by either the DPP or by the person in question. I clearly understand where the Senator is coming from in terms of a discussion and introducing legislation. That is permissible. I would prefer if Members did not specifically refer to the case yesterday or whatever because the matter is out of our jurisdiction. There may be an appeal, which could throw up a different result, lodged either by the DPP or the defendant. The Senator can continue now but I urge him to be careful.

The Cathaoirleach will know that every week I have raised the issues of remaining community amenities, sporting amenities and farming sectors that have not been properly supported following the serious floods that occurred in the Inishowen Peninsula two months ago. The Cockhill Celtic Football Club, which is a very senior football and community organisation in my part of the world, was devastated by the floods. Two of its pitches were destroyed along with all kinds of amenities and the damage to the tune of hundreds of thousands of euro was done. Even though the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Chief Whip were on the pitch within a few days, two months later the club has no idea if it will get any money or financial assistance from the Government. It is completely unacceptable that a senior sporting organisation, that fields eight different teams and facilitates 300 young people in my community, has been devastated by the floods and left with no financial support from the Government and has received no clarification after two months.  Swan Park in Buncrana is a vital amenity that was at the heart of my community. It has been destroyed. Again, there has been no clarification issued by the Government about whether funding will be provided. The same applies to Glenevin Waterfall. Potato and crop growers have had their lives destroyed and suffered financial losses amounting to hundreds of thousands of euro. Again, the Government has not clarified what will happen. We had a debate here last week but I heard no specific clarification regarding County Donegal even though I thought we were going to get one. There was supposed to be an announcement made yesterday but, again, there has been no clarification of these issues.  I wish to make it clear that I will continue to raise this issue until the communities that have been devastated in my area get the support that they need, be it the community or sporting amenities. Such a situation would not be allowed to happen anywhere else in this State. Now that the cameras have gone the people have been left behind. There is no way a major sporting or community amenity that has been destroyed in one town should be left without a clarification, two months on, on where funding will come from.  The Leader made promises the last time I raised this issue two weeks ago. I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange for a specific Minister to respond to me and tell me what will happen in terms of Cockhill Celtic Football Club, Swan Park and Glenevin Waterfall. Please can I have a specific response to these issues?

It is essential that the message goes to the Government, and the Deputy Leader conveys it, that the Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, II report, that has been awaited for over a decade, be delivered. Research is long needed into the extent of sexual abuse and violence in Ireland and a report must be delivered. Recently the Taoiseach has commented that the €1 million for research, which is a paltry sum, has been redirected to legal aid for victims. That measure adds insult to injury. It should not be necessary to choose between legal aid and research to challenge the issue across the country. It is not too much to ask that €2 million is provided. By that I mean the Government should give over €1 million for legal aid and €1 million for essential research on sexual violence, particularly as such research is long overdue and promised for over a decade. I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to expedite the return of the Domestic Violence Bill to this House. The legislation is very much near completion. It contains, as very clearly requested by this House, the specific crime of coercive control. We have seen the horror of grooming in respect of young people. Coercive control is a serious issue that affects many people in society and needs to be tackled. I want us to have an opportunity to tackle it in this House before Christmas. The main issue I want to highlight is the trial of 11 human rights defenders that began in Turkey today. Ten of them were arrested following a human rights workshop organised by a group called the Human Rights Joint Platform, IHOP. The group brought together exactly what we need in society, the human rights advocates from an Islamic and feminist backgrounds and people who worked for LGBT rights equality. The group facilitated dialogue between all of those interested in rights issues across Turkish society. It reflected the diversity of that interest in Turkish society. The 11 people have been arrested and detained on trumped-up charges. I request that the Irish Government ensures that the Irish embassy observes and pays due attention to the trial. I know that the embassy has a capacity to do so.I understand other European embassies have sent witnesses to observe the proceedings, and we should do the same. I accompanied a delegation of human rights advocates from Turkey to Leinster House last week. While they were here, they learned that another of their colleagues had been arrested. I sit on the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe where I have seen colleagues discussing the arrest of fellow party members and parliamentarians. Judges, too, are being arrested. In fact, the Council of Europe awarded its highest honour, the Václav Havel award, to a judge who was arrested. The case of Idil Eser, director of Amnesty International in Turkey, has been much highlighted. He is one of the 11 on trial today, along with others from the Turkish Women's Coalition, the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly and the Turkish Human Rights Association. I note that the EU has withheld €80 million in funding from Turkey in view of concerns regarding human rights issues. How, then, can it justify the immigration control agreements signed with Turkey, let alone the similar agreements with Libya, Sudan and others? Civil society is under threat on a global scale, as we saw with the attack in Malta, the arrest of civil society leaders in Catalonia and the clampdown on protest in Poland and Hungary. I urge my fellow parliamentarians to take this issue very seriously.

Last July, I highlighted the delay in the construction of social housing and the absence of affordable schemes. I understand Dublin City Council is trying to get around the problem and ensure social housing construction proceeds on some of its sites. At the Poolbeg West strategic development zone, commonly known in the locality as the Irish Glass Bottle, IGB, site, the construction of 3,500 units was announced. The planning scheme for the development has gone to An Bord Pleanála, but we still have no affordable housing or affordable rental accommodation at the site. There is an enormous interest in affordable housing among people in my community in Ringsend and Sandymount. Some of these people are living in local authority accommodation, which they would be willing to surrender if there was some certainty regarding affordable housing provision in the area. There have been media reports since July that an affordable housing scheme would be announced within the next two weeks. In September, The Irish Times again reported that a scheme would be rolled out in the next fortnight. Potential users of any such scheme cannot make plans if they do not know whether they will qualify for affordable housing or the rental accommodation scheme, what costs will be involved and how they might qualify. Will the Leader call the Minister to the House at the earliest convenience in order that he can clarify his thinking on this matter and outline the costs of affordable housing provision under a new Government scheme? We need to know if it will be like the old Part V scheme where there was a 20 year clawback and a 30% to 35% discount on the purchase price. There is growing frustration at the lack of clarity. In the absence of information, people who hope to have the opportunity to purchase an affordable housing unit are stuck and cannot move on with their lives. I look forward to having that debate with the Minister as soon as the Leader can arrange it.

This development is being described as the boomerang effect, with members of the Irish diaspora in Australia helping these companies with their plans to come to Ireland. I understand up to 45 firms have expressed an interest in locating their business in the mid-west. It is a most welcome development.

Since joining the UN in 1955, Ireland has played an important role in that organisation, from the pioneering work of the late Deputy Frank Aiken, as Minister for External Affairs, on nuclear non-proliferation to the efforts of Defence Forces personnel in the service of blue helmet peacekeeping since 1958, including in such challenging locations as the Middle East, the Congo and west and north Africa. Sometimes, however, the UN gets it wrong. Early last Saturday morning I read a headline proclaiming that Robert Mugabe had been named as goodwill ambassador by the UN's World Health Organization, WHO. My first impression was that I must be reading an article on the Waterford Whispers News website or that it was some sort of sick joke. In fact, it was true that the WHO's Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebyreyesus, had made the announcement, remarking as he did: "Today I am also honoured to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs [non-communicable diseases] for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritise NCDs." Fortunately, the WHO has, in the light of international opposition, rowed back from the appointment. The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, was right to describe the news as "offensive and bizarre". Mr. Mugabe is in the same league of extraordinary dictators as Castro and Pinochet, people who did not believe in the UN Charter and who rounded up opponents, shot them or had them disappeared because those opponents disagreed with the ideology of the day. What possessed the WHO to do this given the atrocities Mugabe has inflicted on his own people, brutalising human rights activists and democratic dissidents? This incident with Mugabe is a stain on the proud history of the UN and the World Health Organization and one that should never be revisited.

Few in this House can know what it is like to wake up in the morning and realise one is about to lose one's home. I have actually been there, but it happened back in the days when I could walk in and negotiate with my bank manager. I was fortunate that the bank I was dealing with, while taking my house, allowed me to walk away debt free and thus I was in a position to restart my life. I had a call yesterday from a person who worked for one of the pillar banks. I will not name the institution in question in deference to the Cathaoirleach. The caller told me of a manager at the bank who delighted in seeing a tracker mortgage taken from a client, seeing it as a win for the bank. What sort of attitude is that? Most of the people I know working in banks are genuine, decent and hard-working people, but a thug like that needs to be brought to heel. Likewise, the thugs who sit in the boardrooms of the banks of this country, who have stripped those banks of the managers who customers could talk to and cry with, need to be brought to heel. My request to the Leader may seem somewhat crazy but the reality is that there is only one way to bring these fellows to heel and that is through the courts. Of course, no family in unfortunate circumstances could afford to do that. Why does the State not select a few of these cases and take them to court? We are not just talking about malpractice in respect of tracker mortgages but also in regard to variable interest rates. These people are not happy unless they take a person's blood. God being good, I managed to rebuild my life after losing my home and, just a few weeks ago, made the last payment on my mortgage. I decided to go into the bank and make the transaction in cash because it was the final payment due. I thought surely there would be a red carpet out for me, a bottle of champagne and somebody to shake my hand. There was none of that but I was presented with a charge of €35 to get my deeds back. What sort of God-damned people are these? Will the Leader look into the situation of the crew of the LÉ Niamh who are currently serving in the Mediterranean and have not been given their overseas payments? Their families are struggling, particularly those affected by Storm Ophelia.Perhaps the Leader will look into the issue for me today.

I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, come to the House to discuss pay and conditions for councillors who are struggling to maintain a livelihood. We have lost many councillors recently owing to the heavy workload they face and the absence of proper pay. The matter is with the Minister for Finance and I ask that he come to the House to discuss it. I also ask that the Minister come to the House to discuss technician pay for Army cooks. Army cooks were awarded technician pay but have not yet received it. Apparently the issue is with the Minister. I have been lobbying for some time on behalf of an individual in my local area who, unfortunately, passed away last week and was buried on Monday. It grieves me that this man, who represented his country and struggled for so long, died without receiving proper pay.

As Senators will be aware, I have raised a number of times the use of Shannon Airport by the United States military as a forward base, with particular reference to the war in Yemen. We know from freedom of information records that have been released that there is a pattern whereby aeroplanes are flying from Shannon Airport to the capital cities of the so-called Saudi coalition, which has brought death and destruction to tens of thousands of people. The Government has made us a part of this by turning a blind eye to what is happening at Shannon Airport. I have asked the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue on numerous occasions. It reminds me a little of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in that it is apparently coming but a slot for it has not yet been arranged. I would welcome a debate on the US military's use of Shannon Airport.  I raise a specific episode which occurred on Sunday of last week. I regularly attend protests at Shannon Airport and on the day in question I saw a peaceful protester knocked to the ground by gardaí. I then saw gardaí drive up to the protest, inspect the protesters' vehicles, set up a roadblock on the main road out of Shannon Airport and single out the protesters by stopping their vehicles and inspecting their tax and insurance details. They did not stop members of the public. When one of our fellow protesters pulled in to see what the problem was, he was immediately issued with a fine for parking illegally on the motorway. This incident amounted to nothing less than Garda harassment. It was disgraceful and I hope no one in the Government will stand over it. I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to explain the appalling behaviour of gardaí in Shannon Airport.

We must examine all opportunities arising from Brexit. The Taoiseach stated he is seeking associated membership for Ireland of La Francophonie, a group of French-speaking countries similar to the Commonwealth. La Francophonie is a global organisation that deals with culture, science, economy, justice and peace. Ireland is taking its place among the nations of the world, and by increasing our footprint in foreign affairs and doubling the number of Irish embassy staff, we are moving in a different world. I say this because Brexit brings major opportunities and threats and we must work more closely with the United Kingdom. We must also establish more links with Commonwealth countries also and we should not be afraid to do so through justice, science and peace building. We have a shared history and it is incumbent on us to examine all these opportunities. Not enough is being done by Senators and Deputies to forge relationships with members of the diaspora in Westminster who form an Irish caucus, as it were, and show great goodwill towards the island of Ireland. Between 12 and 15 Senators and Deputies will travel to Westminster on Monday, 6 November, to meet the leaders of all the political groups in the UK, including the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Boris Johnson. The group will be hosted by Tourism Ireland and other Irish organisations. We must do much more of this type of work because we have neglected the relationship with the United Kingdom. The Good Friday Agreement will be 20 years old next year and we should be brave and mature enough to start working on this relationship. We need to do more to bring together Members of the Oireachtas and members of the diaspora in the House of Commons.  I welcome the Taoiseach's decision to ask for associate membership of La Francophonie. It is a good idea. We should not be afraid to examine the possibility of forging new associations with Commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada, which is also a member of La Francophonie.

However, not one community group or organisation has had an application accepted under the scheme. The current Minister, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, indicated the funding is secure for the three-year period in question. This year, all five applications made under the scheme have been returned to the groups concerned seeking further information. This is unfair and disappointing. There must be an issue with the scheme if only five applications for funding have been submitted. A sum of €3 million is available for the three-year period, yet only five applications for funding have been submitted. One of the reasons the scheme is not working is that the Government will only fund 60% of the cost of a CCTV scheme, with the remainder to be provided by the applicant organisation. This issue needs to be addressed and the scheme must be changed. I call on the Minister to change the scheme because it is not working. It could be used to monitor littering and anti-social behaviour, particularly in rural areas, if the criteria were changed. Many rural groups, organisations and communities are not aware of the scheme. A proper awareness raising campaign must be introduced and the scheme must be changed.

Several months ago, I and Senator Ó Clochartaigh, along with a number of other Senators, raised in the House what can only be described as the swindle taking place in the JobPath scheme. I want the Minister to come to the House to answer some straightforward questions on the scheme. For example, why will up to €340 million be given to private companies over six years to exploit - that is the only word I can use - the most vulnerable people in our communities? The scheme gives ownership of these people to the two private companies operating JobPath. In 2017 alone, €65 million was spent on the scheme, which is not working for individuals. People are being required to bypass their local employment service and travel miles upon miles to centres where JobPath offices are located.JobPath offices then take complete ownership of the individuals and do not allow them to sign up for any other scheme or anything available to them in their area. I want the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to come to the House immediately to answer my questions. What will be done tomorrow morning if the contract with the private companies is cut off? What are the penalties? Let us have some transparency regarding the original flawed contract which is subject to the height of secrecy. What has been done with JobPath is a swindle; it is one of the greatest debacles of the decade and I thank my colleagues for exposing it today.

It concerns St. Mologa's school in Balbriggan and is affecting 463 children. The school now has 16 prefabs. The children have been in prefabs for years. It is terrible to think that in 2017 children are cold at school during the winter and too hot in the summer. They are on the list for a new school, but there is no firm date and no hard evidence that progress is being made. I congratulate the Minister for Education and Skills on the changes he introduced in the budget to the pupil-teacher ratio and in respect of students with special needs, but these very changes mean that the three extra teachers for the school this year - there will be four next year - will have no classrooms in which to teach the children who represent the future of the country. In a republic of equal opportunities they deserve proper facilities in which to learn and enhance themselves and the country in the future. I, therefore, ask that the Minister be invited to come to the House. I am sure a request is being made to have a Commencement debate on the issue. I will be very happy to share time with other Senators who have a similar interest in it, but it is up to the Cathaoirleach to decide.

I refer, in particular, to comments made by two members of the Garda Representative Association, one from the Donegal division and the other from the Cavan-Monaghan division, in which they highlighted their concerns about Brexit and what might happen in the event that there was a hard border. They were putting the Government on notice that the Garda did not have the numbers to provide an adequate policing service for the community as things stood, never mind in the event that there was a hard Brexit. To highlight this point, they gave a couple of examples. They referred to Clones, County Monaghan, which has a population of over 3,000 people. All it has is one sergeant and two gardaí. Monaghan Garda station recently lost three members, or 10% of its entire workforce, and they have not been replaced. The area from the Cavan border to the Armagh border which covers three counties is patrolled by one patrol car with two personnel on board, if we are lucky. It includes Monaghan town, Clones and the entire countryside. This clearly shows that there is a serious issue with Garda numbers in the Border counties. I would like the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to address it. In addition, he might outline his plans in the event that there is a hard border. What are his plans to strengthen the Garda force in the Cavan-Monaghan division, County Donegal and along the entire Border frontier?

It is not specifically about Garda numbers but about rural crime. To be honest, I had no intention of raising the issue this morning until, about half an hour ago, I received a telephone call from a gentleman who lives within four miles of me at home. He and his wife are both in their 70s. They had a family SME all of their lives and employed at least four to five people, for whom they paid taxes, with their own. Last Friday evening, when they came home having been shopping, they discovered that their business and house had been totally ransacked. This morning the man in question was in tears on the telephone. The couple are now prisoners in their own house. He cannot leave the house unless his wife goes with him and she will not stay on her own. As he said, he is a prisoner in his own house having contributed to society for a lifetime. He also said the lack of policing in rural Ireland was the cause of the majority of the problems. Nobody is aware of how rampant crime is in rural areas and how vulnerable and targeted those in the age group in question feel when in their homes. They worked all their lives for them in order to have a little comfort in their retirement. I do not know whether we would get all of the answers if the Minister was here. We are recruiting extra gardaí and investing extra resources, but it is a question of how the extra gardaí and resources are being deployed. There is no strategic policing code for rural areas, but there is a need for one, as opposed to a code for policing across the entire country. Policing in urban areas is completely different from policing in rural areas, but this is not recognised. Politicians on every side will say such a barracks was kept open. Barracks in our area were kept open and everybody was taking credit for it. There is a maximum of two gardaí on duty at any one time and they are covering an area that was once covered by three or four barracks, each of which used to have four to six gardaí. That is the root of the problem. The man who telephoned me was in tears and I practically was. I had no intention of raising this issue in the House, but the man's conversation moved me to do so. He is a genuine individual who is now, as he states, a prisoner in his own house. Society should be ashamed. We have to take some action to change it.

I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Defence to come to the House to have a discussion on the future of the Defence Forces. Yesterday Senator Gerard P. Craughwell outlined some very alarming statistics on the Order of Business. I would specifically like to ask the Minister of State, in the light of and given the unknowns associated with Brexit, what plans he has for the Defence Forces and the security of the Border. A number of years ago the most modern army barracks in Europe, Dún Uí Néill in Cavan town, were closed. I have raised this issue continuously in the House. We were told the barracks had been closed strategically to improve the quality of the Defence Forces.Almost the entire Border is being left without any Army personnel other than skeleton crews based in County Louth and in County Donegal because the personnel who are allegedly based in both of those barracks are not based in those barracks. They are operating, some of them in this city and some of them in the Government Chief Whip's town of Athlone. It is time we got real here. Our Border is not being secured-----

I do not know whether we are going to stick to the rule that one issue is raised per person. Certainly, there are plenty of issues today. Senator Ardagh raised the issue of waiting lists and lack of capacity. Some €75 million has been spent in this year's budget on this issue. While I take the point the Senator is raising, and it is a serious issue, under the 2017 waiting list action plan the NTPF has advised that so far this year 11,797 patients have been authorised for treatment with more than 4,700 patients having accepted an offer of treatment, and over 2,000 of these patients having received their procedure. On 1 October, funding of €700,000 was allocated by the NTPF to roll out an endoscopy initiative for 2017. Approval was given to the HSE on 25 September to drive a national waiting list validation project. This funding will provide for dedicated capacity within the HSE to support systematic and regular waiting list validation and continued focus on scheduled care. Senator Ardagh also raised the issue of sentencing. I share Members' views on this. There is a certain level of frustration. The House will understand that I cannot comment about an individual case such as the case that has been mentioned. It is important to be aware that sentencing is a matter within the remit of the Judiciary and it is not open to the Minister to intervene directly. The Government published the Judicial Council Bill in 2017. The Bill provides for the establishment of a judicial council, as Senators will be aware. A sentencing information committee will also be established to collate information on sentencing imposed by the courts. The report of the working group, Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines. Nevertheless, it is an issue that could do with debate in this House. The flu jab was mentioned by Senator Ardagh. There has been discussion in the media recently about the flu jab. The flu, by its nature, is an evolving virus and it changes based on geographic location. There is much talk about our flu jab not covering certain strains of flu but I would not want that to dissuade people from having the jab because it covers most types of flu that one can get. I would hate for the message to go out that if one gets the flu jab, it will not be sufficient. I can see Senator Swanick smiling at me. Maybe I am not describing the medical reality of it. It is important, notwithstanding any strains of flu that exist in Australia or wherever, that we get the jab that is available in this country. Senator Boyhan mentioned the Teagasc strategy, and how many patients are on trolleys this morning. I understand the HSE held a weather-ready meeting on Monday, 23 October, which was attended by hospital groups, hospital community health care organisations, CHOs, primary care providers as well as HSE management as part of work to finalise integrated winter plans for all sites for the coming winter. This is part of a pro-active and integrated approach to winter planning in order that the health services are ready for the increased demand for health services, in particular, emergency department, ED, services in the months ahead. The point is well made that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. With regard to fast-track planning, I would be interested to hear from the Minister on that issue. It links in with a point made by another Senator which I will come to. A debate in the area of fast-track planning and planning generally with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, would be a good idea. The last time I took questions Senator Mac Lochlainn mentioned the issue of community funding. All I can say to the Senator is I will follow up. After the Senator mentioned it on the last occasion, I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Ring, who stated he would come back to me on it. In fairness, the Minister seemed to be interested in the issue. Following on from what the Cathaoirleach stated, and as I stated on the previous occasion, I would say it is an issue for a Commencement debate on which Senator Mac Lochlainn will get a direct answer from a Minister. Perhaps the Senator raised it already but it would be no harm to raise a follow-up one. It would be important that, even if an issue is mentioned on the Order of Business, it would not necessarily preclude Senators from raising it. If it is raised here one day and then the next day the Senator has a Commencement matter, that would be serious duplication, which we should avoid. Senator Higgins raised the issue of sexual abuse, the SAVI report and the research on sexual violence which is badly needed. The Domestic Violence Bill is being considered by the Department of Justice and Equality at present and it will be back in the House next month. That is fresh off the press. The Senator will be pleased to hear that. The trial of the human rights activists is a foreign affairs issue. It is something that we will bring to the attention of, and no doubt is already being considered by, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister. Senator Kevin Humphreys raised the issue of affordable housing. I have already stated that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, should come into the House to discuss the planning area. It really is a planning issue that Senator Humphreys is referring to because if there was fast-track planning for cases such as this, it would get around the issue which he raises. Senator Byrne complimented the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on its work when it comes to trade missions. The Senator's comments highlight the value of trade missions, which are perceived to be jollies in a way but which are really hard work. Ministers and representatives from Ireland work hard on those trade missions and I thank the Senator for raising it here. Senator Swanick raised the United Nations day issue, and the Robert Mugabe comments which I wholeheartedly agree with. In fairness, its has changed its mind. It was unbelievable, and I would share the Senator's thoughts on that. Senator Craughwell was passionate today about the banks and I can understand why. I share the Senator's frustration. When one telephones a bank now, one cannot get to speak to somebody or one must go around the houses to get to speak to somebody. The day is gone where there is any real customer service in banks. It is, quite frankly, unacceptable. When it comes to those who are in difficult situations, the empathy seems to be gone out of that area entirely. I congratulate the Senator on the last payment of his mortgage. I wish I was at that stage where I was making my last payment on my mortgage. When it comes to the crew of the LÉ Niamh, that is an issue for a Commencement debate. I would suggest that the Senator do that. Senator McFadden raised the pay and conditions of councillors, which I think we would all agree with. The Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, was in here for a Commencement debate, but it would be a good idea to get him in for an entire debate on this area because it is an issue that interests us all. With regard to Army cooks, that feeds in to - pardon the pun - the wider issue of the Defence Forces. It is a good idea. The Senator is doing good, as it is her area. Given the contributions today, there is a serious need to have the Minister in. Indeed, it will be arranged, probably the second week after we come back, that he will come into the House. Senator Gavan raised an issue regarding the Shannon. I cannot really speak about it. I do know about the issue to which the Senator refers.It is certainly an issue that perhaps should be raised. If that is Senator Gavan's information it should certainly be communicated to An Garda Síochána and I would expect that as a Member of the Oireachtas Senator Gavan would be entitled to a response on what the Garda's approach is to a situation as described by the Senator. Senator Gavan could follow it up with the Minister if the response is unsatisfactory. Senator Feighan does great work and should be acknowledged for his work on Irish-British relations. He has highlighted the recent visit by the Taoiseach to France, and that Ireland would be considered part of la Francophonie group. Brexit is a negative for Ireland but this aspect is a positive part of Brexit; that we must diversify and look to other countries for arrangements, trade and potential. It is good to hear positive talk around Brexit. I commend Senator Feighan for arranging the upcoming trip. Unfortunately, due to other commitments I cannot make it. I hope it is a constructive meeting and that the Members have an enjoyable time with colleagues in the UK. Senator Murnane O'Connor spoke on community groups and the CCTV scheme. This is an issue for a Commencement debate. It is very specific and I believe the Senator would get great satisfaction from a one-on-one with the Minister on the topic. I do not know the full extent of the scheme and how it operates but perhaps there is a communications issue. If there is, the Senator will need to raise it with the Minister directly in a Commencement debate. That is not to say that I will not communicate it to the Minister, but I believe that would be the best way forward.

I am sure the Minister would welcome the opportunity to respond to the allegations the Senator has made with regard to JobPath. I do not want to repeat myself but I believe that Senator Conway-Walsh would get great satisfaction from a Commencement debate on that matter.

I cannot know about every Commencement debate that occurs in the House, and that was quite a while ago also. There is no reason why a debate could not be facilitated in that area. Perhaps it could be expanded slightly so that this issue could definitely be covered. I suggest expanding it in case there are other issues that Members may wish to raise with the Minister in and around the skills, jobs and training area. I will certainly ask the Leader's office to arrange that. Senator Reilly raised a local issue around no classrooms. This issue needs urgent priority. The Senator has a Commencement debate down and I hope that he would not be precluded from continuing with that. Clearly it is a matter of priority. Senator Gallagher raised the issue of Garda numbers on the Border. There are many challenges with Brexit and this is another one we really need to keep an eye on. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, would welcome the opportunity to outline plans in this regard, and as it pertains to Brexit. Senator Paul Daly raised the issue of rural crime. The fear that he described is a reality for many people, especially those who are older or more vulnerable, around the country. The Senator illustrated a very sad and personal situation. I do not want to be party political about the subject but to a degree I have to be. Fianna Fáil closed many of the Garda stations. Since we have had the opportunity we have put significant investment into Garda numbers. I know that is not what the Senator wants to hear but-----

I will certainly arrange a debate in that area. It is a topic that I take an interest in also. I agree with the Senator's point about it not always being about money. In that respect this is a bit like the HSE.

I agree with some of the things he said, and I disagree with other points. I am allowed to do that. I agree that the issue needs attention, that money will not always solve it and that there is a strategy or method for doing things that might work better. It would be good for the Senator to have the opportunity to raise it more fully with the Minister in the House. Senator Wilson raised the subject of the Defence Forces and the future of the Defence Forces. Senators have brought up issues around the Defence Forces on three or four occasions and I have said that clearly there is a need for a debate in the House on this. I understand that this has been arranged for the week after we return. This concludes the responses to the Order of Business.

Mar Aire Stáit le freagracht don Ghaeilge, don Ghaeltacht agus do na hoiléain, fáiltím roimh an deis seo labhairt leis an Seanad faoi chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise 20 bliain agus nithe gaolmhara. Mar is eol don Teach, foilsíodh an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030 i mí na Nollag 2010 tar éis tacaíocht traspháirtí a fháil i dTithe an Oireachtais agus próiseas comhairliúcháin agus taighde. Ón uair gur foilsíodh an straitéis, tá dul chun cinn suntasach déanta ar chur i bhfeidhm na réimsí gnímh éagsúla atá luaite inti. Mar chuid de phlean athnuachana na Státseirbhíse, eagraíodh díospóireacht oscailte ar an bpolasaí faoin straitéis i mí na Nollag 2015 ar mhaithe le breathnú siar ar an méid a bhí déanta go dtí sin maidir lena cur i bhfeidhm, chomh maith le breathnú chun cinn ar na tosaíochtaí ina leith don chúig bliana amach romhainn. Mar chuid den phróiseas sin, reáchtáladh sraith cruinnithe poiblí agus lorgaíodh aighneachtaí scríofa ón bpobal agus ó pháirtithe leasmhara araon. Ceapadh Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge in Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh le tuairisc maidir leis an díospóireacht oscailte agus na príomhthosaíochtaí straitéiseacha don tréimhse amach romhainn a chur i dtoll a chéile. Cuireadh an tuairisc seo faoi bhráid an choiste chomhairligh a bunaíodh chun tacú le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise. Fuarthas tuairimí agus moltaí an choiste ina leith agus tá plean gníomhaíochta don tréimhse 2017 go 2022, ina bhfuil spriocanna sonracha agus amscálaí ina leith, á chur i dtoll a chéile ag mo Roinn faoi láthair. Ós rud é go bhfuil freagracht thras-rannach i gceist maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise, tá plé ar bun ag mo Roinn leis na páirtithe leasmhara éagsúla maidir le spriocanna sonracha agus tráthchlár ina leith a aontú. Is é nádúr na hoibre seo go dtógann sé am le nithe a aontú. Cé go n-aithnítear go bhfuil moill áirithe ar an sprioc ama a bhí luaite roimhe seo, leanfar ag obair i gcomhar leis na páirtithe leasmhara ábhartha i dtreo a bheith in ann an plean a fhoilsiú chomh luath agus is féidir. Táim ar an airdeall chomh maith faoin gá atá ann a chinntiú oiread agus is féidir go bhfuil fiúntas leis an gclár bearta a mbeifear ag súil leis a chur san áireamh mar chuid den phlean críochnúil. Tá gá dá réir a chinntiú go bhfuil téagar agus fiúntas le pé beart a bheidh sa phlean i ndeireadh thiar thall. Fáiltím roimh an mhaoiniú breise do mo Roinn i gcáinaisnéis 2018 a fógraíodh coicís ó shin. Ciallaíonn an €2.5 milliún breise atá á chur ar fáil go mbeidh maoiniú breise de níos mó ná €5 mhilliún ar fáil thar dhá bhliain. Tá an Rialtas seo dírithe ar theacht leis an tiomantas dár gcultúr atá le feiceáil i mórán de na heagraíochtaí díograiseacha atá ar fud an Stáit, taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. San áireamh sa bhuiséad don bhliain seo chugainn tá €1.4 milliún breise chun tacú leis an phróiseas pleanála teanga faoin straitéis 20 bliain, agus €400,000 de mhaoiniú breise d'Údarás na Gaeltachta chun infheistiú ina chláir caipitil agus chun tacaí a mhéadú do chomharchumainn agus d’eagraíochtaí forbartha pobail na Gaeltachta, rud a fhágann go bhfuil an maoiniú caipitil don údarás méadaithe go €7 milliún. Chomh maith leis sin, tá leithdháileadh breise de €687,000 le cur ar fáil do scéimeanna tacaíochta teanga na Roinne lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá €2.65 milliún á chur ar fáil faoi bhuiséad 2018 do chur i bhfeidhm an phróisis pleanála teanga an bhliain seo chugainn. Is ionann sin agus ardú €1.8 milliún thar an allúntas atá ar fáil don phróiseas sa bhliain reatha. Ina theannta sin, ar ndóigh, tá ardú ar an gcistíocht atá ar fáil do na gnáthchláir reatha ar thaobh na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, a bhfuil dlúthbhaint acu chomh maith le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise 20 bliain. Leis an allúntas méadaithe atá curtha ar fáil don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht trí chéile, tá ag éirí le mo Roinn tacú tuilleadh le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise agus an phróisis pleanála teanga mar a bhaineann sé leis an nGaeltacht, leis na bailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta agus leis na líonraí Gaeilge. Mar is iondúil ag an tráth seo den bhliain, tá an phleanáil chuí idir lámha ag mo Roinn i gcomhar leis an údarás, leis an bhforas agus go deimhin le páirtithe leasmhara eile chun cúram cuí a dhéanamh den chistíocht shuntasach seo sa chaoi is go mbainfear an leas is fearr as ar son na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.Ní call dom a rá go n-aithníonn mo Roinn an ról lárnach atá ag an teaghlach mar a bhaineann sé le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge go bisiúil chuig an chéad ghlúin eile. Sa chomhthéacs sin, ba mhaith liom an deis a thapú chun cúpla focal a rá faoin gclár tacaíochta teaghlaigh. Is í aidhm an chláir seo, a ceapadh mar bheart faoi leith le cúram a dhéanamh de réimsí na Gaeltachta agus an teaghlaigh de chuid na straitéise, tacú ar bhealach ilghnéitheach le treisiú na Gaeilge i dteaghlaigh Gaeltachta. Faoin gclár seo, cuirtear cúnamh ar fáil trí scéimeanna agus tionscnaimh faoi leith de chuid mo Roinn ar leasa theaghlaigh na Gaeltachta atá ag tógáil clainne le Gaeilge nó a dteastaíonn uathu é sin a dhéanamh. Tá mo Roinn i mbun forbartha faoi láthair ar fheachtas nua feasachta i dtaca leis an bpacáiste teanga i gcomhar le haltraí poiblí Fheidhmeannacht na Seirbhíse Sláinte agus fógrófar tuilleadh eolais faoi sin sna seachtainí atá romhainn. Mar is eol don Teach, tugann Acht na Gaeltachta 2012 feidhm reachtúil don phróiseas pleanála teanga faoina mbeidh pleananna teanga á n-ullmhú ag leibhéal an phobail i gceantair a bhféadfaí aitheantas a thabhairt dóibh faoin Acht mar limistéir pleanála teanga Ghaeltachta, mar bhailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta nó mar líonraí Gaeilge. Ag an bpointe seo, tá an próiseas chun pleananna teanga a ullmhú ag leibhéal an phobail tosaithe sna limistéir pleanála teanga Ghaeltachta ar fad atá leagtha amach faoin bpróiseas. I mí Aibreáin na bliana seo, d'fhógair mé allúntas suas le €100,000 thar thréimhse 12 mhí i leith gach limistéar pleanála teanga faoi leith ina mbeidh feidhmiú plean teanga aontaithe ag tosú sa bhliain reatha. An mhí seo a chuaigh thart, d'fhógair mé go bhfuil an chéad trí phlean teanga Gaeltachta ceadaithe. Táthar ag dréim go mbeidh pleananna i leith suas le hocht limistéar eile réitithe ag Údarás na Gaeltachta le cur faoi bhráid mo Roinne roimh dheireadh na bliana seo. Beidh an maoiniú breise atá ceadaithe chun tacú leis an phróiseas pleanála teanga in 2018 rí-thábhachtach de réir mar a bheidh breis pleananna teanga á gceadú. Anuas air sin, tá forbairt déanta ag mo Roinn ar an chóras faisnéise geografaí, GIS, chun tacú leis an phobal agus pleananna teanga á n-ullmhú acu. Is forbairt shuntasach, cheannródaíoch atá i gceist leis seo. Den chéad uair riamh, beidh staitisticí agus sonraí faoi leith ar fáil i dtaca le gach limistéar pleanála teanga mar aonaid astu féin. Ní amháin go mbeidh sé níos fusa ag lucht pleanála teanga an córas a úsáid, ach cuirfear an t-eolas i láthair ar bhealach atá tarraingteach don phobal trí chéile. Ag an bpointe seo, ba mhaith liom an deis a thapú chun tréaslú leis na ceanneagraíochtaí ar fud na Gaeltachta atá i mbun ullmhú agus feidhmiú pleananna teanga. Tá obair mhór déanta agus idir lámha ag na heagraíochtaí sin ar son na Gaeilge, ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son an phobail ina bhfuil siad ag maireachtáil. Is é an spiorad sin, spiorad na meithle, atá ag croílár an phróisis agus is cóir agus is ceart é sin a aithint. Ina theannta sin, ar ndóigh, tá obair idir lámha chun an próiseas a bhrú ar aghaidh mar a bhaineann sé leis na bailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta. Chuige sin, tá an t-údarás agus Foras na Gaeilge i mbun oibre le páirtithe leasmhara i Leitir Ceanainn, cathair na Gaillimhe agus Daingean Uí Chúis chun an próiseas pleanála teanga sna bailte sin a bhrú chun cinn. Chomh maith leis sin, tá tús curtha leis an phróiseas pleanála teanga i gCluain Dolcáin, in Inis agus i mBaile Locha Riach i dtreo a bheith in ann aitheantas mar líonraí Gaeilge a bhronnadh ar na ceantair sin. Ní call dom a rá ar ndóigh go leanfaidh mé orm, mar Aire Stáit ar a bhfuil freagracht as gnóthaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, le gach iarracht gur féidir agus gur gá a dhéanamh chun an oiread agus is féidir cistíochta a fháil chun tacú leis an phróiseas tábhachtach seo atá, agus a bheidh, ag croílár chlár oibre mo Roinne mar a bhaineann sé leis an Ghaeltacht sna blianta atá romhainn. Ba mhaith liom anois cúpla focal a rá faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta. Níl aon amhras ach go bhfuil obair thábhachtach déanta ag an údarás anuas tríd na blianta ar mhaithe le saol eacnamaíochta, cultúrtha agus sóisialta phobal na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn. De thoradh na hoibre atá ar bun ag foireann dhíograiseach an údaráis ar son na Gaeltachta ar bhonn leanúnach, tá deiseanna fostaíochta agus fiontraíochta cothaithe agus cruthaithe i gceantair nach bhfaigheadh na deiseanna sin murach gur ann don eagraíocht. Ní gá a rá go bhfuil an obair atá déanta agus idir lámha ag an eagraíocht thar a bheith tábhachtach chun pobal bisiúil na Gaeltachta a chaomhnú agus a chothú. Is ábhar sásaimh é mar gur éirigh leis an údarás 559 post a chruthú anuraidh agus gur cuireadh €300,000 breise ar fáil don eagraíocht do 2018. Fágann sé sin gurb é €7 milliún an bunlíne nua caipitil i mbuiséad 2018 don údarás. Ní miste dom a lua freisin go bhfuil allúntas breise de €1.5 milliún in airgead caipitil curtha ar fáil don údarás i mbliana, chomh maith le €2.4 milliún anuraidh. Fágann sé sin go bhfuil €3.9 milliún sa bhreis ar an bhunlíne curtha ar fáil don údarás le dhá bhliain anuas, idir 2016 agus 2017. Táim sásta go dtabharfaidh an t-allúntas breise seo deis don údarás roinnt tograí caipitil tábhachtacha a bhrú chun cinn in 2018 agus tuilleadh fostaíochta a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht dá bharr. Tuigfidh an Teach gur ar an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna a thiteann an fhreagracht an polasaí don oideachas Gaeltachta 2017-2022 a chur i bhfeidhm. D'fhéadfaí á rá gur aisfhreagra suntasach is ea an polasaí seo ar a bhfuil ráite agus molta sa straitéis 20 bliain mar a bhaineann sé le cúrsaí oideachais sa Ghaeltacht. Mar léiriú breise ar dháiríreacht leanúnach an Rialtais seo chun cúram a dhéanamh do chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise, is díol suntais é go bhfuil aonad pholasaí oideachais Gaeltachta faoi leith bunaithe cheana féin ag mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire, an Teachta Bruton, chun cur i bhfeidhm an pholasaí a bhrú chun cinn. Léiríonn sé seo uile go bhfuil céim thábhachtach eile chun cinn glactha ag an Rialtas ar son na Gaeilge agus cur i bhfeidhm córasach na straitéise. Foilsíodh torthaí an athbhreithnithe ar Bhille na dteangacha oifigiúla (leasú) 2014 i mí Aibreán 2014. De bharr mhíshástacht le cuid de na leasuithe a bhí molta, níor foilsíodh an Bille agus tógadh cinneadh athbhreithniú eile a dhéanamh ar an mBille ag an am sin. Tar éis tréimhse fada comhairliúcháin, foilsíodh ceannteidil an Bhille úr i mí Meitheamh na bliana seo. Tá iarracht déanta sna ceannteidil seo dul i ngleic le dhá mhórcheist - na scéimeanna teanga agus an earcaíocht sa tseirbhís phoiblí. Mar sin, mar chuid den Bhille nua, tá sé i gceist córas na gcaighdeán a thabhairt isteach in áit na scéimeanna teanga. Faoin gcóras seo, bheadh rangú le déanamh ar chomhlachtaí poiblí, ag baint úsáide as rialacháin chun caighdeáin a leagan síos do na comhlachtaí sin. Ar an mbealach seo, beidh muid in ann a chinntiú go mbeidh na caighdeáin is airde ó thaobh úsáid na Gaeilge de bainteach leis na heagraíochtaí a mbíonn ag soláthar seirbhísí don phobal, pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta san áireamh. Má tá an chórais nua seo chun a bheith éifeachtach, beidh orainn díriú isteach ar chúrsaí earcaíochta. Is é ceann de na príomhfhadhbanna a chuireann bac ar sheirbhísí a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge ná nach bhfuil na daoine leis na scileanna cuí fostaithe sna hoifigí cuí. Má tá muid chun feabhas a chur air seo, caithfidh an Stát líon na bhfostaithe Stáit atá in ann seirbhísí a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge a mhéadú agus a chinntiú go bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil ag oifigigh Stáit atá ag feidhmiú i gceantair Ghaeltachta. Chuige sin, beidh sé mar chuspóir sa Bhille go mbeidh 20% de na daoine nua a earcaítear don tseirbhís phoiblí ina gcainteoirí Gaeilge, go mbeidh gach oifig phoiblí atá lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht ag feidhmiú trí Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh na comhlachtaí in ann freastal ar an éileamh ón bpobal ar sheirbhísí trí Ghaeilge. Ní tharlóidh sé seo thar oíche. Creidim gurb í an earcaíocht croílár na ceiste, agus táim dóchasach gur féidir tógáíl, ar bhonn chéimiúil, ar líon na bhfostaithe le Gaeilge agus, ag eascairt as sin, go mbeimid in ann feabhas a chur ar sholáthar seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge mar is cóir. Faoi láthair, tá mo Roinn ag obair i gcomhréir le hOifig an Ard-Aighne chun an Bille a dhréachtú. Ag an am céanna, agus ó foilsíodh na ceannteidil, táthar i mbun comhairliúcháin leis na Ranna Stáit ábhartha, eagrais Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, an Coimisinéir Teanga, agus páirtithe leasmhara eile le cinntiú go mbeidh an Bille is fearr agus is éifeachtaí agam le tabhairt os comhair an Oireachtais. Tá na ceannteidil curtha faoi bhráid Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOileán chun scrúdú réamhreachtach a dhéanamh orthu, agus táthar ag súil go mbeidh an Bille réidh le foilsiú sa chéad ráithe de 2018. Díreoidh mé anois ar an Ghaeilge san Aontas Eorpach. Tá síneadh cúig bliana eile go 31 Nollaig 2021 curtha leis an mhaolú atá i bhfeidhm maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge in institiúidí an Aontais Eorpaigh. Chomhaontaigh Comhairle an Aontais Eorpaigh ar 3 Nollaig 2015 rialacháin a dhéanamh lena leagtar amach méadú incriminteach ar na catagóirí de reachtaíocht an AE atá le haistriú go Gaeilge agus leanúint lena gcur chuige réamhghníomhach i dtaobh eolas a chuirtear ar fáil i nGaeilge faoi ghníomhaíochtaí an AE a mhéadú. Tá roinnt céimeanna tógtha anseo in Éirinn agus sa Bhruiséil chun tabhairt faoi dheireadh a chur leis an mhaolú in 2021. Tá ionad náisiúnta barr feabhais bunaithe ag mo Roinn chun oiliúint chuí a chur ar chéimithe le Gaeilge agus chun feidhmiú mar phointe teagmhála d'institiúidí an Aontais Eorpaigh más mian leo daoine a fhostú ar chonarthaí sealadacha.Tá obair ar siúl ag an gCoimisiún Eorpach agus ag institiúidí an Aontais chun a chinntiú go n-earcófar líon dhóthanach pearsanra le Gaeilge chun deireadh céimiúil an mhaolaithe a bhainistiú. Chuige seo, reáchtáil mo Roinn, i gcomhar leis an Aontas Eorpach, comhdháil coicís ó shin i mBaile Átha Cliath a bhí dírithe ar líonra saineolaithe a fhorbairt in Éirinn chun cur le caighdeán oibre na dteangeolaithe agus dlítheangeolaithe sna hinstitiúidí Eorpacha. An tseachtain chéanna, reáchtáil an Roinn, i gcomhar leis an ionad taighde ADAPT, Ollscoil Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath agus Ard-Stiúrthóireacht Aistriúcháin an Choimisiúin Eorpaigh, seimineár lae ar chomhordú acmhainní na dteangacha Eorpacha in Éirinn. Faoin togra seo, tá an Coimisiún Eorpach ag tacú leis an Roinn agus le ADAPT chun ardán aistriúcháin uathoibreach a fhorbairt don Ghaeilge. Beidh an t-ardán seo tairbheach d'aistritheoirí in institiúidí an Aontais chun dul i ngleic leis an tromualach aistriúcháin. Ag tús na míosa seo d’eagraigh an Roinn, i gcomhar le Cúirt Bhreithiúnais an Aontas Eorpaigh, seisiún eolais maidir le deiseanna fostaíochta do chéimithe le dlí agus an Ghaeilge i Lucsamburg. Rinne ard-stiúrthóir aistriúcháin an Chúirt Bhreithiúnais san Aontas Eorpach cur i láthair do chéimithe, do mhic léinn, d'abhcóidí agus d'aturnaetha faoi na deiseanna earcaiochta sa chúirt. Tá an Roinn ag obair faoi láthair ar scéim úr socrúcháin oibre a réiteach chun intéirnigh a chur chuig na hinstitiúidí Eorpacha ar feadh tréimhse cúig mhí. Beidh na hintéirnigh seo i mbun obair aistriúcháin le linn na tréimhse seo. Cuideoidh an scéim le hintéirnigh oiliúint a fháil ó na hinstitiúidí. Leis na forbairtí seo uile, táim lán-mhuiníneach go mbeidh ar ár gcumas deireadh a chur leis an mhaolú in 2021. Bunaíodh an ciste tríú leibhéal thar lear in 2006 chun teagasc na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn in institiúidí tríú leibhéal i dtíortha eile. Is iad aidhmeanna an chiste dea-thoil i leith na Gaeilge agus an chultúir Ghaelach i gcoitinne a spreagadh agus a chothú trasna na hEorpa, i Stáit Aontaithe Mheiriceá, i gCeanada agus níos faide i gcéin. Tríd an tionscnamh seo, cruthaítear ardán don Ghaeilge trínar féidir eolas a chur uirthi ar bhonn idirnáisiúnta. Cuireann sé go mór le scoláireacht na Gaeilge i measc an phobail acadúil idirnáisiúnta agus méadaítear stádas na teanga dá réir. Tá ag éirí go han-mhaith leis an tionscnamh seo agus tá méadú leanúnach tagtha ar na hiarratais faoin scéim ó bhliain go bliain. Mar léiriú ar sin, ceadaíodh deontais de €1.8 milliún san iomlán don tréimhse 2016-2017 go 2018-2019 le os cionn 40 ollscoil agus coláistí tríú leibhéal timpeall an domhain. Tugann an cúnamh seo deis chomh maith d'ollscoileanna Eorpacha, don Choimisiún Fulbright agus don Fhondúireacht Ollscoile Éireann Cheanada scoláireachtaí a bhronnadh ar mhic léinn chun cuairt a thabhairt ar Éirinn agus freastal ar chúrsaí Gaeilge sna ceantair Ghaeltachta i rith an tsamhraidh. Tá sár-obair ar bun ag na heagraíochtaí taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, ag obair go díograiseach chun úsáid na teanga a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt ar fud na tíre, agus is deas liom gur tugadh aitheantas dóibh sa bhuiséad. Tá ceannáras nua anois ag Foras na Gaeilge, agus iad anois lonnaithe ar Shráid Amiens i dtuaisceart Bhaile Átha Cliath, agus guím gach rath orthu san ionad nua seo. Bíonn Foras na Gaeilge ag gníomhú ar bhonn leanúnach i gcomhréir leis an sé cheanneagraíocht atá faoina chúram, is iad sin Gaelscoileanna Teoranta, Gael Linn, Glór na nGael, Oireachtas na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge agus Cumann na bhFiann. Tionólfar Oireachtas na Samhna na bliana seo idir 1 Samhain agus 5 Samhain i gCill Airne, agus ba mhaith liom moladh go láidir do Chomhaltaí freastal ar an bhféile seo más féidir. Beidh mise ansin. Tá Foras na Gaeilge freagrach as oibriú le pobail i mbailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta, de réir mar is cuí, agus i líonraí Gaeilge chun pleananna teanga a ullmhú agus a fheidhmiú sna ceantair sin, agus cuidíonn siad le pobal na Gaeilge agus lucht spéise na Gaeilge ar fud an domhain trí bhéim a chur ar sheirbhísí agus áiseanna ar líne. Cuireann Foras na Gaeilge maoiniú ar fáil do réimse leathan tionscadal trí scéimeanna éagsúla a chuidíonn leis an aos óg. Tá an scéim Gaelbhratach dírithe ar scoileanna agus ag feidhmiú i 70 scoil. Tá deiseanna foghlamtha á gcur ar fáil chomh maith trí scéim na gcampaí samhraidh. Tá scéimeanna agus tionscadail ar fáil ón bhforas chun úsáid na teanga sna healaíona, sna meáin agus sna hilmheáin a chur chun cinn, lena n-áirítear scéim na gcomplachtaí drámaíochta, scéim na bhféilte, scéim na foilsitheoireachta agus scéim na dtionscadal litríochta. Tuigtear an ról an-tábhachtach atá ag gnólachtaí maidir le forbairt agus spreagadh na Gaeilge, go háirithe sna limistéir pleanála teanga. Cuirtear tacaíocht ar fáil ón bhforas d'fhorbairt na Gaeilge san earnáil ghnó tríd an bhfeachtas feasachta Gnó Means Business agus trí scéimeanna ar nós scéim na gcomharthaí dátheangacha. Is cuid luachmhar dár n-oidhreacht logainmneacha na tíre. Tá forbairt leanúnach á dhéanamh ar an suíomh logainm.ie ag an mBrainse Logainmneacha, ar cuid de mo Roinn é, i gcomhar le Fiontar agus Scoil na Gaeilge in Ollscoil Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath agus le tacaíocht airgid ón Rialtas. Sa bhliain 2017, mar shampla, scrúdaigh agus shocraigh an brainse na leaganacha Gaeilge do 400 logainm i gContae Chill Mhantáin, agus do 200 logainm i gContae Chiarraí. I gcaitheamh na bliana freisin, cuireadh na leaganacha Gaeilge do 1,500 logainm i gContae Laoise os comhair an Choiste Logainmneacha le hiniúchadh. Is coiste Stáit neamhspleách é an Coiste Logainmneacha, ceaptha agamsa, agus a oibríonn ar bhonn deonach agus tá moladh mór ag dul do bhaill an choiste sin as a gcuid oibre. Tá an-éileamh ar an suíomh logainm.ie. I gcaitheamh na míosa seo caite, mar shampla, thug 26,000 cuairteoir uathúil cuairt ar an suíomh agus sa bhliain 2016, tháinig fiosrúcháin tríd an suíomh idirlín céanna faoi isteach is amach le 1,000 logainm. Creidim go láidir go bhfuil féidearthachtaí móra ann cuidiú le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge tríd an teicneolaíocht. Is cúis sásaimh agus dóchais é an chaoi go bhfuil an Ghaeilge le fáil go forleathan cheana ar na meáin dhigiteacha. Tóg mar shampla na hardáin éagsúla ilmheáin atá forbartha ag RTÉ, TG4 agus RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta. Tá tábhacht ar leith le nuachtáin agus irisí Gaeilge ar nós tuairisc.ie agus an Irish Independent achan dara Céadaoin. Tá forbairtí mhóra déanta agus á ndéanamh ar chorpas na Gaeilge leis an bhfoclóir nua foclóir.ie agus an suíomh téarma.ie. Chomh maith leis sin, tá tacaíocht á tabhairt ag mo Roinn d'Acadamh Ríoga na hÉireann chun foclóir stairiúil na Gaeilge a chur i gcrích. Bhí mé ar ócáid stairiúil aréir in oifigí Acadamh Ríoga na hÉireann. Anuas ar na forbairtí seo go léir, tá córais ríomhaistriúcháin don Ghaeilge forbartha ag DCU agus TCD agus tá an tionscadal taighde abair.ie i gColáiste na Tríonóide ag déanamh tuilleadh forbartha ar shintéiseoir Gaeilge, is é sin, córas inar féidir téacs scríofa a aistriú go caint bheo i gcanúintí éagsúla. Chun na deiseanna teicneolaíochta seo ar fad a threisiú san am amach romhainn, tá plean digiteach don Ghaeilge á ullmhú faoi láthair le tacaíocht na Roinne agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé réidh le seoladh gan mhoill. Chomh maith leis seo, tá maoiniú cheithre bliana ceadaithe ag mo Roinn don tionscadail Gaeltech chun tuilleadh taighde agus forbairt a dhéanamh ar theicneolaíocht na Gaeilge maidir le próiseáil teanga nádúrtha na Gaeilge atá á chur i gcrích ag an ionad ADAPT in Ollscoil Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath. Mar atá ráite go minic roimhe seo, ní miste dom a threisiú arís gur dóigh liom go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar cheann de na hacmhainní nádúrtha is luachmhaire atá againn. Creideann an Rialtas go bhfuil tábhacht ag baint le pobal labhartha láidir Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta a chothú chun saibhreas oidhreachta na teanga a choinneáil beo amach anseo agus a thabhairt slán don chéad ghlúin eile. Cé go bhfuil an Rialtas tiomanta gach a dhéanamh laistigh dá chumhacht chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, tá todhchaí na teanga ag brath go príomha ar an bpobal. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil dearcadh dearfach ag tromlach an phobail i leith na teanga. Tá orainn timpeallacht a chothú ina mbraitheann daoine muiníneach as a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid, is cuma cén leibhéal cumais atá acu inti. Tá sé riachtanach go leanfar ag baint leas as an teanga mar theanga phobail agus teaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht agus go gcuirfear an teanga chun cinn ar bhonn níos forleithne taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Ar deireadh, ba mhaith liomsa tiomantas agus dáiríreacht an Rialtais i leith chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise 20 bliain a threisiú uair amháin eile anseo inniu. Táim sásta go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh maidir le raon leathan gníomhaíochtaí faoin straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm de réir a chéile. Tá mé ag súil go mór leis an díospóreacht a tharlóidh amach anseo sa Seanad inniu.

Ní bheidh mé ag úsáid mo chuid ama go léir.Tá sé mar chuspóir ag Fianna Fáil ó thráth a bhunaithe an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar theanga bheo i measc na ndaoine agus cearta na ndaoine a labhraíonn an teanga a chosaint. Tá an teanga náisiúnta mar cheann de seoda cultúrtha na tíre seo. Ní féidir cur síos ar an tábhacht chinniúnach atá léi dá réir. Agus níos mó ná 100 bliain caite ó tharla Éirí Amach 1916, is ríghéar an gá borradh agus brí a chur an athuair sna hiarrachtaí úsáid na Gaeilge a bhuanú agus a fhorbairt. Seasann Fianna Fáil go daingean leis an straitéis 20 bIiain don Ghaeilge, a thug ár bpáirtí chun cinn agus muid sa Riaitas, agus lena chur i bhfeidhm. Thug an páirtí Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 isteach chun bonn reachtaíochta a chur don chéad uair faoi na cearta maidir leis an teanga atá mar dhlúthchuid den Bhunreacht. Bhí Fianna Fáil i mbun feachtais ar son maoiniú breise don Ghaeilge roimh an mbuiséad. Dá bhrí sin, cuirimid fáilte roimh an mhaoiniú breise de €2.5 milliún le haghaidh an straitéis 20 bliain a chur chun cinn a bheidh ar fáil an bhliain seo chugainn. Is díol trua nach raibh aon dhúthracht maidir leis an teanga, nó le cearta teanga a chosaint, ag rith dáiríre leis an Rialtas roimhe seo, a bhí faoi cheannas Fine Gael. Ní mór ceannródaíocht leanúnach agua cistíocht ionas go mbeadh rath ar an straitéis 20 bliain a thabhairt i bhfeidhm. Anuas air sin, leagadh amach mar ghealltanas i gclár an Riaitais sa bhliain 2011 go ndéanfaí smaoineamh ar deireadh a chur leis an nGaeilge éigeantach san ardteistiméireacht. Is léiriú eile é sin ar mheon Fhine Gael. Mar is eol dúinn, tá polasaí láidir ag Fianna Fáil i leith na Gaeilge. Bhí cur chun cinn na Gaeilge mar bhunaidhm ariamh ag an bpáirtí ó bunaíodh é sa bhliain 1926. Idir 1997 agus 2011 thóg Fianna Fáil céimeanna móra leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn. Mar shampla, tógadh isteach Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003, bunaíodh Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga, bunaíodh Foras na Gaeilge, cuireadh cearta teanga san áireamh i ndlíthe éagsúla ar nós Achtanna oideachais agus Achtanna pleanála agus bunaíodh Coimisiún na Gaeltachta. Glacadh leis an straitéis 20 bliain agus tháinig forbairt air. Chinntíomar go ndearnadh mórchuid caiteachais ar bhunstruchtúir Gaeltachta agus Gaeilge. Bunaíodh an Comhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta. I rith ár dtréimhse in oifig, tháinig méadú ar líon na gcainteoirí Gaeilge taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Nuair a d'fhoilsigh Fianna Fáil a manifesto le haghaidh olltoghchán na bliana 2016, shocraíomar ar fheachtasaíocht a dhéanamh ar son spriocanna éagsúla, ina measc go mbeadh Aire sinsearach ann a bheadh an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge mar phríomhchúraimí air nó uirthi; go gcuirfear coiste Oireachtais ar bun a bheadh freagrach as gnóthaí na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge; go dtabharfaí faoi na deacrachtaí cistíochta atá ag Foras na Gaeilge agus ag Údarás na Gaeltachta trí acmhainní breise a chur ar fáil dóibh; agus go gcinnteofar go mbeadh an Ghaeilge i gcónaí mar chroíchuid den churaclam le haghaidh an teastas sóisearach agus an ardteistiméireacht. Cé nach bhfuil Fianna Fáil sa Riaitas, táimíd ag gníomhú go tairbheach ar bhinsí an Fhreasúra ag féachaint leis na haidhmeanna polasaí seo a bhaint amach. Dírítear ar an nGaeilge faoi thrí chinn de théamaí i gclár an Rialtais: an straitéis 20 bliain, cúrsaí teanga agus eacnamaíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge mar theanga iomlán oibre de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh. Coinneoidh Fianna Fáil an Rialtas dílis do na gealltanais dá réir sin.

Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé dáiríre faoin Ghaeilge agus faoin chultúr. Thug sé léargas an-iomlán dúinn faoin méid atá ag tarlú faoina cheannaireacht. Tá cúpla rud le rá agam. Agus mé ag breathnú timpeall an tSeomra seo, is léir nach bhfuil mórán dúinn i láthair. Cén suim dáiríre atá againn ó thaobh cúrsaí Gaeilge, cultúrtha agus teanga de? Ba chóir go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó Seanadóirí anseo ach, faraor, níl. Ba mhaith liom ceithre phointe a dhéanamh san óráid seo. Tá an-suim sa Ghaeilge i measc an phobail. Léirigh torthaí daonáireamh na bliana seo caite gur bhfuil Gaeilge ag breis agus 1.7 milliún duine sa tír seo, nó idir 40% agus 50% de dhaonra na hÉireann. Is léir go bhfuil suim acu sa teanga. Ba mhaith liom a chur i leith an Aire Stáit go bhfuil an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge lochtach. Inseoidh mé cúpla fáth go bhfuil lochtanna móra sa phlean. Ba mhaith liom freisin cúpla tuairim nó moltaí pearsanta a chur in iúl don Aire Stáit maidir leis an gcaoi inar féidir an Ghaeilge a fhorbairt. Ar aon leis an Aire Stáit, beidh mé i láthair ag Oireachtas na Samhna. B'fhéidir go mbeidh damhsa sean-nós againn lena chéile. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht i gcruachás. Ní bheidh aon Ghaeltacht ann faoi deich mbliana eile, faraor. Tá bearna mór idir sheirbhísí an Stáit agus pobal na Gaeltachta. Tá mé ag caint faoi dhaoine ar nós mise, a rugadh agus a tógadh sa Ghaeltacht agus atá fós ina gcónaí ann. Bhí sé mar bhunaidhm ag an bplean 20 bliain go meadofaí lucht labhartha na Gaeilge ó 83,000 go 250,000 roimh 2030. Tá muid beagnach leath bealaigh tríd an tréimhse sin agus, mar is eol don Aire Stáit, táimid ag dul sa threo mícheart. Tá líon na gcainteoirí laghdaithe ó 83,000 go 73,000. Bhí sé mar aidhm freisin go mbeadh méadú de 25% ar líon na cainteoirí dúchais ó 23,000 go dtí 29,000, ach tá an grúpa sin laghdaithe ó 23,000 go dtí 20,600. Tá na fírící ag rá rud difriúil. Faraor, táimid ag dul an bealach mícheart. Mar gheall ar sin, ceapaim go raibh an plean lochtach ón tús, faraor. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil cúpla cúis leis seo. Ó thaobh infheistíochta de, tháinig laghdú de 70% ar bhuiséad Údarás na Gaeltachta ó 2007 go dtí 2016. Mar chomparáid, tá méadú de 24% tagtha ar bhuiséad IDA Ireland agus tá méadú de 19% tagtha ar bhuiséad Fiontraíocht Éireann. Céard a léiríonn an easpa suime seo do dhaoine atá ag obair sa Ghaeltacht agus in Údarás na Gaeltachta? Cuireann sé gliondar orm go bhfuil an tAire Stáit agus an Roinn ag breathú ar sin agus go bhfuil méadú beag tugtha don údarás le haghaidh 2018, ach tá i bhfad níos mó ag teastáil leis an údarás a chur ar an leibhéal céanna leis na heagrais Stáit atá ag plé le fostaíocht in áiteanna nach ceantair Ghaeltachta iad. Maidir le cúrsaí oideachais, tá scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge fíorthábhachtach do na Gaeltachtaí agus do dhaoine a chuireann a gcuid gasúir chuig na Gaeltachtaí. Is sa Ghaeltacht a fhaigheann daoine óga an spreagadh ó thaobh na Gaeilge agus cultúir de. Idir 2011 agus 2015, tháinig laghdú de 15% ar thacaíocht na Roinne don scéim sin. Faraor, tá sé ag dul an treo mícheart. Is fiú €20 milliún don eacnamaíocht áitiúil na colaistí Gaeilge, agus téann thart ar 40 cent as chuile €1 as sin ar ais go dtí an Stát. Dá bhrí sin, dá mbéinn ag plé le h-infheistíocht, chuirfinn an t-airgead isteach san earnáil seo. Bíonn return on investment de 40% ann chuile bliain. Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, tugann na gníomhaíochtaí seo deis do mhná tí na Gaeltachta ioncam breise a fháil. Cabhraíonn sé le turasóireacht agus le fostaíocht áitiuil. Ba chóir an gné seo a fhorbairt le tacaíocht a thabhairt do níos mó paistí agus deagóirí theacht chuig na Gaeltachtaí le haghaidh cúrsaí seachtaine agus cúrsaí trí seachtaine. Spreagadh sé sin méadú ar an méid cúrsaí atá ann faoi láthair. Ba cheart freisin go dtabharfaí deiseanna do státseirbhísigh cúrsaí seachtaine nó deireadh seachtaine a dhéanamh i gceantair Ghaeltachta ar nós na Dúnaibh - áit dúchais an Aire Stáit - agus Conamara. Ba chóir é sin a ghríosadh i measc na státseirbhísigh. Bíonn mé ag caint le go leor acu. Ba bhreá leo deis mar seo a fháil. Ní dóigh liom go gcosnódh sé mórán airgid. Tá 143 bhunscoil agus 41 iarbhunscoil sa Stát atá ag múineadh na hábhair trí mheán na Gaeilge agus iad ag freastal ar níos mó ná 60,000 scoláire. Tá fadhb an-mhór ann maidir le easpa múinteoirí, go háirithe i mBaile Átha Cliath. Baineann sé seo leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna ar chuid bheag nó cuid mhór. Tá fadhb níos mó arís ag Gaelscoileanna de bharr an easpa múinteoirí atá ábalta na hábhair a mhúineadh trí mheán na Gaeilge. Níl na scoileanna sin in ann múinteoirí a fháil. Tá daoine atá imithe amach ar phinsean á dtabhairt ar ais le ranganna a mhúineadh anseo is ansiúd. Tá sé seo ag cruthú fadhbanna inniu agus cruthóidh sé i bhfad níos mó fadhbanna faoi cheann cúig nó deich mbliana eile. Tá dhá chúis leis an easpa múinteoirí seo - an pá íseal agus an costas mór maireachtála í mBaile Átha Cliath. Maidir le cúrsaí gnó, is as ceantar na Dúnaibh an Aire Stáit. B'fhéidir go mbeidh sé ag togáil amach i gComórtas Peile na Gaeltachta 2018, a bheidh ar siúl sna Dúnaibh faoi cheann cúpla mí eile.

Tar éis dom bheith thuas ann ag Comórtas Peile na Gaeltachta cheana, tá a fhios agam go bhfuil muintir an Dúnaibh an-bhródúil as an Aire Stáit. Mar is eol don Aire Stáit go maith, tá na Dúnaibh os cionn ceithre uair an chloig as Baile Átha Cliath. Tá rudaí áirithe ag teastáil ansin ó thaobh cúrsaí gnóthaí de. Caithfimid breathnú ar féidearthachtaí áitiúla. Tá Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin an-mhaith, ach cé go gcabhraíonn an méid atá á dhéanamh ag Fáilte Éireann sa chomhthéacs sin, tá níos mó tacaíochta ag teastáil le indigenous industries, mar a deirtear i mBéarla, a chothú agus a neartú. Tá ceantair ar nós na Dúnaibh ag brath go mór ar chúrsaí turasóireachta, ach ní mhaireann séasúr na turasóireachta níos mó ná dhá mhí sa bhliain. Sin an méid. Mar a phléigh mé leis an Aire Stáit roimhe seo, tá an-suim ag pobal na Dúnaibh sa Ghaeilge agus i bhforbairt na Gaeilge. Caithfear níos mó tacaíochta a thabhairt don phobal sin. Níl na Ranna Stáit ar an leathanach céanna ar chor ar bith, faraor. Tá silo effect ann ar bhealaí éagsúla. Déanann dream amháin cuid amháin agus déanann dream eile cuid eile. Dúirt an tAire Stáit ina óráid go bhfuil sé ag déanamh iarrachta iad a tharraingt le chéile níos mó. Tá céim láidir chun cinn tógtha ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna ó thaobh múineadh na Gaeilge agus scrúdúcháin Ghaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí, ach tá i bhfad níos mo den chineál sin oibre ag teastáil. Tá leathanbhanda ag teastáil go géar. Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, tá fadhbanna móra sa chóras pleanála. Tá daoine ann nach bhfuil in ann tithe a cheannach agus atá ag iarraidh tithe a thógáil ar na garraithe atá acu. Cuireann siad isteach ar chead pleanála ionas gur féidir leo cónaí i gceantar an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh i Ros Muc, i mo cheantar sa Spidéal, sna Dúnaibh, i Ráth Chairn nó thíos sa Daingean, ach bíonn srianta craiceáilte orthu ó thaobh cúrsaí pleanála de. Caithfear an próiseas a oscailt suas. Labhair an tAire Stáit faoi phleanáil teanga sa teaghlach, ach ní bheidh aon teaghlaigh sna ceantair atá luaite agam agus ní bheidh éinne in ann cónaí sna Gaeltachtaí muna bhfuil daoine in ann tithe a thógáil, rud atá fíor-dheacair agus atá ag éirí i bhfad níos deacra.

Is fiú aird a tharraingt ar an méid a dúirt an tIar-Choimisinéir Teanga, Seán Ó Cuirreáin, le comhchoiste Oireachtais go gairid sular éirigh sé as oifig maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise don teanga. Labhair mé leis an Uasal Ó Cuirreáin ina dhiaidh sin. Dúirt sé, mar gheall nach ndéantar aon iniúchadh nó athbhreithniú neamhspleách ar chur i bhfeidhim na straitéise 20 bliain don teanga, níl aon shoiléireacht againn ar cé chomh éifeachtach is atá sé. Ní gá ach Google a úsáid le breathnú ar thorthaí an daonáirimh ó 2011 agus 2016 le foghlaim go bhfuilimid ag dul an treo mícheart, faraor. Creidim san Aire Stáit. I believe in the Minister of State. Tá a fhios agam go ndéanfaidh sé chuile iarracht. Is minic a rinne mé botún. Tá go leor daoine a dhéanann botúin. Má tá rud éigin mícheart - nílim ag rá go bhfuil botúin á ndéanamh ag an Aire Stáit - is é an rud is fearr le déanamh ná tosú arís. Mholfainn go láidir don Aire Stáit athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an méid atá ar siúl faoi láthair agus tosú arís le straitéis nua ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.

Bíonn roinnt deiseanna againn an Ghaeilge agus todhchaí na teanga a phlé sa Teach seo. Cuirim fáilte roimh na deiseanna sin. It is unfortunate that many people, including me, are not líofa sa Ghaeilge. This presents us with significant challenges with regard to the future development of the language. It is crucial that we work to make Irish more visible in our society. I welcome the work of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, on the implementation of the 20 year strategy for the Irish language. The results of last year's census with regard to the Irish language, which were published recently, show that the trends continue to remain challenging. At the 2016 census, 39.8% of people said they were able to speak Irish, compared with 41.4% in the 2011 census. The number of people in Gaeltacht areas who speak Irish on a daily basis decreased by over 2,500 between 2011 and 2016. This is why the 20 year national strategy for the Irish language, which was launched in 2010, is so vital. This strategy provides us with an essential plan to make the use of Irish more visible in society, both as a spoken language and within areas like signage, literature and arts. Tá sé riachtanach anois go dtugann an plean seo buntáistí fíora do dhaoine. An bhliain seo caite, chuir an comóradh 100 bliain fócas athnuaite ar ár n-oidhreacht. Ní mór dúinn úsáid a bhaint as an bhfócas seo chun an teanga a chur chun cinn. It is important that there is an increase in the number of families throughout the country who use Irish as their daily means of communication. Molaim an tAire Stáit as na hiarrachtaí atá déanta aige maoiniú méadaithe a chinntiú don teanga agus don Ghaeltacht i mbuiséad na bliana seo chugainn. The provision of an additional €2.5 million in budget 2018 builds on the additional €2.5 million provided in budget 2017. The total budget for this year will be more than €62 million. This funding is needed to begin to reverse the trend in the decline of the Irish language. The additional €1.4 million provided for language planning is very welcome to support the 20 year strategy. I am pleased that the language plans which were approved by the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, last month can now go forward for implementation. I welcome the provision of €687,000 for the Department's support schemes outside the Gaeltacht. Irish is much more than a language of the people. It is part of who we are as Irish people. It is a key thread in the fabric of Irish society. Mar shampla, bíonn campaí samhraidh ar siúl gach bliain i mBealach an Doirín. Tá go leor suime sa bhaile. It is important that we continue to encourage people outside the Gaeltacht areas to engage with the Irish language. I have spoken previously in the House about the work of Údarás na Gaeltachta. It is very positive that it received an increased funding allocation in the recent budget. Údarás na Gaeltachta has been creating employment and has introduced valuable initiatives to support the linguistic, economic, cultural and social development of the Gaeltacht. This increased investment in the organisation will give it the capacity to build on its work to date in a meaningful manner. Tá a lán deacrachtaí os comhair na Gaeilge, ach tá a lán deiseanna freisin. Ba chóir dúinn an meath a stopadh. Ní mór dúinn tacaíocht a thabhairt don straitéis 20 bliain ar mhaithe le forbairt na teanga.

Agus muid ag caint faoi chursaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, ba cheart go gcuimhneodh muid ar fhear a d'imigh uainn an tseachtain seo caite, Feargal Ó Cuilinn, a bhí ag obair le Glór na nGael agus le Comhluadar roimhe sin. Gael mór le rá agus fear iontach cneasta ab ea é. Rinne sé an-obair. Tá sé inár gcuimhní ag an bpointe seo. Bheadh fiúntas níos mó ag baint le ráitis eile ar an nGaeilge sa Seanad dá mbeimid in ann a dhearbhú go cinnte go raibh dul chun cinn bainte amach againn ó mhí Feabhra seo caite. Idir an mhí sin agus an lá atá inniu ann, tháinig titim €850,000 ar bhuiséad Údarás na Gaeltachta, nuair a thógtar na ceisteanna ar fad san áireamh. Ba mhór an trua é sin, go háirithe i gcomhthéacs an laghdú de 89% a tháinig ar bhuiséad na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na n-oileán idir 2008 agus 2014. Baineadh 9% den bhuiséad iomlán an bhliain seo caite. I ndáiríre, lig Fianna Fáil síos go dona muid nuair a bhí deis acu brú a chur ar an Rialtas tuilleadh airgid a chur ar fáil, mar a bhí luaite ag pobal na Gaeilge. Níor sheas an Rialtas leis an moladh a bhí sa phlean €18 milliún a chur ar fáil thar cúig bliana. Foilsíodh roinnt de na pleananna teanga ó bhíomar anseo an uair deiridh le haghaidh ráitis ar an nGaeilge. I ndáiríre, tá éigeandáil sa phróiseas pleanála teanga. Tá sé ar fad ina chíor thuathail. Ní thuigim cén chaoi ina raibh an tAire Stáit ábalta dul ar aghaidh agus an maoiniú a fhógairt do na pleananna teanga gan dul ar ais chuig na dreamanna lena raibh sé ag plé. Chuala muid ar Raidió na Gaeltachta maidin inné go bhfuil diúltaithe ag ceann de na heagraíochtaí pobail atá ag plé leis an bpleanáil teanga i gCois Fharraige leis an tairiscint de €100,000 ar an mbunús nach raibh an plean a d'iarr an Roinn orthu a réiteach bunaithe ar an bhfigiúr sin. D'iarr an Roinn orthu plean níos uaillmhianaí a réiteach. Tá eagraíochtaí i gceantair eile sa chruachás céanna. Cén plean atá ag an Aire Stáit ó thaobh na pleananna teanga? Cén fáth ar athraigh an Roinn na postaí i lár an chluiche? Caithfidh an tAire Stáit soiléiriú a thabhairt dúinn maidir leis an gcaoi inar tháinig an Roinn ar an bhfigiúr de €100,000.Cén chaoi ar tháinig an Roinn ar an bhfigiúr sin do chuile eagraíocht agus chuile ceantar ar fud na Gaeltachta? Cé na cúinsí a úsáideadh? Cén fáth ar cuireadh dhá bhliain go leith d'obair amú ar na daoine sa bpobal a rinne an obair sin? Rinne siad é go deonach agus ní raibh treoir cheart tugtha dóibh ón tús. Nuair a bhí an t-iar-Aire Stáit, Dinny Mc Ginley, anseo agus é ag fógairt Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, feictear domsa gur tugadh le fios dúinn nach mbeadh deacracht le hacmhainní dá ndéanfadh an pobal na pleananna. Is léir anois go bhfuil fadhb ann. Tá mé féin agus an Teachta Peadar Tóibín i mbun roinnt cuairteanna ar na ceantair Ghaeltachta faoi láthair agus tá cuid mhaith ceisteanna ag teacht chun cinn. Fáiltím roimh an méid atá ráite ag an Aire Stáit maidir le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. B'fheidir go bhfuil míthuiscint idir an Roinn agus an Comhchoiste Gaeilge, Gaeltachta agus na nOileán ó thaobh brú ar aghaidh agus plé a dhéanamh ar sin ag an gcomhchoiste, mar tá na ceannteidil foilsithe ag an Aire Stáit. Is ceist é sin idir an Aire Stáit agus Cathaoirleach an choiste. Brúifimid ar aghaidh leis sin. Fáiltím leis an méid atá ráite i ráiteas an Aire Stáit agus go bhfuil sé ag cloí leis an rud a bhí leagtha síos ó thaobh earcaíochta. Beidh 20% de dhaoine nua ag teacht isteach sa Státseirbhís inniúil ar an nGaeilge. Is rud iontach tábhachtach é sin. Caithfimid brú ar aghaidh leis sin. Ó thaobh na gceantar Gaeltachta, tá dhá rud le feiceáil go soiléir dar liomsa. Is léir go bhfuil an bánú daonra ag cur as do na daoine sna ceantair san iarthar, Tír Chonaill, Maigh Eo, Ciarraí agus araile; go bhfuil easpa fostaíochta ann; agus go bhfuil daoine san aoisghrúpa idir 20 agus 40 imithe as. Dá bhrí sin, tá gá le níos mó infheistíocht caipitil san údarás le tuilleadh fostaíochta a chruthú sna ceantair sin. Níor thagair an tAire Stáit ar chor ar bith don dul amú i leith cúrsaí iompair. Bhí ceisteanna ann ó thaobh an seirbhís aeir go hÁrainn, mar shampla. Tá conradh nua curtha i bhfeidhm ansin a chuireann srian ó thaobh eitiltí breise agus tá sé sin ag cruthú cuid mhaith deacrachtaí. De réir mar a thuigim, tá idirbheartaíocht maidir leis an seirbhís lastais agus an tseirbhís paisinéara amach go hÁrainn. B'fhéidir go mbeadh an tAire Stáit in ann soiléiriú a thabhairt dúinn ar sheasamh an cháis sin. Ceist eile atá ag teacht chun cinn i ngach ceantar Gaeltachta i láthair na huaire ná drochstaid na mbóithre. Deirtear linn go raibh airgead curtha i leataobh ó thaobh bóithre de ag an Teachta Seán Kyne sular cuireadh amach as an Roinn é. Tagraím ach go háirithe do bhóthar ar an gCeathrú Rua ina bhfuil géarchéim ann i láthair na huaire. Is cás éigeándála é. Bhí súil go dtiocfadh roinnt airgid ón Roinn le tacú leis sin ach creidim nach mbeadh pingin ar fáil ó Roinn an Aire Stáit ó thaobh bhóithre áise agus mar sin de. An bhfuil sé i gceist an scéim sin a thabhairt ar ais? I go leor de na ceantair Ghaeltachta tá fadhbanna ollmhóra agus tá gá le tacaíocht den chineál sin. An rud eile atá ag teacht chun cinn go láidir, agus thagair an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh do seo, ná cúrsaí oideachais agus an géarchéim damanta atá ann ó thaobh múinteoirí atá inniúil ar an nGaeilge. Ag leibhéal na bhunscoile tá sé an-deacair teacht ar mhúinteoirí le Gaeilge. I gceantar amháin Gaeltachta ina raibh mise ag caint le príomhoide, bhí folúntas ann agus bhí 70 le cur faoi agallamh ón bpainéal. Ní raibh oiread agus duine amháin ón bpainéal sin tar éis a rá go raibh sé nó sí inniúil go leor sa Ghaeilge le dul ag múineadh i scoil Gaeltachta. Fuair muintir na scoile sin duine ar deireadh thiar ach b'éigean dóibh obair go crua leis sin a dhéanamh. Tá fadhb an-mhór ansin ó thaobh earcú múinteoirí le Gaeilge. Tá fadhbanna níos mó ag an dara leibhéal ó thaobh múinteoirí a fháil, is cuma má bhíonn Gaeilge nó Béarla i gceist, in ábhair éagsúla. Nuair a chuirtear an Ghaeilge san áireamh, bíonn sé fíor-dheacair teacht ar mhúinteoirí le haghaidh ábhair faoi leith ar nós na hábhair eolaíochta, ealaíon, ceol agus mar sin de. Is léir go gcaithfear brú ar aghaidh i bhfad níos tapúla ó thaobh múinteoirí a oiliúint. Bhí plean ann sa staidéar cuimsitheach teangeolaíochta go mbunófaí coláiste oiliúna trí mheán na Gaeilge do mhúinteoirí scoile. An bhfuil se i gceist ag an Aire Stáit athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar sin agus é a bhrú ar aghaidh? Molaim an scéim atá ann ó thaobh an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh thar lear. Bhí mé ag caint le bean as Tiobraid Árann, Majella O'Meara, atá ag múineadh sa tSlóvaic faoi láthair. Tá sí imithe isteach sa dara bhliain ag múineadh Gaeilge do mhuintir na Slóvaice, creid é nó ná chreid. Níl Gaeilge ar bith ina measc agus tá ag éirí thar barr léi. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé sin ag tarlú in áiteanna go leor. Is scéim mhaith é sin agus tugann sí daoine ar ais go dtí na Gaeltachta chomh maith céanna. Tá moladh mór ag dul do sin. I ndáiríre, maidir leis an straitéis 20 bliain, tá sé deacair creidiúint go bhfuil sé ag dul ar aghaidh i gceart. Nuair a bhí an tAire Stáit os comhair an chomhchoiste - nó b'fhéidir go raibh an Teachta Kyne os ár gcomhair - dúradh linn go dtabharfaí suas go dáta muid agus go mbeadh cáipéis le fáil maidir leis na spriocanna ar fad a bhí sa straitéis agus cé mar a bhí siad sin á mbaint amach. Ní bhfuaireamar an uasdátú sin go fóill cé go raibh muid ag súil leis díreach tar éis an tsamhradh. Tá ámhras orm go bhfuil muid siar i bhfad leis an straitéis 20 bliain. Dar liom, tá sé thar am athbhreithniú iomlán a dhéanamh air. An cheist is mó a thagann chun cinn i gcónaí ná ceist na n-acmhainní. Is cuma an bhfuil muid ag caint faoin straitéis 20 bliain nó Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, bíonn na dreamanna ar fad a bhíonn ag caint linn ag rá nach bhfuil an Rialtas chun na hacmhainní a bhí súil leo a chur ar fáil mar is gá. Is léir ag leibhéal bhord an Rialtais go bhfuil an tAire Stáit ag tochailt timpeall le pinginí beaga suaracha anseo agus ansiúd. Caithfear i bhfad níos mó airgid a bheith curtha ar fáil ag an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe don Roinn. Beidh muid ag coinneáil brú ar an Aire Stáit maidir leis na ceisteanna seo. An cheist eile ná, ó thaobh an Dá Chontae is Tríocha agus na cainteanna atá ar siúl ó Thuaidh, léirigh an tAire, an Teachta Coveney, go raibh sé fábhrach ó thaobh Acht na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh. Tá sé mar bhunaidhm go gcuirfear é sin ar bun. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire Stáit in ann ráiteas a dhéanamh ag dearbhú go bhfuil sé féin ar son acht féinsheasmhach Gaeilge sna Sé Chontae agus go gcuirfidh sé brú ar James Brokenshire bualadh le pobal na Gaeilge mar níor bhuail sé leo go fóill, cé gur bhuail sé leis an Ord Oráisteach agus dreamanna eile. B'fhéidir go mbeidh an tAire Stáit in ann ráiteas a dhéanamh ina leith sin.

Um thráthnóna ba mhaith liom i dtús báire tacú leis an méid atá ráite leis an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh mar gheall ar bhás na Gaeltachtaí. Bhí cruinniú agam le baill de Chonradh na Gaeilge le gairid agus bhí an tuairim céanna acu. Bhí siad ag rá ní hamhain go bhfuil fadhb ann sna Gaeltachtaí, ach go bhfuil siad i mbaol báis. Caithfimid bheith níos réabhlóidí má táimid ag iarraidh na Gaeltachtaí a choinneáil agus a shábháil. Tá Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag iarraidh straitéis nua a chur le chéile, ionas go mbeimid i bhfad níos réabhlóidí ó thaobh ár bpolasaí Gaeilge de. Ó thaobh oideachais de, theip go mór orainn mar thír. Is féidir pointí a scóráil ó thaobh páirtí polaitiúla de, ach mar thír agus mar Stát, theip orainn ó thaobh múineadh na Gaeilge agus foghlaim na Gaeilge ó bhunú an Stáit go dtí an lá inniu. Ní dóigh liom gur féidir linn ár méaracha a shíneadh i dtreo aon áit eile ar fud an domhain agus tír a aimsiú ina gcaitheann páistí níos mó na deich mbliana ag foghlaim teanga agus nach bhfuil siad in ann an teanga sin a labhairt go flúirseach nó go líofa. Tá sé dochreidte. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an-chuid anailíse déanta ar an gceist seo. Cén fáth nach bhfuil páistí in ann an teanga seo a úsáid? An easpa spéise atá i gceist? An bhfuil fadhb ann le heaspa suime ag tuismitheoirí? Tá sé deacair a rá cén fáth go bhfuil sé mar sin ach tá sé mar sin. Is iar-bhunmhúinteoir mé féin. Ó thaobh chúrsaí oideachais de, b'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn rud éigin i bhfad níos réabhlóidí a dhéanamh inár mbunscoileanna. B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn, in achan bunscoile atá againn sa tír, bliain amháin nó dhá bhliain a mhúineadh go huile agus go hiomlán trí Ghaeilge. Ní bheadh an Ghaeilge againn mar ábhar inár scoileanna, ach mar theanga. Ní féidir, i mo thuairimse, Gaeilge a mhúineadh mar ábhar. Ní raibh Gaeilge ar bith agamsa go dtí gur fhreastal mé ar Ghaelscoil sa séú rang. Bhí an meon céanna agam mar ghasúr nuair a bhí mé 12 bliain d'aois. Bhí grá agam don teanga ach ní raibh focal dá laghad agam. Bhí mé tar éis deich mbliana á chaitheamh ag foghlaim na teanga, ach go dtí go raibh an Ghaeilge á húsáid agam sa rang, sa chlós, le mo chairde agus sna hábhair eile go léir, níor fhoghlaim mé mo chuid Gaeilge. Ní dóigh liom gur féidir an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh mar ábhar. Caithfear an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh mar theanga. Tar éis deich mbliana ní chainteoir dúchais mé féin ar chor ar bith, ach sílim, ag an staid seo, go bhfuil orainn bheith réabhlóideach faoin rud seo agus - ní maith liom an téarma iachall a úsáid - ach go mbeadh ar gach aon pháiste bhunscoile bliain amháin a chaitheamh sa bhunscoil céanna ag foghlaim chuile rud trí Ghaeilge.Ar a laghad, bheadh cumas i bhfad níos fearr acu sa teanga ná mar atá acu anois. B'fhéidir go b'fhéadfaimis staidéar a dhéanamh ar sin. I also wish to go beyond the Irish language community in respect of the training of teachers. I think the Irish language has, unfortunately, become a barrier to many people who wish to pursue a career in primary school teaching. There is evidence to suggest that people from disadvantaged areas, the Traveller community, and migrants view the Irish language as being an unreasonable barrier to their entry into the training colleges. Nobody is suggesting that the Irish language requirement for teaching should be lessened. The standard of Irish one has when leaving a teaching college should be excellent. The suggestion that applicants should have a high standard of Irish on entering teacher training, however, should be challenged. In my own constituency on the northside, I, the Northside Partnership and the Marino Institute of Education are providing Irish language tuition for students who are attending second level DEIS schools in which higher level Irish is not available. These students cannot even get the qualification because of the school they attend. We are losing out on generations of excellent primary school teachers, who would be fantastic role models, because of the communities they come from, because of their ethnic backgrounds or because they come from the Traveller community. We need to examine that. The standard of Irish one has on leaving teacher training is more important than the standard of Irish one has on entering. I suggest to the Minister of State that he come to the Marino Institute of Education and see those young people and what they are trying to do. They are trying to get extra tuition in the Irish language to get into teacher training. The Irish language is a barrier for them and is not something they are necessarily positive towards because it is seen to be an unreasonable expectation of them at this stage, even though they would obviously love to be in a position to teach it to a high standard if and when they become primary school teachers. Mar fhocal scoir, cuireann sé sórt leadráin orm nuair a chloisim polaiteoirí ó pháirtithe éagsúla ag cáineadh a chéile mar gheall ar an méid a rinne siad nó an méid íseal airgid a chuir siad ar fáil don Ghaeilge. Theip orainn mar shochaí, mar Stát agus mar mhórphobal ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Ní féidir linn a rá go bhfuil an milleáin ar aon pháirtí nó Rialtas faoi leith. B'fhéidir go gcaithfimid teacht le chéile agus a aontú go bhfuil an teanga níos tábhachtaí ná cúrsaí polaitíochta. Sílim féin go bhfuil. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé thar am dúinn bheith i bhfad níos réabhlóidí faoi na leigheasanna atá de dhíth i láthair na huaire.

Aidan Matthews in his short poem, "The Death of Irish", captures graphically the cultural impoverishment we suffer if our language goes into terminal decline. It goes:The tide gone out for good,Thirty-one words for seaweedWhiten on the foreshore.Most of us here would support the Irish language and see it as an integral part of our culture. Most of us would like to see it stronger and more vibrant. Many of us would be willing, as today, to stand up and speak of the need to revive our native tongue. Unfortunately, not all of us feel comfortable standing up and making that speech as Gaeilge. While I commend those lucky enough to be able to do so, I do not in any way criticise those who cannot. It is not their fault. Rather, I am asking the obvious question. Why, after 14 years in school, can most people not speak Irish? It is not that Irish is necessarily a difficult language. Small children can pick it up very easily. Children from English-speaking homes who attend a naíonra for just one year have a better grasp of Irish than many who have spent 14 years supposedly studying the language. Why is it that many of us learned more in three weeks in the Gaeltacht than we did in the entirety of our secondary education? I have a first-hand example of this. My own daughter went to Coláiste Spleodar on Leitir Mealláin. She was picked up on the bus i mBaile Átha Luain and there was no ceol as Béarla, no leabhair as Béarla and no caint as Béarla for three weeks. She is now fluent in Irish. It seems abundantly clear that the greater the degree of immersion in a language, the better we understand it and the more we use it. Molaim an tAire Stáit for what he did last year. The earlier that this immersion begins, the better the outcomes are in terms of language fluency. If we truly want to do more than just pay lip service to the revival of the Irish language, what do we need to do in practical terms? First, we need to support the development of Gaelscoileanna wherever possible. The potential growth market for the Irish language is not in the Gaeltacht, but right across the country, and we can see this working. Second, we should be more creative in making our remaining schools more bilingual or in offering choices to children who do not necessarily have access to a Gaelscoil. If there are two classes for one year in a primary school, could one of them not be offered as Gaeilge? Could we not introduce bilingual teaching, for example, with Irish in the morning and English in the afternoon? Páistí would discuss stair, matamaitic, tíreolaíocht, sometimes as Béarla and sometimes as Gaeilge. Children do not seem to have a problem with this but adults do. The focus throughout primary school should be on oral competence first, with literacy taking a lower priority. I have a lot more to say but I want to share my time with Senator O'Reilly. I would say that I believe that if we really do have a grá for the language and we really do want it to thrive, the one thing we must not do is nothing. Language decline typically goes through a number of stages. The longer we leave it before we react and engage, the more work we will have to do. We must act before the tide goes out.

I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit. Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil sé an-díograiseach agus an-éifeachtach sa Roinn. Tá ár n-oidhreacht, ár stair, béadoideas ár dtíre, ár scéalaíocht, ár ndrámaíocht agus achan rud eile measctha sa teanga. Is máthair don chultúr í. Is í bunaidhm straitéis na Gaeilge ná go mbeadh méadú ar líon na ndaoine a labhraíonn Gaeilge de ghnáth agus go laethúil. Tá fíanaise sa daonáireamh go bhfuil líon na ndaoine a labhraíonn í go laethúil iontach beag - 21% sa Ghaeltacht. Ba chóir go mbeadh forbairt eacnamaíochta ag an nGaeltacht ach, chomh maith leis sin, ba chóir go bhforbrófar plean teanga labhartha don Ghaeltacht. Táim sásta go bhfuil níos mó airgid sa bhuiséad don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge. Tá cúpla rud tábhachtach dar liomsa. Aontaím leis an Senadóir Ó Céidigh mar gheall ar dhaltaí ó achan aicme agus achan ceantar a thabhairt go dtí an Gaeltacht. Ba chóir go mbeadh seans ag gach dalta, seachas daltaí ó theaghlaigh lan-Ghaelacha amháin, agus ag níos mó daltaí dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht. Níl aon rud níos éifeachtaí ná sin i mo thuairim. Táim go hiomlán i bhfabhar an beart sin. Táim cinnte faoi mar thuismitheoir agus mar mhúinteoir. Tá sé sin riachtanach. Chomh maith leis sin tá sé riachtanach níos mó tacaíocht a thabhairt do na daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, agus taobh istigh di, atá ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a labhairt. Ba chóir go mbeadh ciorcail teanga agus saol sóisialta as Gaeilge acusan agus go mbeadh eachtraí ar siúl inar féidir leo an Ghaeilge a úsáid go rialta. Ba mhaith liom níos mó a rá ach tá an t-am istigh. Táim sásta seans a fháil cúpla rud a rá ach an príomhphointe gur mhaith liom a dhéanamh go láidir ná go bhfuilim go hiomlán i bhfabhar níos mó dáltaí ón ngalltacht a chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht. Cabhródh sé sin go díreach. Tá níos mó maoinithe againn anois agus ba chóir é sin a dhéanamh. Tá sé iontach riachtanach.

Muna bhfuil na freagraí aige inniu, b'fhéidir gur féidir leis teacht ar ais chugam. Cén fáth nach bhfuil athbhreithniú déanta ar an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge? Is é sin bunchloch mhúnla pholasaí an Stáit i dtaca le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge idir seo agus 2030. Táimid thart faoin triú chuid den am istigh sa pholasaí sin agus, go bhfios domsa, níl aon athbhreithniú déanta. An bhfuil sé ag obair nó nach bhfuil? Ó na sonraí a luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh inniu, is cinnte go bhfuil comhartha ceiste ann maidir leis an straitéis agus a cur i bhfeidhm. B'fhiú athbhreithniú a dhéanamh. B'fhéidir gur féidir leis an Aire Stáit an chúis nach bhfuil sé déanta go dtí seo a chur in iúl dom. Tá an múnla i dtaca le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge in Acht na Gaeltachta 2012 bunaithe ar na pleananna teanga. In other words, tá an obair go léir fágtha ag na coistí pobail na straitéisí a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá mise ag fáil eolais ó choistí pobail agus, go bhfios dom, níl go leor airgid acu leis na pleananna seo a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá brú orthu na pleananna a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá coistí eile agus tá go leor maoinithe ar fáil dóibh, ach tá coistí ann atá ag cur iarratas isteach ar an Roinn agus níl go leor maoiniú ar fáil. Tá comhartha ceiste ansin. Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil aon fhreagra ag an Aire Stáit i dtaca leis sin. I dtaca le maoiniú na Roinne don chlár caipitil, cuir i gcás i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe agus Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall, bhí lúcháir ormsa agus thug mé tacaíocht agus buíochas don Aire Stáit nuair a bhí sé anseo an lá deireanach i dtaca leis na deontais atá ceadaithe aige. I dtaca leis na deontais caiptil go léir atá ceadaithe ag Roinn an Aire Stáit do gach comhairle contae ar a bhfuil remit Gaeltachta, an bhfuil litreacha tairisceana curtha chuig na comhairlí contae i dtaca le gach deontas a fógraíodh? An féidir an tAire Stáit é sin a shoiléiriú?

Ba mhaith liom cúpla pointe a ardú. Ar dtús báire, bhí plé agus ionchur iontach fiúntach ó Sheanadóirí inniu. Is mór an trua, mar an gcéanna le roinnt ábhair eile, nach bhfuil muid in ann reachtaíocht nó rún a phlé ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil roinnt ar an gclár oibre os ár gcomhair. Ar aon nós, ba mhaith liom cur leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh ó thaobh Achta ó Thuaidh. Bheadh sé úsáideach agus tábhachtach a chloisteáil ón Aire Stáit maidir le seasamh an Rialtais ó thaobh an Achta de. Chomh maith leis sin, aontaím leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh. Tá mé cinnte go n-aontaíonn an tAire Stáit féin gur ábhar náire é nár bhuail an Státrúnaí, James Brokenshire, le grúpa Gaeilge ar bith go dtí an pointe seo, cé go bhfuil na grúpaí sin tar éis iarratas i ndiadh iarratais a dhéanamh chun bualadh leis. Tá súil agam go mbeadh an tAire Stáit in ann é sin a ardú le James Brokenshire, tríd a chuid comhgleacaithe nó ar bhonn pearsanta, agus a insint dó, má tá sé chun bac a chur le cur i bhfeidhm Achta, gur cheart dó, ar a laghad, bualadh leis na grúpaí Gaeilge ó Thuaidh atá ag fulaingt mar gheall ar an easpa reachtaíochta agus a chloisteáil uathu. Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire Stáit ó thaobh tionscadail gur féidir leis an Rialtas glacadh leis. Cé go bhfuil ábhar na hinfheistíochta ardaithe ag Seanadóirí eile agus cé go bhfuil infheistíocht de dhíth agus thar a bheith tábhachtach ó thaobh na Gaeilge de - níl mé ag rá a mhalairt - an bhfuil smaointe ar bith ag an Aire Stáit ó thaobh an tionscadail Líofa atá ann sna Sé Chontae? B'fhéidir go dtiocfadh leis an Aire Stáit rud éigin mar an gcéanna a dhéanamh anseo ó Dheas a treorfadh daoine chuig an Ghaeilge. Níl mórán costais ag baint leis agus ardaíonn sé próifíl na Gaeilge. Déanann sé an Ghaeilge níos feiceálaí ar fud na háite agus osclaíonn sé doirse gan mórán costais don Rialtas. B'fhéidir gur féidir leis rud eile a dhéanamh chun an teanga a roinnt. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an tAire Stáit féin sáite i dteagasc na Gaeilge, agus fair play dó as sin. Go n-éirí go geal leis. Tá a fhios agam go n-aithníonn sé agus go dtuigeann sé an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an Ghaeilge a roinnt leis an líon is mó daoine agus gur féidir.

It is the Gaeltacht areas, however, that keep the language going for us. Our own native Irish language is an essential part of our national identity. We know that in this global village it is our national identity that makes us strong. We all like to know where we are from. The key and the secret to that is in our language. I was happy to attend a recent event organised by Údarás na Gaeltachta in Belmullet. It was about digital hubs and the need to bring broadband into remote areas in order that businesses can operate. I commend the údarás on the work it does. Clearly, these are areas of fine natural beauty. There are great communities there but they cannot live on fresh air. The young people cannot live on fresh air so broadband is imperative. I commend efforts in that regard and the funding provided to the údarás. I have two questions, both of which were raised by Conradh na Gaeilge in the run-up to the budget. First, Conradh na Gaeilge suggests that there is a disparity between the funding of community organisations in English-speaking areas and in Gaeltacht areas. Basically, Gaeltacht community development groups and co-operatives get less funding for their staff than similar organisations in English speaking areas.  There was also a suggestion that local organisations are not getting enough funding to roll out the plans made under the pleanáil teanga. I welcome the funding which the Minister of State provided in the budget. On the issue of speaking Irish-----

Try as I might, I have so many engagements, as I am sure other Members do, that Thursday is not suitable. I question how much consideration has been given to Members. I ask that the Minister of State look at this issue because I am sure there are Members who would like to improve their Irish. The opportunity is available to take classes from beginner level right through to advanced. Thursday evening is really not suitable.

D'ardaigh an Seanadóir Ardagh ceist faoi choinne aitheantas d'Fhianna Fáil faoi choinne an bhuiséid. Ba mhaith liom m'aitheantas a ghabháil dó faoi choinne an bhrú ach, i mo thuairim, rinne an tAire, an Teachta Paschal Donohoe, an cinneadh maidir leis an bhuiséad. Gabhaim buíochas faoi choinne an bhrú in aon chor. Bhí sí ag caint fadúda Aire sinsearach. Bím timpeall an bhord Rialtais agus tá an Ghaeilge an cloch is mó ar mo phaidrín nuair atáim ann. Beidh cúpla lá de dhíth faoi choinne na díospóireachta ar thagair an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh di a leanúint ar aghaidh. Cloisim a thuairimí, agus dá mbeadh aon bhealach iad a chur i bhfeidhm nó rudaí eile ar intinn ag an Seanadóir, táim sásta iad a dhéanamh. Tá sé fíor gur tháinig laghdú ar an bhuiséad. Bhí sé suas le €26 milliún in 2007. Tá laghdú ollmhór ann. Bhí suas le 80 duine ag obair in Údarás na Gaeltachta. Bhí siad thar a bheith éifeachtach agus proifisiúnta. Tá toradh le feiceáil maidir leis an 500 duine breise a bheidh ag obair an bhliain seo chugainn fosta. Beidh deiseanna trí Shlí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin. Bhí an Seanadóir ag caint faoi mo cheantar féin, na Dúnaibh.Tá a fhios aige faoi Chomórtas Peile na Gaeltachta. Beidh mé ag déanamh infheistíochta fadúda sin. Cúpla mí ó shin bhí dea-scéal sna Dúnaibh fadúda comhlacht úr. Beidh 18 duine ag obair i bpoist úr leis. Bhí na daoine uilig, an Seanadóir Maura Hopkins san áireamh, ag labhairt fadúda an buiséad agus an dea-scéal fadúda an champa samhraidh. Aontaím leis sin. Chomh maith leis sin, bhí Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh ag caint faoi phleanáil teanga. Tá comhrá ag dul ar aghaidh idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus dóibh atá freagrach as pleanáil teanga. Tá tús de dhíth fadúda an phróiseas pleanála teanga. Tá an tús sin tosaithe agus beidh comhrá idir m'oifig, an údarás agus na daoine uilig atá freagrach as pleanáil teanga. Tá sin de dhíth. Dá mbeadh aon chuidiú de dhíth nó dá mbeadh aon bhac ar an obair, níor mhaith liom go mbeadh trioblóid leis an phleanáil teanga. Tá na daoine uilig ar an talamh ag obair go deonach. Chuir siad iarracht mhór isteach thar na blianta atá thart. Maidir le heaspa fostaíochta i gceantair Ghaeltacha, beidh Údarás na Gaeltachta ag leanúint ar aghaidh fadúda sin. Tá dea-scéal i nGaillimh fadúda HID Global. Bíonn rudaí mar sin ar súil i nDún na nGall agus Ráth Chairn fosta. Tá dea-scéal ann timpeall an domhain. Chuala mé an scéal faoin Slóvaic. D'ardaigh na Seanadóirí Ó Clochartaigh agus Ó Donnghaile polasaí an Rialtais i leith Acht na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh. Níl an tiomantas ann i leith an Achta sa Tuaisceart. Tá sin tábhachtach. Thug an Seanadóir Ó Ríordáin cuireadh domsa dul go dtí Marino Institute of Education. Táim sásta é sin a dhéanamh. Chuala mé na Seanadóirí McFadden agus Mulherin fadúda an teanga agus an náire a bhíonn ar dhaoine. Nuair a tháinig mé isteach sa phost seo trí blian ó shin, ní raibh mé ábalta Gaeilge a labhairt. Déarfaidh mé cúpla focal go sciobtha trí Bhéarla. I did not rely on language classes. The language is all around us in this country. There are former teachers and there are people in the Senator's parish and neighbourhood who have Irish. If she personally wants to learn the language and improve the Irish she has, she must get the message out and let these people know. That is where I got my inspiration and my help. A former teacher in Ballybofey sent me her class notes from 40 years ago. A gentleman named John Woolson living in Australia kept emailing me to tell me that he began to learn Irish at 70 years of age. He is 80 or 81 now. He went back at 79 years of age. Níl sé riamh ró-mhall. It is never too late. That is the message we also have to get out. Even though we have all had different experiences, taithí diúltach san áireamh, it is never too late. Sin é. D'fhág mé cúpla duine amach. Níl an t-am agam ach táim fíorbhuíoch as an seans inniu. Níl na páirtithe polaitiúla freagrach as an teanga. Tá na daoine uilig sa tír seo freagra aisti - Tuaisceart agus Deisceart. Dá mbeadh aon fhadhb ar intinn na Seanadóirí a bheinn in ann réiteach, bheinn ina dtaobh. D'ardaigh an Seanadóir Ó Domhnaill athbhreithniú ar an straitéis. Thosaigh mé ar athbhreithniú cúpla bliain ó shin. Beidh an plean cúig bliana le cur i gcrích ag deireadh na bliana. B'fhéidir go mbeadh seans ann ag an phointe seo athbhreithniú a dhéanamh. Ar an phleanáil teanga, chuala mé faoi na fadhbanna atá ann faoi láthair. Ar an chlár caipitil, chuir an Seanadóir ceist orm faoi choinne eolais i leith an mhaoinithe atá ag dul go dtí na comhairlí contae éagsúla. Táim sásta an t-eolas sin a thabhairt dó.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	80	I thank the Acting Chairman. I am very grateful for the opportunity to come here today and clear up any misapprehensions which may have resulted from a debate last week. I have been asked to make a statement on the current driving test waiting times, following the Commencement matter discussed in the House on Wednesday, 18 October, which was taken on my behalf by the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin. I understand that Senator Victor Boyhan has queried the waiting times provided by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, in its letter of 21 September, which were different from those provided and outlined to the House last Wednesday, and that he has requested that the waiting times be verified. I am happy to advise that I have since requested this verification from the authority and can inform the Senator that the authority stands over the information provided. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify, for those who are confused, that the waiting times are averaged over the course of the year. A figure for the average waiting time and the longest waiting time at any one centre is liable to change over time. The date on which those times are viewed is very important and differs weekly. The figures provided by the Road Safety Authority were correct on each of the dates in question. Waiting times can fluctuate due to the availability of driver testers at a particular centre and the number of applications for tests from one month to the next. As was mentioned in the reply to the Commencement matter raised last Wednesday, the driver testing service has seen an increase of almost 20% in the levels of driving test applications over the past four years. This, coupled with the retirements of driver tester staff, has meant that the waiting times for customers for driving tests have, unfortunately, increased. The Road Safety Authority’s objective is to have a national average waiting time of no longer than ten weeks. However, the current national average waiting time for a driving test is 14 weeks. The authority is working on measures to improve the wait time for the test. These measures include the recruitment of additional driver testers, the delivery of 120 extra overtime tests per driver tester, initiatives to reduce the number of applicant no-shows at the driving test, initiatives to reduce the number of non-conducted driving tests, and a new driving test booking system. I would also like to point out that the authority is committed to working with any applicants who require an urgent appointment. A priority list system is in place whereby cancelled test appointments are made available for such applicants. More than 1,000 tests are cancelled by driving test applicants weekly and these slots are subsequently offered to applicants who require urgent test appointments. The authority continues to monitor capacity against demand and deploys driver testers to best meet the demand across all test centres. I fully accept that current waiting times remain too high, but I am assured that the measures the authority has put in place will have the desired effect of reducing waiting times to the public. I can advise that my Department has also asked the RSA to examine the long-term staffing needs of the driver testing service to ensure that it can plan in the long term for revision of tester numbers based on demand for tests and to better manage succession planning for driver testers who may retire.
#KeithSwanick	unknown-#KeithSwanick-party	unknown-#KeithSwanick-dob	unknown-#KeithSwanick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	81	My party colleague, Deputy Eugene Murphy, raised this issue a couple of weeks back as a result of the excessive waiting times faced by those in County Roscommon where there is an almost 17 week waiting time to take a driving test. As he said, many of these people may be waiting for a full licence for employment purposes, or a job application may be hingeing on their having a full licence, while other drivers are paying exorbitant levels of car insurance for provisional licences and they are being left waiting long periods to sit their driving test. This has not come out of left field.The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and his Government colleagues have stood by and watched while the average waiting times for a driving test have gradually crept up to the point where a person could have to wait over five months for a test. It shows once again how this Government is completely out of touch with the basic needs of the citizens. The surge in waiting times has been linked to staff shortages. The public sector recruitment ban as well as increased demand as the economy picks up were factors that could have been foreseen and there is no reason for inaction. One only needs to look around on the way to work to know there are more cars on the road. In 2016 the number of private cars on the road crossed the 2 million mark, and there were 240,000 learner licences issued. When this issue was raised almost nine months ago, in February 2017, the Seanad was told that additional resources and staff would be put in place to reduce waiting times. It is baffling that the Government has still not hired the additional staff needed to reach this demand. Instead the Department is proud that it has put in place certain overtime arrangements and notification systems for learner drivers to increase the numbers of tests being administered. This is very basic and should have been put in place months ago. There is no joined up thinking in the Department nor is there evidence of any future planning. When will this Government realise that things do not need to reach crisis point before it acts? The situation needs to be prevented from deteriorating further. I call on it to expedite the appointment of additional driving testers to increase the numbers.
#VictorBoyhan	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-party	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-dob	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	82	I thank the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, for coming before the House and giving his time to discuss this very important subject. I will try to use my time constructively. There are a number of statistics that the Minister's statement to the House did not deal with. I spoke with the Road Safety Authority earlier today. Today there are 70,000 waiting for driving tests whether for private cars, commercial vehicles or for buses. There are 52 test centres in the country spread across 31 local authorities. The Minister has accepted that what has happened is not satisfactory and says there is a plan to recruit testers. When I spoke to the RSA last week, I was informed that it had not made any appointments; there was one panel in situ but others were needed. The RSA informed me that a substantial number of people had retired this year and that a significant number will retire in 2018. It told me that it takes eight weeks to train someone and today no one is in training, so there will not be one single additional instructor this year. If we did have one it would be in late December. These are the facts. The current system is not working. The Minister cannot stand over a situation where there are 70,000 people who have paid a fee and are legitimate applicants waiting on a list for tests. These are people who want to go to college or take up employment and they cannot do their tests. It is most unsatisfactory. It is the Minister's responsibility, in his portfolio of transport, to address this. I want him to say how, in co-operation with other agencies under his responsibility, he will increase the number of new testers. Will he assure this House that there will be new testers in place before the end of this year? How will these lists be cut? I deal in facts. When I spoke to the testing centre in Tipperary today at 9.30 a.m. I was told that applicants had to wait 27 weeks. In Waterford, 26 people have been waiting for 26 weeks. In Wexford they wait 25 weeks and 21 weeks in Cork. Kerry is divided in two with waits of 24 weeks in Tralee and 23 weeks in Killarney. In fairness to the Minister he does accept that this is totally unacceptable that 70,000 people are waiting to do driving tests. It is not an average of 10 weeks. It is a critical issue which must be addressed with resources. It needs to be taken head on. I will bring this back to the House in December for further report. I am committed to sticking with this problem and achieving a resolution.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	83	From listening to the Minister and the Senators, there is clearly a problem. The waiting times are not acceptable. As the Minister noted, ten weeks is the objective. It must be addressed urgently. I understand that a theory test can be had within ten days. I do not know the reason for this. There is obviously more people applying for tests but it does not explain the whole bottleneck. From speaking to the RSA, the Department and so on, I understand there can be a cohort of up to 29% of people who do not show up for their tests, which is a major issue. The Minister mentioned that the test centres now telephone people to check that they are coming. It is hugely important. On a positive note, I am aware of someone who needed an emergency test because they had got a job and they needed a car. That person got the test within a few weeks but people should not have to depend on that kind of queue jumping or no-show tests. I was told that sometimes when people show up for their test, it cannot take place because the person does not have his or her driving licence, or insurance, the car is not taxed or it does not have a valid NCT certificate. On one occasion someone turned up for a driving test without a car. It is necessary to sort all those issues. I welcome Senator Boyhan's promise to stay on the case and I support him on it. It is in the Minister's interest that this be sorted. A waiting time of ten weeks, which is two and a half months, is better than the situation as it is now but it should be better than that again.

I commend my colleague, Senator Victor Boyhan, who has raised this issue relentlessly in the Chamber. I fully support his efforts. If one looks at the numbers for the three test centres in my own county, Buncranna, Letterkenny and Donegal, they are at the top of the list for waiting times. I am sure that the Minister will appreciate the matter that I raise. It is the poor public transport infrastructure in rural Ireland which means if people want to stay in their job, avail of education, visit loved ones in hospital and so on they require a car. I am concerned about the considerable time involved which can be as high as six months for a test, and then there are repeat tests, because not everyone passes the first time. That is unacceptable. The Road Safety Authority has known about the shortage of testers for a long time. I am thinking of the number of driving instructors across the State. I cannot imagine there is significant further training to take people to the level necessary to become testers. I ask the Minister to grapple with this matter in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority, with a particular focus on the impact it has on the rural economies.  We talk about the economy moving in the right direction again. When we look outside from the windows of Leinster House, the cranes can be seen across the skyline, but that recovery is not happening in rural areas at anything like the same level. Situations like this, where people have to wait so long to get either their test or their repeat test will not help to develop the economy, it will hold us back. It is an issue with wider implications than mere inconvenience for those who want to pass their test. The frustration has been brought to my attention time and again by people across Donegal, be they from the Inishowen peninsula, the north Donegal area, the north-east area towards Letterkenny, or south Donegal. It appears that the Government and the Road Safety Authority are unable to sort this issue out. I commend Senator Boyhan and I commend the Minister for attending to deal with this issue today. I appeal to the Minister to intervene to find a solution with the Road Safety Authority.

When I worked with young unemployed people in Wexford, Wicklow and across the south east, I noted that being able to drive really made the difference between getting work and not getting work. In many cases, it was almost impossible to gain employment if one could not demonstrate that one could drive. I am very much aware of the benefit of being able to drive. I wish to highlight two slightly related issues, one of which concerns the driver theory test, which is currently delivered by a private company based in America and working internationally. In the discussions we have had in this House on rural post offices, it was asked why we do not seek to ensure rural post offices could be hubs for things such as the driver theory test. In designing requests for tenders, we should recognise the benefits of locating multiple services that are needed in rural communities in central hubs such as post offices. As of 17 June this year, those seeking to take the driver theory test are required to have a public services card. Given that the Data Commissioner has indicated her dissatisfaction with the arrangements in place regarding the public services card, and having received replies from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, she has now indicated her intention to launch an investigation into how the card has been rolled out, the protections that are in place, or not in place, and how it is being managed. Will the Minister consider removing, or suspending, the requirement for a public services card for those seeking to do the driver theory test? It represents an extra level of bureaucracy for those involved. It is an instrument over which there is a major question mark at present. It is not appropriate to continue pushing people to take up the card while it is under investigation. From May 2018, new European directives on data protection will be in place. They will provide a much more appropriate and safe environment for the rolling out of any of these measures. Will the Minister consider removing or suspending the requirement related to the driver theory test?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	87	I thank the Senators for their contributions. It is quite obvious that this matter exercises people greatly in their own areas but it is universal. It features outside Donegal, on which this debate has largely concentrated. It affects every county and every testing location. The best performance is in Kilrush, where the is an eight-week delay. The delays elsewhere can extend to over 20 weeks. As I have already said, this is not satisfactory. I agree with everybody who said so. It has obviously taken the testers by surprise. One cannot solve this overnight. One cannot appoint testers overnight; it has to be done gradually. The Road Safety Authority is more than aware of this issue, thanks to the contributions of various Senators. I have spoken to the authority about this on several occasions. I am satisfied the matter is being addressed as a matter of urgency and that the numbers and waiting times could be reduced, not only in Donegal. I believe the measures I have outlined today will have an effect. They were also outlined in the House last week. It is a matter of tracking the number of driver testers and the delivery of 120 extra overtime tests per driver tester. Senator O'Mahony referred to the number of no-shows. It is an extraordinary number. It results from people applying who do not really intend to go for a test at all. Many telephone calls are being made and a considerable number of people are saying they are not actually going to turn up. The slots are then filled extremely efficiently by telephoning people who are regarded as a priority and who want a test urgently. New driving testers are being appointed. A large amount of overtime is being grabbed up by testers. There is a new driver-booking system being introduced. Therefore, the matter is being addressed fairly aggressively and effectively. I take the points made by Senators on their own areas and the difficulties in those areas. I understand them and the figures that are being given to us here today. They are correct. I must issue a warning about quoting figures, however. The figures quoted here last week were not accurate. According to the Official Report, Senator Boyhan said the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, said the current national average waiting time for a driving test is 14 weeks. The Senator then said, "I can tell him that this is not the case." It is the case. The Senator should be careful about what he says. I acknowledge he is making a case but he should be careful with his figures. The Senator stated: "Nowhere in the more than 50 centres does the waiting time meet the target of 20 weeks." I do not know where the Senator got the target of 20 weeks. There is no 20-week target. He should be careful. You went on to say: "I reiterate that the waiting time in Buncrana is 19 weeks, in Donegal it is 24 weeks and in Letterkenny it is 21 weeks." That is not correct. All those three figures are completely inaccurate. Those figures that you are quoting are ones that-----

The Senator has been in this business for a very long time and he knows perfectly well that the measure is of the average number of weeks waiting. To come into this House and quote the longest possible waiting time of any individual is not an honest way of producing these figures. What the Senator should have cited, but did not cite, were the average waiting times in weeks. These figures are much lower. They are not acceptable but to cite the waiting time of the one person in each area waiting the longest is misleading. The figures are inaccurate and exaggerated.

What is important here is the average waiting time in weeks. There are two categories the Senator got in the letter. The letter, which I read, made those two categories absolutely clear. In every case that the Senator quoted, the average waiting time was considerably lower. There is an obligation on the Senator, as someone who has rightly championed those who are experiencing the problem, not to quote anything but average figures. The figures are measured based on the average. The problem arose between you and the Minister of State last week because alternative figures were being cited. You and the House know it is right to quote average figures. Average figures will bring one to the same conclusion that all the other Senators rightly came to today, that is, that this has to be addressed.Do not come in here-----

What happens in Catalonia and Spain matters to all of us. We know Spain very well. I know that very many of us, and the people we represent, have spent time living, working, studying or just holidaying in Spain, particularly in Barcelona, one of the great European cities. After Britain, it is the country that Irish people travel to most. Cities and towns across Spain are home for many Irish people. In addition, 1.8 million visits were made to Spain from Ireland during 2016. A growing and welcome element of this traffic is connected with the increasing numbers of Spaniards living in Ireland, and of course the many Spanish students who join us during the summer. We all want the best for Spain and its people, and it is because we know it so well that we were so shocked by the violence that occurred on 1 October and why we sincerely hope that nothing like it happens again. I know that some Members of the Oireachtas also visited Catalonia, including on that October weekend, and their perspectives and experience can help contribute to our consideration of the situation there. Tensions are running high, but the fact is that Spain is an established democracy where citizens have full rights protected by the rule of law. In any democracy, political developments must take place within a legal framework. This is not a procedural point. This is a fundamental requirement if the rights of all citizens are to be protected. Respecting the rule of law, its possibilities and protections but also its limits, is not a choice but an obligation. The resolution of the current crisis needs to be within Spain's constitutional framework, through Spain's democratic institutions. That view was repeated by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, in the Dáil yesterday. The freedom to express contesting views is an essential check and balance in any democracy, but differences of opinion must be contested with full respect for the law and the rights of all citizens. This is the foundation that underpins and protects modern democratic societies. We can disagree with the law. We can work to change the law, but we cannot ignore the law or act beyond the law. In Catalonia, and elsewhere in Spain, as in all our democracies, public representatives and all citizens must work to advance their goals within democratic institutions, such as parliaments, with full respect for the law. Clearly any decision on a question as important as independence requires legitimacy. It requires legitimacy both in terms of the broadest possible political consensus and in terms of a sound legal framework. On that basis, the referendum vote of 1 October cannot be accepted as legitimate. I do not believe that it provides the basis for a declaration of independence. The holding of this referendum was also ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court. It is clear, including from the massive gatherings that we have seen in Catalonia, that many there support independence, but we know too that there are many others who do not support independence, and it would be wrong if their views were not fully taken account of. In early September, a small majority of the regional Catalan parliament voted through referendum and transition legislation in controversial circumstances. Those in parliament opposed to the measures, who made up nearly half the region's parliamentarians, argued that the legislative process breached the parliament's own procedures as well as being illegal. Spain's constitutional court later ruled the legislation illegal. This is a complex political issue and it is for politicians to resolve complex political issues through dialogue and empathy. It is this political dialogue rather than escalating tensions that we all want to see, but dialogue needs to respect the constitution of Spain, the rights of all citizens of Spain and the regional and national parliamentary institutions that represent them. Any political action outside of that framework lacks legitimacy and cannot claim to respect the plurality of opinion in Spain, or in Catalonia for that matter. I am conscious that there have been many calls for external involvement in the resolution of this matter, particularly after the violence that occurred on 1 October. However, the Government's position is that in Spain, as in any other country in the EU, internal political and constitutional arrangements are the prerogative of a country and its people and should be determined by them, through the institutions of the country and in accordance with the rule of law. Internal divisions, contesting aspirations and robust debates are to be expected in any democracy, but they have to be resolved in keeping with the rule of law. Constitutions can be changed, as we know, but that has to happen in a constitutional way. I, therefore, welcome the cross-party support in the Spanish Parliament for the establishment of a committee to consider the issue of constitutional reform, which may address some of the current concerns. I am very concerned at the impact on people's lives that the political uncertainty has given rise to, including the decisions of over 1,000 companies to transfer their corporate headquarters out of Catalonia. I am also dismayed at reports of fractures within families and communities to which this divisive issue is giving rise. The validity and legitimacy of political effort requires, as I have said, securing the broadest possible consensus within the law. Citizens also deserve the certainty that the rule of law extends to them. That is why I remain of the view that it is for all Catalans and all Spaniards to arrive at a shared view on what steps within their laws and their own democratic institutions might best support a process of resolution. Clearly this is proving difficult. The decision taken by the Spanish Government to apply article 155 of the constitution marks a significant point. Nonetheless there still remains an opportunity for engagement. We hope that leaders take the necessary steps to return to the space where differing views are contested through national and regional democratic institutions, with full respect always for the law and the rights of citizens. Upholding the constitution and the rule of law in all its aspects is a key underpinning of all democracies. Ireland respects the constitutional and territorial unity of Spain. The Government's position remains that the constitutional and political arrangements in Spain are matters to be determined by its own citizens, though its own institutions, and in keeping with its own laws.
#MarkDaly	unknown-#MarkDaly-party	unknown-#MarkDaly-dob	unknown-#MarkDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	103	I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss events in Catalonia. There is significant cause for concern in the violence that was perpetrated in the region during the attempt to hold a referendum on independence. I have no doubt that some 100 years ago, there were people in Parliaments around Europe pointing to the need for the rule of law to be upheld in Ireland as it attempted to leave the United Kingdom. I am sure the first Irish Parliament, of which this House is a successor, was described at the time as undemocratic because it did not comply with the constitution of the UK. However, that is all a matter of historical record. In terms of what is happening in Catalonia and what the Spanish Government is doing in response, we would all agree that people should, of course, be allowed to have their say. If the Catalonian population chooses to have a referendum, it should be permitted to take place. That desire by the people to exercise their democratic rights was facilitated in Scotland and Quebec, but it has not been accommodated in Catalonia. We do not know whether the majority of Catalonians are in favour of independence, because the numbers differ depending on which opinion poll one is consulting. Spain, like the European Union, has evolved and changed over time. Having come out of the era of Franco and gone through the establishment of the various autonomous regions, which were given some level of local powers, there is nothing to say it cannot evolve and change once again. The challenge for the Spanish Government is that in saying to the people of Catalonia that democracy will not be allowed to have its say, the Catalonians are being left with very few alternative courses of action. The long and unfortunate campaign by Basque separatist groups and others was the absolute opposite of democracy. People must be shown that democracy works and will be allowed to work. Fianna Fáil welcomes the proposals by the Spanish Parliament for the establishment of a parliamentary committee. This is essentially an issue for the people of Spain and Catalonia to resolve, but that does not mean we cannot raise our concerns regarding incidences of violence. There was no reason for the violence that took place. The referendum could have been allowed to proceed without any need for stopping people from going into polling booths and sanctioning local police to use force. The Spanish Government could have allowed the ballots to be counted and simply ignored the result if it so chose. It is often the case when such conflicts arise, as we saw in this country 101 years ago, that reactions by governments can lead to exactly the opposite outcome to what is intended. The path the Spanish Government is going down runs counter to its own arguments. The Spanish cannot talk about democracy while allowing their police force to beat up pensioners. Nobody in this Chamber or in this country would support the Spanish Government's approach to the crisis it faces. The situation has been going on for decades or centuries, depending on which view one takes, but the response by the Spanish authorities has been appalling and should be condemned by everybody. We all hope the matter can be resolved and that a fair committee will be established which allows for a referendum on independence, as happened in Quebec, if that is what the people of Catalonia decide. As I said, it is not clear whether a majority of Catalonians would vote to leave Spain. The point is that democracy must be supreme. If we do not allow people to have a democratic say, then we leave them with very little alternative. They can either sit tight and accept that democracy will not have its say or they can seek out alternative routes to what they wish to achieve. That was the approach taken by the British Government to events in this country 100 years ago. We do not want the same situation to evolve in Spain but it will require the authorities there to learn lessons from the mistakes of the past in regard to the establishment of this Parliament and the treatment by the British authorities of the will of the Irish people. Of course, the will of the Irish people was not in compliance with the constitution of the UK at the time, which is not to defend the rule of law under the British regime. The United States constitution stated at one time that a slave was not entitled to be a free man. In other words, constitutions are not always right. We all hope for an end to violence in Catalonia and a peaceful outcome to the current conflict. The European Union has a role to play in achieving that but the first requirement is that everybody who saw the violence must condemn it. As we know, governments acted within the law to prevent marches in Northern Ireland. People just wanted their civil rights but were beaten off the streets. The law said that could be done because the marchers were not complying with the laws passed by Parliament. That approach ultimately leads down the wrong road and we must ensure Spain and Catalonia do not take that road. The Catalonian people must be allowed to vote in a referendum on independence, if that is what they choose to do. How the issues are resolved in the long term is a matter for the populations of Spain and Catalonia. We hope the Catalonian people can be allowed to make their own decision as to the best outcome for their region. It is not acceptable that a country which purports to be a democracy would allow pensioners, students and others to be beaten when they are simply trying to exercise their democratic rights. Nobody in this Chamber would condone such activity. As democrats, we must condemn a situation where people who were engaged in what was essentially an opinion poll, because of the manner in which it was not allowed to function properly, were denied their right to do so. There is a difficult balance to be achieved in this instance but we must condemn the actions of any government that resorts to beating what it claims to be its own citizens. As I said, the same thing happened in Northern Ireland when the police force there attacked the citizens it was supposed to protect. The world saw what happened in the North and condemned it. Unfortunately, it led Northern Ireland down a road we all regret.

I recently spent a week in the region during which time the referendum was to take place. There was not a single day that I did not go down to the Palace of the Generalitat to observe the protests. We must be very clear that what happened is unacceptable. With all due respect, it is disappointing to note the failure of the Minister of State, in line with the same failure on the part of the Government, to condemn this violence unequivocally. We in Europe need to learn from our history. The proposal on which the Catalonian people were to vote asked whether they wished to be ruled or administered by a new republic. As we know, a true republic is about equality, access, dignity and allowing people to exercise their rights in a democratic way. I am a strong advocate of the republic. We must never lose sight of what a true republic is about and what it represents. The European response to the crisis has been disappointing. Whether one is from the Basque region, Catalonia, Madrid or any other part of Spain, one is a European. All of those people are citizens of the European Union and should, as such, be protected. The EU should be defending the rights of its peoples. I do not wish to say too much about the internal workings of Spain because I recognise there are particular constitutional arrangements to do with the administration of the country and so on. We in Ireland would resent - and do resent, in some cases - any interference in how our country is run. It is disappointing that member states of the EU and the institution itself have not come out strongly on this issue. We are seeing the beginning of a fragmented Europe both in the realm of economics and in respect of a shared culture and sense of belonging. People are becoming more and more alienated and the space that has opened up is being filled by extremism. We must be conscious of that and of the lessons of history. My understanding of the EU was always that it would defend the rights of its citizens.The European Union and its predecessors assisted this country greatly in getting, and vindicating, rights on many issues and we owe a great deal to it. That is my real concern. We must acknowledge that all people in Spain are citizens of the European Union and the European Union should stand firm in solidarity with its people.  The Government needs to come out unequivocally and condemn the violence. I saw the violence there; I speak as someone who witnessed people being intimidated, being clobbered over the head and being dragged, viciously beaten and kicked by the authorities there. Irrespective of what authority they had, it was not right and proper. As politicians, or for that matter as citizens, we do not suspend our critical faculties. We do not have to remain silent or be gagged because we are members of the club called the European Union. We do not have to stand shoulder to shoulder and let it go on. If we fail to condemn it, we are part of it. That is my concern. There were young people, old people, families, workers and the unemployed. There was a vast range of people there but they had the right to gather in a public place. They had the right to have a view, and to express their view. They had the right to disagree and whatever about the constitutionality of the referendum - that is a matter for Spain and other authorities - nobody had a right to beat them, humiliate them and walk all over them. What is more disturbing is that the Union, our country and other member states of the European Union did little in response. I make a prediction. There will be European Parliament elections in 2019. Young people do not want to support or be part of a Europe that stands idly by and does nothing but, more importantly, whose leaders turns a blind eye to violence and humiliation and do not allow people peacefully assemble and talk about a new vision and a new way for their country or region. I certainly do not and I am in my 50s. That is what is at stake. For most people in Europe, it is not actually about the internal workings of Spain. It is about the great organisation called the European Union that was going to stand shoulder to shoulder with us in solidarity, that remembered the Europe of the past and that advocated for a new Europe of the future, but it has failed abysmally. What will happen is people will move off and vote for different extremes and that vacuum will be filled. I hope these matters will be resolved internally by agreement. It makes economic sense. It makes sense for many reasons. It is a matter for the Spanish people to stick together, to consolidate, to grow their economy, their country and their opportunities for what a great country it is. We have a road to travel too, and that is my criticism today. I understand the Spanish Senate is meeting on Friday and it will discuss this matter. I understand, even from today's news, that there is ongoing negotiation and dialogue for a resolution. As democrats, we have to welcome that. Hopefully, we will have a resolution to this dispute. Let us be clear that, if we sit idly by, we will lose people. The European ideal, the expectation that it would stand in solidarity with its people, is steadily being lost and it is something we need to wake up to.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	105	The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, correctly stated that what happens in Catalonia in Spain matters to all of us. We know Spain well. Many of us and the people we represent have spent time living, working, studying or just on holiday in Spain, particularly in Barcelona, one of the great European cities. How true that is. I live in the west of Ireland and Knock is my local airport. There are five direct routes from Knock airport to Spain. I will fly from Knock Airport with my partner and child next Saturday to Malaga. Although Malaga is not in Catalonia, this shows how close the relationship is between Ireland and Spain. There is also a direct route to Faro from Knock airport. The Minister of State said that Irish people travel to cities across Spain and it is the destination of some 1.8 million visits. We are very close to Spain. It is effectively our escape, for warming our bones, etc. Since the 1930s, Spain has been so close to us. We must not lose sight of the fact that Spain is an established democracy where citizens have full rights and are protected by the rule of law. It is evident that Catalonia remains tense. Spain's Prime Minister announced over the weekend that he would invoke a never-used provision of the Spanish constitution to remove elected leaders of Catalonia from office because of their support for independence. In response, the far left CUP party described Madrid's action as an act of aggression against all Catalans. There are reports that Catalonia's political leaders intend to bring a legal challenge to prevent the Spanish Government from removing them from office and taking over running the region to stop its push for independence. We agree that the real worry in what we saw is that the rise in political tensions will spill over into something more sinister on the streets of Barcelona and elsewhere. I readily condemn the actions of the police. I saw it on television. It was very upsetting. Certainly, it was unwarranted. It is imperative that this dangerous conflict is resolved as soon as possible through talks and dialogue rather than any manifestation of violence. It is also clear that this political crisis is having an economic impact. Some say it is huge. It certainly has had an impact in Catalonia. Caixabank, Spain's third largest bank, has reported it suffered a moderate but temporary run on deposits due to the crisis over the independence bid. The bank, until recently, was based in Catalonia but now has transferred its headquarters to the Valencia region. I am aware that the situation in Catalonia is being monitored by our Government. It is very serious. Earlier this month, the concern about the situation was conveyed to the Spanish authorities by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, at a meeting with the Spanish ambassador. I reiterate that upholding the constitution and the rule of law in all its aspects is a key underpinning of all modern democracies. The Government's position remains that the constitution and political arrangements in Spain, as in any other member state of the EU, are a matter to be determined by its own citizens through its own institutions in keeping with the rule of law. The Government has made it clear that any decision on a question as important as independence requires legitimacy, both in terms of the broadest possible political consensus and in terms of the legal framework. On that basis, the referendum vote in Catalonia cannot be accepted as legitimate - it is an aspiration - and does not provide the basis for a declaration of independence. The Irish Government cannot recognise or accept a unilateral declaration. As I said, I hope the Government is conscious that tensions remain high. It is important that steps are taken to reduce tensions. I hope that the parties concerned can find a way to do this as soon as possible and work out a way to discuss their differing views in dialogue. Since the crisis began, the solution remains the same. It is for the parties there to arrive at a shared view, and I agree with setting up a group on what measures might best support a process to resolve this crisis. As we all will be aware from our experience on this island, violence has no place in politics. While the situation is still precarious, we all hope the voices of moderation on both sides will prevail in order to defuse this growing political crisis. The EU certainly did not emerge well out of this. It seemed to take a step backwards. However, I hope that we will work together and ensure that calm heads can pave a way through this difficult decision.We talk about a Europe that is united but fragmented. Issues such as these are boiling over in many areas of the EU, in the Basque country and in the Veneto in Italy, for example. How can the EU and European Governments deal with such areas?

We have to recognise at the outset that Catalonia has long had a distinctive culture, history, and social, economic and geographical conditions. It is a distinct region and its autonomy has been recognised in the past, in 1979 for example, though subsequent rulings of the constitutional court have diluted that somewhat resulting in later difficulties. The Spanish Government's reaction to the referendum is within the law as laid down by the Spanish constitutional court. The point needs to be made, however, that it has been overly heavy-handed in its approach. The police overreacted considerably to the referendum, ultimately injuring 900 people. The second point that needs to be made is that the representatives of the Catalan local administration must act within the law. The proper Government reaction would be to take a more reasonable approach and enter into dialogue with the Catalan representatives. The onus is on the Catalan politicians, meanwhile, to abstain from illegal activity. I hope that, within the auspices of the European Union and through the Members of the Spanish Parliament, a process of mediation can arise and produce a settlement that preserves a level of autonomy and self-government in Catalonia while still maintaining the overall integrity of Spain.

I hear much talk of law in this debate and in the conjecture surrounding it but there seems to have been no talk of international law and international human rights. The debate here seems to be very selective about which law and who has to obey the law. The right to self-determination is enshrined in the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, both approved by the United Nations in 1966 and ratified by Spain in 1977. Article 1.2 of the Charter of the United Nations and Statute of the International Court of Justice recognises the right to self-determination. The Spanish constitution of 1978 establishes in Article 96 that international treaties ratified by Spain form part of its domestic legislation and Article 10.2 establishes that the rules on fundamental rights and public freedoms shall be interpreted in accordance with international treaties on the matter. The Parliament of Catalonia has continuously and unambiguously expressed Catalonia’s right to self-determination. A resolution on self-determination was adopted on 1 December 1989 along with subsequent resolutions in 1998, 2010 and more recently the approval of the declaration of sovereignty and the right of the people of Catalonia on 6 October 2016. This also confirmed a parliamentary majority in favour of independence. UN Resolution 1999/57 proclaimed the indissoluble links between the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the foundation of any democratic society. The International Court of Justice has stated that the only limitation on the right to decide that the court regards as enforceable is the unlawful resorting to force or other serious violations of the rules of international laws. I was in Catalonia on 1 October and nobody could accuse the Catalan people of unlawfully resorting to force or other serious violations. One could certainly accuse the Guardia Civil of this, however.  A recent report by a commission of international experts has concluded that there is no international legal prohibition barring a sub-state entity from deciding its political destiny by assessing the will of its people. EU member states have recognised many former sub-state entities that assessed their people's political will and decided to pursue independence. The EU, therefore, recognises the right to decide. Are we now saying that we, as members of the EU, do not recognise that right? International human rights also respect the rights to free speech. International human rights do not close down hundreds of websites illegally, as the Spanish state did before the referendum. International human rights recognise the right to freedom of assembly. International human rights do not attack civilians at polling stations.  It is obviously quite clear that the relationship between the Spanish and Catalan Governments has deteriorated incrementally since 1977, with less and less autonomy and the blocking by the Spanish state of progressive legislation passed by the Catalan Government on a number of issues, including homelessness, marriage equality, bullfighting and education. The recent referendum was overseen by a team of international independent election observers led by an Irishman, Michael Grange. I will read an extract from his report: Yesterday we witnessed events that no election monitors ought to ever witness. We hope to never witness scenes of this nature ever again. We saw numerous and repeated violations of civil and human rights. We are shocked that this happened at all, even more so as it is clear to us that it was a centrally orchestrated, military-style operation carefully planned. We are stunned that armed masked officers entered polling stations with the purposes of preventing a peaceful democratic process. Despite these issues, and other difficulties, people experienced trying to vote. I want to emphasise that we did see a day of voting yesterday. We wish to acknowledge the peaceful nature of how the Catalan people acted yesterday. We witnessed many acts demonstrating the strong will of the people which showed that they were determined to have their say and let others have their say through the ballot box, including the elderly and disabled.As can be expected, there is a lot of disinformation out there. The 43% vote cited reflects the final recorded number of ballots actually counted. This does not include votes in ballot boxes removed by the Spanish police. This, then, is actually a remarkable percentage and surprised even the Spanish Government. On the eve of the vote the Foreign Minister declared that there would be no real voting. Spain did everything possible, both legal and otherwise, to prevent voting: hacking into computer systems; closing down websites; as well as the violence that we all saw on television. The brave people who voted, including a number of wheelchair users, ought to have their voice respected. Do they not deserve to have their rights respected under international human rights law? I think that they do and I think that our country has a role in ensuring this happens. It is quite ironic that we are hearing so much talk here about obeying the law when we consider some of the players involved in the Catalan situation. It is interesting that the Partido Popular, Prime Minister Rajoy's party, is currently implicated in more than 60 cases of corruption, 31 of which involve 835 party representatives being charged. The response from Rajoy's executive has, from the start of the current legislature, taken the form of a strategic change that consists of disabling the key institutions that uncover and investigate corruption in Spain, namely, the state Attorney General's office and the anti-corruption public prosecutor. This de-activation was designed, I am told, by the Minister for Justice, Mr. Rafael Catalá, through the appointment of the state Attorney General, Mr. José Manuel Maza, and the Chief Prosecutor for anti-corruption, Mr. Manuel Moix. The three have been reproached and condemned by the Spanish Parliament for obstructing the investigation of corruption cases, among them caso Lezo. Rajoy's party, then, does not exactly shine as a bright beacon of legality. It is also interesting that the decision taken in the Spanish Parliament to impose Article 155 has really been taken by three parties: the Partido Popular; the Partido Socialista Obrera Espanol, PSOE; and Ciudadanos.It is interesting that none of these parties has elected MPs from the Catalan region. As such, they do not have popular support in Catalonia, yet they are imposing their will on the 7 million citizens of Catalonia and failing to recognise the will of the region's people in democratically electing Carles Puigdemont as their President and a parliament that wanted the right to self-determination vindicated. I am disappointed the Committee on Procedure has not yet allowed an invitation to be sent to President Puigdemont to address the Seanad. We should not be bossed around by anybody about who can or cannot speak in this Parliament.  I support calls for international mediation, including the calls made by Kofi Annan and the Elders and Amnesty International. We must recognise that this is an international issue of fundamental human and civil rights. We cannot be bystanders in this case which is a challenge to the basic principles of democracy. If it were to happen here, we would seek support internationally. We had to call for international support to mediate in this country in the past and this is what all 7 million Catalans are calling for. Ireland has been, and is viewed as, an honest broker and we have a good reputation internationally with regard to peacekeeping. We could and should play a role in helping to facilitate a process of dialogue. We must wake up to what is taking place without being afraid to call it out.

Many of the points I wished to make have been made by Senator Ó Clochartaigh so that should be possible. We have heard many references to the rule of law being invoked as if it is a magic card that can be played. The rule of law has a context. We are duty bound to protect and support a rule of law that is linked with democracy and respects human rights in a free civil society. Many countries have a rule of law and those of us who have travelled internationally will have visited some where the rule of law is imposed and does not have regard to considerations of self-determination, democracy, human rights or civil society. Let us not use the term "rule of law" in a blanket manner and instead be clear about what type of rule of law we mean.  Senator Ó Clochartaigh eloquently highlighted an area of immense concern for people in Ireland and the rest of Europe. We need international law, international human rights law and respect for freedom of expression, assembly and self-determination. There is no doubt the actions taken by the police, at the direction of the Spanish Government, against those who were voting or seeking to vote in the recent referendum in Catalonia violated human rights. The evidence was provided by those from Ireland who were in Catalonia and it was visible internationally. The response of the European Union, including Ireland, has not been adequate. Prime Minister Rajoy has spoken of the "firmness" and "serenity" shown by the police in their actions. We have heard discussion in the Oireachtas about the violence but we have not had a strong message from Europe properly condemning the violence, demanding action in response to it and asking whether our concerns about human rights breaches are being addressed. The message we sent to the Spanish Government was one of impunity for its actions. The Government has spoken at length about its concerns about the rise of populism and there is constant discussion about the importance of the centre holding. However, a blind eye is being turned in the face of authoritarianism, which is, in many cases, a much greater danger than populism. Authoritarianism, which is bound into the rise of populism, is on the rise in Poland, Hungary and Austria where far right parties may be part of the next government. We know what authoritarianism looks like as we saw it in Catalonia, not only in the actions taken on the day of the referendum but also in the shutting down of websites and the arrests of civil society leaders on charges of sedition. We have seen this play book enacted in many parts of the world. Why do we not speak up against it when it takes place in Europe? The task of peace building in Europe has been deeply neglected in recent years. Securing borders, the predominant narrative, fits in with the narrative of policing and might is right. The diplomatic skills required to meet the challenge of having people who disagree with each other find ways to engage in dialogue and build peace together seem to have been forgotten and neglected. The challenge of peace building was the reason for European integration in the first place. Of all countries, Ireland, with its legacy of building peace and experience of war, cannot wash its hands of the task of peace building and promoting diplomacy. There is no doubt that dialogue, space and time are needed. When President Puigdemont chose not to immediately implement the decision on independence and stood back from the brink at the request of Europe, he created a space for diplomacy and dialogue. This window of weeks has been used by Spain to make arrests of civil society leaders, hold further trials and engage in more sabre rattling. The threat to invoke Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution is extremely dangerous. Regardless of whether one attributes credibility to the results of the referendum, the people of Catalonia voted for the Catalan Parliament and Mr. Puigdemont as their President. Invoking Article 155 sends a direct message to those in Catalonia that their vote is being disregarded. This message will drive a further wedge between Catalonia and Spain.  I am sad to see fragmentation in Europe. I would like to have a Europe of strong, autonomous regions which can work together. What we should see in Spain is a credible coming together of regions of different cultural traditions and with different backgrounds and working together with respect and in autonomy. What we saw in 2012, however, was a push by Prime Minister Rajoy to diminish autonomy when he used the issue as a political football for electoral purposes. Europe stood back and did nothing because during the period of austerity, important issues such as Europe of the regions, ensuring an equitable spread of development and prioritising measures to support social cohesion were pushed to the side for the sake of short-term national fiscal targets. This has exacerbated tensions in regions across Europe. I am concerned by the outcome of votes in Lombardy and other parts of Europe. When Europe's wealthy countries failed to send a signal of solidarity to the poorer countries of Europe and we have, at the highest level, President Macron and, to some extent, Chancellor Merkel, speaking about a two-speed Europe, we send a message that might is right and the wealthiest must look out for themselves. This is the signal we also send to wealthy regions in countries which may wish to pull away and emulate the type of division we have seen. The fragmentation of Europe is a real and dangerous threat and we need to step up to the challenge. We cannot wash our hands of this issue. Ireland should step forward and insist on a strong chastisement of the actions taken by Spain. We must also put ourselves forward as an honest broker and offer ourselves as a mediator or demand a non-EU external mediator.

Like other Members, I know Spain well from many visits there. The eruption of this constitutional crisis is shocking. It was particularly shocking to see the violence that erupted on 1 October and the heavy-handed response by Prime Minister Rajoy and the Spanish Government. It clearly inflamed the crisis and strengthened the independence movement. We should hear stronger words of condemnation from the Government of the actions of the Spanish Government. That is crucial. The scenes were shocking, as was the fact that 900 people were injured. The subsequent political arrests of pro-independence people were also shocking. It was an inflammatory move by Prime Minister Rajoy. He and his Government have mishandled the separatist question as a result. That said, I certainly would not support a unilateral declaration of independence by Catalonia. Like my party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, I disagree with those in this House and elsewhere who call for unthinking support for Catalonian independence. We must also be clear that the so-called independence referendum took place outside a constitutional framework and that independent observers declared that it did not meet the standards required and so forth. However, Prime Minister Rajoy's response was appalling. There has not been sufficiently strong condemnation of the violence by the central Government from our Government. Furthermore, this issue is continuing to unfold. There are ongoing developments. Tomorrow, the Parliament of Catalonia will meet to decide on its response to the threat of direct rule from Spain, another heavy-handed tactic on the part of the Spanish Government, after which the Spanish Senate will return to the matter. The strongest words of wisdom are the words of the Elders who spoke through their chairman, Kofi Annan: "The constitutional crisis that is unfolding in Spain calls for consultation and not confrontation." The Elders have urged the Spanish Government and the regional government of Catalonia to renew their commitment to a resolution through dialogue and to find a peaceful path. One thing we in Ireland know is the importance of peaceful dialogue. As Europeans, we have lessons to learn from what occurred in the former Yugoslavia and, indeed, from what has been happening more recently in Crimea and Ukraine in terms of declarations of independence and the assertion of rights of self-determination that have consequences, may be complex and have to be navigated and negotiated through peaceful means. That is very important. I also refer to the recent statement by the president of the Party of European Socialists who criticised both sides in this dispute, pointing out that by calling an illegal referendum Catalonian nationalists tried to bend the rule of law to their advantage but by hiding behind police and the judiciary the Spanish Government stretched Spain's institutions, gave up on politics and fed extremist positions in both camps. Ireland should condemn the Spanish Government's inflammatory moves and seek to encourage all involved to work towards a peaceful resolution. Finally, it is not good enough for the European Commission to describe the crisis as an internal matter for the Spanish. In the past we saw the EU fail in its response to the breakdown of the former Yugoslavia. The EU must recognise that this is an important matter which cannot simply be brushed aside. It is more than an internal matter, particularly when we see the police tactics used on the streets of Barcelona. There is a middle ground. Many people in Catalonia would not have supported the vote for independence and did not turn out on 1 October for that reason. Equally, they were disgusted by the Spanish Government's tactics. There must be stronger words from Ireland and a strong indication of our support for any peaceful attempts to resolve this crisis, recognising, of course, that there are ongoing issues and that the crisis is unfolding as we speak.

I feel very strongly about this subject. The reason is that I, like many others, witnessed Catalan women being dragged, kicked and assaulted on the referendum polling day. It would not be right for me as an Irish woman parliamentarian not to speak out on the subject. What efforts have been made by the Government to call for dialogue between the Spanish and Catalonian administrations? The response of the Government is indistinguishable from the Partido Popular's Government line. As a people recently familiar with the importance of open dialogue for resolving political disputes we should be seen to forward a solution-based negotiation. The Taoiseach's recent comments on the possible Border poll under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement have not helped the situation. Referendums are a democratic expression of political will and should be treated with due respect. There is an urgent need now for dialogue. It is clear that the Spanish Government will not initiate or facilitate this. It is up to the EU leaders, therefore, to ensure that the collective pressure of the EU is used. The Taoiseach should demand this at the next EU Council meeting. Whatever anybody's views on the demand for Catalonian independence are, there is an irrefutable electoral mandate there and it should be respected. This mandate should form the basis of negotiations without preconditions. The Spanish Government's position of pretending that the referendum never happened is not tenable. The first step it must take is to acknowledge the support for independence. I remind the Spanish Government and the EU that this was a key moment for Catalan independence. I would almost go so far as to say that it assures independence in the same way as young people and others across this island were politicised in 1920 after the first Bloody Sunday, in 1972, 1981 and 1916. In all cases people were politicised and motivated. I foresee the same thing happening again. However, the imposition of direct rule by Madrid is folly, as is direct rule being imposed in the North. We cannot sit on our hands. We must play an honest and active role in protecting human and civil rights.

Ireland has always worked constructively with the Spanish Government to build bilateral and trade relations and to pursue our common goals at both EU and international levels. Of course, we are monitoring developments in Spain closely so we can better understand our EU partner. We are paying particular attention to any potential impact that events might have on Irish citizens. The Department is following developments closely and is responding to the concerns of Irish citizens both in the Houses and outside. The Government continues to give this matter its full attention. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, spoke on the matter in the Topical Issue debate on 21 September. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, have spoken with the Spanish ambassador on the issue. There were statements in the Dáil yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I am happy to have the opportunity to update the House this afternoon. The Taoiseach discussed Catalonia with Prime Minister Rajoy on the margins of the recent European Council. I and the Government condemn the violence that occurred on 1 October. The Government is very clear that there is no room for violence in politics and it is important that there should be no repeat of that violence. Such actions are counterproductive. Political progress must be pursued through dialogue. The Government supports a resolution to the current situation that is based on democracy and the rule of law. I reiterate the Government's position that this must be determined by Spain and its people based on the rule of law and through their institutions. It is through such democratic processes that all voices can be heard and a way forward found. Of all nations in the EU, we should understand that. We are now entering a phase where there is potential for confrontation. None of us wishes to see further clashes or injuries such as those that occurred earlier this month. Dialogue is the way forward so there can be a peaceful outcome.

I know the process involved discussions with a wide range of stakeholder groups and with officials from my Department. I appreciate the time and effort that has gone into the report. I wish to thank the Seanad for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate. Since taking up my role as Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I hope I have made it clear that my priorities include children living in consistent poverty, of which there are 130,000, working families, including lone parents, and people on fixed incomes who are dependent on the social contract in Ireland. Therefore, I welcome the report by the committee on lone parents because it touches on particular issues that we all know and recognise in this area. The report and the more recent Indecon review of the changes to the lone-parent family payment have re-enforced my commitment to lone-parent families. In budget 2018, I followed through on these priorities. A range of measures will be introduced next year that will directly benefit lone-parent families and especially their children. The committee report described the main challenges facing lone parents, which include child poverty, activation and education, child care costs, maintenance payments and the changes to the one-parent family scheme. While I do not have the time today to speak on all the recommendations, I will do my best to cover as much as possible. The poverty rates currently experienced by lone-parent families are unacceptable. Unfortunately, this is not new; it has been ongoing for some time. There are many views as to what causes this and what might resolve this situation. My view, which is supported by the Indecon report, is that broadly speaking the policy approach of encouraging and supporting women and men into work is correct. This approach has positively impacted on the lives of lone parents where they have found employment. Nonetheless, the risk of poverty is still too high for those with no or low-paid employment. Budget 2018 will see a €5 per week increase in the rates of payment and an increase in the qualified child payment of €2 per week. These increases represent a significant first step to help reduce the poverty rates for these families. The extension of the fuel allowance season by an additional week will further support these families. However, the supports needed to end poverty do not stop or start with income support. Continuing and improving the policy supports that help lone parents into sustainable employment are critical to ending poverty. The Indecon review shows that the changes to the one-parent family payment have already resulted in increased employment among lone parents and a decrease in welfare dependency. The survey of one-parent families carried out as part of the review showed an increase in full-time employment among the survey respondents from 15% to 22%. We need to continue this progress and in particular to create supports that will help more lone parents to work and, most important, to find work that pays and improves their lives. From March next year, I am increasing the earnings disregard of the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment from €110 per week to €130 per week. This will allow a lone parent on OFP or JST to earn an additional €20 per week of their own money before it will affect their payments. When this is combined with the increase in the national minimum wage to €9.55 per hour this year and the rate increases, it results in an extra €19 per week in the pocket of the OFP and JST recipient with one child who is working 15 hours per week on the national minimum wage. Lone parents working more than 19 hours per week will also gain through an increase of €10 per week in the working family payment thresholds, formerly known as the family income support, for families with between one and three children. This will result in an additional €6 per week for those families. The legislative sunset clause on the back-to-work family dividend is also being removed. It was due to end this March. This effective support will remain available to lone parents and couples who make the transition from welfare dependency to work, including those who also avail of the working family payment. I am aware that the committee recommended higher increases to the income disregards for OFP and JST payments and to the child payment rates. As the Senators are aware, to continue the jobs-led recovery that is under way in Ireland, thankfully, the Government needed to balance the books. I am sure that in budget 2018 I have struck a fair balance between improving the welfare of lone-parent families while maintaining the relative positions of all other groups. I wish to emphasise that an important message from the committee report, which we heard loud and clear, is that access to education is critical to improve the position for lone parents. It also highlights that the activation services provided by the case officers in my Department must tailor the supports to the specific challenges experienced by lone parents. My Department already provides a wide range of financial supports to lone parents to allow them to participate in the variety of educational and employment programmes available through my Department and the Department of Education and Skills. For example, lone parents on OFP or JST payments who wish to participate in education can retain these payments and also avail of the SUSI grant from the Department of Education and Skills. That grant is not assessed as means by my Department. This option is not available to other jobseekers. My Department's employment services also currently provide a case-management approach to assist lone parents to avail of various opportunities within an ever-increasing and improving labour market. For these supports to be truly effective, access to affordable child care is needed. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, has announced measures under budget 2018 to extend the free preschool scheme for an additional year to make the scheme applicable for a full two years. Senators will be aware that some people were falling between birthday dates. The Minister, Deputy Zappone, is also going to invest further in the child care affordability measures she introduced last month. Both of these measures will be of particular support to lone parents. My Department will continue to support and assist with these initiatives. The committee report included further recommendations that I have been unable to address, but I can confirm that all of the recommendations are under consideration by my Department. My Department has reviewed all aspects of the maintenance arrangements relating to lone parents. Since April, the work for the statutory review, that is, the Indecon report, has taken priority. However, the work will now recommence and I intend that it will be completed soon. When it is completed, I will be happy to come back to have a full conversation about it. I am confident that the budget will improve the financial situation of lone parents. I intend to continue to prioritise supports for lone parents, particularly those which incentivise work over welfare. I will also provide for the further review of the scheme. As there is a time lag before the benefits of labour market reforms appear, I anticipate that this review will take place next year and that we will have a further report at the end of 2018. I hope that will be more reflective of the working environment changes that have happened since 2016-2017. We might get a more reflective report next year. I wish to thank the Indecon representatives publicly for the work they have done. They did an incredible block of work in an incredibly short amount of time in producing the qualitative data. I am grateful to them for that. I thank the Senators for devoting their time to discuss this important issue. I look forward to hearing what they have to say and to taking on board the views they wish to express to me.
#CatherineArdagh	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-party	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-dob	unknown-#CatherineArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	124	Fianna Fáil welcomes the publication of the report on lone parents and commends the work of the committee. As the report points out, lone parents are not a homogeneous group. However, being a lone parent carries its own particular difficulties. Lone parents represent one of the household types most at risk of poverty and almost 58% of lone-parent households experience deprivation. Moreover, as the housing crisis continued unabated and rents continued to soar, 770 lone-parent families were living in emergency accommodation as of August 2017. This report highlights the particular issues faced by lone parents and how the systems and policies that are currently in place can often hinder rather than help lone parents and their children. The reforms to the one-parent family payment introduced by Fine Gael and the Labour Party under the previous Government have had a detrimental impact on a significant number of lone-parent households and have caused a great deal of financial and emotional distress.Such measures must be cognisant that not only do lone parents parent alone but they also face difficulties in the type and quality of work available to them due to the absence of affordable child care and access to adequate public transport. It is imperative that lessons are learned from mistakes of the past and that we take on board recommendations made in this and other reports, and develop progressive systems and policies that recognise and take account of the particular circumstances of lone-parent families. Of the 218,817 one-parent families recorded in census 2016, the vast majority were female and over half had just one child while fathers tended to be much older, with 68% being aged 50 years or over compared to just 38.3% of mothers. Fewer than half of parents in one-parent families were at work compared to 70.2% of two-parent families. Lone-parent households continue to be extremely exposed to poverty and deprivation. The most recent SILC data available from January 2017 shows that there was an increase in the percentage of lone-parent households in consistent poverty. Some 26.2% of lone-parent households are in consistent poverty in 2015 compared to 25% in 2014, 36.2% of lone-parent households are at risk of poverty in 2015 compared to 36.5% in 2014 and 57.9% of lone-parent households are experiencing deprivation in 2015 compared to 58.7% in 2014. The Minister referred to the measures introduced in the recent budget which are very welcome. While Fianna Fáil is not in government, we used our influence as best we could to ensure that budget 2018 would be fair and would assist those on low and fixed incomes. As a party we are committed to ensuring that this is a country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few. While the budget is far from perfect it contained a number of positive measures which will directly impact on lone parents and which are also in line with some of the recommendations contained in the joint committee's report on lone parents, including a €5 increase for all other social welfare payments, a €2 increase in all qualified child payments, the income disregard for working lone parents increased by €20 from €110 to €130 per week, and an additional week of the fuel allowance, bringing it from 26 to 27 weeks. These measures are all very welcome. However, the homelessness crisis has affected lone parents disproportionately. Ireland is in the midst of a homelessness crisis. Unfortunately, the Government’s inadequate response to such a serious issue and its failure to build social housing has left thousands of people without a home and living in emergency accommodation. Lone parents make up a significant proportion of those who are homeless. In August 2017 there were 770 lone-parent households living in emergency accommodation. Growing up in a hotel room robs far too many children of their childhood and causes considerable distress for all subjected to such inappropriate living conditions. The committee’s report notes that private rental costs rose in Ireland by an average of 13.5% in 2016, and the lack of social and affordable housing has contributed to this crisis. Other issues such as domestic violence can also contribute to homelessness for lone-parent households. Fianna Fáil believes the policy whereby if an individual receives HAP he or she must give up his or her place on the social housing list must change. The committee’s report rightly states that "this requirement, along with the ongoing insecurity of tenure in the private rental market, can lead to a hard choice between the desire to leave emergency accommodation and the long term security which social housing might provide for their children e.g. in terms of school enrolment". Moreover, the Government’s over-reliance on the private rental sector is a flawed approach and will do little to solve the crisis. They need to get back to basics and start building social housing. While we welcome the measures introduced in budget 2018, some of which are in line with the recommendations of the committee’s report, much more needs to be done if the poverty and deprivation experienced by lone parents and their children is to be comprehensively addressed. The social welfare system must be more flexible and responsive to the needs of lone parents and their children. It must be recognised that they are caring alone and the welfare system needs to reflect the needs of both one and two parent families. The social welfare system should help, not hinder parents trying to balance and combine their caring role with paid employment.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	125	I welcome the report and the Minister's statement to the House. I know she is passionate about putting some of the wrongs to rights. The lone parents of Ireland make up a diverse group. It includes parents who have achieved the full range of educational qualifications. It is diverse in terms of the ages of parents and children and it includes families with one child and those with up to seven children or more. Lone-parent families include those who cohabit with partners or with partners and their families, so-called blended families. They may be single, separated, widowed or divorced. Many co-parent with ex-partners from whom they receive varying levels of co-operation. In short, there is no stereotypical lone parent or lone-parent family. One-parent families have the highest consistent poverty rate at 26.2% of any group in Irish society. They suffer higher rates of deprivation at 57.9% compared to 25.5% in the general population. Children in one-parent families are three times as likely to live in constant poverty than families with two adults with one, two or three children. The consistent poverty threshold for a lone parent with one child is €278 per week, or €14,456 annually. Since 2012 constant poverty among lone-parent families has risen from 17.4% to 26.2% in 2015. Some lone-parent families have lower levels of education compared to the general population according to census 2011. Research has shown that better educated parents have better educated children and that those children have better economic outcomes as well as better mental and physical health. Among one-parent families headed by a mother, research shows that education is more important than family structure in determining the well-being of the children. Education for lone parents may represent a huge opportunity to improve outcomes for all members of lone-parent families. Children lone parents are more likely to suffer from long-term illnesses and disability than children in two adult households. These outcomes are strongly linked to poverty. The challenges faced by lone parents have been increased by the cost of housing, especially the problem in the private rental market, as Senator Ardagh noted. Rents increased by an average of 13.5% in 2016. Lone parents do not have the same financial capacity
or resilience as other family types while a lack of education and prohibitive costs of child care restrict their ability to increase their incomes. As a result of these and other factors, lone parents may be vulnerable to increases in the cost of housing. Some 65% of homeless families are lone-parent families where lone families comprise 26% of all families. Further research could examine this disparity in order to facilitate more effective intervention. The Social Welfare Act 2016, enacted on 16 December 2016, included a commitment that a review to the changes to one-parent family payment schemes since 2012 would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within nine months of the Act's enactment. The review was to assess the financial and social effects of the one-parent family payment changes, taking into account the effects of welfare dependence and the poverty rate of those affected. The scope for the review included the long-term age related policy to the schemes that were implemented since January 2012 in addition to shorter term change required to achieve savings across all social welfare expenditure over the same period following the economic downturn. As part of the review which Indecon carried out, there was a quantitative and economic analysis of a number of relevant databases to access the impact of the changes on lone parents. The review also included one of the largest surveys targeting one-parent families in Ireland.Responses were received and analysed from almost 3,700 lone parents directly affected by the changes. The Indecon report which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on Monday, 9 October contains several positive findings. It concludes that the policy changes introduced have been successful in increasing employment and reducing welfare dependency. It has found that the reforms increase the probability of lone parents securing both employment and higher employment income. The responses to the survey are in line with this finding, showing that the percentage of lone parents in full employment has increased from 15% to 22%. The report notes that welfare dependency rates among lone parents fell in the year after the one-parent family payment was lost and continued to fall in subsequent years. The review also highlights several areas of concern. It notes that many of those who lost their one-parent family payment remained unemployed or in low paid or part-time employment. The balance of evidence indicates there is an increased probability of being at risk of poverty as a result of the changes. All of this serves to emphasise the need for further supports aimed at assisting lone parents to obtain full-time employment or increased hours of work. The findings made in the Indecon report support the rationale and continued reliance of the policy changes since 2012. However, the report also highlights the risk of poverty for lone parents without employment and those in low paid employment and the associated policy changes required to integrate those lone parents into the labour market. The report recommends a move to more tailored progression plans for lone parents, together with improved access to the child care, education and training and other supports required to allow them to access the labour market. These changes should help to improve the living standards of those concerned and reduce their risk of poverty. I understand a further review of the scheme to include data to the end of 2018 is planned.
#MaireDevine	unknown-#MaireDevine-party	unknown-#MaireDevine-dob	unknown-#MaireDevine-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	126	I welcome the Minister. The latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show that 26.2% of children in one-parent families are living in consistent poverty. Lone parents have a tough job, one I certainly would not want to have to do. Walking the floorboards at night with a crying baby, with nobody to share the load, is difficult and very rarely a lifestyle choice. The 26.2% of children who are in one-parent families are three times more likely to be living in consistent poverty than children in two-parent homes. In the context of these frightening figures, the findings made in the Indecon report are to be welcomed. I commend all of those involved in working to produce the report. In this House we often note that reports are only as useful as recommendations. Although I would prefer if this time slot was being used to debate legislation to enact the recommendations made in the report, I must concentrate instead on addressing some of the key issues arising from the work done. The first point to address is the impact of the change in policy some years back which reduced the cap for eligibility for the lone-parent family payment to a measly seven years of age for the youngest child, thereby cutting short the childhood of those affected. This change, introduced under the watchful eye of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government, left many single parents in no-man's land where they could not afford child care and consequently could not work. It was one of the cruelest decisions made by that Government. In the course of our work we examine a lot of research, statistics and reports, but the one finding that has really stayed with me, more than a year since I read it, is the observation made in the report of the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, on deprivation indices that many children living in poverty and deprivation had given up on their dreams and aspirations by the age of 13 years. That is a very sad finding which calls to my mind a young girl whose role model was Wonder Woman. Most of us do not get to be Wonder Woman on more than a few occasions in our lives, but that aspiration should not be dead by the time a girl is 13 years of age. That is what poverty does, in contrast to the ability of children in well off families to pursue and achieve their dreams. It is heart-rending to think of the large percentage of children living in deprived areas, as discovered in the TASC research, who conclude at 13 years of age that they will never go anywhere. This change in policy was unequivocally Thatcherite in its ideology, although some Members might consider that a compliment. Who in their right mind takes the view that childhood costs decrease at seven years of age? What about all of the costly requirements associated with raising children aged seven to 14 years, including expenses associated with sports activities, clothing, illnesses, school trips, voluntary school contributions, school books, after-school care and sports clubs? What if children require mental health support? More and more families who find themselves in that situation are being forced to access treatment privately owing to the lengthy waiting lists. For a lone-parent family, however, dependent on income from the State, that cost is not manageable. The commitment that this policy change would only be implemented when we had a Scandinavian-type child care model was farcical from the beginning. Thousands of families continue to struggle daily with rising child care costs. Being stressed about money does not incentivise work. Worrying about finding affordable child care does not incentivise work. Lying awake at night trying to work out how one might pinch the pennies in order to take one's child out of poverty does not incentivise work. What we are doing to lone parents and their children is not right. The independent Indecon report was commissioned following an amendment brought forward by Sinn Féin to the Social Welfare Bill. The report outlines the changes made to the one-parent family payment and their impact on lone parents. The evidence set out in the report indicates that there is an increased probability of lone parents being at risk of poverty as a result of the changes. Many lone parents who lost the one-parent family payment remain unemployed. For those who did secure employment, financial well-being has nevertheless deteriorated considerably. There has been an increase in the number of families unable to afford a warm waterproof coat, keep their house warm and eat meat regularly. This is not about being able to afford a €30 bottle of wine but about dire poverty and deprivation. What will living in that type of poverty do to the next generation? Does the Government expect that by allowing children to struggle, living in cramped accommodation in hotel rooms, we will produce a generation of healthy, happy and contributing adults? In its fully costed budget Sinn Féin proposed to restore the one-parent family payment to lone parents of children aged up to 14 years. That is the right policy level, morally and economically, given the extreme poverty experienced by many lone parents. I welcome the recommendation made in the report that no lone parent should ever have his or her social protection payment threatened or reduced through non-receipt of maintenance from a former spouse. Many relationships end because of abuse and we should never put people in a situation where they lose out on supported payments because they cannot chase an abuser for maintenance. I look forward to seeing this and the other positive recommendations made in the report being implemented by the Government.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	127	I welcome the Minister and acknowledge her indication that this is a priority issue for her, as supported by her frequent references to it. I hope we will now see intensified action to address the issues involved. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Social Protection which produced an important report on the situation of lone parents in Ireland. That document is as close as we have got so far to a comprehensive analysis of the supports, solutions and actions needed to improve the position and life experiences of lone parents and their children. The report acknowledges that the policy we devise must be cognisant of the fact that Ireland has a very poor historical record in the treatment of lone parents and their children and that existing disadvantages have been exacerbated by the changes introduced in 2012. The evidence is clear in our report, the Indecon report and the statistics from the CSO and elsewhere.Others have spoken about the deprivation and consistent poverty figures and the fact that children in lone-parent families are more than three and a half times more likely to be living in consistent poverty than children in two-parent families. However, there is a range of other figures that can be discussed. Some 65% of homeless families with children in Ireland are headed by lone parents. The alarm bells regarding the 59% deprivation rate have been ringing for some time. The situation was exacerbated in 2012. I will speak first to the Indecon report before discussing the recommendations of our report. The Indecon report points to the fact that while there is a small decrease of 3% to 4% in welfare dependency and some increase in employment, that employment does not necessarily improve the financial situation of lone parents. A majority of the lone parents surveyed, 53%, said that their financial situation is now worse while a quarter of them, 26%, described their financial situation as much worse. That is a serious concern and it must be examined and addressed. Some 5% saw themselves as considerably better off but, as we have heard, there is a range of experiences. The majority are still signalling that they are much worse off. Another figure of concern in the report is the fact that 63%, almost two thirds of those surveyed, who were in full-time employment were still in deprivation and doing without three or more of the essentials for life. Moving people into low paid, insecure jobs that leave them and their children in poverty while they struggle to balance the gaps is not an adequate solution. While the Minister speaks about the importance of tailored supports, case work and investment in child care, the change of moving lone parents onto these payments happened without the adequate supports being put in place. I have spoken on these issues previously in the House. We have had the Babies and Bosses reports and other reports with which I am very familiar. When those reports referred to the lack of engagement they were speaking about the lack of State engagement to support lone parents. Somewhere along the way that translated into the idea that it was necessary to push lone parents themselves to step up. Many lone parents are willing to work and excited and interested about work and going back to education, but the State must improve its supports. The unfortunate issue was that the transition to the new payments took place without adequate supports being in place and we are playing catch up now. There is inadequate case work support. The activation programmes in education and employment in many cases do not reflect facts such as part-time availability, a reality for many lone parents and those on jobseeker transition payments. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate further on that tailoring of supports and case work and how she envisages it might be done to significant scale. I welcome her points about access to education. I will now refer to the recommendations of the reports. Will the Minister address the anomalies around rent allowance? Can we move to a situation where lone parents can access back-to-education allowance and student grants together, for example? That is one proposal. There are also gaps in accessing rent allowance. I could read through the detailed proposals but that probably would not be useful. However, there is a specific proposal relating to the anomaly where lone parents in receipt of rent supplement and one-parent family payment are not eligible for Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, maintenance. How can we address that? We do not want to increase the risk of homelessness or to have people choosing between the security of a home for their children and the chance to have a better life for themselves. These concerns must be addressed. The Minister mentioned the issue of maintenance. The policy in this area has directly disimproved the situation of lone parents. We see that in the change that occurred. Some 50% of recipients of one-parent family allowance are receiving maintenance but that drops to 36% when the child turns seven because the State no longer engages with the liable relative. In fact, we hear constantly that the pressure is put on lone parents to pursue maintenance and to show that they are doing so. In some cases where there is a court ruling that they should receive maintenance there are reductions in their payment even though they are not receiving that cash. This is a huge anomaly. There are proposals with regard to a State maintenance agency. Perhaps the Minister would outline her thoughts on how that might proceed. The invisible lone parents are a serious concern, that is, lone parents who were made invisible by the 2012 changes. They are those with children over 14 years of age. A child is still a child at 14 years of age, as we have seen this week. Most parents give care and are concerned about their child when they turn 14. People know that different teenagers will need different care and different responsibilities. I ask the Minister to address a key recommendation in the report on the jobseeker transitional payment. That payment is a recognition that somebody might be engaging with employment or educational opportunities but is also balancing his or her work of care and other considerations. Can we not extend the jobseeker transitional payment until the child is aged 18 years rather than 14 years? At that point lone parents are put on jobseeker's allowance, the special supports they need disappear and the particular challenges they sometimes face are no longer being addressed by the system. For example, they are mandatorily required to be available full time. There might well be people who have children of two years of age who can become available full time, but the jobseeker transitional payment is a better system than moving people to jobseeker's allowance when their child turns 14 years of age. Perhaps the Minister would address that specific concern. It would allow the State to engage in support.

The Indecon report shows €45 million in State savings. That is almost an indictment. The changes were introduced at a time of austerity in 2012, but that €45 million is coming from one of the most vulnerable groups in society. Will the savings of €45 million be redirected back directly to lone parents as a particularly vulnerable group? I am seriously concerned about the Minister's reference to a new review in 2018. Lone parents cannot afford to wait for the changes.

She has been bamboozled this afternoon with statistics. While they are all extremely relevant I do not intend to take that route. Any increase the Minister could achieve for lone parents was welcome. However, one aspect of our lone parent policy that bothers me is the talk about work incentive schemes. Being a lone parent has to be the toughest job in the country. Instead of trying to incentivise lone parents to go out and work we should be ensuring that they have some type of livelihood that makes it worthwhile to stay at home and rear their children. God knows, we hear enough about latchkey children. I am aware of one town in this country that is regarded as a latchkey town because so many of the parents are working. These are two-parent families. The children come home in the evening to nothing and nobody. That is no way to run a country. I have a difficulty, therefore, with the idea that we should be incentivising lone parents to go out to work. We should be incentivising them to rear their children, while those who wish to work should be incentivised to do so. Indeed, I know lone parents who are in very senior positions and who have managed to find the work-life balance whereby they are able to rear their children and work. They are to be congratulated. They are not all women. Some of them are men. On the education and activation programmes, education is the key to everything. If one can educate oneself one can move forward. I will always be grateful to Limerick City Vocational Education Committee which gave me my second chance in education and brought me through to degree and postgraduate qualification. Otherwise, I would be living on a social welfare payment somewhere in east Limerick.Education is the way forward. Anything that can be done to help lone parents into the education system is to be commended. A number of excellent pilot programmes were run in Dublin some years ago which involved running the same module of a course three times a day. Lone parents were able to share the load of looking after children and taking up the opportunity to participate in education. I am delighted that one can apply to SUSI and hold on to the lone parent payment. That is excellent. I say, "Fair play," to the Minister in that regard. Let us get away from talking about statistics. I am thinking of poor Mary Murphy or Julia Molloy or Tom O'Connor who is walking into the house this evening with his two or three children and nobody else. As my colleague said, when the door closes and one is walking the floors at 3 a.m. with a sick child, all the payments and statistics in the world mean absolutely nothing. Two issues concern me. I am familiar with a widow whose husband died when the children were young. She worked hard all her life, paid PRSI and managed to keep a job going to educate her children who have now left. Unfortunately, she was a victim of the financial crisis and lost her job, but she is not allowed to draw any of the PRSI contributions that she herself made. There are two payments she is entitled to draw down, namely, her own social welfare payment, as well as her widow's pension. Her husband paid for the widow's pension, while she made her own PRSI payments. They should not be regarded as the one payment. The other issue probably does not fall exactly within the Minister's remit, but she might bring it to the attention of the Cabinet. I have documentary evidence of one case and since I became aware of it I have become aware anecdotally of other cases. I refer to husbands who mortgage properties to the hilt and then walk out. In the particular case that was originally brought to my attention the man put the money in his pocket. He did not get it to pay off a debt; he walked away with €280,000 in his back pocket and left his wife and two children destitute. The banks about which we were talking this morning and in recent days went after her, not him, even though he had walked away with the money and is living a wonderful life. I know him. On the other hand, she is living on cornflakes once the children go to school in the morning. We have to do something about that situation where the fathers of this country walk away and leave their wives and children destitute. I know that it does not come directly under the care of the Minister, but it is something she might bring to the attention of the Cabinet as we must look at such issues.  I will not take any more time. I appreciate the Minister's attendance for this debate.
#MariaByrne	unknown-#MariaByrne-party	unknown-#MariaByrne-dob	unknown-#MariaByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	134	I welcome the Minister. I agree with much of what has been said and will not go over it. I wish to refer to one or two experiences I have had.  Sometimes maintenance is promised by a partner and there is an agreement in place that maintenance is to be paid. However, in many cases it is not or else it comes every six or eight weeks rather than every week or in whatever timeframe was agreed. The single parent is being penalised because as far as the Department is concerned, there is an agreement in place and it is of the view that the person concerned is in receipt of the maintenance payment that has been agreed to. That is one issue that must be examined. I have come across many cases where people are affected in that regard. I agree with what Senator Craughwell said about education. I welcome the €500 back-to-education allowance, which is most important. Many single parents want to go back to work or education and the way to get such persons back to work is through education. Some individuals might not have worked for a number of years. They might have given up their jobs when they go married or entered a relationship and they need to be incentivised. I welcome anything that can be put in place to incentivise and help people to get back into education as it will help them to get back to work. I, too, have come across the situation where someone has walked out and left a partner with a mortgage. It is a major issue and I have heard of many such cases where the single parent has been left with the children. I know of one case where a single mother has three children still in school. Unfortunately, her sibling passed away and she must now look after her mother who has dementia. She is going through the process of having her house repossessed. There are some very sad cases and perhaps they might need to be considered in a slightly different way from the norm. It is not always the case that everything fits into the one scenario. There is not always leniency when people present. There has been an uptake in the number of people receiving supplementary welfare allowances in these cases, but one size does not fit all. Each case should be examined individually because the rules do not always fit particular situations. They are the few issues I wanted to highlight.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	135	The Minister is very welcome to the Chamber. Before I commence my remarks, I acknowledge that in her public utterances she has demonstrated a commitment to bringing about a reduction in the incidence of child poverty, including the children of lone parents and lone parents. That is a laudable objective. She has demonstrated in the budget that she is committed to doing this. As Senator Gerard P. Craughwell said, no amount of money will satisfy everybody, but if significant progress can be made to reduce the level of consistent poverty among children in the coming years, it will be welcomed and supported by all parties. We might differ on how the Minister should arrive at that objective and the quantum of resources she is in a position to apply to achieving it. Over a period it is fair to say, objectively, that some positive developments and changes have been implemented to support one-parent families. The back-to-work family dividend is a policy change I very much supported in 2015 to ensure those who had been out of the workforce for a considerable period would be financially supported to get back to work. Much discussion has taken place in this Chamber and the Lower House about the impact of the one-family payment measures when they were introduced in 2013 and the structure was changed. As the Indecon report has demonstrated, some one-parent families have become financially better off and accessed opportunities in the workplace over a period for a range of reasons. I had a detailed look at the Indecon report earlier and while there are some positives in it, there are also some negatives. In accepting that there are some positives and that the experience of a good number of individuals has been extremely positive, the universal experience has not been positive. A significant number of lone parents have benefited from the measures and there is evidence to support that claim, but I think the Minister would acknowledge that much more work needs to be undertaken by the Department and the system in general to ensure there will be tailored supports in place for lone parents because they are not a homogenous, monolithic group; they are human beings with their own difficulties and challenges. I welcome the remarks made by the Minister about tailoring and customising supports for lone parents because the system does not capture every single experience in the way we might like. I was particularly drawn to a remark made by the authors of the Indecon report which stated many of the individuals surveyed said a job had helped them to make more money, develop new skills and improve confidence and, importantly, the well-being of lone parents and their children.It is a critical point and very vocal critics of the measures introduced in 2013 need to be conscious of that, while accepting that the positive experience has not been universal.  The report pointed to a number of problems. An area of concern referenced by my colleague, Senator Butler, was the fact that there are still stubbornly high numbers of lone parents who are unemployed or underemployed, as well as lone parents who, for a variety of reasons - possibly predominantly because of their caring and child rearing duties - are in low-paid, part-time and precarious employment. The Minister knows from the work undertaken by the Low Pay Commission that there is a preponderance of women in receipt of the national minimum wage, a very high number of whom are lone parents. We also know there is a prevalence of women in precarious working situations for a variety of reasons. Given the Minister's stated determination to address child poverty and poverty among lone parent families, I implore her to work very closely with the Low Pay Commission to ensure the Government follows through on its commitment of a national minimum wage of €10.50 per hour, inadequate though it may be, during its lifetime. The Minister can also ensure that the area of precarious work is better addressed. She will be aware of my commitment in that area and the University of Limerick study two years ago which made significant recommendations to Government on addressing the scourge of if-and-when contracts and precarious work in general. There are still far too many people in this country going to bed on a Sunday night not knowing how many hours they will work the following week and, therefore, how much they will earn. As a society, the least we can do is to make sure we make the necessary changes to support people who are working and those who want to work, and allow them to have the dignity which comes with that in order to reach their full potential as active citizens in terms of employment. The best Christmas present the Minister could provide for low-paid workers in this country is to meet the commitments of this Government and the previous Administration, and legislate to ensure precarious work is addressed in a comprehensive way in order to support people who get up early in the morning and make their contribution to our society and their families. I want as many citizens as possible in this country to work, as does the Minister and everybody in the House. Those who are able to work and those in a position to work should be able to do so. I have seen too many lives and communities destroyed by a lack of available work and because a system has written them off in terms of working activity at far too early a time in their lives. That has a destructive impact on the dignity of the person, communities and family life. The Minister knows work is much more than a weekly or monthly pay cheque. It also includes engaging fully in society as an active citizen. It is about real inclusion and equality. It is about self-respect and the dignity of work.  Having said that, we need to make sure we continue to learn from the lessons of the recent past and try to make sure we have a properly resourced, strong and robust system in place in order to be able to support lone parents who are doing a remarkable job under extremely difficult circumstances. The system needs to be much more responsive to the individual needs of people because, as I said, we are all human beings with different needs.  Lone parents, no more than any other cohort in society, are not a homogenous, monolithic group. They need tailored, customised support and I ask the Minister to reflect very deeply on the report developed by the Joint Committee on Social Protection, take what is best from it and apply it to her work.

I thank Senators for their comments. It is very interesting to hear different people's perspectives on a policy which, in the main, was very good. The Indecon report clearly stated it was a very good policy and the outcomes of the policy objectives were, in the main, achieved. We all have to acknowledge that while the policy reforms were very well intended, they happened to be coupled with the then Government's decision to take €4 billion out of the social welfare system because the country did not have a bean at the time. That the decision coincided with the changes resulted in the outcome the Indecon report clearly stated. Let us not ignore the objectives of the policy changes and the result, namely, that it did exactly what we set out to do. There were unintended consequences arising from the cutbacks which had to be made. Let me be very clear. It is to be hoped that our bona fides can be seen for what they are. For example, we increased the disregard by €20 in the budget. For the first time in eight years we increased the qualifying child allowance and extended one or two of the other measures, including the back to work dividend and the fuel allowance, all of which goes towards making life a little bit easier than it was before the changes were made. Until we fully unwind the cuts which were made to lone parents, the policy that the then Labour Party Minister introduced will not be able to flourish in the same way as it would have if we had not had to introduce the cuts at the same time. I cannot guarantee Senator Higgins that the €45 million taken from lone parents will be given back. Everybody acknowledges and recognises that fact, and I thank the Senator for saying so. I did not arrive into the Department of Social Protection and pick the most populist group of people who we would hear from very loudly if we were going to make changes. This particular group of people probably do not have the same levels of respect others in this country enjoy. I do not want to pick on Senator Higgins, but that reflects what she touched upon.  It goes back to societal opinions of women, in particular unmarried mothers, in years gone by. If I do nothing else in whatever short period of time I am in this Department, we are going to break that stereotypical image. The vast majority of women I know who are parenting alone work bloody damn hard and deserve to take home more of the money which they go out and earn in work. There is a misconception that they are all sitting at home drinking
lattes, but that is far from the truth. As long as I am here not only will I champion the hard work which is carried out by women in this country, I will also recognise that it is more than twice as hard for women and men who are parenting alone as it is for those who are cohabiting and jointly taking on board the work involved. I wish to address one or two issues. A Senator mentioned she had an issue with the fact that the changes we made forced women whose children were as young as seven years of age to go out to work. That is factually incorrect. The JST payment which was introduced gives exactly the same means disregards and protections as the one parent family payment does for those parents with children aged between seven and 14 years. The only thing they need to do is engage with the Department of Social Production in order to discuss training and possibly going back to college. I do not think anybody in this House or the Lower House would challenge me on this point. As a Government we have greater ambition for the women of Ireland who find themselves parenting alone than to take them off welfare and put them into low paid jobs. That is not the ambition I have for my sisters in this country. I have an ambition that they will be able to earn decent wages doing jobs they love or, at the very least, enjoy on a weekly basis and get paid pretty well so that they can improve their and their children's lives in a better way than heretofore.What was implied was not factually correct. The supports within the JST scheme are exactly the same for children and their parents until they reach the age of 14. I acknowledge the compliments by various Members with regard to the change the Minister for Education and Skills introduced a number of months ago regarding the bursary for lone parents. Again, this feeds into the fact that we all have an ambition to achieve better outcomes and brighter futures. This leads me very nicely to my concluding remarks. It is not just the responsibility of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure better outcomes for children living in consistent poverty and people parenting alone. It is not just a matter of saying we want to ensure lone parents will get work so they will not be depending on welfare. What we want for people are the services that wrap around working families, be they single-parent families or dual-parent families. It is a question of ensuring child care is supported financially by the State, that education will become more affordable or less of a cost to families, and that we extend the already introduced free GP care for children from birth to six to children up to 12 or 18 years of age. It is a matter of addressing the housing crisis by building more social housing and not quoting statistics, as Senator Craughwell said. We are all aware of the numbers of houses to be built in the next 12 months, 24 months and 36 months. Admittedly, the rate of construction is not half as fast as we would all like, but the houses are coming. In the round, that will alleviate the problems for the section of society in question, which is probably more affected by the housing crisis than some others. I recognise I am not touching on maintenance. Suffice it to say that if anybody is under the impression that we deduct money in respect of those who have been promised maintenance and have not received it, he or she should realise we categorically do not do so. If Senators have examples of where they believe this is happening, however, they should please bring them to my attention and we will address them. Under no circumstances are people's means taken into account when we assess their overall means if they are not actually getting the money. That would be totally counterproductive. If the Senators have specific cases, however, they should please come to me. With regard to the overall recommendation in the joint committee's report on means, I will revert to the House. The work we started was interrupted by Indecon and the budget. I will revert to the House on another date, if Senators do not mind. Our ambition is to ensure we meet our target regarding the 113,000 children living in consistent poverty, many of whom come from lone-parent families. We may not meet it by 2020. I do not know whether Senators saw the report we released last week. It was a joint report issued by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, and me. We may not meet the target by 2020 simply because the goalposts keep moving in respect of the median of 60% since the economy is recovering. That is great but it is not so great when my target is specifically based on 60% of the average income. Senator Nash should note that we will be helped by the fact that we will achieve a national minimum wage of €10.50. Along with very many of the companies that already pay the living wage, we hope we will actually get there sooner than some of the sceptics who challenge us believe. I hope we get there a hell of a lot sooner. There is no doubt in my mind that the target of €10.50 will be met within the lifetime of this Government, depending on how long that is. I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak today. I look forward to coming back to talk about the means and maintenance at a later date.

I fail to see the point in making legislative provision if people can just actively ignore it. It would have as much power as labour guidelines on how workplaces should address the issue of gender pay gaps. If we are to be serious about this, the legislation before us should not be merely tokenistic. That is the rationale for the amendments.

I welcome the commitment by the Government to addressing the serious problem of the gender pay gap. I welcome to the Visitors Gallery the representatives of the National Women's Council of Ireland. I thank the council and other organisations, such as IMPACT, for their great support for this Bill. This Bill passed on Second Stage as a Labour Party Private Members’ Bill without opposition on 24 May. We are delighted it is before the House on Committee Stage. We very much hope for cross-party support. We anticipate that the Minister of State will not be opposing the legislation as it proceeds through Committee Stage today. In the context of the specific amendments tabled by my colleague, Senator Conway-Walsh, I thank her for supporting the Bill generally. I acknowledge the amendments have been tabled in the spirit of seeking to strengthen the Bill, which I absolutely appreciate, and to make it prescriptive rather than simply facilitative. I am not against them but I ask the Senator not to press them to a vote today because we anticipate there will be Government amendments on Report Stage. I look forward to working with the Minister of State and colleagues from all parties on how best to shape the Bill to ensure we have an effective mechanism for tackling the gender pay gap. Let me give a little background for colleagues. We know there is a 13.9% pay gap between men and women in Ireland currently. The equal pay legislation we passed in 1974, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, has been ineffective in addressing it. Effectively, women in Ireland are working for free for one month every year. This is a growing problem that has been recognised internationally. We have examined other models of legislation, particularly from the United Kingdom, Australia and Belgium, where steps have been taken to tackle gender pay discrepancies through transparency and disclosure of data to show where there is a gender pay gap in existence. As colleagues will be aware, this issue came to a head in the context of the gender pay disparity in RTÉ. As a result of its being revealed, we saw the publication by RTÉ of figures. This Bill seeks to enable this kind of publication. The data would be anonymised so no individual employees would be identified. The data would simply show how many men and women work at a particular level in an organisation and their level of pay. In that way, we could establish whether there is a pay gap between women and men in a particular organisation. That is the nature of the Bill. We have included the word "may" in the legislation rather than "shall" specifically to keep it in line with the existing Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, which in section 32 empowers the commission to invite a particular undertaking or group of undertakings, or a particular sector, to carry out an equality review or prepare and implement an equality action plan. Our Bill specifically seeks to enhance the power of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission by inserting a new section 32A into the 2014 Act. This would also empower the commission to require employers to publish the pay data I have described to show whether there is a gender pay gap in their organisations. We have simply used the same language that is in the 2014 Act, namely, the word "may". The Sinn Féin amendment would make it stronger and state "shall publish". We were conscious that the commission is independent in its functions and that the word "shall" might be unduly prescriptive. Rather, we want to empower the commission to take the sort of action I have described. I have been consulting since we took Second Stage of the Bill. I am mindful that there may be a better mechanism altogether than empowering the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to obtain the data from employers. In this regard, let us consider what is happening in other jurisdictions. In Britain, for example, there is a government website on which data are required to be published by employers. Therefore, it may well be that the collation or publishing of the data could be achieved by a State agency or a Department, be it the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation or the Department of Justice and Equality.Perhaps the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation would be more appropriate. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission would then have a role in oversight and monitoring. Where the data published disclosed a gender pay gap in an organisation or a sector, for example, in a given chain of supermarkets or the whole supermarket sector, then the commission would be empowered, as it is currently under the 2014 legislation, to require the employer to take steps to address and remedy the gender pay discrepancy. It may well be that we would be willing to countenance amendments to this legislation to place a different onus on the commission, that is, the onus of monitoring and oversight, rather than the onus of collecting the data in the first place. There are two steps. The first is the diagnostic aspect, whereby we must ensure that we know where gender pay gaps exist. We must see the data and it must be published transparently. We have seen that method used effectively in Australia and Britain. It is not simply a matter of name and shame, and I know there is another Sinn Féin amendment on that point. We have to be careful about that. It is not simply about name and shame. It is also about name and fame. An IMPACT official said to me today that companies or organisations that are doing well and in which there is no gender pay gap would be disclosed and celebrated. In such organisations there is in fact pay parity between women and men. I would describe this as a carrot rather than a big stick. The diagnostic element involves publishing the data and the power to publish the data. That is why we are including the enabling language of "may". The Sinn Féin language probably steers us to a different level by using "shall". I am not opposed to it per se. I am in favour of anything that strengthens the Bill, but I can see that we have to work with stakeholders. I am conscious that the Minister of State and the Department of Justice and Equality as well as the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Fitzgerald, are engaging in consultation. There will be a symposium in December. Some organisations have changed their positions. I am delighted that IBEC has come out this month in its publication in favour of measures to tackle the gender pay gap. I know some in that publication are critical of aspects of the Bill. I believe we can work together to ensure a good model is adopted that addresses the concerns individuals may have around anonymity. Some say there may be data protection concerns, but that should not arise if the data are anonymised. That is important to say. We like the current model. It is useful to look at using the existing mechanism of the independent agency, that is, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and to give it additional or enhanced powers in respect of gender pay gap monitoring and oversight. It may be that the body that will be given powers to require publication of information might be a different body. We prefer not to set up a new agency. I am conscious that in Australia, for example, the model is the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. I know that is probably not the best approach for us. We took the view that existing legislation uses similar terms through the use of the expression "may" with reference to the commission carrying out equality reviews or action plans with different undertakings under section 32 of the 2014 Act. We should look at similar powers and provisions in this case around the publication of gender pay gap information. I apologise for going on so long. However, I believe this is a key amendment in terms of how the Bill works or how it would work. We are absolutely open to amendments. We are happy that there is ongoing consultation and that the Government has committed to this. This is very much in the spirit of the commitment in the programme for Government. IBEC has been critical of our model of more than 50 employees as being too low a bar. Of course, that is the Government's level. The model mirrors what is already provided for in the 2014 Act, section 32 of which gives the commission powers around equality reviews and equality action plans in respect of undertakings of 50 or more employees. We already have a model and we are keen to keep it within existing legal framework while ensuring that we provide for enhanced powers such that we can get the information we need without the existence of a gender pay gap.

It is great to see this Bill progressing on Committee Stage. I congratulate Senator Bacik and the Labour Party Senators for keeping the pressure on this issue. It is important. We have a real problem here. It is 40 years since we saw equal pay legislation. I would have thought that since that was in place there would be no need to have this conversation. Women earn 14% less than men on an aggregate basis and that is utterly unacceptable. We have to take additional measures like those set out in the Bill to ensure that this issue is addressed via the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission or some other collector of data - Senator Bacik referred to Departments - with the commission having oversight. That is an interesting idea. We must ensure that the Bill is as strong as possible. Some of the amendments tabled by Senator Conway-Walsh would strengthen the Bill. The first aspect of all of this is to bring the problem to the surface, because it is not everywhere. That is important. We do not know that we have a problem until we know where the problem is. That represents an important part and consequence of the Bill. A little shaming is no harm, but I think so-called faming also works. Both carrot and stick are appropriate, but information is everything. I am delighted IBEC has come on board. There is nothing more depleting of morale and productivity than finding that a person is getting paid less or has different terms and conditions than another sitting beside that person who would appear to be doing the same job. All these issues are emerging with new teachers and gardaí coming in. We should have a situation whereby similar work is paid similarly, especially in this instance, irrespective of gender. The debate also provides us with an opportunity to hear the Government intent on the matter. I hope the Minister of State will set out his stall to us today. The inclusion of actions in strategies is well and good, but we need concrete action to address and eliminate this issue. There is no reason to have a gender pay gap at all. It is possible to eliminate it and I believe the proposals in the Bill requiring companies with 50 employees or more to publish any differences in the rates they pay to men and women, including bonus pay, would represent a concrete measure. It has been proven to work elsewhere. I hope that we can follow suit in this country.

The Bill is welcome. Senator Kelleher touched on an important point. We need to diagnose the problem first. Sometimes, when I speak about the gender pay gap with people, they seem to think that it does not exist, that it is some kind of figment of our imagination or that it is not actually happening. However, it is happening. People are keeping it to themselves because many women are embarrassed that they are being paid less than others who are often junior to them in companies. This is a good way of highlighting the issue, diagnosing the problem and then doing something about it. The next steps are important. Once we have the problem diagnosed and we can see where it arises, then we can bring companies along. As legislators, we need to focus on the two main policy areas of child care and shared parental leave. Affordable child care is something I have been speaking about for a long time. It really needs to gain traction if we are going to close the gender pay gap. Many of the women I speak to who have taken prolonged periods out of the workforce never wanted to do so in the first place. They find when they go back that they are at a far lower level and their bargaining position is far weaker. Many never wanted to take five or six years out but they were forced to do so due to the high cost of child care in this country. If we had a proper focusing of the Government mind on providing subsidised child care throughout the country in every community, then I believe we would see the gender pay gap narrowing. Shared parental leave is essential. Let us suppose an employer is hiring or promoting employees. If the organisation can look at a male and female employee in the same light, in the sense that they both could take time off to look after young children, then I think we would see far less prominence given to men in promotional circumstances. I very much welcome and support the Bill.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	146	I am very pleased to be back in the Seanad to discuss this Bill in the names of Senators Ivana Bacik, Kevin Humphreys, Gerald Nash and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin. I congratulate Senator Lorraine Clifford Lee on the birth of her little boy. It brings to mind the issue of maternity and paternity leave for politicians, an issue on which we should focus at some stage with a view to determining if people want something to be done in that regard. I also note that while a lot of progress has been made on the issue of child care, more has to be done. It is an issue the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, has seized upon and, with the support of everybody, I hope we can make further progress on it. It is a very important issue and the Senator was right to raise it. To get back to the issue in hand, as Senators will be aware, the Government has committed in A Programme for a Partnership Government and in an action in the national strategy for women and girls, which I encourage colleagues to read because it contains a lot of information, to promoting wage transparency by requiring companies with 50 or more employees to periodically complete a wage survey and report the results. This is part of a package of measures envisaged to address the gender pay gap. A public consultation process to inform this work concluded on 4 October and the analysis of the submissions received has started. The findings will be considered at a symposium planned for 4 December to identify the actions needed in the short and medium term, including the most useful methodology to be used in wage surveys. It would be my preference for the Bill to complete Committee Stage but not to progress further until the Government brings forward proposals following full consultation with stakeholders. Actions are happening in parallel to what we are doing. It is in that context that I approach the Bill and the amendments tabled for discussion. I should make it clear that I am examining the Bill with a view to bringing forward a number of Government amendments on Report Stage. I have listened carefully to Senator Conway-Walsh's explanation for the amendments and understand and appreciate her intention to address one of the concerns I raised on Second Stage, namely, that no provision had been made which would guarantee that wage surveys would be introduced. However, the Government's position is that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, should not be involved in wage surveys but rather that the Minister for Justice and Equality, in co-operation with other relevant Ministers, should, subject to appropriate scrutiny by the Houses and based on primary legislation, frame the scheme for wage surveys. It would be a whole-of-government approach which I am sure Senators will agree would carry a great deal of weight. We understand informally that the IHREC also considers that it would not be appropriate for it to take on this role, but I accept what Senator Ivana Bacik has said about it having an oversight role. That will happen and it is important that it should. A lead-in time would be needed both for the making and administration of a scheme and for employers to gear up to produce the information specified. I take the opportunity to ask all companies, both public and private, to start focusing on this matter now. It is important that all companies, both public and private, do so if they have not already started. I am preparing an amendment to provide for a commencement order to accommodate this approach. I will bring forward the amendment on Report Stage, with amendments to the Long Title of the Bill to remove the references to the IHREC. Amendment No. 2 would reduce the level of discretion allowed in the making of a scheme. I suggest that when the list of matters to be prescribed in a scheme is reasonable, it may not be necessary to require that all matters be dealt with in every scheme. I note that amendment No. 3 would reduce the discretion allowed. On the face of it, the making of a biannual report by employers sounds reasonable. However, I am concerned that this provision would be unduly restrictive and not offer the flexibility required to vary a scheme to provide for less frequent publication of information should experience and practice suggest it would be beneficial to do so, for example, in the case of smaller employers. I raise an additional matter which concerns the information to be published at employer level in accordance with subsection (4) of section 32A to be inserted by section 1. There may be a danger that the pay of an individual might be worked out from the information published. I am advised by the Attorney General that this raises the matter of compliance with Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union on the protection of personal data which provides that:Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law.The matter will be discussed further with the Office of the Attorney General and I may bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to take account of it. For the reasons outlined, the Government is not able to support the amendments, but I assure Senators that we are all headed in the same direction on the need for wage surveys and to address the gender pay gap. We will bring forward amendments on Report Stage when we have gone through the public consultation process I outlined, including the symposium, and carried out the research that needs to be done. We will then bring proposals to the House for debate and consultation.

I know that the consultation process was concluded on 4 October and that, as he said, the symposium will be held on 4 December. As we are anxious to make progress on this issue, I wonder if he could outline a timeline. We hope to bring the Bill back to the House early in the new year for Report Stage and I understand some of this is within our control as the Labour Party group; therefore, it would be good to work with the Minister of State and his officials on the amendments in the meantime. I am conscious that we did this in the enactment of our previous Private Members' Bill, the Competition (Amendment) Bill, which became law this year. The Minister of State has set out in some detail what might be a better mechanism for wage surveys, under which it would be a Government responsibility. That answers Senator Conway-Walsh's concern about making it more prescriptive in that the Government would have to require the publication of wage surveys. It would be positive to include a role for the commission in providing for oversight and monitoring. That is the diagnostic aspect. The curative aspect involves the penalty and so on, a matter we will debate when we come to deal with amendment No. 4.  I am grateful to the Minister of State for setting out his intention to amend the Bill on Report Stage. I also thank other colleagues for their support for the Bill. I congratulate Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee in particular. She is right about affordable child care, parental leave and paternity leave. There are other measures that need to be taken to address the bigger structural issue of gender pay discrimination. The real experiences of individuals in the workplace have been brought home to me since we introduced the Bill. Women have come up to me and said they have experienced gender pay discrimination, yet there are still people who deny that there is a gender pay gap. We might call them gender pay gap deniers. It is very important that we move forward quickly on this issue to challenge the deniers and show that there is a problem in particular sectors or organisations.

I will call a vote on it on Report Stage. I thank the Labour Party for presenting the Bill which has 100% support from us it, but we strongly believe the issues outlined in the amendments need to be dealt with in the Bill.

Companies take matters such as this seriously when there is a threat of being exposed publicly. However, I also question whether the threat of a fine is worth the paper on which it is written when faced with the decision to opt in or out of such a scheme or face a potential fine. The companies that already know that there is a gender pay gap will run a mile, making this legislation pointless.Sinn Féin backs the spirit of the Bill entirely, but on its practicality, if it became law, there are serious and simplistic errors in it, as it stands. I will not push the amendments to a vote today, but I reserve the right to reintroduce them on Report Stage. I hope Senators Ivana Bacik and Gerald Nash will take this and some of the other things we pointed out on board and have them incorporated in the Bill.

I know that the amendment is in the spirit of trying to strengthen the Bill and that the Minister of State will obviously have a view on it. There may a process issue involved in the provision for multiple fines and in any case it would probably have to be tweaked. We should look at the penalty again. We have included a class A fine for a breach of the scheme. I am conscious that section 33 of the 2014 Act under which the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, was established provides for a class C fine or imprisonment for a term of up to one year for somebody who fails to comply with a substantive notice on foot of an equality review or action plan. As there are already different penalties provided for in that legislation, it may be a case of having to tweak it.  On naming companies and having a public database, we should be careful to say this is not just about naming and shaming but also about naming and faming and celebrating companies that positively promote gender equality and that do not have a gender pay gap. We just do not know what gender pay gap there is in particular sectors or organisations. We just have the very global figure of 13.9% in Ireland. The curative aspect is very important. We need to make sure we get the penalty right and that we are open to amendments. I thank the Senator for bringing forward the amendment.

As a matter of interest, I am really taken by the naming and faming idea. As it happens, I was at the signing this morning of the diversity charter for companies. Some 51 companies were involved and six more joined this morning. They are talking about having a standard diversity mark for companies which they would strive to attain. Penalties are one side of the equation. On the other companies that want to reach certain standards could be awarded certain marks. It strikes me that there could probably be a gender equality pay mark for companies that have achieved a certain standard. Sometimes we focus on penalties when perhaps we should focus on encouraging and supporting the positives just as much, if not even more. I note that Senator Rose Conway-Walsh has suggested she will withdraw the amendment with permission to retable it on Report Stage. Its objective seems to be to provide for penalties where there are repeated breaches of the provisions of a scheme. Provision has been made in subsection (6) for the imposition of penalties for contravention of the provisions of a scheme by an employer. It is not clear, however, what the amendment would add in specifying that multiple class A fines would apply to those who repeatedly contravened the provisions of a scheme. It goes without saying that each such contravention could be punished by the imposition of a class A fine.  I note that the proposed public database for repeat offenders raises the possibility of the expenditure of public funds on its creation and maintenance. The proposal does not provide for matters such as the duration of an entry on such a register. The fact that an employer has been fined for an offence would be a matter of public record. We would have to consider whether the idea of having a database is a proportionate response. Would a company be on it forever? One has to work out how a company could get off the database. That would have to be provided for in the legislation. For these reasons the Government is not able to support the amendment, but I am disposed to considering further what the enforcement and encouragement mechanisms might be. I will observe without expressing a view that the corresponding British regulations in this area do not impose a sanction.
