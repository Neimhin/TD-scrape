The Central Bank has published an internal audit report in respect of lack of compliance with State guidelines for public bodies. The report makes for very poor reading on the part of the bank and raises matters of very great concern. I spoke to the Governor of the Central Bank late last week with a view to inviting him to come before the Committee of Public Accounts, PAC. However, issues around remit have arisen in respect of the PAC so I believe this is the appropriate committee to invite representatives from the Central Bank to appear before. There are other issues associated with these matters relating to allegations being made by a whistleblower and claims that raise concerns about the treatment of that whistleblower in the course of the process. I am not proposing that the committee deal with those matters but the report, which was published last week, is extremely worrying and merits a very early appearance by representatives from the Central Bank. The Governor informed me late last week that he had an open mind about going before the PAC. I took him at his word but it now seems the committee is not in a position to advance that invitation so I think it should come from this committee as quickly as possible. That might not happen before the Christmas break but, nonetheless, I think we should invite representatives from the bank to appear here early in January. Will the Acting Chairman take up that proposal and advance it after this meeting?

In our first public session this afternoon I am pleased to have the opportunity before the recess to hear about developments in NAMA, not least its response to the difficulties facing the housing market. I thank the witnesses for their attendance here today. The format of the meeting will be that Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh will make some opening remarks, which will be followed by a question and answer session. I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.I invite Mr. Daly to begin.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	Thank you, Chairman. We last appeared before the joint committee just over a year ago and can report that very good progress has been made in the meantime across a range of activities. In 2015, to date, we have generated cash receipts of €8.8 billion, which brings the total cash generated since inception to €32.4 billion. Recently, for the first half of the year, we reported a profit of €473 million, including, for the first time, a write-back on impairment. This was higher than the €458 million profit we had reported for the full year of 2014. We expect the 2015 full-year profits to be well in excess of €1 billion. Crucially, from our perspective, we are close to achieving our target of redeeming 80% of our senior debt by the end of 2016. As of today, we have redeemed €22.1 billion or 73% of the €24 billion required to achieve that target. We are confident of redeeming all of our senior debt by 2018 and repaying our €1.593 billion subordinated debt by the first call date of March 2020. As of today, based on current market conditions continuing to prevail, our expectation is that by the time we complete our work, we will have generated a surplus of the order of €2 billion to hand over to the Exchequer. This is some distance from the forecasts of some commentators who not so long ago were predicting NAMA losses of up to €8 billion. Our strong cash position, bolstered by the proceeds of the Project Arrow transaction which was completed last Friday, means that we have the capacity, if required, to fund two significant development programmes which would help to address major supply shortages of residential and office accommodation, particularly in the Dublin area. The chief executive, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, will outline our plans for facilitating and funding the delivery of 20,000 residential units on a commercial basis, mainly located in the greater Dublin area, by 2020. I will focus on the progress made in facilitating the development of key sites which secure our loans within the Dublin docklands strategic development zone, SDZ, area.  The development of the Dublin docklands SDZ is a major priority for NAMA and one on which excellent progress has been made in a relatively short time. Shortly after the docklands area received SDZ designation in May 2014 the NAMA board approved a docklands SDZ business plan and established a special delivery team to oversee the development and, if necessary, funding of sites within the docklands SDZ. The sites under the control of NAMA-appointed receivers and investment partners have the capacity to deliver 3.8 million sq. ft. of commercial space and about 2,000 residential units. The position as of today is as follows: construction has started on sites which are expected to deliver just over 780,000
sq. ft. of commercial, mainly office, accommodation and 245 residential units. Planning permission has been obtained or sought for another 1.8 million
sq. ft. of commercial development space, including office, hotel and 970-bed student accommodation, in addition to 326 residential units. This includes block 10A on North Wall Quay where in recent days planning permission was received for a development of almost 400,000 sq. ft. Pre-planning work is under way on the remaining 1.3 million
sq. ft. of commercial space and some 1,168 residential units. Planning permission was received recently for the construction of a new road from Sheriff Street to North Wall Quay. Construction is expected to begin during the second quarter of 2016. Design work is also under way for the construction of a number of new pedestrian bridges which will facilitate access between the north and south docklands areas.  There are 14 individual sites within the SDZ area which secure our loans. The approach we adopt towards each site depends on its particular characteristics and particular complications that may attach to it. Accordingly, the level of our involvement in the development of sites can vary considerably from very active involvement in some cases to a more passive role in others. In the case of Boland’s Mill, now designated as Boland’s Quay, we have committed to advancing to the receiver all of the required development and associated funding – about €170 million - to enable the site to be developed. The project which will include two landmark office buildings and a block of apartments, in addition to retail, commercial and cultural space, is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.  In other cases, our role is less active. For instance, in the case of a development at 8 Hanover Quay, our involvement is by means of a share in a fund - in this case, an Irish collective asset management vehicle, ICAV - with two joint venture partners. We have also provided construction funding for the project on arm’s length commercial terms. The ICAV’s function is to secure planning permission, procure a tenant, develop the site and dispose of the property when completed. A tenant – Airbnb – has been secured and the sale of the building is close to being agreed. Construction began earlier this year and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2016.  We have adopted a different approach again in the case of a site at 72 to 80 North Wall Quay, Project Wave. In this instance, we entered into an agreement with Oxley Holdings Limited which was selected after an open market process. Under the agreement for lease structure, it acquired the right to develop, manage and realise the site. NAMA has retained the freehold interest and will receive a secure income stream, in addition to a percentage of future sales proceeds.  The development work which has begun in the docklands SDZ will have a major transformational impact on the area and the associated benefits will be felt for many decades to come, not least in the attraction of quality foreign direct investment to Ireland. I emphasise the progress made to date in the docklands would not have been possible without the positive engagement and support we have received from Dublin City Council, both in its capacity as planning authority and as development agency for the area. NAMA was established almost exactly six years ago. Our first board meeting, the minutes of which I was just looking at today, was held on 23 December 2009; we are, therefore, within a week of our sixth anniversary. I cannot help but contrast the very fraught circumstances in which NAMA came into being with the much more positive outlook today. As I mentioned, I recall reading newspaper articles during those early days which included forecasts by various commentators who were predicting authoritatively that NAMA would incur losses of up to €8 billion during its lifetime. Thankfully, they have been well wide of the mark. We will deliver a profit of at least €2 billion. Part of the initial pessimism had to do with the fact that people were unsure about the asset management agency model as a mechanism for dealing with the soured property lending of the banks. In the European context, it was largely untried and untested on the scale envisaged for NAMA. Part of the pessimism also reflected the depth of despair many felt at the rapidly deteriorating property lending crisis as it unfolded during 2009 and 2010. Either way, there was not a huge amount of hope to propel NAMA on its way. The intervening six years have often been difficult and challenging. There can be few organisations which have been the subject of so many differing views and expectations of its role and what it was expected to deliver.Some took the view that NAMA's job was to hold its portfolio for the long term, the premise being, I presume, that somehow the Irish market would recover without the stimulative impact of NAMA's market transactions. Others took the opposite view, that we should forget about maximising the recovery value of the loan portfolio and instead sell the portfolio quickly to generate activity and thereby stimulate the Irish market out of the torpor into which it had fallen as a result of the crisis. There was also a view that NAMA's role should have been to donate property at little or no cost to various groups and activities. This we could not do, however, as we are obliged under the legislation to act commercially and ensure debtors maximised their debt repayments from asset sale proceeds. Those debt repayments go back to the Irish taxpayer. Another view was that NAMA should enforce against all of its debtors on the basis that those who were part of the problem should not be part of the solution. Finally, we had those who characterised NAMA dismissively as a debt collector, the implication being that those who borrowed millions and billions should have been granted a moratorium on debt repayments at the same time as many ordinary people were struggling to keep up payments on their mortgages. In reality, NAMA could not be all things to all people and, indeed, it never sought to be. We were obliged to operate to the clear and unequivocal mandate set for us by the Oireachtas, namely, to conduct our business on an independent and commercial basis and, subject to that requirement, if we could also make a worthwhile social and economic contribution, so much the better. This clear mandate meant, first and foremost, that we had to recover the €32 billion of debt we incurred to acquire loans from the banks. This meant working with our debtors and receivers, who controlled the underlying property collateral, to repay as much of their debt as possible. If, as a result of our efforts and those of our debtors and receivers, there is a surplus by whatever future date we complete our work, that surplus will be handed over to the Exchequer. I take this opportunity to refer to the significant amount of commentary we have seen recently regarding one of our sales transactions. To clarify, we cannot give preferential treatment to some bidders at the expense of others who are willing to pay higher prices for assets. If taxpayer funds are to be allocated to particular groups or activities, it is appropriate that the elected Government, not NAMA, should decide how those funds are allocated and which groups or activities benefit from them. I mentioned earlier that the asset management agency approach was untested on a major scale in the European context until it was implemented in Ireland with the establishment of NAMA in 2009. My view that the agency has been very successful in carrying out its work is a view shared by major international organisations and by other sovereigns. A recent report by Moody's, for example, compared NAMA very favourably with two other large European sovereign work-out vehicles, Sareb in Spain and Germany's FMS-WM. Of course, NAMA has had its share of critics, not least among that minority of debtors who expected their spell in NAMA to be one long untroubled sabbatical from reality, with no requirement on their part to make the adjustments necessary to deal with the crisis. That was not how we saw it and I doubt if taxpayers would see it that way. The cosy relationships between some debtors and their banks could not continue if the crisis was to be addressed. We are often asked for advice by other sovereigns which have established or are contemplating the establishment of entities similar to NAMA. Our view is that the asset management agency approach works best where one has a portfolio of distressed assets which are broadly similar - commercial property loans, in our case - and there is sufficient scale to justify the recruitment of experienced specialists to manage it in a professional manner. We also highlight the importance of a clear and independent statutory mandate to enable the business to be conducted in a commercial manner and without external interference. We emphasise, too, something that has been very important in terms of attracting and consolidating investor interest in Ireland, namely, the assurance that transactions will be openly marketed, managed in a professional manner and that the best bids will be accepted with no preferential treatment for anyone. With the very formidable challenges of the past six years behind us, we have now begun the final phase of our work. This will involve facilitating an expanded residential delivery programme and the development of the Dublin docklands strategic development zone, SDZ. The primary motivation for these programmes is commercial, that is, to maximise the sales proceeds our debtors and receivers can generate from their assets and thereby enhance their capacity to repay their debt to taxpayers. Given the serious supply shortages of residential and office accommodation in Dublin and other urban areas, these programmes are likely to generate wider economic and social benefits. Those seeking to purchase their first homes will benefit from the greater choice that will be available as new supply is delivered. New supply will act to reduce upward pressure on sales prices and on the level of rents. I am convinced that NAMA funding of this programme will mean that supply comes on stream sooner than would be the case if the sites were to be sold to the market. There will also be major benefits in terms of employment. Our estimates, based on industry benchmarks, suggest that construction funding on the scale proposed will lead to the creation of 30,000
construction jobs when activity reaches its peak. In addition to direct jobs, this scale of construction activity will generate an additional 10,000 jobs downstream in the construction supply chain. There will also be fiscal gains from this increased economic activity in the form of higher tax receipts from newly employed construction and other workers and an associated reduction in social protection payments. We expect NAMA's funding of residential projects will generate a positive return for taxpayers and thereby enhance the currently projected €2 billion surplus that is to be transferred to the Exchequer when we complete our work. NAMA debtors and receivers, even operating at full capacity, can deliver only one fifth of the 100,000 unit supply that will be required over the next five years. That leaves more than enough scope for others to deliver the additional 80,000 units the country so badly needs.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	My colleague, Mr. Daly, has spoken about the progress made on the redemption of NAMA's senior debt and the development of the Dublin docklands SDZ. My comments will be directed at another initiative which we expect to form a major part of NAMA's work in the years ahead, namely, our role in funding the development of a major residential delivery programme between 2016 and 2020. The shortage of housing in the main urban areas and particularly in Dublin has been well documented by now. The cause of the shortage is no great mystery. A fall of more than 50% nationally in residential prices between their peak in 2007 and their lowest point in 2013 meant that residential development, by and large, became commercially unviable, given that construction costs remained fairly constant throughout that period. It is worth bearing in mind that it has taken an increase of 35% in residential sales prices from their low point in 2013 to bring many sites to the point where development might be a commercially viable option, as is now the case for a minority of sites. The average three-bedroom home in the Dublin area, the type of unit we propose to fund on many of our sites, costs €260,000 to €280,000 to build, taking all costs including site value into account, and is currently selling for €300,000. Based on official CSO house price indices, however, even as recently as April 2014, such a house would have achieved a sales price of only €240,000, which is well short of the break-even mark. No funder in the Irish market, including NAMA, would have been willing to engage in speculative funding of residential construction based on a hope that prices might rise in the future. There have been suggestions from some quarters that NAMA and the banks should have been actively funding residential development during the period from 2010 to 2012 when prices were in free fall. This viewpoint is seriously out of touch with any commercial reality. The NAMA board could not have done so as it would have been at variance with our obligations under section 10 of the NAMA Act. It is simply not realistic to suggest that any funder, be it NAMA, one of the banks or any private investor, should have sunk funds into property projects that were not commercially viable. It certainly is not realistic to suggest this would have happened while the country was still reeling from a major property market collapse. As CEO of NAMA, I doubt this committee would have been impressed if I had appeared before it in those earlier years and told members we were funding loss-making residential development at a time when prices were still falling and there were few sales taking place in the market. The committee, quite rightly, would have drawn my attention to NAMA's statutory obligation to act in a commercially sensible manner. Price rises over the past year or so prompted us to review the residential sites securing our loan portfolio to assess whether funding the development of those sites would be a commercially viable proposition. In particular, we asked our specialist residential delivery team to carry out a detailed, site-by-site review to assess the scope within the portfolio for funding a delivery target of 20,000 units by the end of 2020. Arising from that detailed review, we are confident that sites capable of delivering 13,200 units are commercially viable to develop at current prices. We are also confident that intensive asset management work on other sites, including enhanced planning and the provision of strategic infrastructure, will ensure the residual 6,800 units are likewise delivered.With that in mind, we intend to work closely with local authorities, with Irish Water and with Transport Infrastructure Ireland to address any infrastructural issues which are impeding the development of sites which would otherwise be commercially viable. The 20,000 unit target set for the period from 2016 to 2020 is in addition to the 2,300 units which have been delivered since the beginning of 2014. In addition to working towards funding housing delivery, NAMA has also focused on funding new or improved planning permission for other sites which secure its loans. In addition to the 2,300 units which have been completed to date, construction has begun on sites which will ultimately deliver another 3,000 units. Over 900 units have been built on sites sold by debtors and receivers since early 2014; these sites have a capacity to deliver 11,000 units. Another 5,000 units have received planning permission with construction expected to begin on the majority of these in 2016. Planning applications have been lodged or will be lodged within 12 months for another 9,900 units. Finally, another 32,500 units are at the pre-planning stage or feasibility stages. Delivery of this programme will be a major challenge. NAMA, through its funding and management activity, aims to increase delivery from an average of 1,250 units per annum to an annual average of 4,000 units in 2016-2020. We would expect that much of our funding will go towards the construction of starter homes in the €250,000 to €300,000 price bracket. Construction is currently taking place on some 40 sites and this will need to be increased to 100 concurrently active sites if the target is to be met. It is estimated that NAMA debtors and receivers control only about 30% of zoned residential sites in the Dublin area. To achieve the 20,000 unit end-2020 target, NAMA will work with existing debtors and receivers but we also plan to work with joint venture partners and with non-NAMA housebuilding firms. NAMA is keen to ensure that a wide array of market participants will contribute to this programme and, to that end, is seeking expressions of interest from potential partners willing to work with it over the next five years to deliver badly needed housing in Ireland. A new residential delivery division has been established in NAMA to bring drive and focus to its expanded residential delivery programme. Our projections indicate that total funding for the programme will be €5.6 billion, assuming 20,000 units, and that peak funding will be €1.8 billion. Based on sites which are currently viable, NAMA's overall return on the programme is projected to be 15%. Under Section 10 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is required to operate on a commercial basis. Since its inception, it has funded numerous development projects relating to assets securing its loans. Our key criterion for funding any development project is whether the project will generate a better commercial return with funding than it would generate from alternative options such as a straight sale. For the debtor or receiver, that higher return means that more of the debtor's debt can be redeemed. As with all projects, funding for residential development projects must meet a stringent commercial viability threshold, a commercial return which is broadly in line with what a private investor or lender would require. NAMA will only fund projects that pass this test. The funding rates that we propose to apply to construction funding will be in line with corresponding rates in the market. We are aware that a complaint has been submitted to the EU Commission alleging that there may be State aid implications to our proposal to fund commercially viable residential projects under the control of our debtors and receivers. In conjunction with the Department of Finance, we have had preliminary engagement with the Commission. I am reluctant to comment further at this stage other than to indicate that the NAMA board is entirely satisfied that our proposed programme does not constitute State aid. It has been claimed that NAMA's involvement will leave the market in a state of crisis by forcing competitors out of business. This I reject out of hand. Most forecasts suggest that aggregate market demand will be for about 100,000 units up to 2020. It is worth pointing out that the NAMA programme, even if fully delivered, will meet only 20% of the 100,000 housing units required over that period. That suggests that there is a lot of scope left for others to contribute the additional 80,000 units that will be needed to meet expected demand over the period. In addition, NAMA debtors whose projects are likely to be funded by us are among the best house builders in the country in terms of their track record over the years, both in terms of the volume of houses delivered and the quality of their developments. It is vitally important for the future of the sector that these developers are working to full capacity over the next five years. Not only can they make a major contribution within that period but it is also important that, when they emerge from NAMA, they are in a position to exert a positive and significant impact on residential delivery for many years to come. Finally, it is worth bearing in mind that any financial surplus generated by the residential delivery programme will be transferred to the Exchequer and will thereby reduce the losses incurred by taxpayers as a result of poor property lending by financial institutions and excessive borrowing by debtors during the last decade. On social housing, we have been working hard to contribute to its delivery. Since the start of 2012, we have identified over 6,500 houses and apartments, controlled by our debtors and receivers, as available for social housing. Some 2,500 of these have been confirmed as suitable by local authorities. NAMA has been working with its debtors and receivers, together with local authorities, housing groups and charities, to ensure that these 2,500 houses and apartments are delivered as quickly and as efficiently as possible. I am happy to confirm that by last Friday, 2,000 of the 2,500 houses and apartments had been delivered. This was our target for end-2015. To put this into context, the 2,000 units equate to more than one third of the total delivery of Part V social housing between 2002 and 2011 of 5,700 units, and this was during a period of unprecedented housing output in Ireland when 550,000 new residential units were built. These 2,000 homes have been delivered across 131 individual projects spread over 18 counties and have involved transactions with 18 approved housing bodies and nine local authorities. Along the way, we have invested over €70 million to remediate and complete properties.  We have also taken initiatives which have helped to streamline the process, including the establishment of a special purpose company, National Asset Residential Property Services, NARPS. The NARPS vehicle, together with the direct leasing or sale of social housing units by NAMA debtors and receivers, has become an increasingly important mechanism in delivering social housing. Over 70% of the units delivered in 2015 were delivered through NARPS. We have invested more than €150 million through NARPS to buy houses and apartments from our debtors and receivers and to lease them directly to local authorities and approved housing bodies. By the time all properties are delivered under this initiative, NAMA will have spent more than €250 million in remediating and completing properties and in buying properties through NARPS. Delivering these units for social housing is a win-win situation. First and foremost, people who need a home get a home. For the local authority, it means a shorter waiting list for social housing and an unoccupied property is finally brought to its intended use. This has also helped us to reduce the number of unfinished housing estates from 332 in 2010 to 47 at end-2015 and we expect these last 47 estates to be resolved by end-2016. In addition to the 2,000 social housing units delivered by end-2015, and in line with Part V requirements, a significant delivery of social housing will be part of NAMA's expanded 2016-2020 residential delivery programme. As you know, the revised requirement is that 10% of all new schemes be reserved for social housing. Wherever feasible, NAMA will facilitate the provision by its debtors and receivers of future Part V housing on NAMA-funded developments through the NARPS vehicle. This will mean that NAMA, rather than local authorities, will bear the upfront capital cost of delivering Part V housing on developments that it funds. Instead of the local authority purchasing the units from the developer, NARPS will do so and will then enter into a leasing arrangement with the local authority or approved housing body. There have been some representations to the Minister for Finance recently to the effect that NAMA-funded development sites should be required to include a higher proportion of social housing than applies in the case of Part V housing generally. I would suggest that it is neither equitable nor feasible to impose different social housing obligations on developers, based purely on their sources of development finance. To impose on a NAMA debtor a higher obligation to deliver social housing than is imposed, for instance, on a developer who is funded by a bank or who has access to other sources of finance, would be arbitrary, discriminatory and very likely to be subjected to legal challenge. It will also have the effect of reducing the commercial viability of sites. Given that, under section 10 of the NAMA Act, NAMA can only fund commercially viable projects, the net effect therefore would be to reduce the total number of units which could be delivered. From the perspective of a NAMA debtor, his primary objective is to redeem as much of his debt as he can. If he is faced with additional obligations over and above those that are imposed on non-NAMA developers, he will clearly find it more difficult to repay any given amount of debt than would his counterpart who has borrowed from a bank or from another source of capital. I cannot see how such an additional imposition could survive legal challenge. There was a widespread perception in earlier years – although less so now - that every unfinished estate in the country was under the control of NAMA. In fact, that was far from the true position. After we analysed the collateral securing our acquired loans, we estimated that only about one in ten unfinished estates in Ireland was under our control. At that stage, NAMA loans were secured by 332 estates that were classified as unfinished by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. As mentioned earlier, that number is now down to 47 and we expect these to be addressed over the course of 2016 once site resolution plans are finalised with local authorities. It is worth adding that about half of the 2,000 social housing units that NAMA has delivered to date are located on estates that had originally been classified as unfinished. In completing these units, not only have the new residents benefited but existing residents have also benefited from the enhancement of the estates concerned. What has been achieved over the past six years, in often difficult circumstances, is a great tribute to the NAMA board, the Executive team and, particularly, NAMA staff.As the committee will be aware, officers of NAMA are employed on specified purpose contracts which expire at NAMA's discretion. There cannot be many situations whereby the better one performs one's work, the sooner one will be out of a job. This has been the context in which NAMA staff have been operating for the past six years. Over recent years, unlike employees of other commercial State bodies, NAMA staff became subject to FEMPI legislation, including the consequential salary cuts. As a result, we lost many experienced and expert members of staff. In 2013 and 2014, the level of staff turnover was such that we faced a challenge in maintaining sufficient continuity to ensure that our functions were carried out to the high professional standards that we had set for ourselves. The decision of the Minister for Finance last year to approve a redundancy programme for NAMA staff was helpful in stabilising a difficult situation. The programme is expected to cost €20 million over NAMA's lifetime. Some €14 million of this relates to standard public sector redundancy terms, including two weeks’ statutory pay per year of service, capped at €600 per week, plus three additional weeks of base salary per year of service with an overall cap of two years' base salary. The other €6 million relates to an additional redundancy payment which is designed to ensure that staff remain for as long as we need them – this element equates to a one-off payment of ten weeks of final salary. It should be borne in mind that this scheme only applies in circumstances where staff members are being made redundant and have remained with NAMA for the period required to fulfil its mandate, and at NAMA's discretion. The NAMA scheme should not be confused with certain retention schemes which have been the subject of recent public discussion, whereby certain staff in State bodies receive payments while remaining employed within an organisation. NAMA has made no such payments since its inception and I reiterate that the NAMA scheme only applies when a staff member is leaving at NAMA's discretion.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	In his opening statement, Mr. Daly makes a lot of play on the absence of preferential treatment by NAMA, the absence of cosy relationships, etc. In light of that, I want to ask him a couple of questions about Project Eagle, the sale of the northern loan portfolio. When was it decided to bundle the properties and sell them in a single lot? Can he recall the date?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	It was 12 December 2013.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	Does Mr. Daly have paperwork or analysis that informed that decision of the board?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	11	There would be paperwork, yes. We would have done an analysis of what the best option was for NAMA. Deputy McDonald will recall that this was the end of a process that started, I suppose, in September 2013, with an unsolicited approach to NAMA.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	We will come back to that. I merely want to know does NAMA have paperwork and can Mr. Daly provide it to the committee.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	We can provide some paperwork but, obviously, some of it would be commercially sensitive. We will look at what we have. We would not have taken a decision on something like that without going through the alternatives. It is back to what Mr. McDonagh was referring to.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	What I am referring to, specifically, is the decision to have the transaction as one lot. Obviously, NAMA made an analysis of that and the transaction has now occurred. I would like to see the documentation on it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	We would have looked at the alternatives to doing it in one lot and that would have informed our decision to put it in one lot. We have provided all of those papers to the Comptroller and Auditor General who is, as Deputy McDonald will be aware, conducting his triennial inquiry.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	Yes, of course. I am asking that Mr. Daly provide the paperwork, the basis upon which NAMA took that decision for a single lot, to the committee. Can Mr. Daly do that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	We can look at that and see how commercially sensitive it is.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	19	Yes, he has come up at the Committee of Public Accounts.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	21	Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	23	That is correct.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	25	It was on an insolvency panel. As the Deputy will be aware, the way NAMA operates for insolvency-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	On an insolvency panel, not a consultancy panel.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	29	It did, and that is public knowledge. It has been published in our annual report or on our website. We gave the information to the Committee of Public Accounts and to the Northern Ireland Committee for Finance and Personnel. It is on the website as well.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	30	Is Mr. Daly aware that Mr. Watters claims responsibility for the decision for coming up with the initiative to bundle those properties? Mr. Watters did not refer to it as Project Eagle. It was referred to as "Project Amani" when it was first conceived.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	I have seen a lot of the commentary in Northern Ireland which refers to what Mr. Watters and others are alleged to have said, but I have no direct knowledge of that.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	Might it be an idea to correspond with this gentleman to establish the veracity of his claims? He is fairly firm in his view. He wrote to Tughans, the solicitors' firm that we have discussed long and hard, which was involved in the initial Pimco debacle and then, subsequently, in the Cerberus debacle, and he is quite firmly of the view that he did considerable work, and had involved Mr. Frank Cushnahan, who was then a member of the northern advisory committee of NAMA, in the scheme to bundle the properties together into a single entity. He is quite sore that he did not get a fee it seems that he was promised for that work.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	33	I would totally disagree with Deputy McDonald's characterisation of the Pimco or Cerberus deals as debacles, particularly the Cerberus one. We have been through all this at length in the Committee of Public Accounts and I do not intend to go through it again.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	34	I know, but it gets curiouser and curiouser.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	35	Deputy McDonald and I have a totally different view of this. If Mr. Watters is sore about not getting a fee then that is his problem, but let me make one point clear. He was never going to get a fee or expected to get a fee, or never could have reasonably thought he might get a fee, from NAMA or anybody connected to it.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	36	Mr. Watters says that he involved Mr. Cushnahan, who was very much part of NAMA at the time, to work on the concept. It was called Project Amani. They then approached Mr. Ian Coulter - another name familiar to Mr. Daly - of Tughans who, in turn, approached Brown Rudnick - a man by the name of Mr. Tuvi Keinan who is also known to Mr. Daly. This gentleman then came up with the two names, Pimco and Cerberus, and all of that predated the formal approach to NAMA. Mr. Daly may claim that is none of his business and it is not his problem, except for the fact that Mr. Cushnahan, in particular, and others, were very close. They had, would we call it, "a cosy relationship" with NAMA while all of these manoeuvres were in play.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	37	No. Mr. Cushnahan was a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee up until November 2013, as the Deputy will be aware.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	38	That is correct.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	39	I certainly would not characterise his relationship with NAMA as a cosy one. A lot of allegations have been made in Northern Ireland about some of the names Deputy McDonald mentioned and their relationship with Mr. Cushnahan, and whether meetings were going on or matters were being discussed. NAMA had no knowledge of those, and still does not have any first-----
#AideenHayden	unknown-#AideenHayden-party	unknown-#AideenHayden-dob	unknown-#AideenHayden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	I am sorry, I will intervene at this point. I must remind members and those who are here giving evidence today as witnesses that one should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I am aware that a lot of this is in the public domain but I must make members and witnesses aware that this is the position.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	41	I thank the Vice Chairman. I have not mentioned any name that has not been put to me in a question.
#AideenHayden	unknown-#AideenHayden-party	unknown-#AideenHayden-dob	unknown-#AideenHayden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	42	I am aware of that. I am simply making the comment before this discussion goes much further.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	43	With that in mind, when Mr. Daly appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts his line of argument in respect of Project Eagle was that if there are difficulties and allegations, they all reside on the side of the purchaser.Mr. Daly said NAMA had a clean bill of health.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	44	Sorry, I said - and it is an important distinction - that they reside on the purchase side and not with the purchaser. I have not made any allegations against Cerberus, which was the purchaser.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	45	I take that correction. It is the purchase side. Of course, it subsequently emerged that Mr. Cushnahan, in addition to all of the other controversies surrounding him, had, in fact, had a meeting with PIMCO, the original bidder, while still engaged by NAMA. I know Mr. Daly wrote to Mr. Cushnahan on 19 November 2015 because I have a copy of the letter in front of me. Has he had a response to this letter?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	46	Yes. The allegation that Mr. Cushnahan met PIMCO was given in evidence by the First Minister of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson, to the committee on finance, in which he stated that in May 2013 he had met PIMCO and that Mr. Cushnahan was there. This was news to NAMA. We were not aware of this. I wrote to Mr. Cushnahan on 19 November and asked him to come back to me on whether this was correct, whether he had any views or whether he wanted to tell me anything about it. I also asked him to clarify whether any other relevant meetings had taken place. I asked why he had not declared or deemed it appropriate to declare these interests to NAMA. I have not had a reply from Mr. Cushnahan to this. We provided the letter to Mr. Cushnahan to the Northern Ireland finance committee. We also sent it to the Committee of Public Accounts and I understand it was noted.

We are getting into the specifics of a particular case, which is not the function of the meeting we are attending.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	48	It is, as a matter of fact. What is the topic?

Everyone was advised that they should not make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in any such way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I ask everyone to please respect this. It is in accordance with the Defamation Act 2009. If people depart from this they do so at their own peril.

I am just saying I did not hear any charges being made. Questions were being asked.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	55	There is no call for that. We are here to discuss NAMA. This is a matter that goes to the heart of the governance of NAMA, which I understood was the topic under discussion. When this transaction occurred it was the single largest transaction overseen by NAMA, and it has been riddled with controversy and question marks. I believe it was a corrupted process from the get-go. I have discussed this with Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh previously. I have specific questions and I want answers to them. Sin é.

The issues and the names of the individuals concerned are in broad public circulation, and there has been correspondence and hearings here and in the North in which these names have been well ventilated, so I do not accept that position. I really hope the Vice Chairman is not trying to disrupt my line of questioning with this witness.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	63	I respect the ruling of the Vice Chairman but, leaving names aside, I cannot let Deputy McDonald's reference to a corrupted process stay on the record. This loan sale - I have said this before at the Committee of Public Accounts, but I need to say it again - was well managed. It was competitive and conducted in line with best international practice, independently overseen by Lazard, a major international investment bank. Nine major global investment companies were engaged. The integrity of the sales process was fully protected. No external members of the Northern Ireland advisory committee - because this is what always comes back to - had access to confidential information on this sale, but all of the bidders had equal access to the information. No third parties-----

A number of times during their speeches, Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh spoke about acting on a commercial basis, which has prohibited them from doing things that other people would have expected them to do, be they debtors, politicians or people in Ratoath. The terms "social dividend" and "social return" were bandied around an awful lot when NAMA was established. From where did they come, given that section 10 probably precluded any of NAMA's activities from ever giving a social dividend, given the climate we had in 2009? I was not here at the time. Did it come from the likes of me hoping that out of a mirage of something bad we could attain something good?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	117	I will answer this, as I was around when the legislation was developed. The NAMA legislation was very controversial at the time, and as part of the debate 400 amendments were proposed between the time when the legislation was first introduced to the Dáil, in September 2009, and when it was passed in November 2009.One of those amendments concerned the social dividend. That was inserted as a purpose of the Act under section 2 but the board is obliged to act in accordance with section 10, which means getting the best commercial return. That is the legal constraint within which the Oireachtas obliges the board to operate. We have done our best to facilitate the provisional sale of sites from debtors to the Department of Education and Skills and local authorities for schools and social housing, and where sporting organisations had leased land from debtors we have ensured those leases continue as long as possible. We have been supportive where we can but unfortunately the board has to operate within the legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	118	In effect section 10 overrode section 2. NAMA was paid for the land it sold to the Department of Education and Skills and the land for social housing. There were no dollars lost.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	119	The board is not allowed to give away anything for free. It has to maximise return. If the land has an agricultural value the debtor gets an independent valuation and if somebody expresses an interest in it then it is sold at that value to what is effectively a governmental body. There will also be several non-governmental bodies interested but they would have to bid on the open market like everybody else.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	120	Why were so many of the houses offered to local authorities returned? Was there an overarching reason or did authorities have individual reasons?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	121	We do not hold the houses. They are held by our debtors. A total of 6,500 units were offered to the housing agency and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which had discussions with local authorities around the country and only 2,500 were deemed acceptable. Sometimes the decision took so long that the debtor wanted to sell the houses. We could not hold them back any longer and had to sell them. On other occasions they were rejected. The main reason for rejection seems to come down to the fact that the local authority and the housing agency, which is part of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, deemed there to be an over-concentration of social housing in that area. The last time we discussed this was before the Committee of Public Accounts, PAC. The County and City Management Association issued a statement afterwards saying many of the houses were unsuitable or were not built in accordance with regulations, or whatever the case was. That was the case for some of the houses but as I said at that PAC meeting, we have remediated many of the problems through working with local authorities on site resolution plans to make those houses accord with the regulations. When we offer them the local authorities have to tell us they want them, then they have to start engaging with the debtor to sell them to the housing agency or local authority, or to us so that we can lease them back to the housing agency. The main reason was the over-concentration of social housing.

NAMA does not manage them itself. Can Ms Birmingham tell me if it is possible to get information for the past nine years on who manages them, the breakdown of contracts, how they are awarded, and whether there is an audit of what the sub-contractors charge the contractor, for example, to wash windows, and what the contractor charges NAMA?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	123	NAMA does not engage anyone to wash windows or do anything of that nature because we do not own the properties. The debtors or receivers would engage any third parties that might be required to carry out any services in respect of the properties.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	124	Do they charge NAMA?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	125	They do not charge us. It is a cost for the debtor or associated with that property, for instance, if it is a multi-let building, that might be a service charge cost levied against the tenants. It depends on the nature of the property. If it is for a receiver to make the property safe and secure that will be a cost to the receivership.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	126	Is there an audit, from NAMA’s perspective, through the debtors and receivers, of the third party contractor doing the work, whether securing the property, or fixing a window?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	127	These are property management costs and they are either taken off against the rent that comes in for the property, if it is rented. Typically, NAMA has a financial monitor who makes sure the work is done and that there are appropriate invoices against industry benchmarks. It is in our interest to make sure the overheads are kept as low as possible but the costs are incurred by the debtors because they own the properties.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	129	They do not appear in our books but if a rent of €1 million comes in for an office building and the debtor has to provide some services to keep that office building going, which cost €100,000 a year, he can remit only €900,000 rent to us. We are interested in making sure that the €100,000 he spent on those services is appropriate and stands up. That is why we ask a financial monitor to audit that €100,000.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	131	When we took over the loans from the banks there was no control over rental income or expenditure. We decided very quickly that we needed to get control of that rental income and that if it was necessary to deduct money from that rental income that it was an appropriate amount. We have had that process in place since the start of 2011.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	132	Is there a difference between what would be an acceptable cost deduction for washing windows today versus the cost in 2009? I ask because I have heard anecdotally from several sources that contractors were charging, for example, €10 to do a particular job but the final bill sent to NAMA by the debtor or receiver was a multiple of that amount. I want to know if there was an audit trail.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	133	We have heard all the same stories because we have been getting calls every day from people telling us different things that are going on. At the start, when we inherited loans, some of the expenditure seemed to be high. That is why we put in the financial monitors who said a contract for cleaning a building should be X amount per annum. If it turned out the debtor was claiming more we told him to get a new supplier to do it. I am not saying it did not happen but that from 2011, once we got hold of the portfolio and wanted to lock down as much cash as possible and have it remitted to us, we started to put those procedures in place. Like anything, we can put in as many controls as possible and think they are working effectively but people can be quite ingenious in how they try to extract money. We did as much as we possibly could to lock it down and make sure that whatever is being charged is appropriate for that service. At the start we did not have too many benchmarks but as time went on we got more and we were able to see where somebody stood out. Sometimes there may be a genuine reason where a service costs more in one building than it did in another. If it was explained and we accepted it, that was fine.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	135	We got the debtors to employ some small accountancy firms who provided the service but who reported to us, and because we had so many different reports from around the country we were able to create an internal database of the costs and if one was out of kilter we could ask why.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	137	Effectively, we are getting people to do it for us but we are analysing the data that comes in from that to make sure it stands up. We know what the service charge should be for a building of a particular size. If somebody comes in with a larger amount then we know that it is out of kilter and we check it out.

First, one can look at the fact that property prices are now back almost to 2007-2008 levels or heading in that direction.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	149	Not in residential. They are still 35% below the peak of 2007.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	151	I accept that they are rising rapidly.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	152	I question the rationale behind selling off all this residential property when its value is appreciating at its current rate. I wonder whether we got the best value for money. I wonder whether the vulture funds that have bought residential property from NAMA will be the beneficiaries. I wonder whether the sale will end up being a very bad deal for the public who paid for all of this stuff.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	153	Not all of those properties. I presume the Deputy is talking about the big real estate investment trusts, which have bought a fair amount of properties. The properties are openly marketed and people can bid against each other. Therefore, we get the best price we can at that point in time. There have also been a substantial number of properties that were bought by individuals who wanted to buy houses in various housing schemes that had been developed by our debtors. That is what happens in any market. We are satisfied that we got the best price at the time we sold them. We as a board had an obligation to generate cash to pay off our debt. We have repaid almost 80% of our debt, which was our target for the end of next year. We could not have achieved that without selling assets, be they residential properties, commercial properties, retail units or hotels. That was the nature of the portfolio.

I acknowledge the point made by Mr. McDonagh at the beginning of his statement that previously it was not commercially viable to build and it is only just about becoming commercially viable to build now. I accept that this is a mandate that was set for NAMA, so in some ways it is not really NAMA's responsibility but that of the Government. Against a background in which NAMA was set up to deal with a disastrous market failure, that same market has dictated to NAMA and to the Government what is and is not built. The net result is that we have a chronic housing crisis and NAMA has delivered next to nothing to flatten out the boom-slump cycle when it comes to housing. Is that what Mr. McDonagh has more or less admitted?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	155	No.

What about the development potential of residential land? What would that bring the figure up to?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	167	At the start, our land bank could have consisted of about 70,000 units.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	168	Residential units.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	170	Yes. The land bank portfolio, if planning permission was achieved for all of it, would be about 52,000 units. As I said in my opening statement, as of today there are 32,000 units available out of the 52,000 due to a number of issues that are out of the control of NAMA or its debtors, including infrastructural deficits such as water, sewerage and roads. If such matters were resolved, that land would be available.

Mr. McDonagh said at the beginning of his statement that because of the collapse in prices, neither NAMA nor anybody else would consider building up until now. Was that his point? The market dictated it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	172	That is a commercial reality.

If what one is trying to do is to provide housing, one might have a different approach.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	174	Our objective is not to provide housing. Our objective is to manage the portfolio in a commercial way, as provided for in section 10 of the NAMA legislation.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	175	I am not pointing the finger at NAMA. I understand the straitjacket that it is in, but I have always disagreed with that straitjacket.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	176	That is fair enough.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	177	We are paying a disastrous price for it, given the failure to build housing for a number of years. I want to quiz Mr. McDonagh on another matter. It seems an obvious statement of fact that the mandate that has informed NAMA's activities has failed us, in that it has exacerbated the cycle.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	178	The commercial mandate has had to inform our activities. It is the only way we can operate. Otherwise, we would be in breach of the Act. For a couple of years in circumstances in which, as Mr. McDonagh explained, it was not commercially viable to build houses, doing so would have been purely speculative development and would have been irresponsible on our part. As matters changed and the previous situation of commercial viability became a reality, NAMA was pretty much the first body to start planning to build houses again. That is what the 20,000 programme is all about. Remember that we have already delivered 2,300 of those 20,000 units.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	179	I am running out of time. I take Mr. Daly's point, but the idea that NAMA has tracked the market, which is its mandate, is crazy and we are paying the price for it. I must be honest and say that. On the delivery of social housing, out of the 70,000 - now 52,000 - existing or potential units, the total that we can expect for social housing from NAMA is 2,000. Is that not a pathetic return?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	180	The planning legislation applies to all operators in the market on the same basis. That was the point I made in my speech.If 10% is required under the new Part V legislation passed earlier this year, it means 10% of actual housing built, as opposed to what happened between 2002 and 2014, when people could simply pay money to the local authority and not have any social housing in schemes. A total of 550,000 houses were built between 2002 and 2011.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	181	That is correct, and we did not get any social housing then either.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	182	Only 5,700 units.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	183	I agree and I accept that point. However, 2,000 out of 70,000 is a pathetic return in terms of social housing.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	184	Of the 15,000 units, some 2,000 have been set aside for social housing.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	185	My next point follows from this point. I find Mr. McDonagh's concern for NAMA debtors and the possible feelings of discrimination or victimhood they might have a little nauseating. I did not think it was NAMA's job or the job of any public agency to worry about these debtors and developers who bankrupted the country. The idea should be to increase the provision of social housing.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	186	All I am doing is pointing out the factual position. It is in our interest that our debtors maximise return from their properties to pay off as much debt as possible, because the deficit between what the banks lent and what NAMA paid for the loans represented an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer when it came to funding and recapitalising the banks. We have to try to make back as much as we can on our portfolio. We can only do that if our debtors maximise the return on their portfolio. Deputy Boyd Barrett might not like it, but that is the legislation we are operating under. I am simply pointing out the facts.

If there is time left at the end - I doubt there will be - I will certainly come back to you.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	189	I suppose it is the case that if we have moved on to discussing NAMA as a housing agency, then it must signal some satisfaction with the job for which NAMA was set up in 2009. Is that the position?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	190	We are not a housing agency. I have to start with that point. What it signals is that in terms of our primary mandate of getting rid of the debt we have been quite successful. We are now at the stage where we are absolutely confident that it will be repaid by 2018. On top of that, we are generating enough cash to be confident that we will also deliver a surplus of at least €2 billion to the Exchequer. We have cash, resources and expertise available along the way. We see two needs in the economy or society at the moment, namely, housing and commercial office space, in particular, grade A office space. NAMA can neatly fill the gap, because we control many of what we call the success factors. We have sites, money, expertise and the opportunity. It is not so much a revamping of the agency's role, but it is recognition that, six years on, we have done well in the core job or objective. As a consequence, we have generated the capacity to do more and we are willing to do more.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	191	I am keen to put one more question on that point.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	192	By the way, over all of this we could not do the docklands or housing work unless we were confident that it was going to give us a commercial return. Therefore, it is back to the mandate and section 10 in that sense.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	193	The NAMA deputation has referenced the success to date and the projected surplus of €2 billion. They have pointed to some commentary - in some cases serious commentary and in other cases commentary by people who do not know the first thing they are talking about, which is not novel. To be out by €10 million is not insignificant. Could it be said that the price at which NAMA acquires the loans - the original haircut - was more severe than it ought to have been?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	194	We had no great discretion on the price at which we acquired the loans. The price was dictated by the European Commission and by regulation. It was dictated on the basis that they would be valued in November 2009 at the market value. On top of that, it was dictated on the basis that there would be a long-term economic value uplift, which, in effect, was state aid. Let us consider the price we paid. The reality is that we overpaid by €5.6 billion in respect of the state aid or long-term economic value uplift. This has been brought out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his reports. We priced them at November 2009 rates and an uplift was applied. We should remember as well that even after that, property prices continued to deteriorate up to 2013. I do not believe that we overpaid in any sense. I know this point is adduced from time to time. Some people maintain it is easy for us to say we will make a €2 billion profit because we bought the loans cheap. Actually, we did not, we overpaid for the loans.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	195	All colleagues are concerned about housing provision for obvious reasons. Back in 2011 there was such an overhang of housing, including in this city, that anyone who wanted to start building houses, even if the money was available - it was not - would have been taken away by people in white coats. However, rapidly we developed an acute housing shortage and a real supply problem. The NAMA representatives seem to bear out in their evidence today - I do not mean to put it pejoratively - that some of the excuses of the developers and builders are not based on commercial fact. The NAMA representatives seem to bear out that the cost of building in Ireland seems out of kilter. The example Mr. McDonagh gives is of the typical three-bedroom house valued at between €260,000 and €280,000 which could realise €300,000 now. That is modest enough. When the builders explain why we cannot get housing output up they maintain they cannot afford to build because of the cost of building. Do the NAMA representatives have any opinion on the question of whether the cost of building a house in this city or country is out of kilter with the realised price?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	196	We certainly do have an opinion.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	197	I hope my opinion is the same as that of the chairman. One of the remarkable things is that one would have thought that in the depths of a recession in which over 100,000 people in the construction industry lost their jobs, like any business the prices would drop. However, the cost of building has effectively flat-lined all the way through from 2010 until today. People can use all manner of excuses not to build. They can say local authority levies are too high. They were high in certain places but, in fairness, the Government has done something to resolve that. They could say there was no clarity around Part V regulations. The Part V regulations have now been clarified. They could say there was no availability of construction finance. Far more players are providing construction finance now. They could complain about the cost of construction finance, but construction finance has become more available and is becoming easier and more affordable. However, the main thing that might be holding back the issue is that house prices were rising rapidly. They recovered by 35% from the low point. Then, earlier this year the Central Bank introduced prudential rules, which effectively has had the effect of slowing down house price inflation. What we are seeing is that first-time buyers can secure up to approximately €320,000. This is based on the Central Bank rules of property priced up to €220,000 with a 10% deposit and in cases above that level there must be a 20% deposit. However, people cannot buy anything from €320,000 up to €450,000.One then has a different market again above €450,000, in which people who are probably in negative equity are able to buy the bigger houses. However, this has resulted in something remarkable in the sense that some schemes in the commuter belt that were not viable 12 months ago are now becoming more viable again because people are beginning to commute again. They are buying houses in counties Wicklow, Meath, Louth and Kildare. This is because they believe they cannot buy a house in Dublin and consequently are buying houses in these areas. It is remarkable to me that people are sitting back and stating they will not build until sales prices rise. This means that they are not satisfied with a profit of €20,000 per house but wish to wait until it is €50,000, €75,000 or €100,000. That is the market; one cannot force people to build, but we have a severe housing shortage. NAMA commissioned some research by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, that considered population figures all the way out to 2030 which suggests an average figure of 20,000 units per annum will be required. Our debtors control approximately 30% of the landbank, while others control 70% of the landbank in Dublin and they are not building. As for those who state it is not profitable, NAMA is involved with our debtors and it is profitable. It is a question of how much profit people wish to make.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	199	Not really, that pretty much sums it up. There is a huge demand and if one leaves aside NAMA and our 20,000 units, there is an opportunity to provide 80,000 houses up to 2020. In the future, the model of the house builder or the developer will probably be broader than it is. In the United Kingdom, for example, the vast number of houses are built by PLCs, not by the traditional small developer we have seen here. It probably would be no harm to see a greater mixture in the Irish market. Another point that is really important - Mr. McDonagh referred to the ESRI research we co-sponsored - is that hard data for supply and demand and demographic needs have been absent, although they are beginning to become available. If we do not get this right, members might be looking for a NAMA II in ten years time.

Would it do anything to quell the noise? The overwhelming majority of Members of the House are waiting for some evidence from some of those making allegations about the discharge of duties in NAMA. They have seen no evidence, but the chorus goes on. We are opening up a new industry, in that we could be inquiring into NAMA for the next 25 years, which would provide a lot of employment for lawyers, accountants and so on. However, is the mystery being added to by some elements of the statute enacted in the febrile environment of 2009? Is there any tweaking of the legislation that would enable NAMA or the Minister for Finance to deal with some of the allegations? It is a case of "dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi" and using parliamentary privilege to state it in the House and all NAMA can do is to state what Mr. Daly has said today.
#AideenHayden	unknown-#AideenHayden-party	unknown-#AideenHayden-dob	unknown-#AideenHayden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	204	Before Mr. Daly responds to Deputy Pat Rabbitte, I inform members that while we had intended to conclude at 4.15 p.m., I am aware that Deputies Pearse Doherty, Michael Creed and Tom Barry and I might have a few things to say. Consequently, I propose that the meeting be extended until 4.30 p.m. to allow the rest of the members to have their input. While Deputy Pat Rabbitte has put what is probably a highly interesting question, Mr. Daly should bear in mind that other members wish to contribute.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	205	I will be brief because I have been appearing before committees for long enough to be wary of straying into Government policy, whether it be the current or a new Government. Over the six years of NAMA's life we have been the subject of quite a lot of allegations which, to my mind, have a common characteristic: they have not stood up. Little or no evidence - nothing in fact - has ever been produced to back up allegations of wrongdoing at NAMA. I will state as a strong personal view that it is unfortunate that sometimes, under parliamentary privilege, individuals have been named who cannot defend themselves. As to whether anything in the statute could help us, members should remember that in terms of NAMA and its operations, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is all over us. It has access to every single document and e-mail and anything it seeks in NAMA is provided for it. The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has conducted two reviews of NAMA to date and is in the middle of a third. It is required, under the Act, to carry out these reviews on a particular basis. Nothing in the first two has revealed any serious or significant issue for NAMA. Consequently, there are plenty of opportunities for NAMA to defend itself. However, I am not looking for any change in legislation. In our view and to my personal knowledge, the Comptroller and Auditor General does an extremely thorough job.

When we became aware of that, I wrote to that former member of the Northern Ireland committee on 19 November asking his view on whether this was correct and if it was correct, why he did not declare it as is required under the conflicts of interest and SIPO legislation to NAMA. That is the letter of 19 November in respect of which I sent a reminder yesterday. We have been over this ground.

Perhaps they are not the transcripts, but, as the Deputy will be aware, the committee has published all correspondence with witnesses and others with whom it has engaged. My understanding is there is a letter from Mr. Cushnahan's solicitor confirming that he had shareholdings but also indicating - I say this in defence of Mr. Cushnahan - that he was of the view that they had been disposed of and that it was an administrative error. There is stuff going around, into which I will not get because, as far as I am concerned, until Mr. Cushnahan replies to me, it is all third-hand information.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	244	Deputy Pat Rabbitte asked about the relative cost of house building and the complaint lodged with the Commission about state aid. When does NAMA expect a ruling to be given?  Will Mr. McDonagh comment further on the level of profitability in house building? Could it be the case that other developers who could deliver houses are sitting on land banks that have been acquired at a higher cost than those acquired by NAMA on which they are building and, therefore, their starting point, cost wise, is much higher relatively? It is great that NAMA proposes to build units mostly in the greater Dublin area, in the docklands, etc. That is exciting for those areas, but is Mr. McDonagh satisfied that, on a regional basis, the agency is sweating all of its assets and land banks and delivering units in so far as it can on all of the property portfolios it owns in the regions? Some 6,000 properties were offered to local authorities, of which approximately 2,500 have been taken up. Bearing in mind that Part V required 20% of a development to be set aside for social housing, although that figure has been reduced to 10%, is NAMA cognisant in the portfolios it offers to local authorities of the fact that it may offer to engage with them on the basis that if they avail of the opportunities presented, they will be significantly higher than the 20% requirement in developments that were partially completed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	245	There is a state aid complaint and we are engaging with the Commission. The complaint was formally sent to us on Monday of this week and we have a period in which to respond to the Commission which will take whatever action it wants after considering our response. It is difficult for us to know what the land costs of other developers are because we do not have that information. However, I refer to the publicly available information from Cairn Homes plc, an Irish house builder. It has an average site cost of just over €30,000. When we look at our debtors, the site cost is not dissimilar to that figure. With regard to the opportunities to build in the regions, if it is commercial and works, we will fund it. We have no bias towards Dublin or anywhere else. If something will work in Galway, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or any other county, we will look at it. In terms of social housing provision, we offered up to 6,500 units and 2,500 have been accepted.If I understood correctly, the Deputy is making the point that if the local authority and the Housing Agency, which is under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, decide they want to take units, that may increase the social housing element within a scheme to more than 20%. To be clear, this is not a matter for NAMA but for the local authority and the Housing Agency. We do not decide where the units are or how many units will be taken. That is something I would expect the local authority and Housing Agency to take into account.

#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	247	I welcome the delegates and thank them for their engagement with the committee. I wish to raise an issue that has been of concern to me for some time. Defining €300,000 as the price tag for a starter home seems expensive. Although we have had a recovery in recent years, I do not particularly see a huge wage recovery at present. For a lot of people, €300,000 is a high threshold to reach at this time. Mr. McDonagh gave us the very interesting information that the cost of the site in the example he gave was some €30,000, with the cost for NAMA's portfolio being similar. I am taking it, therefore, that the average cost is around €30,000, with perhaps €50,000 being the maximum. When the delegates talk about units, I assume that involves everything from apartments to three-bedroom semi-detached houses. During the housing crisis, I approached the owner of a medium-sized construction company to ask about building costs. For an A-rated 1,000 sq. ft. house, he gave me a quotation of €110,000, which included €95,000 for the house and €15,000 for the associated works. I later spoke to a local quantity surveyor at a business meeting and he gave an estimated building cost of €1,000 per square foot, which was not far off the figure given by the builder. I am talking here about A-rated homes being constructed by a creditable and modestly sized building company. Using those figures would land the cost of a site in the €140,000 to €190,000 range. Even if we say we go to the lower end and assume a €250,000 sale price and with the caveat that I am referring to Cork rather than Dublin, there is a €100,000 gap, which is staggering, between the figures I gave and those offered by Mr. McDonagh. Is NAMA tendering out work to smaller builders? I have given the quotation I mentioned to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance and have discussed the issue with the delegates in the past. These people are there to be interrogated as to construction costs. The discrepancy in the figures is a cause for concern. In the course of our discussion today, NAMA was likened to a housing agency. I would say it is much more like a bank. It is funding the development of Boland's Quay, for instance, and there is a lot of expertise there. I do not have a huge issue with that. Certainly, we need as many strands of funding as can possibly be made available in order to stimulate the industry. While we have primarily discussed the situation in Dublin, will the delegates broaden their comments to encompass Cork and the regions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	248	There seems to have been a misunderstanding in respect of the figures I quoted. House-building costs will depend on location but, to break it down, we are talking about €110,000 to €130,000 per square foot for a 1,000 sq. ft. house. Where the sale price is €300,000, €36,000 of that will go on VAT and the cost of construction and professional fees will be €145,000 on average. Other costs will include finance, marketing and site costs, which will typically be in the range of €85,000 to €90,000. The costs all add up.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	249	The €36,000 in VAT seems fine. My concern is with the figure of €85,000 for marketing and finance. Does Mr. McDonagh agree that is a large figure?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	250	Yes, but the cost of finance can be significant, depending on how much equity the developer has. It would not be unusual when building a scheme for a builder to be looking at 18 months of costs.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	251	Yes, but the builder is putting up the units and then selling them off.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	252	We do not provide finance for free to our debtors when they build a house.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	253	Of course, but €85,000 certainly does not suggest it is being given for free.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	254	That figure includes the site costs. For a €300,000 house, the site costs will typically be €30,000 or €35,000 and the finance costs the same again. If the builder is borrowing the money for a year or 18 months, the interest will be 8% to 10%.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	255	I appreciate Mr. McDonagh's answers but he knows my concern in this matter. I would like NAMA to consider giving contracts to regional builders with medium-sized businesses who did not get into trouble in the past. They are new operators who should be given an opportunity to offer quotes and play their part in stimulating activity.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	256	Absolutely. We are looking for people to enter into joint ventures with and sell sites under licence. Such operators will not be able to put up all the money up front but every time they build and sell a house, they can pay us for the site. We have done that already. I am very much in favour of new people revitalising the construction industry on a sustainable basis.

Am I right to assume that anything the agency sells from now on will be in single or much smaller lots than has been the case heretofore? How is the situation resolved where there is an equality of bids? In regard to Project Eagle and so on, I will not mention any names but I am inclined to assume it was parties other than NAMA which may have sought to corrupt matters by virtue of the fact that people held themselves out as having a power, value or influence they did not, in fact, have, legally or otherwise. There is also the fact that because it was a different jurisdiction, people were inclined to assume things. A lot of it was poppycock and there was no legal basis for what was claimed. I have seen no evidence whatsoever that NAMA acted in any way incorrectly, but I would like the delegates to confirm that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	258	I will take the last question. I reiterate that NAMA did not do anything incorrectly in regard to Project Eagle or any other sale. I will not point the finger at any particular jurisdiction but it is a feature that, from time to time, people put themselves about as having more influence or power than they really do. I was going to say we all do it, but that would be unfair. As to whether it happened in this case, I will leave members to judge for themselves. Where anybody was incorrectly putting themselves about in that position, I assure members they did not have one whit of influence, one way or the other, on the sale by NAMA of its Northern Ireland portfolio. I will not go over the details again but that is the reality.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	259	In terms of lot size, we have sold some large portfolios, most of them loan portfolios. The major ones have now been done and we will be doing smaller lot sizes from here on out. We will not, for instance, be doing anything of the size of Project Arrow or Project Eagle. Instead, we expect typically to be bringing forward €250 million lot sizes or thereabouts into the future. When it comes to evaluating bids, we try to ensure appropriate sales agents are appointed who have a duty of care to NAMA and are professional in their dealings. We want to ensure everyone gets the same opportunity based on the same information and can bid at the same time and, where there is a closed-bid process, that the bids are opened at the same time.Our experience to date is that one never hears about 99.9% of the sales process. We are contacted about only a very small number. I fully encourage people to contact us to say they do not like the sales process, the outcome or because they suspect something has gone on. In those instances, we always investigate and ask the agent for additional details such as the marketing report, who was contacted, how many people expressed interest, what bid they put in, what day they put it in and whether their bid went to the first or second round.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	261	Yes, we have had a number of instances recently where two people have had similar bids. We tell them to go back and decide on a best and final offer so both can put a sealed bid in. That is how it works.

To play devil's advocate, how would NAMA respond to the argument that there was a write-off of over €40 billion of taxpayers' money in terms of the banks so that the profit of €2 billion is on the values NAMA took them over at? How does NAMA respond to that argument? Will the profit actually be €2 billion?

The only fair way by which to judge us is on the basis of what we took over and what we paid for the loans. I have already explained to the committee that we actually paid more than the market value at the time.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	283	I might let my colleague answer that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	286	It is unlikely that we would go into joint ventures with somebody and give 100% of the funding because we have existing debtors from whom we have taken, effectively, all their equity as part of their encumbered assets, which is over €900 million. We do not want to get more people into us who want 100% finance from NAMA. There are a number of people with equity who have expressed an interest in joint ventures with us and who would be capable of putting in 40% to 50% equity.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	310	All the smaller debtors that were being managed by the banks on our behalf were sold as part of Project Arrow so we are now down to what we call the original NAMA managed debtors, which we always managed in-house. We try to give guidance to the market to keep investors interested so we have already publically disclosed that we will bring two portfolios to the market in the first half of next year. There will be about 18 debtors in each portfolio - one in quarter 1 and the other in quarter 2. After that, the debtors that will be left will be much bigger even though they will have sold many assets in the meantime. Given their size, they are more likely to be single loan sales. They are a nice size for people interested in buying that type of portfolio.

Mr. McDonagh mentioned that NAMA has sold between 5,000 and 6,000 residential units and still has 9,000 units in its portfolio. Of the 5,000 to 6,000 units it has sold, could Mr. McDonagh provide us with a breakdown of the number that were individually disposed of and the number that were bundled?How were those that were bundled disposed of? Were they disposed of in groups of ten to 20, or 20 to 30, for example? Could I have a meaningful breakdown illustrating how the units were put on the market?

On behalf of the committee, I apologise to them for the delay and thank them very much for waiting. Unfortunately, we were delayed by a Dáil vote and some other matters. Following our engagement with credit union officials in November and noting the concerns raised by their representative body on the impending legislation, it is appropriate that we have the opportunity to discuss these concerns with the Registrar of Credit Unions today, given the important alternative that the credit union movement provides to the pillar banks. Ms McKiernan will first make her opening remarks, which we will follow with questions and answers. By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that evidence connected only with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I invite Ms McKiernan to begin.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	315	I thank the committee for the invitation to attend. I am accompanied by the deputy registrar, Ms Elaine Byrne. As members will know, our statutory mandate at the registry is to protect credit union members' funds and maintain the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the current challenges facing the sector and our regulatory and supervisory approach in this regard. I acknowledge the important role the credit unions play within communities and the financial sector more broadly. Our actions are taken to ensure the sector will survive and thrive and have the capability to adapt to the changing environment and meet the needs of members in a modern and progressive way. In my statement, I will focus on three main areas: the current position of, and main challenges for, the credit union sector; the standards the Central Bank requires of credit unions so they will protect members' funds and remain stable; and the requirements for the growth and development of the sector.  With regard to the profile of the sector, for a number of years credit unions have been dealing with the effects of the financial crisis, fundamental change and structural factors. Recent legislation and regulatory actions have been designed to better position the sector for the future. The prudential decisions that we in the registry have taken are to ensure credit unions will be more robust and, therefore, better able to serve their members' needs in the future. The decisions included restrictions on inappropriate lending, stronger liquidity and reserves requirements, and emphasis on improved provisioning levels. In addition, we used extensive on-site engagement with credit unions to focus on strategic planning, governance, risk management and controls, and remediation of priority actions.  Today there are 339 active credit unions, with a total asset base of €15 billion. When we speak of the sector, it is important to remember we are dealing with a large number of independent entities varying in size and resilience. The majority of credit unions have assets worth under €25 million. Some 170 credit unions have an average individual asset size of just over €12 million. It is these small credit unions that often face particular challenges given their limited capacity to invest in new products and delivery channels, which would best position them to attract and retain younger active members. Some 37 credit unions have average asset values of over €100 million, and they account for just over 40% of sector assets. It is for these entities that our supervisory expectations are highest.  The biggest challenge facing the sector is the fall in income from core lending. Loans to members have decreased to €4 billion from €7 billion in 2008, while total interest income has fallen by 40%. The key indicator of sector growth potential, which is the loan–asset ratio, has almost halved, to 28%, since 2008. Nearly 200 credit unions are below the average. The reasons for this include the impact of both the crisis – especially the fall in household and small business borrowing – and underlying structural factors. These structural issues include the ageing membership base of the sector and the difficulties many credit unions face in changing their business offerings to attract younger borrowers by offering the services they want via the channels they expect. This often requires technology investment that smaller credit unions, in particular, struggle to deliver. Investment income helped to offset some of the declining loan income, but this is now under pressure in the low-yield environment. At the same time, the cost-income ratios are rising. Together, all these factors present an important challenge to the viability of credit unions. While many are reasonably well provisioned and have adequate reserves, we are concerned about current loan arrears, which remain significant at 13.5%, on average. A number of credit unions have arrears of almost one third of their loan books. I acknowledge the scale of the challenges that credit unions across Ireland have dealt with over the past decade and the efforts undertaken by their management, boards, members and volunteers to deal with the impact of both the crisis and its aftermath.Many credit unions took appropriately conservative responses, such as increased provisioning, cutting dividends and adopting new regulations, to steer through the difficult period but further strong efforts and strong leadership at the sectoral level are now required to address the financial weaknesses and, in particular, the structural challenges. Turning to the standards required for the stability of the sector, the Commission on Credit Unions in 2012 recommended the introduction of a strengthened regulatory framework for credit unions. The Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 significantly reformed the governance and risk management requirements of the sector in a manner proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the Irish credit union sector. Our on-site engagement is focused on implementing these requirements in a proportionate way. In May 2014, we summarised our findings from on-site engagements in a published report. We found significant weaknesses in governance and risk management standards and practices, as well as a fundamental business model weakness in many credit unions. That report set out our minimum supervisory expectations for credit unions, which reflect our statutory requirement to safeguard members' funds. This year, an external review of the Central Bank's performance of its regulatory functions in respect of credit unions, which is required by law, was also conducted. The review determined that the Central Bank effectively performed its regulatory and supervisory functions and that our supervisory practices were commensurate with the complexity, size and risk profile of the sector. It also made recommendations for enhancement and we have adapted our inspections and engagement model to target supervision in a proportionate way. We have minimum standards expected of all credit unions and higher standards expected of larger and more complex entities. We continue to focus our efforts on strengthening the regulatory framework in a proportionate way. Concerns have been raised about some of our proposed new regulations, especially the cap on individual savings of €100,000. We have considered all of the arguments put forward but we remain convinced that this cap is the right decision for the sector at this time. It ensures that members' savings in a credit union will be fully protected in the event of a resolution, which will also help to protect the stability of the sector by avoiding the potential negative impact of any credit union member losing any of his or her savings. It is our responsibility as regulator to take measures at the sector-wide level in order to minimise risks or vulnerabilities, especially at a time when the sector is going through a major restructuring and facing significant challenges. One of the arguments put forward against the cap is that it will limit the ability of credit unions to develop their business models. This is difficult to accept, given the fact that the figures show that savings of over €100,000 represent only 1% of total savings. We note that, at the sector-wide level, credit unions are holding extensive deposits - €11 billion - relative to their lending of €4 billion and many have self-imposed deposit caps well below our proposed limit. However, we have indicated to the sector that, where there is a clear business case and sufficient safeguards in place to protect members' funds, we will permit credit unions to retain existing savings over €100,000 and, in exceptional cases, take in new savings of over that limit. Turning to the sector's future sustainability, our vision is for a thriving credit union sector that provides choice in the financial system while carrying out its important role at community level and meeting our regulatory requirements. To get from where we are now to where we need to be will be difficult but we have set out four main requirements: further restructuring; a further drive for new, younger, active borrowers; a marked increase in core lending; and business model development in a multi-step, well-managed way. Restructuring, as acknowledged by the Commission on Credit Unions, is necessary to address the viability and operational challenges that continue to face many credit unions. There has been solid progress in recent years, which has been significantly facilitated by the restructuring board. However, more needs to be done to provide the capacity to tackle structural weaknesses. We have worked closely with credit unions and their representative bodies to resolve a number of non-viable credit unions that could not demonstrate their ability to safeguard their members' funds adequately. We have done so with minimal disruption to services, no loss of funds to any member and via solutions within the sector itself. The drive to attract and retain active borrowers is the cornerstone of the sector's future. I urge the sector to consider further how to leverage its community advantages and its trusted brand to become more relevant to a new generation of borrowing members while pricing appropriately for risks and services. Regarding business model development, there has been some criticism that the Central Bank is holding back the development of new business lines or that regulation is too restrictive. I wish to respond to these points. At the registry, we have not seen often enough from credit unions well-structured, viable and sustainable plans for development that also address the current operational and financial challenges that must be dealt with to move forward successfully. Our focus is always to ensure that proposed developments are carefully assessed, properly costed and consider risk and potential return. The prudent approach is a multi-step development of the business model, as this would best protect stability and members' funds. Where credit unions set out a clear path on how they wish to develop, we consider any amendment to the regulations that may be appropriate. A recent example is the change to our forthcoming regulations to include explicit reference to "projects of a public nature", which would include, but not be limited to, social housing. We are fully committed to using all of the powers within our regulatory remit to help credit unions to help themselves and, thereby, their members. In this regard, we recently undertook a review of lending restrictions across the sector. Our review was to bring a renewed focus on improving standards of credit risk management and controls across credit unions. We have been able to lift restrictions at 55 credit unions where they prioritised improvements in their credit risk systems and met our requirements. Unfortunately, we also rejected 20 cases where credit unions had still to undertake further work in that regard. It has been a challenging period for the credit union sector. I wish to acknowledge the constructive and positive engagement of individual credit unions, their representative bodies and other key stakeholders as we work to improve the resilience and future prospects of the sector. The sector has benefited from many conservative actions in recent years through increased provisioning, cutting dividends, adopting regulatory requirements and entering into mergers that provide better long-term prospects for many members. The most important challenge remaining is to drive sustainable, appropriate and prudent development of the sector while retaining the important voluntary ethos and community spirit. I thank the committee for its attention.

I will start by asking her about an issue that is consistently raised by the movement, that is, tiered regulation. The movement argues strongly that although tiered regulation was a feature of the Commission on Credit Unions, it has not happened yet and that the one-size-fits-all style of regulation which is being applied to the sector is hampering its development and growth.How would Ms McKiernan respond to that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	318	We consulted the sector on tiered regulation in 2014. The feedback received from the majority of respondents in the sector at that time was that while they might wish for tiered regulation, it was not the time to proceed with it. The main reason for their stance was that there was a significant amount of change under way in the sector at the time, including restructuring, and that it might be more appropriate to revisit the issue when the future shape and development of the sector was clearer. We have always indicated to the sector that we are willing to engage further with it on both business model development and any future approaches to tiered regulation it wishes to take. At that time, part of the sector's submission suggested its members had a wide range of views regarding the form or specific scope of tiered regulation they would like. Smaller credit unions had their views and larger credit unions had different views. We have engaged constantly with the sector and are willing to hear any united or firm views on how to take the issue forward and that remains the case.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	320	Our view on this is that the business model development of the sector ought to be taken forward in the context of the priorities of the sector. From that, it might be appropriate to consider whether a tiered regulatory approach is needed or relevant. We are currently involved in a business model dialogue process with the sector to help understand the priorities the sector wishes to move forward with us and whether any aspects of our regulatory framework need to be adapted to accommodate those business model proposals. As the future development of the sector becomes clearer, this will be the appropriate platform on which to consider whether tiered regulation or some other proportionality in our approach is required.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	322	I would also highlight that we have an element of tiering within our current approach because we apply our rules in a proportionate manner.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	330	Our statutory mandate is to protect members' funds in the credit union sector and ensure the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally. We have not been mandated to direct the business model development of the sector. We put the regulatory framework in place and supervise it. We are mindful of the fact that the sector needs to change part of its business model to stay relevant and thrive into the future. We work closely with it to see where our regulatory framework may need to be adapted now or in the future to accommodate such development. To ensure there is an appropriate focus in the sector on the need to transform the business model appropriately, we initiated engagement with it on that very theme. We brought all of the key stakeholders together with the focus on understanding their agreed priorities and various options for business model development. We also focused on understanding where we could help them to help themselves and where our regulatory framework might need to be attuned to that development. It is not our role to run credit union businesses or drive future business development and strategy, but we are certainly facilitative of that process.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	332	I have called publicly for more leadership at sectoral level to enable the sector to deal with its particular structural challenges. As the majority of credit unions are at the smaller end of the scale, sub-€25 million entities, they are going to find it very difficult to undertake the investment required in new technologies or platforms to retain younger, active borrowers, who increasingly expect their financial services to be conducted via technological means. It is extremely difficult for individual smaller entities to undertake these proposals and in that sense sectoral leadership would be of importance to help them. Undoubtedly, sector-wide representative bodies have focused increasingly on the need to develop the business model and we work very closely with them. Our engagement is based on understanding their proposals, challenging them for improvement, ensuring all appropriate risks are identified and that proposals are based on current realities in the sector. There should not be too big a gap between where it might need to go and from where it is coming. I believe they find this input very constructive.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	334	Such a review would be a matter for the Minister. It was actually included in the external review of our functions, to which I referred in my opening statement. That peer review was carried out by the International Credit Union Regulators Network, ICURN, and included a recommendation that a review of the implementation of the recommendations of the commission on credit unions in 2012 be undertaken. It also acknowledged that it was not exclusively a matter for the registry.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	335	Regarding the changes to the level of savings above €100,000, Ms McKiernan said:Savings of over €100,000 represent a very small proportion, 1%, of total savings. We also note that, at the sector-wide level, credit unions are holding extensive deposits relative to their lending needs and many have self-imposed deposit limits well below our proposed cap.While I know that Ms McKiernan's priority is to protect members' savings, does she accept that there is a reputational issue for credit unions? The signal that it sends is that any sum in excess of €100,000 is not safe in credit unions. That is a very negative signal to send.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	336	In all of the measures we take we constantly assess the risks we are seeking to close off to adequately protect members' funds and the stability of the sector. We judge that there is a risk that some members could potentially lose savings above €100,000. In aggregate, there is a very small volume of such savings. We recognise that the proposed cap of €100,000 gives very significant head room to credit unions because the average deposit is €4,000. We propose to put that limit in place, notwithstanding the reputational risk mentioned by the Deputy, because we are trying to reduce other risks across the sector. We judged that there was no impact on the business model of credit unions because such a small proportion of overall funding in the sector comes from deposits above €100,000. I also highlight the fact that, at sector-wide level, there are very significant deposits of some €11 million relative to the sector's lending of €4 million. A shortage of deposits is not among the structural factors weighing on the sector. We, therefore, felt it was an appropriate risk management response at this stage to close off a vulnerability, particularly in a period of heightened restructuring and transition. We would be open to reviewing it in time, if such a review were to become relevant and credit unions were able to show it was needed.

This seems to be a very good idea. How many such meetings have been held to date? Would Ms McKiernan consider holding off on further implementation of CP88 pending the outcome of these consultations?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	338	There are a number of issues there. We have ongoing contact with the representative bodies and individual credit unions regarding business model proposals. Some of these consultations are by groups of credit unions and some are by representative bodies on behalf of the sector itself. We held preliminary meetings about our intent and objectives with the stakeholders dialogue and then held a formal meeting with stakeholders on how we would take it forward. We held a significant number of informal and regular engagements to discuss what we are seeking to achieve. The aim is to keep the focus on this big structural issue and to understand what the sector really needs from us around its business model development so we can consider how we need to change either our supervisory or regulatory framework accordingly. We continue to hold these meetings. We did not think it appropriate to hold off until after the regulations were signed. It will be a long road and a multi-step process to see significant business model change, and we should start on that road early.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	339	I welcome Ms McKiernan and thank her for her contribution. I have met with credit unions over the last while and it is very interesting to see the huge differential in scale between credit unions. It has become clear that the credit unions are unhappy with the €100,000 deposit protection. I understand Ms McKiernan's argument but they do not seem to accept it and the gap needs to be bridged and dealt with. They are not happy with the engagement. Many people put a lot of their time into this voluntarily and they feel almost hounded out of existence. While Ms McKiernan may have a remit it is important that the remit does not sound the death knell for credit unions. That needs to be kept in the back of Ms McKiernan's mind all the time. I acknowledge that, like all lending institutions, bad decisions were made by some credit unions - but we do not live back there, we live in the present and the future. The witness said that some credit unions would find it hard to go onto new platforms. I have been in business for many years and in the last few years we have concentrated on doing the simple things effectively and sticking to our core business model. We have seen many examples of other insurance companies etc. losing fortunes by veering too far away from their core client base and they have gone back to their original client base. Maybe credit unions should be helped to go back doing what they are best at which is lending low amounts and keeping people away from loan sharks, with all the important social dividend that brings. We are veering into social projects and social housing but I suggest the credit unions should get the basics right first. The statistics reported by the CSO today indicate that car sales have increased by 30%. Credit unions were always good for car loans. A platform is not needed for that, a person just goes in looking for a car loan. We need to find out why this is not happening. If businesses are falling from €7 million to €4 million in lending is it because of the restriction under which they operate or has there been a fundamental change? If demand is there for car loans - which the credit unions were traditionally involved in - why is that business not going to credit unions now? These are the questions I would like answers to. I do not agree with a one size fits all approach. It certainly does not fit in this area. Projects of a public nature were mentioned. I came across a particular credit union which was involved in lending to a crèche. This was fine but there was another private crèche over the wall. Two crèches in business back to back in a medium sized town does not suggest a very sound business decision. With declining loan books the credit unions are under pressure and not happy and I reiterate that credit unions need help to do their basics and then they can look at other dreams and platforms. The dialogue between Ms McKiernan's office and the credit unions needs to ramp up and those ideas need to be teased out. I would be interested to know how much communication she has with them and if she see a favourable outcome for credit unions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	340	I thank Deputy Barry and I will try to address as many of his points as possible. I completely agree it is most important for credit unions to focus on getting the basics right. In my statement I referred to the four areas to focus on, one of which is to increasing core lending which is personal finance to small businesses and households. That is the area in which the credit union brand is best established and where it has expertise. While mistakes may have been made in the past, credit unions are generally now working to put in place the higher regulatory requirements and better practices. We are very happy to work closely with them to do that. It is a significant part of our supervisory on site engagement with the credit unions. However, where proposals for the sector are being developed - and we could mention social housing here - we do want to work with the sector bodies and the credit unions to see whether the proposals are proportionate, appropriate and viable for the sector. We have a two-pronged approach to ensure they can do their core business well and grow it in the current environment and that they are positioned to take on any new business model development where necessary or appropriate. I will now turn to the issue of the significant fall in the core lending. Some of the drop in lending is to be seen in the context in which the credit unions were operating; an environment in which households and small businesses were cutting back significantly on borrowing. All financial institutions were affected. The Deputy asked if the lending restrictions which we put in place were a factor. Our view is that they were not. Our lending restrictions were calibrated to reduce excessive risk taking but to not impact on the core and small personal loans that could be undertaken. Some years after lending restrictions were introduced we conducted research to see if they were biting credit unions and forcing them to turn customers away and the answer was they were not. In general the restrictions applied to loans of between €10,000 and €30,000 but the average loan size in the sector is between €6,000 and €8,000, depending on the time of year. Lending restrictions were introduced because we saw instances of excessive risk taking out of line with the kind of model and practices for which we advocate. Restrictions were imposed to help reduce the vulnerability of the sector and with the intention to putting an impetus on credit unions to improve their basic practices. In our supervisory engagements it was subsequently found that some credit unions were not addressing those basic weaknesses, so short-term restrictions became longer-term. To bring focus back onto getting the basics right and on having the right credit control standards, we initiated a review earlier in 2015. This was to ensure that credit unions could act proactively on their credit risk management practices. It is a good news story that 55 credit unions were able to meet our requirements and better protect their members' funds by having the adequate risk management standards in place. It is unfortunate that there are still a number of credit unions that cannot meet those basic requirements. We have had to turn down 20 applications for lending restriction reviews. It says something about the sector that in many cases credit unions are happy to live under lending restrictions and that sets their appetite for how much lending they are willing to do. In the context of dialogue with the sector I accept the Deputy's point that some credit unions are unhappy with some of the measures we have introduced. However, our mandate is to protect credit unions' funds which, through their lending, is other people's money.Our requirements are proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the Irish credit union sector and that has been reviewed externally. We would highlight that the peer review found evidence of poor quality underwriting still in place in many credit unions. One can expect that we will put standards and engagements in place to try to improve that. On the issue of dialogue, Ms Elaine Byrne is better placed to answer that question than we, we have a series of information seminars across the sector and across the country to ensure that credit unions are aware not only of what we are doing but why we are doing it and how it is all based on our mandate to protect their funds and the stability of their sector.

Will the witness explain the risk-based rationale that the credit union sector has the support of the imposition of the savings cap at €100,000?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	342	Only a small amount of funds is affected by the cap. With an average deposit size of €4,000 in the sector and with many credit unions having self-imposed caps, well below €100,000, we felt it was an appropriate risk-based measure to reduce the prospect of members losing funds in a credit union if their credit union needed to be resolved or if there was any unexpected matter that would cause the failure of a credit union. It does not impact on the business model of credit unions because there is such a small percentage of funds over the cap already in place. We felt that a measure that can reduce risk and vulnerability and at the same time not negatively impact on the business model or the development of the sector was an appropriate risk-based measure to undertake at this time.

I am well aware from previous statements and the knowledge we have of what is the average deposit in savings in credit unions but what is the risk-based rationale that the witness carried out within the bank that led to the belief that a cap of €100,000 was appropriate?
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	344	The same risk would apply to any financial institution out there, whether the AIB or Bank of Ireland, if there were depositors, savers, in those banks who were to lose funds as a result of resolution or liquidation. We have seen a number of situations in the past but there is no imposition by the Central Bank to say that nobody can save above €100,000 in those institutions. What is the increased risk that the witness has seen? Can Ms McKiernan outline to us who within the bank came up with the approval for a €100,000 cap on deposits?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	345	On the point of no equivalent cap in other financial institutions such as the banks, I would point out that banks are subject to a very different type of regulatory framework. It is enormously more complex than that applying to credit unions. The framework for credit unions has developed to be proportionate to the type of sector we have in Ireland. While there may not be a cap in place for the banks, there are many other requirements put in place to ensure that the risk of loss of members' funds, in the case of banks, are covered by many other safety nets. Banks are also now subject to the bank recovery and resolution directive which requires for bail in; in other words a significant number, a waterfall of safeguards to reduce the chance that some bailing of depositors funds over €100,000 will ever be needed. There is such a different regime applicable there that it is not really possible to compare across to the credit union. Also the average deposit in banks is in a different scale from what one finds in the credit union sector. We are very mindful that the core business of credit unions - coming back to Deputy Tom Barry's point - has been small scale lending and small scale deposits and that putting a very high cap in place, albeit linked in with the DGS limit is a very good risk management response at this time and it safeguards members in credit unions from losing any funds. There is not a queue of depositors going into credit unions seeking to deposit volumes over €100,000.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	361	I would say the proposal originated within the registry.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	362	May I also add a point? It goes back to the report on the commission on credit unions when it was considering illustrative asset bands in the tiered regulation concept. In that report there was a table on savings that gave an indication of the way that could look in a tiering context. Limits in savings were proposed there. For the very small credit unions a maximum of €50,000, for the majority of credit unions, that would be in €10 million to €100 million, a limit was specified of a lower percentage of assets or a €100,000 maximum. It was only for those credit unions over €100 million that there was any concept of savings being at a higher amount. That was very much envisaged for the majority of credit union compilation, a €100,000 so there was a basis where it had been referred to in that external context.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	363	And the proposal was obviously a tiered approach which the Registrar of Credit Unions has decided to scrap and go with the blanket approach across the credit union sector. Can I put it to Ms McKiernan that, basically what she is telling the committee is that some credit unions may go into resolution in the next number years and there may be losses to members' funds if they have deposits above €100,000 and she believes that risk is such that she has decided to come in with this instrument to cap funds at €100,000.There can be no other logic to the blanket approach that the registrar has taken on this issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	364	I would describe this as a pre-emptive measure to ensure that the financial stability of the sector is best protected by removing the vulnerability that any members may lose funds over €100,000. It does not make any statement about expectations or probabilities of any credit union getting into resolution difficulties. Clearly, we cannot also see the future in terms of what might evolve with the sector, but it is our job to look to where the vulnerabilities are and to take the pre-emptive actions that best protect the sector. If we are able to take a measure that at the same time does not compromise the business model and the development of the sector, then that seems to us like a reasonable risk response.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	365	I have two questions and I will try to be brief. The registry previously stated that the credit unions would need up to €500 million, which, obviously, frightened members at the time. It turns out that only €20 million was required and has been drawn down. Does the registrar regret using that figure and how was it got so wrong? Does the registrar also believe that the money in ReBo could be used to invest in the sector? With the indulgence of the Chair, I have a final question on the capital requirements that the registrar is requiring of credit unions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	366	The figure of €500 million is based on a stress-test scenario that was undertaken in 2011. The purpose of the stress test at that stage was to assess what were either central or worse-case scenarios that could occur. There was a stress test carried out in the credit union sector and a stress test carried out in the banking sector. Clearly, stress testing is a regular feature of any regulator's role. At that time, the stress-test estimates were that there was a possibility of a very severe outcome for the credit union sector and, indeed, for other sectors. That stress-test message allowed us to consider at the Central Bank what pre-emptive actions would be good to offset the worst possible outcome and a number of measures were then undertaken, some of which I referred to in my opening remarks. These included increasing reserve requirements in credit unions and encouraging a better provisioning approach. Many credit unions also undertook appropriately conservative measures to safeguard themselves against worse outcomes, including cutting back on their dividends to reinforce their reserve base. The fact that amount of €500 million or any other stress-test estimate amount has not been needed is not because the figure was in any way inaccurate. It is because the scenario for which it was developed prompted actions that were taken to stop the worse outcome from being realised. It is a good news story for the sector that combined actions, both by credit unions and by us as regulator, ensured that they are now recovering part of their financial resilience and able to face into dealing with their structural challenges which pre-dated the crisis but which they were not able to deal with at that time because of other, much more urgent, financial challenges.

What is the rationale for 10%? Why was it not set at a lower, or indeed higher, level? Where is the analysis in this regard? I understand that it has been said previously that the World Council of Credit Unions has been used as a reference point, in case Ms McKiernan wants to mention that, but the council disputes this and states that the asset ratio over 70% requires a 10% risk capital element. The registry has no risk weighted at all. Is it the case that this is another blunt instrument from the registry to impose on credit unions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	372	Deputy Pearse Doherty is correct in referencing the World Council of Credit Unions, WOCCU, as having given guidance that a 10% regulatory reserve ratio is an international norm or an indicator level that we could use. The level of 10% was brought in to increase the reserve requirement on credit unions during the crisis period in recognition of the fact that many credit unions were coming under significant pressure and we needed them to work on their resilience to withstand some of the negative impacts of the crisis. Bringing in the higher level was very much related to ensuring that they had the capability to remain financially sound in the future. At this time, the reserve ratio remains appropriate for the sector that we are dealing with. In the sector there is a very significant excess of available funds - I mentioned the €11 billion in deposits - relative to the amount of lending by the sector of €4 billion. The regulatory reserve ratio is there to ensure that credit unions are well run and have a fundamental base on which to remain strong.

It should be based on risk, not on the number of one's assets. If one looks at other products, mortgage lending has a risk weight of 50%.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	377	I can answer that. I refer to what Deputy Barry mentioned earlier about credit unions getting back to their core business of personal finance short-term lending. That remains the vast majority of the lending activity that is undertaken in credit unions. Apart from a few exceptions, that is what they do significantly. It is not a complex business model that would require significant types of risk weighting for the reserves to accommodate different types of practices. However, if the business model of credit unions changes dramatically in the future as a result of initiatives that they drive forward, we will review whether risk weighting becomes appropriate but at present it is a fairly unsophisticated non-complex business model and we believe that the straightforward non-risk-weighted approach is most appropriate, particularly when one takes into account the significant number of smaller entities.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	378	I welcome Ms McKiernan and Ms Byrne and thank them for their presentation. I get the overall impression from the presentation and from the question and answer session that it is the registry's view that there are too many credit unions. Ms McKiernan acknowledged the role of community. That is really important because if that goes, the credit union movement, and the linked sense of ownership, goes. Ms McKiernan stated that she wants "to acknowledge the important role which credit unions play within communities". She continued: "Our regulatory and supervisory actions are taken to ensure that the sector can survive and thrive into the future, and has the capability to adapt to the changing environment and meet the needs of members in a modern and progressive way." She went on to talk about "underlying structural factors... which often require technology investment that smaller credit unions, in particular, struggle to deliver", and said: "Further strong efforts and indeed strong leadership at the sectoral level are needed now to address the financial weaknesses and especially the structural challenges, to position credit unions for growth and development ahead." Ms McKiernan also stated: "To get from where we are now to where the sector needs to be will be difficult but we see four main requirements for sector recovery and growth: further restructuring, drive for new younger active borrowers, marked increase in core lending, and business model development in a multi-step, risk-managed way." To me, that is code for fewer credit unions. Would Ms McKiernan care to comment on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	379	The need for sector restructuring was a central set of recommendations in the Commission on Credit Unions in 2012 and arising from that, the restructuring board was set up to prompt voluntary and incentivised restructuring. Significant progress has been made on that front. Even this year, we have gone from having 374 active credit unions at the beginning of the year to 339 now. As for whether there is a number or if I think there is some target in terms of credit union restructuring, we do not have a target number but we certainly see that there are still so many challenges to the viability of credit unions that more restructuring is undoubtedly needed.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	380	Was the basis of restructuring that these were not financially sound post the crash?However, the evidence in terms of the draw-down of restructuring funds, as alluded to by Deputy Pearse Doherty, does not sustain the argument that these credit unions were badly governed. There are undoubtedly issues that need to be addressed, but the concern expressed by the Deputy is not backed up having regard to the amount accessed from the fund put in place to position the credit union movement to meet the challenges following the economic crash and put it on a good footing for the future. The draw-down of €20 million from a €500 million provision suggests the sector is pretty healthy.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	381	I refer the Deputy to the remarks we and others made about the financial, operational and structural challenges facing the sector. There are some business realities with respect to the pressures they are operating under. I have referred to the long-term viability pressures they face. Their income has continued to decline, while their core lending has contracted enormously. The investment income on which they relied to continue their income steam has weakened significantly. Having regard to its ageing membership base, many of them are struggling to generate the lending business that will keep them viable into the future. Therefore, for many of them, restructuring provides an opportunity to invest in new products or developments that could attract younger active borrowers in the age cohort more likely to borrow for holidays, the building of kitchen extensions and so on.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	382	Is it not the case that credit unions have strayed from the category of core lending, their original raison d'être? Core lending in all financial institutions in the period since 2007 has been on a downward trajectory. People have been repairing their domestic balance sheets and have not been in a position to borrow, rather they have been repaying loans, which is the reason deposits in credit unions have risen. Whether core lending will be driven by car sales or loans to cover the costs holidays, education or house repairs which have been put on the longer finger, what the registrar is doing in using the decrease in core lending as a stick with which to beat the credit union movement is unfair because it has been the hallmark of all financial institutions following the crash. The credit union movement is now positioned to release funds to meet the pent up demand for loans.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	383	On the Deputy's point about restructuring, the mandate of the restructuring board which was due to come to an end at the end of 2015 has been extended into 2016 in recognition of the fact that many credit unions are stating mergers with other stronger credit unions would represent the best outcome for them. It would allow them to provide the different products or services their younger membership base requires to stay viable into the future. The restructuring board has been working very closely with these credit unions to ensure as many of these mergers as possible will be sustainable and that there are good partnerships between stronger and potentially weaker credit unions. As to why more funds were used in the restructuring process, while funding was available, it came with terms and conditions, it was judged by many credit unions to be expensive for them or they did not want to leave themselves in a position where they would have to draw down funds and then repay them. It has been a process of self-selection by credit unions not to use the available funds, but that does not read that there has not been a need for more restructuring in the sector. My understanding is the restructuring board has seen a large number of credit unions express an interest in continuing with restructuring proposals into next year.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	384	How can the community ethos be protected in the context of restructuring or rationalisation? How can the registrar protect the community ethos in terms of the reach of the credit union movement into the communities that I represent and yet have fewer credit unions? Ms McKiernan referred to there being a current loan arrears figure of 13.5% and, in some instances, up to 30%. Is there a direct correlation between credit union size, governance and the size of arrears?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	385	On the Deputy's first point about the community ethos, clearly, we strongly believe in it and the importance of the credit union sector to both the financial system generally and communities. We very much want to see it protected as we move forward. At the same time it is important to recognise that credit unions are dealing with some very difficult realities, some of which involves giving up local independence in return for staying part of the credit union movement into the future which may involve mergers with neighbouring credit unions. My understanding of the mergers that have taken place is that the vast majority of credit unions work very hard to sustain the community ethos. It often extends to keeping local branch offices open in the communities where credit unions have merged. Undoubtedly, it is a challenge as we move forward in terms of how credit unions can restructure and at the same time retain the same identity within the local community. On the issue of arrears, we have not seen a very strong correlation between governance and arrears and size. With regard to governance, it has taken a period of time for the improved standards we expect which are set down in the new regulations to become embedded across the sector. Our requirements are proportionate. We only have a small number of required pre-approved control functions, for example, under the fitness and probity regime. Certainly smaller credit unions, in general, struggle with meeting all of the requirements and at the same time deal with their financial, structural and operational challenges.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	386	Ms McKiernan spoke about the requirements of modern day financial systems and the credit union movement being ill-equipped to meet them, but it has been alleged to us that the Central Bank drags its feet, even in facilitating those credit unions that want to move towards the use of new technology, different platforms and so on. Would she care to comment on this?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	387	Yes. I read the comments made at this committee when the debate on credit unions started in November. I highlight that our engagement with credit union representative bodies and credit unions is constant. It is designed to ensure we prompt a focus on developing new products or services and that the way in which such products and services are developed be appropriately risk managed and prudent. Credit unions may see this as taking longer than they would prefer, but certainly it has all been designed to ensure the outcome will be the best possible from a risk-assessed and cost perspective and appropriate to meet the current challenges credit unions face. I could give the Deputy an example of where there was considerable engagement across the sector on the improvement on one particular proposal. Some of the parties involved failed to meaningfully address the concerns raised. We called a particular risk which materialised some months later and a proposal had to be put on hold because of it. We make no apologies for ensuring we are focused on the stability of the sector and our challenge is to make sure this is taken care of as much as possible. I dispute that it is foot-dragging; it is not. It is rooted in carrying out our strategic mandate to protect members' funds.

What loan-to-asset ratio does she believe a credit union should have to ensure it is viable in the long term?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	389	There are international norms on which we can draw in that respect. In general, rates of between 40% and 50% would be considered viable in the long term for the sector.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	390	I have dealt with credit unions on a professional level for many years and have great time for them. They kept small businesses operating in instances where the banks would not give them funding. They have cost the State €20 million to date, while the gross cost to it of bailing out the banks to date has been €64 billion.Anglo Irish Bank will cost us €30 billion, yet we are debating - in the twilight zone - about a group which is trying to survive. I put it to Ms McKiernan that the reason the loan-to-asset ratios of many of the credit unions in the State have fallen by a half is that they cannot lend money due to the restrictions put in place by the regulator. Will Ms McKiernan address a point that has been made to us by many people, namely, that the credit union movement, because of the restrictions being put in place, is driving people to resort to moneylenders? I see where the registry is coming from. It is seeking to create a structure that is viable but the credit union movement is far bigger than that. I put it to Ms McKiernan, as the regulator, that we have to find a means by which we can support the credit union movement. A loan-to-asset ratio of 28% is too low and will force many of the credit unions to amalgamate and others to disappear. I have a problem with that prospect. Will Ms McKiernan address those two issues, namely, that the imposition of the restrictions has, by stealth, driven the ratio down and that the restrictions are sending people to moneylenders.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	391	I thank Deputy O'Donnell for his questions. The lending restrictions were imposed to a greater extent at the height of the crisis but they were calibrated in such a way as to reduce excessive risk-taking. They were not calibrated to impact on credit unions' core short-term financing standards.

What does she, as regulator, regard as core?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	393	The area in which they have significantly built their business model to date is around short-term personal and small business finance.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	395	Generally, sub-five years. However, we allow longer-term lending and mortgage lending for credit unions that can undertake the appropriate risk management for such practices. We, in turn, have prudent rules in place to ensure the special risks that exist around longer-term lending are appropriately managed. Our rules also take account of the fact that the funding model for credit unions is largely on-demand deposits. We need to balance the risks around that with their entry into longer-term lending.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	396	Does Ms McKiernan think it valid to state that the restrictions being put in place will, by stealth, force credit unions to amalgamate?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	397	I would like to come back to the point about the lending restrictions programme and the progress in that regard. As I mentioned, the programme was put in place to limit excessive risk-taking lending. The size of the restrictions was calibrated to allow all the credit unions on which they were imposed to do normal and appropriate credit risk management and lending. We continued to see poor practices across credit unions during our supervisory engagements. These showed that, in many cases, they were not doing the appropriate credit risk management. We bear in mind that it is the funds of one group of members which are being lent to another group of members, that is, borrowing members. We want to ensure that those funds are appropriately safeguarded. We make no apology for putting in place regulatory requirements which are proportionate to the size and complexity of the credit union sector. Again-----

#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	400	I am limited in terms of time. I understand what is being said but has the registrar examined the possibility of providing back-up services? The credit union movement is based on community. A person is able to go to the local credit union and deal with someone he or she knows. In my experience, most people want to repay their credit union loans. My worry is that credit unions will get bigger and the smaller credit union with its community ethos will disappear. Before we know it, credit unions will get bigger and bigger and end up being banks, which is not what they are supposed to be. Instead of going to a credit union, carrying out an audit and indicating that its standards are not up to par, has the regulator examined the possibility of having an alternative process? The regulator is dealing with very decent people. Could the registry put back-office facilities in place? This has happened in Canada and other countries. If someone comes in with a proposal, the credit union could avail of back-up facilities provided by the registry through the league or otherwise. It would be assisted in putting in place the necessary due diligence and risk assessment. We all want to get to the same point. I am concerned, however, that in getting to the point of having very sound credit unions, we will lose too many of them. They will be lost overboard from the credit union movement. I know from first-hand experience dealing with people that we owe a debt of gratitude to the credit union movement. My concern is that they are coming under enormous pressure. I know and accept that the registry has a job to do but what can we do to assist the credit union movement put these measures in place? Many of them would not be able to afford the level of regulation that could be required. At the same time, they are the ones providing the money, which means people do not have to resort to moneylenders and pay exorbitant rates of interest. What action is the registry taking to help the credit union movement survive and how will this facilitate the implementation of the type of standards it wishes to see put in place? Rather than going in and saying credits unions are not meeting the mark, will the registry not ask them what it can do to help them meet that mark? Will Ms McKiernan address that matter?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	401	I will start by saying that we share the same vision for the credit union sector. We want to see a thriving credit union sector. It provides choice and competition across the financial system and it also serves community interests. We are very much aiming for the same end but we have different responsibilities along the way. What can we do to help the sector? We are already doing a couple of things. We are engaging consistently with the sector bodies around the proposals they are bringing forward to address exactly some of the issues raised by Deputy O'Donnell, namely, how it can provide services to credit unions which, effectively, give them the economies of scale they will not get themselves.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	402	Correct.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	403	Our role is to look at those proposals and see if they are appropriate for the credit union sector now and in terms of how it might evolve in the future. We work with those bodies to develop those proposals so that they will have a better chance of success and of saving the sector. The second thing we can do is ensure - while all of the latter are moving from being emergent proposals to better developed proposals to, eventually, it is hoped, successful proposals - that we work with credit unions through direct contact and our supervisory engagement so that they focus on ensuring they meet the basic standards that protect their members' funds. They will, therefore, stay relevant, viable and safe while on the way to potentially taking on new business product approaches.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	404	I will conclude on this point. The credit unions will not be able to grow their loan books unless the restrictions are somewhat lifted. How can we get to a point where the registry will feel comfortable enough to lift the restrictions so that they can grow their balance sheets again? They are currently shrinking and if that process continues, they will not survive.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	405	This year we set out on a journey to find out how we could lift restrictions in a safe and sound way. This was our lending restrictions review programme. Having started with 199 restrictions in place, as of today we have lifted 55. We focused resources on ensuring that if they meet the basic requirements, they can get their restrictions lifted and many of them have.

If a lending restriction exists in a credit union, it carries a certain amount of information value, which is that the credit union needs to do more to protect its members' funds. If there is no lending restriction, it equally carries information value, which is that the credit union prioritised its efforts in terms of its basic credit practices.

We talked about the requirement for 10% capital in proportion to total assets. Do the witnesses accept that this is more than double what international peers have to carry? That is because it is not risk-weighted.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	410	We have a supervisory engagement model which is adapted to take account of risk as well as impact. From the beginning of 2016 all our supervisory engagements will be prioritised on a risk basis. We will look at all the risks that exist across the credit unions, including their risks relating to viability, their practices and their governance, and we will prioritise the frequency and scope of our engagements with those credit unions that exhibit the highest risk. In this way we will fulfil our mandate to protect the sector. The Deputy mentioned the reserve base and our current ratio. The credit union sector in Ireland is generally of a very different level of complexity, size and model from what one finds in most other jurisdictions. We are often compared with credit unions in the US or Canada but those are, in general, far more complex, far more bank-like in their product base and significantly larger in scale. Comparing their base requirement to ours is not comparing like with like. 
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	411	The Registrar of Credit Unions is asking credit unions to carry a capital risk weight of 100% for investment in Government bonds when, by international standards, it should be down at 20%. My next question is on lending to small businesses. Ms McKiernan said that lending to small businesses has to be 50% of the total capital requirement. Given that the capital requirement has no connection whatsoever to the risk asset mix, this will force credit unions to engage in unsecured lending when they reach 50% of capital in order to increase their capital so that they can lend on to small businesses. Mortgage lending, which is secured, must not exceed 10% of the total loan portfolio over a ten-year period so, when they hit 10%, the same situation arises. They cannot lend any more in mortgages so they increase unsecured, riskier lending to increase their overall loan portfolio and thereby increase their secured lending. This does not make sense.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	412	When we carried out all our supervisory engagements across the sector and published our report on standards, we were disappointed to find there were significant weaknesses in the business model, credit risk standards and governance standards across credit unions. One would expect us to be conservative and not to loosen requirements until the basics were met to sufficiently protect members' funds and the stability of the sector. We are going through a period of significant transformation in the sector around restructuring. A large number of credit unions are still engaging with ReBo, acknowledging that a merger is probably in their best interests to provide the best service to their members into the future. That also provides an opportunity for credit unions, as they get more scale and capacity, to tackle their business model weaknesses and we believe that is the point at which we will revisit several of these rules and see in what way the regulatory framework can be adapted to give more flexibility while we still prudently manage the sector to ensure its stability.

Surely not all of the 300 credit unions are going into ReBo. This crisis did not hit us just last month or last year. Surely the registrar knows that certain credit unions are sustainable, on a sound footing and with no questions over systemic risks, but measures are still in place which limit their potential and drive them into riskier lending. When will this review happen? The instruments seem very blunt and designed to hold back the water. The estimate was for a figure of €500 million but if we had come up with a similar miscalculation for the banks we would have estimated their cost at €1.6 trillion. The instruments do not seem to be connected to risk and are simply designed to hold back the dam and there does not seem to be an acknowledgement, other than what Ms McKiernan has just said, that some of this needs to be revisited.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	415	Mortgage lending is already provided for in our regulatory framework. Only a small number of credit unions choose to use the scope they have in the regulatory framework to undertake that business. They rightly recognise that long-term secured lending is very different from what most of their business is built on, which is short-term personal financing. Mortgage lending is a competitive market with experienced players so we would expect credit unions to consider very carefully whether a major move into that market was best suited to them in the context of their current and future challenges. What do we think credit unions most need to do at this stage? They need to work with us to meet their regulatory requirements as this best protects them, their members' funds and the stability of the sector. Second, they need more mergers as this will help them to get stronger, financially and operationally, and to gain efficiencies that can be used to develop their business. Third, they need to focus on the product and service development and new delivery channels, not necessarily in an overly ambitious way but in a way that will attract and retain younger borrowers and give them the services they need in the way they expect. If credit unions can get those three things right, there is no reason they cannot recover their strong place in the financial system and be a thriving force into the future.

When was the last time the registrar issued guidance on lending and credit risk management practices? The handbook does not cover these areas. Ms McKiernan has spoken of what the credit unions need to do but I want to ask what the Registrar of Credit Unions needs to do, and what the Central Bank needs to do.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-16 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	419	I referred to the report we published in May 2014 on the standards we observed during our on-site engagements. That document also set out our expectations on the standards the sector needed to meet. We issued a prudent lending circular in 2013, which contained more granular information on our expectations and our standards around lending and the limits thereon.

We have to acknowledge that there has been a significant slimming down of the financial offering, particularly that available to people on low incomes, since the financial crisis. A number of good points have been made about what is expected of the credit union movement, about the uniqueness of the movement and what it has to offer, which is something that, increasingly, our high street banks are not offering. Some banks have even taken measures to remove themselves from public engagement, which the credit union has not done.In fact, the credit union movement seeks to engage directly with borrowers, which is a significant strength. Deputy O'Donnell asked whether we will reach a point where we will no longer recognise the difference between a credit union and a bank. That is an important point. It is perhaps a matter of policy that this committee needs to revert to with the Minister. After our previous meeting, we wrote to the Minister to ask him to delay implementing the rest of the legislation until we met the Registrar of Credit Unions. It may now be appropriate to write again to say that we have met the registrar, that concerns remain and that we hope officials from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the credit union representative bodies will continue to meet to find an effective solution to the difficulties the committee has identified. Is that agreed? Agreed. The clerk to the committee will send a summary of this discussion to the Minister. I thank Ms McKiernan and Ms Byrne for appearing before the committee today.
