#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I have just heard that the Government intends to bring a special motion before the Dáil on Thursday seeking the permission of the Dáil to proceed with the sale of Aer Lingus although the Dáil is not meeting over the summer months. Will a similar motion be put before this House before the end of session? It would be outrageous if the Government chose to sell this State asset without recourse to this House, given the debates we have had on the matter in recent months. It would highlight the irrelevance of the House if the Government was to proceed in such a way.When the Leader's colleague, the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, brought the Aer Lingus Bill through the Houses two years ago, he gave an absolute guarantee that before a flotation would take place, the Government would publish in full a detailed assessment of the criteria applying to and reasons for the sale of the asset. He gave a commitment in both Houses that a full, detailed White Paper would be published before such a sale but it has not been done.We are entering the summer period but there is still confusion. The asset is worth 50% less than it was when Mr. Willie Walsh was in charge of the State airline. It would be highly unusual and wrong for a decision to be taken without recourse to both Houses. The other House will have its chance on Thursday. Will this House have a chance before Friday to debate this important matter?I was privileged to be in Islandbridge last Saturday for the national celebration of the 90th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme. I want to record my appreciation and congratulations to the Departments, whether the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs or other Departments, which organised that wonderful commemoration of reconciliation for those from all parts of this island who gave their lives for peace in that awful war that emerged in the first part of the last century. We need to learn from that reconciliation. It was an excellent commemoration and all involved should be congratulated.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I was not aware of the Aer Lingus debate in the Dáil. I concur with the points raised by Senator Brian Hayes.  People on all sides of the House hold all sorts of views. Senator Ross has called for a debate numerous times and looked for a business plan. Everybody has views on it, probably all different, and we are entitled to put them on the record.Last year when we discussed employment I made the point that 80% of Irish call centres would migrate to English-speaking Africa by the end of the next decade and I still think that will happen. What happened yesterday in Waterford is tough on the workers and the area. That was only a consolidation and reorganisation. There will be more of this and only the call centres that have added value such as technical support will stay here. Those that only give information and deal with issues will move to English-speaking Africa and we cannot depend on them. We should make every effort to bring better industry and to retrain and help the workers who have lost jobs in Waterford and to ensure they get a decent redundancy if they are left without employment. This is a significant issue for the future. A large number of people work for call centres around the country. Those who are simply giving out information will not do that for much longer and we must ensure there are alternatives for them. I would like to have a debate in the autumn on that kind of employment without added value.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It is news to me that the Government plans to put a motion on the sale of Aer Lingus to the Dáil this week. I hope the Leader will tell us that a similar motion will be put to the Seanad before the end of the week, although I, like other speakers, believe it is designed to give the Government carte blanche to make a decision during the summer without any accountability to either House. That is unacceptable. Considering the views expressed on this matter in the last number of months by Members here it would be extraordinary if the matter were rushed through in the summer.I, too, note the commemoration of the Battle of the Somme last weekend. It was appropriate and has greatly advanced the cause of reconciliation on this island around the issues that first came up for us around the time of the Battle of the Somme. It was an important, valuable and worthwhile exercise. I acknowledge and congratulate all those involved.As we approach the end of this session I note that the calls I have made for a debate on child care regulation and media law have not been successful. I do not blame the Leader or hold her responsible. I simply note that various Ministers promised a review of child care regulations, a very important area, and that has not happened. We had a promise from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who is productive on legislation. However, he has not brought forward any of the long-promised legislation on media law and the press council. This will not happen before the summer, I doubt it will happen during the summer, and I look forward to it happening in the autumn.

The first emigrant to benefit from such an extension of the scheme is Ms Mary Kelly, who was born in Askeaton, County Limerick and resides in New York. She is one of 30 applicants who will receive this payment of €2,500. I ask the Leader to congratulate all concerned and to wish all our Irish emigrants in America a happy Independence Day.

#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	12	It was recently announced that the Health Service Executive is putting out to tender for four private hospitals in the campus of existing public hospital areas. One of those is Limerick Regional Hospital. I wonder what is evolving in the health service. In the Limerick area there is already permission for two private hospitals. During the week a private hospital recently established in Galway announced 150 redundancies because of lack of agreement with the VHI on rates. In my area I see the difficulty of accessing public hospitals for the elderly due to the reduction of beds on those public hospitals, and I am sure other politicians see the same. The biggest problem in my area is not the distinction between private and public, but the number of elderly people in hospital beds, such as those in Limerick Regional Hospital. Through no fault of those elderly, one cannot access operations and intensive care units. So where is the problem? Rather than talk about private hospitals we should establish a respite location in Limerick Regional Hospital to take these people out of the main hospital, because they cannot get into St. Ita's or St. Camillus's hospitals. Will we have a rash of private hospitals sustained by Government taxation measures to incentivise them, leading to a reduction in the number of beds in public hospitals? Is this the Government's plan for the future?

I understand that up to 200,000 people are driving with provisional licences. Would the Minister consider an amnesty for those who have been driving for five years without being involved in accidents or experiencing problems? It is ludicrous that this number of people are driving without a full licence. With the carnage on the roads, the Minister should examine this. It would solve a number of problems.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I join with my colleagues in calling for an explanation of the Aer Lingus situation. The Minister appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport, and I attended that meeting. There are worries about it. The same, or similar, advisers who were involved in the Eircom situation have been advising on this. It does not look as if we will get a good deal. The public was misled in the run up to this by suggestions that it was legally impossible for the Government to invest in Aer Lingus. We know this is not the case. I would welcome a debate on the matter. Bypassing the Seanad is a bad idea, although it does not surprise me.I also join with my colleagues in expressing pleasure and satisfaction that the massacre at the Somme was officially commemorated in a dignified and appropriate way. It was also moving that, for the first time, a stamp commemorating this was issued. I would have liked to have been there but because of various factors my invitation did not arrive until Wednesday and it was too late to rearrange my schedule. However I am glad it took place.I wish to raise the establishment of a heritage council, which is to be welcomed. I would like to think it would be a vigorous body. I regret that An Taisce has been excluded——

May I remind the interrupters on the other side of the House that the people who attack An Taisce for its reasonable comments on one-off housing and its implications for water and sewerage systems, squeaked about this but did not like it when An Taisce told the truth.I hope that houses such as Kilmacurragh in Wicklow which was a very beautiful and important Queen Anne house——

Something perhaps should be done with that. The editorial in The Irish Times states: “But the remit of the fine-sounding Irish Heritage Trust is so limited that the institution does not deserve that title”. I hope that after a period this will be re-examined and proper and full legislation brought in, through this House, to establish a real and vigorous Irish national trust.

I read an article in the financial pages of a newspaper from across the water, to the effect that companies there were beginning to rethink the outsourcing of call centres to distant continents because it was not working very satisfactorily. There is much to be said for having call centres closer to the customer base. That argument is by no means over.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Minister for Transport is probably the man responsible for clamping in Dublin. It was the responsibility of the former Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, and may now fall under the remit of his successor, Deputy Gallagher. In the past six months a new company has taken over responsibility for clamping in the city.A serious incident was brought to my attention last Sunday after I met the Cathaoirleach at the Leinster hurling final. A group of parents of the Kilkenny hurling panel were travelling together and when they left Croke Park at approximately 5.30 p.m. they discovered that the car in which they had travelled was removed from where they had parked it. Most of these people are in their sixties. They assumed the car had been stolen.An elderly man living in a house nearby told them it might have been clamped. He gave them the telephone number for the clamping company, which they phoned. The company confirmed that the car had been clamped.They were told to go to a shop two miles away to pay the fine, which they did. That shop did not have the bill and they had to go a further two miles to pay the fine. When they phoned back to the company the man who answered the phone said he did not have a clue where the car was and wished them the best of luck and happy hunting trying to find it.This is a new company brought on board, I presume, by Dublin City Council, in conjunction with the Department of Transport to oversee clamping operations in Dublin. That behaviour is not acceptable in any context. I urge the Leader to convey my objections to the Department of Transport on that issue.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I endorse some of the comments of my colleagues about the dangers of a decision being made on Aer Lingus during the recess. There is a general principle involved here. I do not join the opportunist bellyaching which always comes from some parts of the House about a long recess but it would be extremely regrettable for the Government to use the recess as an opportunity for taking important decisions when the Dáil and Seanad cannot scrutinise them.There is a danger that is exactly what is planned in respect of Aer Lingus. The one thing we know about Aer Lingus is that we do not know much about it. We know nothing of the terms of the proposed privatisation or flotation. The detail is so important that it will decide the merit of the flotation and privatisation. There are people on all sides of the argument who have large stakes in the result of the negotiations.The workforce has a vital interest in what will happen but taxpayers and investors also have an interest in it. One interest bounces off another. It would be a grave insult to this House to wake up in September and find that Aer Lingus has been sold for a song and we can do nothing about it. It would be absolutely wrong if this flotation were to take place without the Dáil and Seanad knowing anything about how it will happen.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The forthcoming budget in December may contain a welcome provision whereby there will be an income disregard for the first €100 of a non-contributory old age pension. While I welcome this I am surprised that people on small supplementary pensions do not have the same benefit. I would like the Minister for Finance to consider this and perhaps we could hold a debate on some of these provisions. It is most unfair that a person on a widow's pension might receive a small supplementary pension of €30 or €40 a week but have it taken away in the means test for a non-contributory old age pension.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Last week the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, issued a press release on drugs in which he stated that one chooses whether to take drugs. He specified the notion of informed choices. Are we as legislators, educators and parents, informing young people of the dangers of drugs? Do we give them the information adequate to making informed choices?According to an article on the front page of today's Irish Independent, 300,000 people aged 16 to 24 dabble in cannabis. That is a red alert. Extensive research in San Francisco and Scandinavia shows that 10% of these people will be prone to develop schizophrenia. That amounts to 30,000 young people.I call for the Seanad, in its final year under the present mandate, to have a debate next autumn on drug abuse and to pose questions about information anomalies. The onus is on us to do that.I spoke to the international president of Europe Against Drugs, Grainne Kenny, this morning. The Leader is acquainted with her through her ministerial role in a previous life. Ms Kenny issued a personal plea through me to the Leader to consider holding a national conference on drug awareness and the dangers of drug abuse. She will contact the Leader personally but we should use this House to highlight the dangers of drug abuse and protect those who take drugs.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The Ryder Cup, which is a major sporting event, will have taken place in Ireland by the time the House meets again in the autumn. It is a major coup for Ireland to have attracted what is probably the third largest sporting event that will take place in the world this year. It is obvious that the organisers of the event have serious worries about controlling the crowds which are expected and implementing the various regulations which are needed in the interests of the safety of those who will visit the area and those who will be involved in all aspects of the event. The chief executive officer of the K Club, Mr. Michael Davern, has sent a letter to all property owners in the area, clearly indicating what I see as a serious situation. Mr. Davern has demanded that all property owners should sign and accept certain rules and regulations if they intend to have any visitors or guests on their property during the course of the event.I find it disturbing that it is stated, near the end of the letter, that the policies and regulations outlined in the letter will be governed and construed under English law. It is hard to know exactly what that means. Nobody has been able to explain it to me in any way. Does it mean that Ryder Cup Limited, which is an English-based company, has no confidence in the ability of the Irish people to run a major event like the Ryder Cup? Is the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, aware of the organisers' statement that this requirement will be imposed?It seems, in effect, that in a selected area, Irish law will be dispensed with and English law will be transposed for the duration of the event. I would like the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, whether he is aware of these conditions and, if so, whether he has accepted them. Similarly, does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, know about these regulations and does he agree with them? Given that we have heard many rousing republican speeches from the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I do not know how he can accept the conditions which have been laid down for this event.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I think the Senator has made his point adequately.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I hope the Leader will, in the near future, be able to inform us of the implications of the application of English law in this part of County Kildare for the duration of the Ryder Cup.On a separate matter, I support Senator Kitt's request for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to explain fully a significant social welfare anomaly, whereby PAYE workers who are paying into a pension are allowed to earn €100 a week but there is no corresponding identifiable benefit or condition for self-employed people. I hope the Minister will clarify this unfair set of circumstances as a matter of urgency because many people could benefit from such a provision.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Senator has spoken about a form of Poyning's law.

While it is not an urgent matter, it would be useful to discuss it. A Senator has already mentioned that if our trout stocks die out, rural Ireland will die and our tourism industry will be destroyed. The economy is a minor issue compared to such difficulties we might have to face. I ask that we be given a chance to debate the economy at the earliest opportunity.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I join Senator McHugh in calling for another debate on cannabis use in light of a new Government report which shows that 300,000 young people use the drug on a regular basis. Given that the use of cannabis is now seen as kind of cool, we need to ensure that its ever-increasing dangers are highlighted. New medical research has proven that cannabis joints contain four times more tar than tobacco cigarettes and that adolescents who use cannabis are four times more likely to develop schizophrenia than those who do not use it. I am worried because there has not been a cannabis awareness campaign in Ireland. Most parents are ignorant of what is happening in our communities. I ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the Seanad to outline the protections she intends to put in place. We need a cannabis awareness campaign, for example. We have to fight this ever-increasing scourge, which is found throughout Ireland.

Cannabis has been glorified by certain people. If I remember correctly, a Dáil candidate in Dublin approximately 20 years ago had the use of cannabis as one of his plans for election.

It must be remembered that cannabis is a gateway drug with some very serious components that can affect mental and physical health. We need a debate at the earliest possible opportunity on the use of cannabis.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	73	This week, many of this country's thousands of primary school teachers are giving up the first week of their summer holidays to do courses. Can the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to explain why the teachers will receive just three days of annual or personal leave in return for spending five days doing such courses? Will the Minister consider providing substitute cover while these teachers attend courses? Primary school teachers who take course days have the day off but their classes are split up among the rest of the school. It would not happen in any other profession. If, for example, a doctor is missing, a locum will replace him or her.The substitute teacher option is also important for health and safety reasons with many classrooms already overcrowded. As a result, many teachers do not take the three course days to which they are entitled. In many rural schools, the children tend not to go to school on the day in question. That is, however, happening less because both parents may be working or single parents cannot keep their children at home. Will the Minister for Education and Science consider allowing teachers on day courses to put in a substitute for the days in question?

The coverage arises out of the report, to be published tomorrow morning, by the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on cannabis use. It is good to see we are making front-page news. I pay tribute to the committee’s Chairman, Deputy Keaveney, and the various witnesses who gave their points of view on the issue. The Irish Independent took the report as it found it and did not endeavour to put its own spin on it. The newspaper also gave the Chairman the opportunity to respond to some questions it had.The report has heightened an awareness of the subject of cannabis use. Too many people, particularly socialites, put forward the idea that cannabis is harmless and that it has many kinds of medicinal values. We all know the dangers that lurk in that argument. When an Oireachtas committee puts so much work into a report that receives such coverage from a daily newspaper, it should be debated in the House. It would be a worthwhile debate and I hope it will happen in the next session.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Senator Brian Hayes, as did many other Members, asked if the sale of Aer Lingus would be debated in the House. It will be debated in the Dáil. Section 3(5) of the Aer Lingus Act 2004 states, "The Minister for Finance may not dispose of any shares in the Company without the general principles of the disposal being laid before and approved by Dáil Éireann". The Act was passed by the Seanad on 31 March 2004. I am giving Members the legal position before they all jump up on the issue. I will ask if the relevant Ministers will discuss the matter with the Seanad. Senator Hayes also raised the matter of the White Paper on the sale of Aer Lingus promised by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. I do not know where that has gone but we have sent a note on that matter.Senator Hayes congratulated all Departments responsible for the recent ceremony for the Battle of the Somme commemoration. I, like others, received an invitation but I had a previous arrangement which I could not cancel. The Battle of Verdun was even greater than the Somme and more Irish soldiers, particularly from the fusiliers, died there. That will be for other days. What I saw of the Somme ceremony made terrific viewing.Senator O'Toole also called for a debate on the sale of Aer Lingus. I have already given the legal position on that and it is up to the Minister for Finance if he wishes to have a debate. I will seek a debate regardless. The Senator also called for a debate on employment, considering NTL's announcement on its call centres.Senator O'Meara raised the Somme commemoration, media law and child care. Bills on child care and defamation and privacy will be introduced in the autumn and both have been secured for first reading in the Seanad.Senator Brennan pointed out that today is 4 July, American Independence Day. He also welcomed the extension of the President's centenarians' bounty to expatriates. The first to receive the bounty is Mary Kelly, who was born in Askeaton in July 1905. I am very happy for her and others who will be lining up for it. The Senator marked the matter in a dignified way.Senator Finucane raised the issue of public and private care in hospitals. He believes more respite centres should be built where the elderly can go in comfort rather than divvying them out between public and private hospitals.Senator Bohan pointed out there are 200,000 drivers with provisional licences. He asked for an amnesty for those with a licence for at least five years and no convictions. I do not know whether that is proper but I will put it to the Minister.Senator Norris raised the issues of the sale of Aer Lingus and the Somme commemoration. Like me, he could not go to it. He noted the establishment of the Heritage Council but with the exclusion of An Taisce. He is correct in saying there are no warm feelings for An Taisce. He also raised the matter of the lovely Queen Anne house in County Wicklow that has fallen into disrepair.Senator Mansergh claimed the argument is not over about the fading away of employment in call centres because there is a rethink about hiving these jobs off to India and other countries. Perhaps it will be back to base for call centre employers.Senator John Paul Phelan recounted a terrible story about how a clamping company laughed at the people who were clamped. To say "Good luck, I hope you find your car", particularly after a warm day, is a terribly derisory way to treat anyone. The company was awarded the contract. When one contacts such companies, they can be very offhand. I understand the individuals, although they were in the wrong, were not happy when they were clamped. However, that is beside the point when they sought the return of their car.Senator Ross called for the flotation of Aer Lingus to be discussed. He heard what I said. Senator Kitt asked for a debate on the means-testing of supplementary pensions, which he claimed was unfair. Senator McHugh raised Kofi Annan's recent comments on drug-taking. I saw Grainne Kenny of Europe Against Drugs with Senator McHugh in the canteen earlier. I recently met a Donegal woman who is mad about Senator McHugh and wants him to get——

I agree with him. Senator Feighan spoke about the dangers of cannabis. This was echoed by Senator Glynn who reminded us that it is called a gateway drug, which is a nice warm name for leading the way to other much more harmful drugs, but it is harmful in its own right.Senator Browne wants substitute teachers to be provided in cases where teachers undertake the five-day course rather than have pupils divided among other classes in schools. Senator Ó Murchú believes the Irish Independent has given generous coverage to the issue of cannabis in view of the report pending from the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs chaired by Deputy Keaveney. Cannabis is harmful and I would hope to have a debate on the matter in the autumn.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Amendment No. 1 relates to section 5(8)(a) which concerns the preservation of a crime scene. I believe there is value in the arguments made yesterday by Senator Cummins in regard to this subsection. There is a need to ensure that evidence obtained from a crime scene is not rendered inadmissible simply because a garda did not make a written record of the direction from his superintendent that a place be designated as a crime scene as soon as practicable.Amendment No. 1 qualifies section 5(8)(a) by adding the words, “a failure to record the direction shall not by itself render any evidence inadmissible”. This does not give the Garda an out in terms of the formalities but, equally, where through an oversight the direction is for some reason not recorded as soon as practicable, it would not in itself render inadmissible any evidence found at the scene. I commend the amendment to the House.Senator Cummins will probably see that I have gone more than half-way to meet the point he made and confined the particular provision to admissibility. Whether it would have repercussions for the Garda in terms of exceeding its powers or being liable in damages to owners of commercial premises is a different issue and is not one with which we must be concerned here.

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 20, line 18, to delete "includes a dwelling" and substitute the following:"means a physical location and includes—(a) a dwelling, residence, building or abode,(b) a vehicle, whether mechanically propelled or not,(c) a vessel, whether sea-going or not,(d) an aircraft, whether capable of operation or not,(e) a hovercraft, or(f) any other place whatsoever”.When addressing this matter the Minister suggested that the phrase covered by paragraph (f), “any other place whatsoever”, could be twisted by a lawyer to imply that it would include one or other of the definitions referred to in the above paragraphs (a) to (e). This is an effort on our part to clarify the situation. In spite of the Minister’s reply from yesterday, we are still not clear why this is not acceptable. We wish to copperfasten the entire definition. It is probably a belt and braces approach but we consider it is necessary. We would welcome further clarification on this matter from the Minister.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I second the amendment. If I recall correctly, the Minister stated yesterday that when paragraph (f), “any other place whatsoever”, was used, it would refer to paragraphs (a) to (e), and in the courts a lawyer could argue that paragraphs (a) to (e) would only be a reference point in terms of “any other place whatsoever”, and would not mean anywhere outside of those areas. I think the Minister said the Supreme Court had ruled to that effect.Senator Cummins's aim is to provide clarity such that "any other place whatsoever" would include other places that were not referred to in paragraphs (a) to (e). The extent of leaving this out would mean that all of those areas referred to would be just those areas. For the sake of clarity it would be preferable to have a more all-embracing term included at the end, even in the context of case law that already exists.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 29, to delete lines 37 to 39.Having raised this issue on Committee Stage yesterday, I reviewed the relevant documentation I received from the Law Society. In its submission on the Bill, it said in regard to sections 17 and 18, "Declarations, oaths or affirmations should not be administered by persons who have an interest in the subject matter at hand but should be taken by an independent person with a duty to explain to the declarant the nature and import of the declaration, oath or affirmation which they are about to make".I am aware there is legislation which allows other categories of persons to sign statutory declarations. In the case, for example, of a person applying for citizenship on the basis of marriage to an Irish citizen, I understand the declaration that must be provided to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform may be signed by several categories of witnesses, including solicitors and commissioners for oaths. I am aware of other cases where this can be done and I presume the relevant provisions are set out in particular statutes and so on.The Statutory Declarations Act 1938 does not deal with the question of a conflict of interest. It is standard practice on the part of solicitors that they should have no personal interest in cases where they witness or signs a statutory declaration on a client's behalf. Approximately one year ago, the Law Society wrote to solicitors, including myself, outlining the practice in this regard because it seems some people's understanding of it may have become vague with the passage of time.If a witness makes a statement to a garda about an offence, it may well be in the interests of the garda to get the witness to make a statutory declaration to support that statement. Under section 17(2), it may be the investigating garda in question who enacts that declaration or objectively witnesses it. This seems inappropriate.When we discussed this issue yesterday, the Minister referred to section 16(4)(a), which provides that a witness statement may not be submitted in evidence if the court decides “having had regard to all the circumstances, including any risk that its admission would be unfair to the accused or, if there are more than one accused, to any of them, that in the interests of justice it ought not to be so admitted”. If judges are to take that subsection into account, they will have to rule out any statutory declaration made according to the provisions of section 17 and perhaps section 18.It is obvious there is a conflict of interest and that section 17(2) allows for a questionable way of securing a statutory declaration. I ask the Minister to reconsider. A peace commissioner could surely be authorised to sign off on such declarations as they do in the case of other declarations. I am not sure how it is done in other legislation but perhaps something could be included in the Bill to say what categories of persons may witness a person's statutory declaration, including not only solicitors and commissioners for oaths but also peace commissioners and others included in other legislative provisions. The Passport Office, for example, has a list of persons who may be witnesses to declarations. It would not be difficult for a garda to say that a declaration must be made and that it may be witnessed by certain categories of persons. Section 17 is flawed and any declaration made under it will not be worth the paper on which it is written. Any judge would rule out such a declaration because of the conflict of interest it involves.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I second the amendment. I have something of a Machiavellian interest in it because it deals with such matters as conflict of interest, validity of statements and so on. In addition to supporting this important amendment, I wish to afford the Minister an opportunity, if he so chooses, to revisit my amendment No. 5, which relates to the video taping of the taking of samples. I was 30 seconds late in moving the amendment because I had to take a telephone call. It relates to the same area of principle as Senator Tuffy's amendment. The Minister said yesterday he might look at this issue again. He seems willing to accept amendments and we are galloping ahead at an unprecedented rate.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Members have canvassed an interesting point in regard to these amendments. This section follows the Canadian model and provides that a judge can take into account where inconsistent statements are subsequently withdrawn. It is important that there should not be impediments in this regard.I can see, as Senator Tuffy said, that solicitors will make an argument when the witness is hostile regarding the statement he has made and anything that might compromise it. There are practicalities involved also and it is not always easy to get a peace commissioner to attend when a witness is making a statement. Generally they are made in Garda stations. We should try to protect section 16 because it is important and may prove effective in tackling organised crime where intimidation of witnesses can occur.If a garda other than the garda in charge of the case against the defendant took the witness statement in the station it could be argued there is not the same conflict of interest, in inverted commas. I have difficulty with this idea of a conflict of interest. The Garda exists to represent the State and society generally. It is the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that brings the case against the defendant with the garda, often, as a witness. Perhaps there should be a distinction made between the garda in charge of the case against the defendant and other gardaí in the station. I would hate to think that section 16 could be undermined by interpretations made subsequent to the passing of the Bill.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I am grateful to Senator Norris for the invitation to be disorderly and deal with his unmoved amendment. The issues that he raised can be dealt with by custody regulations made under the Criminal Justice Act 1984. Senator Norris is raising ways it can be proved beyond contradiction the taking of a sample was done in a lawful way. The majority of people will be happy to provide a DNA sample when asked to do so by running a swab inside the cheek. To put in place a requirement that all this must be done before a camera may be unnecessary with regard to cooperative witnesses. As I said, this can be dealt with by way of regulation.The effect of the amendments raised by Senator Tuffy is to remove subsection (2) from section 17 and subsection (3) from section 18, the purpose of which is to extend the power to receive statutory declarations to members of the Garda Síochána and the employees of public authorities. Removing the two subsections would defeat the purpose of the sections and they would become redundant. The sections would then only provide that a person who makes a statement to a garda or an employee of a public authority could make a statutory declaration. A peace commissioner or commissioner for oaths would need to be brought in to receive the declaration and there is nothing to prevent this from happening at the moment. If the Garda really want commissioners for oaths present they will be asked to come in.Section 17 extends the power to receive statutory declarations to members of An Garda Síochána while section 18 extends the power to receive statutory declarations to competent persons who are defined as the employees of a wide range of public authorities. Section 1 of the Statutory Declarations Act 1938 envisages that persons other than notaries, commissioners for oaths and peace commissioners might be designated by law to receive statutory declarations and sections 17 and 18 do this. The reason for the inclusion of these sections is that section 16(2) refers to statements made on oath or affirmation containing a statutory declaration or in circumstances where the witness understood the requirement to tell the truth and contains no limitation on to whom the statement must be made.The extension of the power to receive statutory declarations to the Garda Síochána in section 17 and all public authorities in section 18 flows from section 16(2)(c). It means there is a mechanism that can be used by the Garda and public authorities, for example the Revenue Commissioners, immigration officers, the Passport Office and so on. Investigative agencies will know that people making statements to them should understand the requirement to tell the truth, that these are not simply casual conversations where people can lie, or not, as suits.Sections 17 and 18 simply allow the Garda and the employees of public authorities to receive statutory declarations. In the event that a statement contained in a statutory declaration is subsequently relevant to criminal proceedings and is recanted it will be a matter for the court to decide, within the parameters set out in section 16, whether it should be admitted.A high threshold is set out in section 16 for the admissibility of a statement that has been recanted. The section requires the court to subject a statement that has been recanted to a series of tests before making a decision on whether it should be admitted. It can only be admitted if the person who gave it is available for cross examination and the witness confirms or it is otherwise proved that he or she made it. The court must also be satisfied that direct oral evidence of the fact concerned would be admissible in the proceedings, that the statement was made voluntarily and that it is reliable.Furthermore, in order to be deemed admissible, the court must be satisfied that either the statement was given on oath or affirmation or contained a statutory declaration by the witness that the statement is true to the best of his or her knowledge or belief or the court is otherwise satisfied that when the statement was made the witness understood the requirement to tell the truth. Section 16(4) provides that if the court is of the opinion, having regard to all the circumstances, that the admission of a statement would not be in the interests of justice it should not be admitted. It will be clear from the tests built in to section 16 that a statement containing a statutory declaration is not decisive when a court is deciding whether to admit a statement, it is simply one of a number of factors the court will take into consideration.Senator Tuffy asserts that there is a rule of practice, in the world of lawyers, suggesting that solicitors should not act as the administrator of an oath or receive a statutory declaration relating to a matter in which he or she has a direct financial or professional interest and they should always go to another lawyer to achieve that end. That is ethical and I do not suggest it is redundant, but people dealing with agencies of the State, such as customs and excise, are in question here.Customs and Excise officers may ask questions on where the oil in the tank of a car or heroin hidden behind a panel in a recently searched car came from. If, in those circumstances, someone makes a statement indicating who did it or who was in possession of the car and subsequently writes a statement to the that effect, containing a statutory declaration, then that statement carries more credibility than a mere conversation on a bar stool in a pub. If the person understood that he or she was making a statutory declaration and that it is an offence to tell an untruth in such circumstances, then it will help a court to decide whether that person was making a formal statement, expected to be relied on by someone else, or was simply a self-serving white lie to get out of a difficult situation. This is the line that concerns us.I offer an example. A garda is interviewing a witness to a murder in Limerick. One of the people in the station claims to have seen AB stick a knife into the deceased. The garda asks if he is certain it was AB to which the answer is "Yes". The witness agrees to put this in writing and make a statutory declaration to that effect. It is entirely different for a person in such circumstances to recant than for a person to do so having simply made a statement to a detective in a bar.It can be an oath, affirmation or statutory declaration or it can otherwise be given in circumstances where the court is satisfied that the statement maker knew it was important to tell the truth. I can imagine a situation in the latter category where somebody, in the course of a video-recorded question and answer interview, says he or she saw person AB stick a knife into the deceased. The detective sergeant conducting the interview would then ask if he or she was absolutely sure that it was person AB, to be told "yes". The detective sergeant would then tell the person that on the basis of the statement, members of the Garda Síochána will arrest person AB. He would ask if the statement maker was absolutely certain or had any doubts about whether it was person AB or somebody else at the scene. The statement maker says that he or she is absolutely convinced it was person AB. In certain circumstances, if there is a record of it and if the court was satisfied from what it saw that the person really knew the import of what he or she was saying, that it would be taken seriously and would be a serious matter to send members of the Garda Síochána on a false trail, that clause could kick in.We are leaving it to the courts in the last analysis to decide whether a statement was made with such premeditation and formality that the maker knew that what he or she was saying would be relied on and that he or she had an obligation to tell the truth. Obviously, where an oath, affirmation or statutory declaration is concerned, there is an automatic obligation to tell the truth because one commits an offence if one says something false in that context.We must remember that making a false report and accusing somebody of committing a crime is itself a crime if it is done with malice or with the knowledge that it is not true. If one goes into a Garda station and declares that one saw another person commit a serious offence, that is a false report and it is a serious crime to lie to a sergeant and then wander out of the station, knowing that it will have consequences. The Garda Síochána will pursue people for so doing.The purpose of this section is to state that we must differentiate between remarks people might make by way of deception in order to exculpate themselves, to throw somebody off the scent or to impress somebody and statements made by people who sit down at a table and put themselves on the line by saying "that is what happened". It is in that latter category that the real scandal arises if somebody, having given a lengthy and vivid account of an incident in writing and having signed it, or it having been video recorded, says six months later to a jury, "I have no idea why I said that and am not standing over it at all". In certain circumstances, the jury is entitled to examine the original matter and declare that it prefers the original to what it is hearing in court.Senator Tuffy asked if judges would automatically strike down statutory declarations taken by gardaí in these circumstances. I would certainly hope not because there is nothing inherently unfair about it. It is just a degree of formality which exists. Statements made under section 21 of the 1984 Act are relevant in this context. For those who are not familiar with that Act, providing a witness statement is made in a certain format, it can be handed into a jury without producing the deponent at all, if there is no objection from the accused. It is not always necessary, for instance, to produce the garda who preserved the scene in court. If he or she made a section 21 statement confirming that he or she stood beside the body from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. until the State pathologist arrived and nothing happened to the body, that can be handed in to the jury. If it is tendered in writing, with a subscript declaring that the garda makes this statement, knows it to be true and that if anything in it is false, he or she will be liable to be prosecuted, should it be tendered in a trial, that statement becomes admissible evidence. There is nothing novel about that. Furthermore, that statement does not have to be made to a commissioner for oaths, a solicitor or somebody who is independent of the investigation. It is simply there and admissible as evidence with that particular proposition added to it at the end.I strongly suggest we should leave the text as it is. This is an effort to make statements which are intended by the maker to be relied on by other people and are made in a context whereby the maker knows that it is important to be truthful, and prima facie capable of being used in the circumstances set out in section 16.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	131	However, I have not signed a statutory declaration in many months. I am winding down my work as a solicitor at present but I could benefit from this legislation in the future.I still have a problem with this section. The Minister has referred to the 1938 Act which provides for different people to take these types of declarations. However, I do not think that the Act envisages that the people taking such statements would be directly involved in the particular case. The member of the Garda Síochána is involved and is probably the person to whom the statement was made. He or she is also trying to solve the crime and will be giving evidence in court. Therefore, he or she has an interest in the statement being made. That raises the issue of a conflict of interest and places a question mark over the statement. While the issue of ethics arises, the main question is whether the statement is worth the paper it is written on. It places a question mark over the statement and the person concerned can argue against it. Given that judges are former solicitors or barristers, I believe they will find it difficult to accept these declarations.The legislation provides that a person may give a declaration but it does not specify at whose behest. It is obvious that a garda would be looking for a statutory declaration to be made to back up a statement that has been given to him or her. We are all aware that problems can arise in such circumstances. While that is not true in the majority of cases, there have been problems regarding statements in the past. Statements given by witnesses can be problematic. I read the Dáil debate on this legislation and Deputy Costello gave the example of the Kerry babies case, where a sister of Joanne Hayes made a statement about events which was not true. It can happen that people who are witnesses, even if they are not the accused, can give statements that turn out to be untrue. Obviously, for people who are vulnerable, dealing with gardaí is very stressful. One must always examine a statement on its own merits.In terms of the statement and given what the Minister said about section 21 of the 1984 Act, what is provided for there is not covered under the Statutory Declarations Act 1938. It is not a statutory declaration, an oath or an affirmation, rather a person is simply given a certain degree of extra protection through the making of a statement. The Minister could have made provision for such a measure in this legislation.The Minister appears to suggest that the fact that a person would have to make a statutory declaration would make him or her more fearful of giving an incorrect statement in the first place, but the statutory declaration is given after the event. The person concerned makes a statement and it should stand on its own merits or otherwise.As to the provision for the making of a statutory declaration to shore up a statement, the process must be done in an independent way. That is not what the Minister is providing for in this section. He could have broadened the measure by providing for the involvement of one of a list of people such as a priest or a teacher. Such a person would be in a position to make the individual concerned understand that the declaration is a serious matter, the signing of which involves a formality. However, I am not sure the person concerned will take the matter seriously if the garda who took his or her statement then takes his or her statutory declaration, as if the person concerned is somehow removed from it. I do not believe such a declaration would stand up or be worth the paper it is written on. I do not accept what the Minister has said on this amendment.

At the moment, if a farmer calls the Garda to complain about such encroachment, he or she will be informed that it is a civil matter. The Minister stated that a person can only shoot on specific lands other than his or her own. This would cover the issue. The Minister went some way towards clarifying the matter yesterday but can he confirm that the gun licence will contain details about the specific lands on which someone can shoot other than his or her own? This would solve the current problem whereby a farmer complaining about someone trespassing on his or her land is told that it is a civil matter and confirm that it will be an offence to carry guns on other people's property.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Amendments No. 8 and 9 are amendments to section 30 of the Bill, which deals with the new section 3 of the Firearms Act 1925 and provides for the formal effect of firearms certificates. Amendment No. 8 proposes the insertion where the permission of the person has been obtained in subsection 6(b) where a limited certificate for a shotgun is being sought. In this respect, I can confirm to Senator Cummins that under subsection 11(a) of the new section 3, a limited certificate relating to land occupied by a person other than the applicant for the certificate shall not be granted unless the occupier of the land has given the applicant a nomination in writing for holding the certificate. Therefore, the person must have a written nomination from the occupier of the land.Amendment No. 9 proposes that a person who uses or attempts to use a firearm on land occupied by another person without the consent of the owner shall be guilty of an offence and that a firearms certificate can only be granted for shooting on specific lands or for specified purposes. Where the prior consent of the owner of the land is not given, no certificate will normally issue. A gun club occasionally has permission to go across lands which are not mentioned in the firearms certificates of the club members.A separate firearms certificate is issued in respect of each firearm and every firearms certificate specifies the conditions under which the firearm is to be used. Where it is to be used for the purpose of shooting over lands, the lands in question are normally specified, except in cases relating to gun clubs to which I have referred. Where a person uses his or her firearms for a purpose other than that stated in the certificate or on lands other than those specified in the certificate, he or she is, subject to what I have just stated, using the firearm otherwise than as authorised by the certificate. Under section 2, subsection (2) of the Firearms Act 1925, as amended, any person who has in his or her possession, uses or carries any firearm without holding a certificate therefor or otherwise than as authorised by such certificate shall be guilty of an offence.Section 27 deals with an increase in penalties for offences under section 2 of the 1925 Act. Under this new section, any person found guilty of an offence under section 2, such as using a firearm otherwise than as authorised by the firearms certificate, will be liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to €5,000, or 12 months imprisonment or, on conviction on indictment, a fine of €20,000 or seven years imprisonment.I have dealt with the points raised by Senator Cummins. It is not wise to make it an absolute rule that a person who uses or attempts to use a firearm on land occupied by another where the occupier has not given his or her permission for the use of a firearm is guilty of an offence. For example, if someone went on commonage beside his or her land and was not in a position to establish who was the occupier or where the permission lay, he or she might find himself or herself in a spot of bother. It might be slightly over the top to sentence that person to five years imprisonment on indictment for that particularly heinous crime. I believe the position is sufficiently covered.

The Bill as it stands provides a range of maximum and mandatory minimum sentences in respect of certain firearms and drugs offences. In deciding whether it would be just to impose a mandatory minimum sentence in all circumstances, there are a number of factors that the court must take into account, including whether the convicted person pleads guilty, materially assists in the investigation of the offence or has previous convictions for firearms or drugs offences.The Bill provides that these matters may only be taken into account in circumstances where a first offence is concerned. However, when the draftsman examined her handiwork, she noticed a concern, namely, whether it could be argued that the relevant provisions of the Bill as currently drafted could have the effect of not allowing the court to impose the maximum sentence provided for in respect of a second or subsequent offence. While they will probably never be construed in such a way, to be 100% sure about no one being able to argue that we created a loophole, the draftsman noticed this possible interpretation at a late stage.The amendments I have proposed make it clear that where second or subsequent offences are concerned, the court, while being obliged to impose the mandatory minimum sentence, may also impose the maximum sentence provided for. Where life is the maximum sentence, nothing in the amendment's earlier draft could be construed as stating that life was no longer the maximum sentence for these offences.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	144	On amendments Nos. 38 and 39, it does not appear that the paragraph would make sense upon removing the word "who". One could remove "who is" or there would be nothing wrong with leaving "who". If "who" is removed instead of "who is", it will read a person "is convicted of a second or subsequent offence" and lead into "shall be sentenced", which would be changed as a result of the Minister's amendment on the mandatory minimum sentence.Anything that clarifies the mandatory minimum sentence is welcome. On Second Stage, we spoke about the need to increase the number of cases in which the sentence is applied from 16 out of 76. We must know that the sentence is seriously taken on board by the Judiciary and I hope that any further reviews will show the proportion has significantly increased from 20%. Indeed, we could have the converse, that is, applying it in 80% of cases and using discretion in the remaining 20%.

In page 164, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:"197.—Section 13 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 is amended—(a) by the deletion of subsection (1), and(b) by the renumbering accordingly, of subsections (2) to (10) as subsections (1) to (9).”.Senator Henry asked me to move this amendment on her behalf as she must catch an aeroplane. I previously seconded it. The amendment follows the Minister's acceptance of an amendment in the Dáil tabled by Deputy Ó Snodaigh. There was general agreement that giving permission to the Minister for Health and Children to designate certain prison centres as mental facilities was inappropriate. Having accepted the amendment, consequential changes should have flowed from it but did not. The subsection in question is, in any case, rendered redundant in light of Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment.I was greatly facilitated by one of the Minister's advisers, who very helpfully gave me a copy of the principal Act. It may be helpful to put on the record the subsection being removed. Section 13(1) of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 states, "Where a person is detained under this Act in a designated centre being a prison, the duties and powers conferred by this section and by section 14 of this Act on a clinical director shall be carried out by the governor of the prison on the advice of an approved medical officer”. The subsection is rendered meaningless by the amendment accepted by the Minister in the other House. If my memory serves me correctly he indicated he might be in a position to accept an amendment of the kind tabled. I and Senator Henry would be grateful if that were the case.

As Senator Norris rightly pointed out, during the debate in the Dáil on the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill I acceded to a late amendment tabled by Deputy Ó Snodaigh and supported on all sides of the House. I assumed that there would be no consequential amendments but, when it came before this House, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, noticed that there was a problem and, rather than bring it back to the Dáil — the Bill had been awaited for 20 years at that stage — we decided to pass it and avail of the first opportunity to remove the redundant and offending subsection.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I thank all the Members of this House for the way in which they have carefully gone through the Bill, participating in a very constructive debate on Second, Committee and Report Stages. I thank individual Members for the amendments that were accepted, and for those that were not, which nevertheless were argued for with passion and in a constructive spirit.This is a very extensive Bill of almost 200 sections. It is designed to make our criminal law more effective but it is not, as I said on Second Stage, the be all and end all of criminal legislation. There will be more in the fullness of time and further reforms may be necessary.I am reasonably satisfied that all of the measures provided for in the Bill are proportionate and reasonable and will greatly assist members of the Garda Síochána in dealing with the new type of crime with which they are confronted. I refer in particular to the provisions on detention periods for investigations of serious offences and to those on firearms, which are of significant topicality. Other provisions relate to anti-social behaviour, the preservation of crime scenes and investigative procedures and there are general amendments to the criminal law which will be most valuable.I echo what I said on Second Stage. We live in a very different world from the one in which most of our criminal law originated. I was impressed by a speech by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, the other day. He said that, coming as he did from a legal family and being a barrister himself, he had regarded many things as immovable and unchangeable cornerstones of society. We now live in a world where we must revisit certain fundamental propositions. We live in a world in which it is not just hardened paramilitaries who stare at a point on a wall in a Garda station for 24 hours but 19 year old thugs and where significant efforts are made to destroy forensic evidence, such as by burning out cars and leaving the handguns used for murders in them.We live in a world where people who should be willing to be witnesses, because they see with their own eyes murders committed, suddenly become cold for that purpose. We will have to recalibrate our law to deal effectively with such people. This Bill addresses that to some extent, though I do not suggest it will be easy to achieve the right balance for the next generation of reforms.Criminal law is formal and painstaking and the requirement for proof beyond reasonable doubt is difficult but I take that as a given in a society subject to the rule of law. Equally, it is not a game of chess between lawyers. It is a life and death matter, the health of our society or its sickness are at stake. It is the difference between human rights being trampled down or not being trampled down.The criminal justice system does not exist as the private game park for lawyers but as the possession of every citizen as a bulwark against the invasion of their rights by others. I do not endorse everything that Tony Blair has said or done. For example, we in this country are fortunate to have a constitutional obligation to allow trial by jury, which cannot just be set aside for the convenience of the Government. Likewise we have a constitutional guarantee of trial and the due course of law, in which the Judiciary is the ultimate decider of what does and does not amount to a fair trial, by reference to constitutionally guaranteed values. Having said that, in the next few years Ireland as a society will have to revisit some fairly fundamental propositions if we are to be able to stand up to the drug warlords, the people who damage our society and those for whom life has ceased to have any sanctity.I conclude by thanking the Leader and other Members of this House for their co-operation with me and my officials in the passage of the Bill through the House. I wish to convey how hard my officials have worked on the Bill. They have worked at weekends and until the early hours of the morning on what has been by no means an easy task. The amount of work involved, even in preparing amendments to set aside the loophole identified the other day, was colossal. I pay tribute to those in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel who worked on this legislation and legal advisers in the Office of the Attorney General who gave of their learning to ensure the Bill was as good as we could make it. Finally, I thank the Bills Office in the Houses of the Oireachtas for all the work it did to ensure that our intention as legislators was translated, as far as possible, into good law.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	171	This is comprehensive legislation that deals with major crimes involving firearms, drugs offences and anti-social behaviour, among other things. It is an attempt, as the Minister said, to make the criminal law more effective. We all realise that Ireland is changing day by day. As such, our laws will have to be kept under constant review to keep ahead of the activities of the criminals. I am confident the Bill will assist the Garda in dealing with major crimes. Our attempt is to make the punishment fit those crimes and the Bill is a good day's work in that regard.I join the Minister in complimenting his officials. The Bill, with over 200 sections, must have presented major headaches. I also compliment the Bills Office and all the staff involved. We have worked long hours on the Bill. Above all, I thank the Minister. He has played an important part and taken a hands-on approach to the Bill. We thank him for accepting so many amendments, which is unprecedented. The Minister is prepared to accept a good idea that will improve legislation, irrespective of from what side of the House it comes. On behalf of my party, I thank him for accepting the amendments.Let us hope the Bill achieves what we have set out to achieve, namely, to give the Garda and all right-thinking people the tools to combat the criminals who are prevalent throughout the country and commit heinous crimes on a daily basis.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	172	Like Senator Cummins, I welcome the passage of this comprehensive Bill, which will have beneficial effects. I am not sure whether it was Senator Henry or Senator Norris who referred to the fact that balancing in the criminal justice system is always a challenge. In this Bill we have seen a rebalancing to the extent that it is necessary, including with regard to witness statements, which if withdrawn can still be taken into account by judges, which is a measure taken from the Canadian model. Changes have also been made with regard to drugs, where a loophole was used in the past, and in the area of organised crime, where provision has been made for an offence of participation in or assisting a criminal gang. All of that is very welcome.The Bill has been well thought-out. The Minister and his officials deserve great commendation from the House for the hard work that went into the Bill prior to it coming to the House. To be fair, the House has given the Bill a good debate. The Opposition parties tabled constructive amendments and the Minister on this occasion surpassed his own propensity to accept good ideas from wheresoever they come, which is greatly to his credit. He is a Minister with a very good grasp of his brief and the Bill. As an eminent lawyer, one would expect this of him but he also showed a disposition to amend and improve the Bill during the debate, which is to be welcomed.While we have gone some distance in rebalancing the law, there are many advocates for the human rights of the offenders, which is as it should be. However, we need to further strengthen the human rights of victims and society generally. The Bill is a move in that direction and I would like to think future Bills will take further steps in that direction so an even better balance will be achieved.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I agree this is a very important Bill. Every Member of the House supports the Minister in his objectives. Some of us had qualms about some of the approaches but the Bill will pass. I join my colleagues in thanking the Minister. He has taken a clear and personal interest in the Bill. He has been present in the House throughout its passage and did not hand the debate to a surrogate Minister. As always, he was completely in charge of his brief and was able to illuminate certain aspects of the law. I found it a refreshing and educational experience, and there were some moments of the light banter without which Parliament would be considerably impoverished.I join the compliments to the Minister's team, who have obviously worked extremely hard, and the Bills Office, which had to put up with amendments being fired at it from here and there during a pressurised time. I repeat that I received very gracious assistance from one of the Minister's team who gave me a copy of the original law which we were amending under Senator Henry's amendment.A rather nasty word, "resile", has slid into common usage from legal parlance. I do not like it and believe that most who use it do not have a complete grasp of its legal meaning — I probably do not fully understand it myself. However, I was glad on this occasion to see the Minister resile a little from his initially enthusiastic endorsement of Mr. Blair, for whom I do not have an admiration, despite his legal background. I noted with some horror that Mr. Blair said that the cornerstone of British law would have to be revisited. I hope the British people have the good sense to get rid of him before he has a chance to do any more damage to fundamental principles.I am one of the bleeding heart liberals and pointy heads — I make no apology for it. My friend, Senator Jim Walsh, referred to the offence of assisting in the commission of a crime. This is exactly what we have been doing at Shannon Airport. I am glad this is being criminalised in Irish law. I shall remember this when we come to consider rendition.

I congratulate the Minister and his team on the passage of the Bill. I thank him for the courtesy he has, as usual, shown to the Seanad, and for being present throughout the debate and answering all the questions. Even if questions were tedious and ill-informed, he was always courteous. I learned a good deal during the progress of the Bill. I hope it will achieve the effects the Minister, his advisers and the House wish for, namely, that crime can be fought and that ordinary, decent people are permitted the enjoyment of their lives as citizens of this country.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	176	Like other Members, I thank the Minister for successfully bringing the Bill through the House, and thank his staff and the Bills Office. We read every day of the shortcomings in trying to bring to justice those who flagrantly blackguard our laws. The Bill will go some way to addressing that problem and will help gardaí to successfully bring criminals before the courts. In that, it is a good day's work.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I thank the Minister and his staff. I am particularly grateful that the Minister will allow the Bill to return to the Dáil, thereby allowing Members to table amendments that could be accepted by the Minister, which he duly did in some cases. This is particularly welcome as it was not expected. I presumed we would be told we could not have amendments accepted because the Bill would not go back to the Dáil. I am pleased this is not the case.I would like to reiterate some of the points I made with regard to anti-social behaviour orders. I am in favour of the orders but it is important that we review the legislation and that within a couple of years we would consider introducing an anti-social behaviour Bill, such as that introduced in Scotland in 2004. If we do this we will consult communities. The Minister spoke about the NGOs and the "pointy heads", on which I will not comment. The Law Reform Commission does great work but often bases its papers on certain groups. The usual groups consulted make submissions while the views of communities are not necessarily heard. It is important to consult communities if this legislation is to be reviewed. People in communities have to deal with anti-social behaviour. It is not an us versus them situation. They want the young people in their areas to succeed and do not want them to be involved in crime. They want it to be nipped in the bud. People often say that if one does something about the young child who is lighting fires in the local park, one might prevent him or her from going on to commit worse crime. There is a positive aspect to anti-social behaviour orders because they do not necessarily criminalise people. Hopefully they would stop people from getting involved in criminal behaviour.Local authorities need to be given a more important role. They should have been able to get anti-social behaviour orders and we need to introduce this in the future. There will be teething problems. The Scottish legislation introduced interim ASBOs and we may need to examine that here. One of the difficulties found by the reviews was that it took a long time, numerous court days, to get an anti-social behaviour order. Interim ASBOs would be one way to address that. We need statistics on anti-social behaviour similar to those the Minister is building up on crime. We will need statistics on the ASBOs made, the outcome and so on. Politicians and people such as the Ombudsman for Children can use that kind of information for review. People may revise their views on how they work as a result.The Labour Party raised points with which the Minister was sympathetic. In the other House questions were asked about how to facilitate community fireworks and there is an issue there. We must address the fact that people buy fireworks in the North and use them here illegally. We must bring in a workable law on this. Yesterday the Minister mentioned reopening cases where a person is acquitted of serious crime. I hope the Minister finds a way of dealing with that issue. I do not agree with the qualification in the legislation on the age of culpability for children. The Minister should have stuck with what his Government introduced initially. Perhaps the child protection committee could review that. It is an unnecessary move and the Minister should reconsider it.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He is a just and decent man and this is a case of clear and flagrant injustice. I hope the Minister of State may be able to rectify it in some way. It concerns an interesting property on the Dublin quays. It is about the only early 18th century house left in that range of buildings. It is used as a post office and my informant's family has lived there since 1913, so there is a long family tradition. The Minister of State will be aware of the living over the shop scheme tax incentive. I was involved in it in a small way through the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. It was a useful scheme because it helped to bring life back into the city and encouraged people to improve their premises. This property was designated for the tax incentive. The family applied and in 2004 obtained full planning permission and a full, first-stage certificate from Dublin City Council assuring them that development was compliant with the objectives and the criteria of the scheme. On the basis of that certification my informant and his family borrowed far more than their income would normally sustain to fund the work. However suddenly, just after Christmas, they were told by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that it would not issue them with a certificate of reasonable cost, which is necessary for the application to be successful, because the floor area of the residential portion of the building was too large. I have come across this before and it is terribly silly. If our objective is to preserve these buildings and make it possible for people to live over the shop we must recognise that Dublin is a Georgian city and the spatial dimensions are different and need to be respected. To put this kind of qualification in, to fail to notice it until a person has borrowed money and invested heavily, is unacceptable.I have the name of the inspector and can pass it on to the Minister of State so that he can know this is not a wild claim. The application was submitted in 2004 and the inspector accepted that the costs were reasonable and that the work was being carried out to a satisfactory standard. However, after a site inspection in January 2006 he suddenly raised the issue of the floor area, although following a previous inspection in October 2005, no such concerns were expressed. My informant was placed in a false position. His application was properly made, he was told he met all the criteria and no question was raised at the initial inspection in October 2005. Yet suddenly, when he had borrowed the money and just about completed the work, he was told the floor area is wrong. Naturally the man and his family were surprised and devastated that this decision was made after they had almost completed the work and incurred the expense. In a human sense that is terribly unfair on decent people trying earning a living. The authorities had advised them to proceed. As full planning permission had already been obtained before the granting of the first-stage certificate by Dublin City Council, the scale of the development was clear. The council had the full planning permission, it knew the floor area, but did not raise it on foot of the drawings or the first inspection in October 2005. Suddenly when the money was all borrowed and spent, the council told the family there was a problem. That is not good enough. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government told them that while it is supposed to inspect the building before the work started, it often did not manage this and preferred to inspect closer to completion. It advised them to go ahead with the work provided they could justify the costs. It did not raise the issue of the area of the house or indicate that this might be a problem in any way.I understand that this case is completely unprecedented in its severity. No local authority has granted a certificate for a development which the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government subsequently refused to do. They have also been informed that no formal procedure exists for an appeal or review of the situation. I tabled this matter on the Adjournment because this is the only means of recourse to justice for these people.The building is a protected structure, the only pre-20th century building to survive on Usher's Quay. It dates from before 1730, contains elements of much older buildings in its fabric and is possibly the oldest building on the south quays. It also forms the only surviving element of a 1916 battle site as the original Nos. 1 to 4 were destroyed by artillery fire. The building has been in use as a post office for over a century and has been operated by this family since 1913.A considerable portion of the costs involved in the renovation was spent on structural works as the building was in a poor structural condition. This was in no small part because an elderly relative who lived there was reluctant to invest because Dublin Corporation had threatened a compulsory purchase order for a road widening scheme. The machinations of our city authorities have had a considerable impact on this family. I do not suggest there was any evil intent but this is an innocent family running a business we all need, namely, keeping a post office going in an area where it provides a community service, and post offices are regularly closed down. The family lives over the shop, an objective of everybody in the city, and is being frustrated in its effort to restore an important 18th century building.The building is laid out in a small number of large rooms, rather than the converse and that seems to be the problem. If that is always to be the case no Georgian building will receive this kind of grant and I cannot believe the Government intends that to be so. The accommodation comprises one single and two double bedrooms. Subdivision of the residence to create multiple units would involve the destruction of much of the Georgian and Victorian internal fabric of the building and replace the 18th century floor plan with cramped and oddly proportioned rooms.The family intended to restore the only 18th century building to remain on this part of Dublin's quays in the spirit of its original use as a family home. It feels it has acted in good faith and in reliance on the certificate which was provided by Dublin City Council. As the living-over-the-shop scheme requires that all qualifying work be completed by June 2006, it incurred the full cost of the renovation rather than seeking to make the work more affordable by phasing it in. As a result it is in a much worse financial position than had it never been accepted for the scheme. The family has not undertaken a commercial development but the renovation of a house where generations of a family have lived. If it is denied the living-over-the-shop tax relief it may be unable to sustain the financial burden of living in its home.This jeopardises the existence of the post office too. This is an awful situation in which people were misled into believing that they would get a grant. The family borrowed substantially, did exactly the kind of work we want and at a late stage the approval was withdrawn. I appeal to the Minister of State instead of penalising these decent people to attempt to find some mechanism whereby they will not be driven out of their business and home and an important social amenity for the community in this part of Dublin's inner city is extinguished.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	187	This tax incentive scheme was introduced in 2001 and is strictly governed by the statutory requirements of the Finance Acts of 1998 and 2001. This scheme involves certification of compliance with the scheme conditions, as opposed to the issue of a grant.The main aims of the scheme are as follows: to apply an integrated package of tax relief to secure investment and tackle the problem of vacant upper storey space over commercial premises in certain streets in the five borough areas of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford; to provide additional residential units in such areas; to achieve greater economic use of such premises with a view to relieving the pressure on housing supply, particularly for rented residential accommodation; to promote sustainable development patterns and assist in fostering a "living" urban environment in the targeted areas; and to promote more sustainable use of existing building stock and infrastructure and relieve pressure for green-field development. The tax relief is based on expenditure incurred by applicants on the construction or renovation of property which is located in these designated areas.A certificate of reasonable cost issues where the house meets the conditions and standards specified by my Department which requires, inter alia, that the floor area is not less than 38 sq. m. and not more than 125 sq. m. and the construction complies with the building regulations. Such a certificate alone does not certify that applicants are entitled to tax relief, as entitlement depends on compliance with other requirements of the relevant tax legislation. However, a certificate of reasonable cost or compliance is required as evidence of expenditure by the inspector of taxes where a tax relief application is made.My Department received an application for a certificate of reasonable cost under the living over the shop scheme, in respect of the property mentioned at Usher's Quay, Dublin 8, on 4 July 2005.

Prior to submitting this application the applicant would have received formal notification of planning approval and first stage consistency certification from Dublin City Council.An on-site inspection of the property on 31 January 2006, when all works had been completed, found that the floor area measured 180 sq. m. which is in excess of the maximum allowable under the terms of the scheme. A certificate of reasonable cost cannot issue in this case as, contrary to the conditions of the scheme, the floor area exceeds the maximum limit of 125 sq. m. If the applicant in this case wishes to appeal the decision of my Department in not granting certification on the basis of the measured floor area and has appropriate documentation to justify such an appeal, a further inspection will be arranged to establish if the property, as built, satisfies this cornerstone requirement of the scheme.I appreciate the Senator's point. The area as he describes it sounds interesting and one wonders about the various stages of this process. I did not expect to be in this House for another hour or two and thought I might use that time to clarify one or two thoughts that strike me as I read it. This matter has arisen in a parliamentary question in the Dáil but the Department's response is very definite. I will get a copy of the Senator's speech to try to tease out whether there is any doubt or wrong on the Department's side.While the Senator's contact does not want sympathy, this case seems unfortunate. I do not know how one can go about lodging an appeal or alter the space.

If the discrepancy in measurements were only 2 or 3 sq. m. the family might be able to shake that out. It is a long way from 180 sq. m. to 125 sq. m. The Department seems resolved that all the conditions have not been fully complied with. I do not know whether that should have been obvious at all stages. The earlier inspection seems to have been of a building only. Maybe the plans showed everything. Maybe the planning permission did not cover the drawings of the interior.The option of an appeal, provided it can be backed up with documentation, seems to exist. I will get a copy of what the Senator said. The Department has considered this and it does not comply. I will make some inquiries about it. The applicant, however, could prepare the appeal with the guidance of the relevant people in Dublin City Council and elsewhere.

I notice that in his prepared script he avoided mentioning the earlier meeting altogether. The objective of the city council is to preserve these buildings. The floor area requirement is a complete nonsense as far as 18th century buildings are concerned. I do not know how they can meet that requirement, but they have met every other criterion. They have also been misled. Is the Minister of State prepared to meet the family in question?

The application and the work have to be done in accordance with rules and regulations. It is not for me to wonder why the 125 sq. m. requirement is in place. If rules are in place, we have to comply with them. I fully accept that the person Senator Norris is representing might have had a legitimate motivation for what he was doing. The living over the shop scheme has not been a significant success, generally speaking. Everyone thinks it is a marvellous bloody idea, but they do not seem to be taking it up.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I appreciate the Cathaoirleach's decision to allow me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, for coming to the House to respond to the points I will make.I imagine that the Cathaoirleach is familiar with the location of Croom Orthopaedic Hospital. I would like to highlight the problems faced by two people from Nenagh who have come to see me to discuss their problems. They have been told by their general practitioners, to whom I have spoken, that they will have to wait two and a half years before they get an appointment for their complaints to be examined at Croom Orthopaedic Hospital. I saw one of the people to whom I refer in Nenagh this morning, before I travelled to Dublin. He is losing weight at such a rate that he will turn into a skeleton shortly. The great pain he is suffering in his back means he cannot go up and down the stairs in his house, even though the bathroom is upstairs. He is totally miserable because he is suffering severe pain. I find it extraordinary that he has been told that nothing can be done about the two and a half year waiting list.Having done some investigations, I have found out that no clinics from Croom Orthopaedic Hospital have taken place in Nenagh since last February, even though Nenagh is supposed to benefit from a clinic rotation whereby orthopaedic services are provided there every fifth Monday. However, that system is not currently operating because of a shortage of consultants.I understand some changes were made to the relevant rota following the retirement of a consultant, who presumably has not been replaced. It seems the matter is under review, although I hope the Minister of State will say a little more than that in his response. It is extraordinary that public patients have been told by their GPs, who are equally highly frustrated by the current problems, that they will have to wait for two and a half years.The second case with which I am familiar relates to a man who is not old, but is of advancing years. He is starting to wonder whether his complaint will ever be assessed and dealt with. It would be a very different matter if the people in question were private patients. I thought we had made a commitment to equality of treatment, but that is clearly not the case in this instance. It is nothing short of a scandal that patients in the public system have to wait for two and a half years to get an appointment. It is simply not acceptable. I hope the Minister of State will not just tell me that the matter has been raised, that it is under review and that something may happen in the near or distant future. I look forward to the Minister of State's response.I appreciate the Cathaoirleach's agreement to allow me to raise this matter. As we are aware, in recent times matters relating to the Health Service Executive or health in general have been kicked forward, which has been very unsatisfactory for public representatives. The HSE knows about this unacceptable situation because we all raised it with its representatives last Wednesday week.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I thank Senator O'Meara for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I will respond to it on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.The Health Service Executive is responsible for the provision of acute hospital services at Croom Orthopaedic Hospital. Having made inquiries of the HSE, the Department of Health and Children has been informed that all general practitioner referrals for orthopaedic consultants are currently placed on Croom Orthopaedic Hospital's outpatient waiting list. If a GP referral indicates that an appointment is urgent, it is reviewed by the consultant orthopaedic surgeon. If the referral letter does not make reference to the degree of urgency, the referral is assigned an appointment based on the available time slots. Referrals marked for the attention of a particular consultant orthopaedic surgeon are reviewed by the consultant and prioritised for assessment. Every effort is made to see urgent referrals on a timely basis. There are six orthopaedic surgeon posts in the mid-west, one of which is currently vacant pending the filling of it on a permanent basis by the Public Appointments Commission.The HSE has initiated an independent external review of all acute hospital services in the mid-west, to ascertain how they can be developed in accordance with best practice. The review will be completed by the end of the year, following which its findings will be published. The process of appointing consultants to conduct the review is about to commence. The consultants will be asked to consider and make recommendations on the options for reconfiguring and redesigning services, to identify the elements of health care which can be most effectively delivered at each site and to set out what needs to be done to achieve this goal. The report will allow the HSE in the mid-west to define more clearly the level at which services should be planned, give examples of how they should be provided at and across each acute hospital site and offer some practical guidance to management and clinical personnel. I emphasise the Government's commitment to the continued development of services at Croom Orthopaedic Hospital and the continued provision of high quality and safe acute hospital services to the people of north Tipperary and the mid-west.The National Treatment Purchase Fund is a health strategy initiative, the task of which is to achieve reductions in waiting times and, in particular, to offer treatment to patients who have been waiting longest. It has made significant progress in reducing waiting lists and waiting times since it was established in April 2002. Patients are now waiting between two and five months for the most common surgical procedures. Over 43,000 patients have had treatment arranged under the fund to date. Those waiting for more than three months will be facilitated by the fund in most instances. Some 470 patients from the mid-west region received treatment under the fund in 2005. At the Tánaiste's request, the fund established a number of outpatient pilot projects throughout the country in 2005. Over 4,400 patients received outpatient consultations in private hospitals as a result. As the fund is expanding the outpatient initiative in 2006, it has asked for proposals from hospitals in this regard.I have been informed that the mid-west region of the HSE will be commencing referrals for outpatient appointments for patients waiting for assessment or surgery at Croom Orthopaedic Hospital. I understand that up to 150 patients who are waiting for outpatient appointments at the hospital are being referred to the Bon Secours Hospital in Cork. If Senator O'Meara wants to pass on the details of the cases she has raised, I will be more than happy to follow them up with the HSE.

I will be happy to supply the details in question to him. I note that 150 patients are waiting for outpatient appointments at Croom Orthopaedic Hospital. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that is an extraordinary situation. When is it likely that the system of referring the patients in question to Cork will start? The Minister of State's response did not indicate when that will happen.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I am requesting the Minister for Finance to consider his powers through ministerial order to amend section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997. Representations have been made to me and other Members because the Act restricts the amount of money credit unions can lend to their members on a five-year and ten-year loan basis. Only 20% of the credit union loan book can be lent over a five-year period and only 10% of it over a ten-year period. Overall, only 30% of credit union loans can be granted for medium-term lending purposes. In many cases, the credit unions would like to reschedule some of their loans and grant a longer-term loan but are restricted in doing so.Money is available to the credit unions which could be lent to members and put to good use. Instead, the credit unions find themselves lodging that surplus money in banks and building societies from where it is lent to their clients. This must be reviewed. We are all aware of the success of the credit union movement. It has transformed the lives of many people and communities. It has done tremendous work through its co-operative structure since it was established many years ago. We must ensure the laws reflect current lending practices and allow the credit unions to help as many people as possible, particularly people whose circumstances may have changed and who may need slight flexibility in their loan terms. Will the Minister for Finance consider the request of the credit unions?
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I am grateful to Senator Bradford for sharing his time. I endorse what he said on this subject. We are all aware of the wonderful work done by credit unions. They have made representations to all sides of the House. The credit unions have a large excess of liquidity. However, they are caught in a straitjacket and their operations are restricted by the 1997 Act. We as legislators should be ensuring a level playing field. The Minister for Finance has the power under the Act to vary this arrangement through a ministerial order for the short term. A more detailed review is needed further down the line. No Member wants to see credit union clients being forced into the hands of moneylenders because of these restrictions. The Minister of State has a listening ear and through his good offices I hope he brings this matter to the attention of the Minister for Finance.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I thank Senator Bradford for allowing me the opportunity to contribute on this matter. I concur with the sentiments of Senators Bradford and Coghlan. All Members have been lobbied by those involved in the Irish League of Credit Unions on section 35 of the 1997 Act.In 1997, there were probably legitimate and understandable reasons these limits were imposed. Ireland has changed much since then and the credit union movement has grown dramatically. It has many thousands of members to which it provides a valuable service. The credit unions are structured to reflect the local circumstances of the areas they serve, whether urban or rural. They are seeking to have a level playing field with the commercial banks.The Minister for Finance must review section 35 to ensure the credit union movement is treated equally with other financial institutions in loan terms. A ministerial order amending the section would have a great impact on credit union members. Only 30% of the credit unions' loan books are limited to loans of over five years. That is a small proportion and, as a result, the credit unions find themselves having to invest much of their money in the commercial banks. As Senator Coghlan pointed out, we do not want a situation where people are forced into the hands of moneylenders because of the imposition of these limits. After nine years, it is time the Department of Finance reviewed the loan term limits.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-07-04 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I am dealing with this matter on behalf of the Minister for Finance. Under section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997, loan terms over five and ten years are limited to 20% and 10%, respectively, of each credit union's portfolio overall. These limits may be changed by ministerial order under the Act.The Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, is proposing a significant increase in the lending limits to 40% for five-year loans and 25% for ten-year loans. The ILCU's position is that the current limits on longer-term lending are affecting the competitiveness of credit union lending, as credit unions are not in a position to compete with the banking sector in one of the more demand-driven areas of the overall lending market.The registrar of credit unions in the Financial Regulator's office is opposed to any change in the lending limits at this time, primarily because of the danger of increased credit risk. He is of the view that underwriting skills are weak in many credit unions and, in that respect, points out that loan arrears and bad debt provisions in the movement are rising. In his view, the capacity of credit unions as a whole to manage the inherent risks arising from longer-term lending is not sufficiently developed to permit such a substantial increase in long-term lending.The Minister for Finance recognises the concerns of the credit union movement on the current constraints on longer-term lending in circumstances that an increasing share of the savings of credit union members are invested rather than lent out. In the Minister's address to the consultative general meeting of the Irish League of Credit Unions in April 2006, he noted the strong view held by credit unions that increased longer-term lending could make a substantial contribution to alleviating the issue of surplus investment funds. However, in considering any change to the lending limits the Minister must ensure that it does not lead to any deterioration in the overall risk profile of credit union lending. Ultimately, the overriding objective is to ensure the funds entrusted to credit unions by members are safeguarded.Given the divergence of views between credit unions and the registrar on this important issue, it was concluded that further assessment and analysis was required of the appropriateness of the proposed easing of current lending limits, balancing the requirement to support the development of credit unions and protecting members' savings. Consequently, the Minister referred the matter to the expert statutory advisory body on credit union matters, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, requesting its advice as to whether a review of the current limits on longer-term lending by credit unions should be initiated. The CUAC was provided with a detailed statement of the league's case and was also informed of the registrar's views regarding the risks of increased long-term lending by credit unions.The advisory committee is acutely conscious of the importance of this issue to the credit union movement and the recommendation of the committee is expected shortly.
