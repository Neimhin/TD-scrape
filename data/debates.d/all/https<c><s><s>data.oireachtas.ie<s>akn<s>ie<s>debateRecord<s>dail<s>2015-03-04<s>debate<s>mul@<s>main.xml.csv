#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	Yesterday evening we discussed the Estimates for the Department's spend, 52% of which is on housing. It would be no harm to discuss the issue and outline the means by which the Minister expects to meet the demands placed on the Department by virtue of the announcements made in budget 2015, Construction 2020 and the social housing strategy 2020. We are led to believe the housing crisis which has been allowed to proceed unabated in the past few years can be addressed, despite the fact that it has been exacerbated by the bank veto which continues in the legislation dealing with bank mortgages and which has resulted in 100,000 people being on waiting lists. The spend in 2008, 2009 and 2010 was 3.5 times the budget for this year and the next two years. Then 12,500 units were built, but the Minister says he can still achieve the target for this year of 7,500 units, not including the 8,400 provided for through housing assistance payments and transfers from the RAS. In going through the figures it strikes me as unlikely that we can increase supply. That is the big issue. Demand far outweighs supply, which is causing rents to reach exorbitant rates. With no major house building programme in the Department's proposals, there is a great danger the crisis will continue unabated. Will the Minister inform the House how he hopes to meet demand?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	Social housing is a key priority for the Government, as evidenced by the additional €2.2 billion in funding announced for social housing in budget 2015 and the publication of the social housing strategy 2020 in November 2014. The strategy builds on the provisions contained in budget 2015 and sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list. Importantly, it restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing. The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the housing assistance payment and rental accommodation scheme will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand. In committing to provide these 35,000 new social housing units, at a projected cost of €3.8 billion, the strategy marks a fresh start for social housing in Ireland. Under the relevant actions of the strategy, national targets for the delivery of social housing on a local authority by local authority basis are to be agreed for each year in quarter one 2015. This process is well under way and all local authorities have submitted delivery proposals, across all delivery mechanisms, for the years 2015 to 2017. These are being examined in my Department. Total housing provision in 2015 will result in an investment of almost €800 million across a range of housing programmes. I expect some 7,400 new social housing units to be provided this year. In addition, a further 8,400 households will be assisted through the housing assistance payment. The social housing strategy sets out an ambitious agenda for delivery and it is one that all of the key stakeholders and I are determined to meet.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I thank the Minister for his reply. In drilling down into the real facts contained within the figures we see that 2,000 leased units under the RAS can never become long-term homes for the occupants. Some 3,000 leased units are provided by the social housing agencies for which we do not have specific delivery plans on the table. They are leased units and the legislation does not allow for their occupants to buy them and call them home. There are just 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities. Local authorities are being squeezed out of the process, but they are at the coal face as they have up to 100,000 people seeking to be housed. They are the ones, the doors of which will be knocked on when the courts repossess the homes of those who have no option but to accept the bank veto rather than adhering to the intermediaries' solutions under the existing legislation. Demand outweighs supply and the Minister is not addressing the severe supply issue. All experts and stakeholders have consistently said the only way to address the issue is to embark on a building programme. As Deputy Brian Stanley said at a committee meeting last night, in the 1930s, 8,000 houses were built per annum by local authorities and the State. That is the sort of measure that is absolutely necessary to address what is a calamitous crisis.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I reject completely what the Deputy is saying. This is the largest social housing fund in the history of the State. The Deputy can check the statistics and will find that that is a fact. Yesterday we discussed at length the programmes sent to local authorities. All local authorities, including the Deputy's, have come back to me with their plans under the various schemes and the Deputy knows the figures because I have published them on a number of occasions. They give a breakdown of how we are going to provide the units provided for. Depending on what stage each local authority is at, there will be a mixture of building and purchasing because in some parts of the country purchasing units is probably financially preferable to building. This will not hit supply because the properties in question are actually available. We are also delivering hugely in respect of voids, with well over 2,000 last year and a further 1,000 projected for this year. This is an area on which I have concentrated. In the next few years we will be delivering hugely in terms of supply to ensure more people will have homes which they totally deserve. As the Deputy knows, 7,536 units will be delivered, while 8,389 additional HAP places will be provided.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	As the Minister said last night, many of the HAP payments represent transfers from the RAS.We could not elaborate on the percentages last night but all of them could be transfers from existing tenants under RAS schemes. Ultimately, the Minister's ambition will be measured by the record of success, when the year concludes, on the deliverability of what is proposed. I do not agree that it is the biggest house building programme in the history of the State. I will check the facts but I am sure I am on the right side of those facts. Local authorities, in conjunction and in co-operation with the Minister's Department, should be charged with the responsibility of addressing this issue. They should be providing and building new units. This is the only way to meet the crisis. Fr. McVerry stated this recently and he is not the only expert who has stated this consistently. The only way to address the supply issue, because of the demand, is to increase the supply. It will not suffice to increase the supply of leased units. There is a crisis in that sector also. Rents would not be at their current levels if this was not the case. The Minister is looking at the existing market to fulfil a need which needs to be resolved from the outside and by that I mean constructing units. Unfortunately, the record will show that there is only provision for 1,400 units and we do not know how many of them will be built.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	My interpretation of this will be adjudicated to be correct.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	I am happy to stand up to scrutiny as regards the allocations we have given out. I remind the Deputy that this scenario exists because of his party's policies. We have the legacy of Part V. Over the past years this provision did not exist because there was no development. This structure was one his party put in place. The ratio of transfers from rent supplements to new applicants in the housing assistance payments, HAP, scheme is 50-50. We are happy with the programme of work we have outlined up to 2020. Delivering on 110,000 units is a phenomenal target. There are 90,000 people on the housing waiting list. Many of these people are in key urban areas, which we will be targeting in the coming years. 
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	My question relates to the amount collected in local property tax, the amount of it which went into the local government fund, where it is supposed to be going, and the amount which was provided to local authorities. This is a key issue for people. People were promised many times in this House and elsewhere by senior Ministers and Ministers of State that the money would be used to provide for footpaths, public lighting, libraries, and parks etc. The Minister might outline the figures for me.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	The Minister for Finance, in the Exchequer Statement for 2014, reported that €491 million was collected in local property tax in 2014. Some €483.5 million from the local property tax was paid into the local government fund during 2014. A further €7.7 million was paid into the fund in January 2015. This related to the local property tax collected in the last week of 2014. The annual accounts of the local government fund for 2014 are in the process of being finalised and the Comptroller and Auditor General will commence the audit of these accounts this month. The accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and expenses are, therefore, matched with the related revenues and are reported when expenses occur and not when the cash is paid.  Estimated 2014 figures show the following payments from the local government fund for 2014: general purpose payments of €281 million; recoupment of local authority water services capital loans of €47. 4 million; payments in respect of group water schemes of €21. 7 million; local government innovation and reform payments of €6.6 million; payment to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of €372.4 million; payment to the Exchequer of €520 million; subvention to Irish Water of €439.1 million; and miscellaneous payments of just more than €1.6 million. 
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I thank the Minister for his reply. The figures he has given outline the problem with the local property tax. It is not what people thought it was and what it was for. The Minister has outlined that €281 million was disbursed from the local government fund in respect of general purpose payments while a further €359 million was also disbursed from the fund. As we all know, the fund is made up of motor tax, direct Exchequer funding from other sources and the local property tax. In 2014, the fund totalled €1.626 billion. For that year some €281 million was disbursed from the fund in respect of general purpose payments while miscellaneous provisions amounting to €47 million, €21 million and another €6 million, totalling €74 million, were also disbursed from the fund. This means that approximately €350 million was disbursed from the fund. However, this shows a huge discrepancy, not just in respect of the local property tax money, which shows there is €100 million which did not go into the fund. It also shows that more than €1 billion from the fund was disbursed in other ways. This is the issue. We were told in the mid-1990s that the local government fund would be made up of the road tax. The road tax was increased and we now pay higher road tax than our neighbouring states. It is much higher here than in the North, which the Government often references. We do not have any control over this as the tax in the North is set by the British Government.

We know the Government supported the Tory cuts last year because it wanted us to implement them in the North.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	We fought a hard bargain which was criticised. Do the Members on the other side of the House remember what they said last year?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	We will wait and see.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	There is no intention to misrepresent the payments of the local government fund. The fund has made a payment back to the Exchequer for a number of years. The details are published in the Estimates each year. Local property tax for 2014 is €491 million. As I have previously stated, it is unaudited and the process of auditing will now proceed. The estimated figure for 2015 is €440 million. I need to nail a myth here. Every cent of the local property tax goes to local authorities. Some 80% of it is retained locally. The remaining 20% is used in an equalisation scheme to ensure that local authorities do not go below the level of the previous year. I am sure the Deputy, coming from one of the smaller counties, in the midlands, will respect the fact that it is necessary to have such an equalisation fund and to manage the property tax in this way to ensure counties, with their various different issues, are dealt with in a fair way.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	A sum of €491 million came in through the local property tax and €282 million made its way to the general purpose payment. Some €359 million made its way from the overall local government fund, which in the current year is more than €1.839 billion. This shows that a large part of it is not being disbursed. There is a further €520 million payment in the current year made to the general Exchequer. This leaves a lot of room for manoeuvre. Some €93 million is provided for under the miscellaneous heading. The provision for direct subvention to Irish Water, the bit that is actually named, is €439 million. This shows that people are not getting what they were told they would get. The Minister and Commissioner Phil Hogan told us in this Chamber that Irish Water was going to be a stand-alone commercial semi-State company. For how long will we shore it up? Some €59 million in rates is being carried. The Government speaks about keeping money off the balance sheet. It moved €500 million in one section of the Bill enacted just before Christmas back onto the balance sheet from Irish Water. This is €500 million that is owed to the housing finance agencies.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	There are other Deputies I need to call, Deputy Stanley.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	This clearly shows that there is no clear accountability. The funding is not directly linked. A smoke and mirrors job is going on here with funding being moved around and not ending up where it was intended.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	The Deputy makes me laugh at times. His party would know a lot about smoke and mirrors and funds.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	Our funds are totally transparent.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	We are satisfied that there is transparency here in regard to 2014.The local property tax, LPT, was paid into the local government fund along with motor tax receipts, which was always done. A total of €281 million went directly to local authorities; €260 million was paid to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for essential non-national roads; €12.5 million went to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the vehicle and computer services division for the operation of that essential service; and €439 million was paid to Irish Water, which is consistent with the way in which it was done previously. A total of €520 million was paid to the Exchequer. Let me restate that 100% of all local property tax will be retained by local authorities in 2015. That is an absolute fact. If Deputy Stanley disagrees with the manner in which it is being done he can make alternative proposals, but I would like to see him stand over a situation where he disagrees with an equalisation fund that helps weaker local authorities and weaker areas of the country to maintain what they had in the previous year.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	Could I ask the Minister what contingencies the Department is taking for the possibility of mass non-payment of water charges; what plans are in place to increase funding from the State to Irish Water in that circumstance; and if an assessment has been carried out on the impact of such an occurrence on the EUROSTAT market test?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	As Deputy Murphy is well aware, in November 2014 I announced a package of measures to ensure that domestic water charges are certain, affordable and clear. In relation to the payment of charges, a range of easy pay options will be in place, including direct debits, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a paypoint or payzone sign or, importantly, a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of €5, which is a small amount, can be made. Section 4 of the Water Services Act 2014 provides that where a customer has not paid any water charges within a period of 12 months after the issuing of the first demand and has not entered into, or is not complying with, a payment plan with Irish Water, a late payment fee shall be charged by Irish Water, for each year the charges remain unpaid. Further legislation will be brought forward by the Government which will contain a range of measures to ensure that Irish Water will be in a position to recover charges from customers who have not paid bills. In addition, a range of measures will be pursued by Irish Water in order to maximise payment of charges, including robust revenue collections processes. The Government remains confident that Irish Water will pass the market corporation test. Ultimately, as the Deputy is well aware, that will be a matter for EUROSTAT, which is an independent entity.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	Was the answer "No", that the Minister has not considered the possibility that large numbers of people will refuse to pay and that will result in Irish Water failing the market corporation test and a major crisis for Irish Water and the strategy of off-balance sheet funding is falling apart? The Minister can provide all the options he wants for people to pay. He can make it as simple as he wants for people to pay but a large proportion of people will refuse to pay because they do not agree with the water charges and they see them for what they are, namely, another unjust attack on working class people, and they understand that mass non-payment is the central tactic that will sink Irish Water and defeat the water charges. The rational decision for people to make is that there are no penalties for non-payment until July 2016 and then it will be €30 or €60. It makes sense for people to say they will join the boycott because they know that no penalties will apply until after the next general election. They can be safe in the knowledge that if 30%, 40% or 50% of people refuse to pay, in the context of a general election that would be the dominant issue and any Government that comes in would be under massive pressure to withdraw the penalties but also to withdraw the charges. Has the Minister not carried out an analysis? Will Irish Water fail the test if 30%, 40% or 50% of people do not pay?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	We are very confident that the Irish people will work with us on the plan that has been announced. I was pretty disappointed that I did not see Deputy Paul Murphy in Killarney last weekend. Perhaps he was outside but we could not see him among the 400 to 500 people who were there. The reality is that people are signing up to Irish Water. We are very happy with the volume of people signing up and additional people are signing up all the time. I am amazed at Deputy Paul Murphy's stance. He believes in the right to water but I challenge him on the right to water for future generations, for my children and everyone else's children, who are and will be in this country in the coming 100 years and how they will get water. The Deputy also has a very mixed view of who should pay for water. I will put a question to Deputy Murphy. Has he met with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes of Ireland which has been providing water for the past 60 to 70 years? Has the Deputy been to Lissycasey in Clare where 1,100 houses are provided with water? Has he been to Callow in Mayo where there are 1,200 houses in a group water scheme, or to the Erne Valley in Cavan or Claremorris in Kerry where 1,250 houses are in a group water scheme? They have been paying for water. Why is Deputy Murphy not protesting outside their homes and their schemes on the basis that they have been paying for water for many years or does he need me to give him directions past the Red Cow?
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	Thanks a lot. Perhaps I should remind the Minister that his party stood in the previous general election on a platform of opposition to water charges. Any criticisms he can make about the need to have water charges will rebound on him and his previous position. Our position is clear: we are for the right of everybody to have free and quality water, I repeat, everybody in the State. We do not go in for the urban-rural divide the Government would like us to. Perhaps the Labour Party conference went to the Minister, Deputy Kelly's, head. I understand there was a motion from the Minister's branch celebrating his role as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. The Minister spoke about this being one of the best Governments ever. He is completely disconnected from the reality that exists with those couple of hundred people in a room in Killarney all slapping each other on the back. It is going to be awakened: the party will be wiped out, partly as a result of the water charges, and the Minister, Deputy Kelly's, future prospects of being a leader of the Labour Party will clearly be challenged by the fact that he is unlikely to get re-elected as part of the wipe-out of Labour.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	The opinion polls indicate that four in ten intend to pay, three in ten intend not to pay and the others say they do not know and they will be convinced by a campaign that advocates the way to defeat the water charges is through non-payment. Has the Minister seriously not considered the possibility that significant numbers will refuse to pay and what kind of crisis that causes for Irish Water?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	The Minister is to conclude on this question.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	Deputy Murphy can try to lecture the people of Tipperary but to be honest, I am sure they will not listen to him. I like the fact that the Deputy is predicting the electoral demise of many different groups, including my own party, 14 months from an election. That shows a level of arrogance that I am sure the people will judge. We are quite satisfied with the plans that are in place. I repeat again that we are quite happy with the number of people that have signed up. There is well over 66% now. It is not a rural-urban divide. It is a simple fact. Why does Deputy Murphy not oppose people in this country paying for water in group schemes? I challenge Deputy Murphy to respond to the question.

What did they say to Deputy Murphy? Did he listen to them? He has not even met them. The facts are that these people know the value of water. The facts are that these people knew they had to come together to deliver water. Can Deputy Murphy not understand that water is a resource that must be paid for into the future? We need a different funding model or else we simply will not have water in the area Deputy Murphy represents.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	My question relates to transfer of assets and liabilities from local authorities to Irish Water. The legislation that governs the transfer was passed in December 2013 for the transfer as of 1 January 2014. Could the Minister confirm to the House that all assets and liabilities were transferred on that date? If not, why not, and what liability has since been incurred by the State as a result of non-compliance with its own legislation?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	On 14 January 2015, I signed an order under section 12 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013. This order provided for the transfer to Irish Water of all underground water services assets previously vested in any local authority across the country. Further orders for the transfer of assets are currently being drawn up and I expect shortly to sign an order for the transfer of approximately 250 treatment plants from local authorities to Irish Water. Considerable work is involved in preparing supporting material for the transfer of over-ground assets from local authorities to ensure that the order reflects the precise nature and, in particular, the boundaries of such assets. The remaining orders required will be completed as soon as possible, subject to taking the time necessary to ensure that the assets are accurately defined. In that regard, I expect the process on the transfer of over-ground assets to be largely concluded by the end of June 2015. Work is under way between Irish Water and the local authorities on the identification and quantification of water-related financial liabilities. Final agreement on the liability to transfer to Irish Water, including financial assets, liabilities and debtors, will be by way of balancing statements agreed between Irish Water and local authorities. Again, this is a very significant exercise which it is important is completed accurately. The work involved is now at an advanced stage and I anticipate that it will be completed in the near future. In 2014, some €47 million was provided to local authorities for the purpose of servicing water-related loans, pending the agreement of an enduring set of arrangements for dealing with such loans. Discussions in this regard are ongoing between my Department, the Department of Finance and other stakeholders, including the local authorities. These discussions will be finalised as soon as possible.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	This again proves the point we have made from the outset, namely, this entire concept and its delivery was rushed, and needlessly rushed when one considers that no extra funding has been spent on the provision of water services during the four years of the lifetime of this Government. We were told that all assets and liabilities would be transferred. They have not been transferred because there was not adequate time or preparation put into that process. How many assets remain outstanding, and what value are those assets? What liabilities are associated with them? Are they specific assets that were constructed under public private partnerships? The Minister said that €47 million was provided last year to local authorities, and that is on top of the €500 million paid to the Housing Finance Agency. In what form was that €47 million provided? Was it part of the local government fund because local authorities were given to believe that they would have no liabilities or accruals in regard to their bills associated with Irish Water and with the assets? Is the Central Statistics Office aware of this? Our party spokesperson on public service, Deputy Fleming, has asked the CSO if it has been informed, for example, that all assets and liabilities have been transferred. Has it been informed or is it aware that outstanding liabilities remain which local authorities are being forced to pay?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	Thank you, Deputy. I will come back to you.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I am nervous that the local government fund is not what it says on the tin either because it may be the case now that the €47 million provided last year was used to pay these ongoing liabilities.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	It was never intended that the assets would transfer on 1 January 2014. It was planned that transfers would take place on a phased basis. As work progressed on the identification and the various assets and liabilities became clear, there was a need to ensure that loans did not automatically transfer with the assets. As the Deputy is aware, because we discussed it in this House, legislation to underpin this was passed at the end of 2014 to ensure that assets could transfer this year. The transfer of outstanding assets will take place over the coming months and the process is expected to be largely concluded by June of this year. A licence arrangement applies under the service level agreements between Irish Water and the local authorities and thus the fact that assets have not been fully legally transferred has not acted as an impediment to Irish Water from an operational or capital investment plan point of view. The Deputy asked whether the local authorities incurred additional expenditure as a result of this issue of timing. The straight answer is "No", they did not.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	The Minister said in his initial response that the €47 million was provided to local authorities to meet the liabilities associated with it.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	Yes.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	Was it from the Central Government Fund? How much will be provided this year, and will it be from the Central Government Fund because that is on balance sheet? There is great talk about moving the expenses associated with water services off-balance sheet. I might add that the €300 million Irish Water has borrowed so far off-balance sheet is two and a half times the rate it would cost to borrow it on-balance sheet. The public need to know that it will not be the Government that will be paying it. Ultimately, it will be the taxpayers. They are already paying more, despite the fact that they have got less with regard to the provision and maintenance of services. The records for the past four years will show, and the Minister can check them, that less has been spent in the area of water services in terms of what is under the ground by comparison to what went before. In total, €1.5 billion has been spent on the preparation for a mechanism that is being postponed for two years in order for the costs associated with off-balance sheet to be hidden. When the rates are so high the only way it will be compensated is when the charges increase. On the point I made-----
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	A question please, Deputy.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I will confine it to this. Last year the Minister said €47 million was provided to local authorities, and he said it again in his initial response, to meet the liabilities associated with the assets still on-balance sheet.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	Yes.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	Can the Minister tell me how much is being provided this year? Clearly both are on-balance sheet. Were they contained in the local government fund provided to local authorities?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	The local government fund is set aside, and I am happy that the fund will service the demands of the local authorities as set out in the Estimates we dealt with yesterday. Local authorities will not incur any expenditure on water service assets. In regard to the €47 million from last year, we will provide the funding for what is required in 2015 but as the Deputy is aware, assets are in the process of being transferred so loans will transfer as well. There are no hidden costs to the taxpayer. Regarding the Deputy's commentary on EUROSTAT and the CSO, they are both independent bodies. They have to do their own analysis based on the figures presented to them following auditing. I expect results from a EUROSTAT perspective in regard to its work some time next month.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	I ask the Minister to report on his reported meeting with the Irish Property Owners Association and, in view of rising rents and the homeless crisis, the plans to address the rent crisis affecting people. I understand reference was made at the Labour Party conference to something approaching rent controls but referred to as rent certainty. The Minister might provide more detail on that. Does he have any plans to increase the rights of tenants because the absence of a legal framework providing security of tenure for tenants is a major factor? There has also been some discussion on the tax treatment of rental income.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	The meeting which the Minister, Deputy Kelly, held with the Irish Property Owners Association was part of the consultations my Department is having with a range of stakeholders in regard to the development of legislative proposals. In that context, the association raised certain issues of interest to it, including the taxation treatment of landlords and the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations. Fundamentally, the main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market. The implementation of the range of actions under the Government’s Construction 2020 strategy will support increased housing supply. In addition, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 published in November of last year sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list. The report Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector, commissioned by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, and published in autumn of last year, includes an examination of rent regulation regimes in other countries and puts forward a series of policy options on rent stability for consideration. These include options in regard to rent regulation as well as measures aimed at increasing awareness of tenant rights under the existing legislation. The Government is monitoring the rental market closely and we are considering a number of policy options in regard to achieving greater rent certainty. The options put forward in the Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector report I referred to form part of these considerations. The Government's overriding objective in regard to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	The Government underestimates the seriousness of this problem. We cannot just decide to wait and build houses at the slow rate referred to in the Government's housing strategy. According to the CSO, almost one third of people rent accommodation.They are faced with rent increases of over 10% in Dublin in the past year. A recent report by the National Association of Building Co-operatives, NABCO, states that 23% of all tenants are afraid of losing their home. That is reflected in the calls that I get to my office, as I am sure other Members do, of tenants being bullied by landlords pushing them out in order to increase rents for others. The figures are worst for those on low incomes where 45% are afraid of losing their home. One third of tenants do not know whether they have a formal lease. Only 7% identify themselves as having a Part 4 tenancy. Action is needed on this now. Action could be taken and central to that is rent controls. We do not need temporary rent controls in certain areas. We need rent controls, as exist in many other European and developed countries, to limit the profiteering that is going on at the expense of generally low-paid workers.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	I assure the Deputy that the Government certainly does not underestimate the problem. We recognise that there is pent-up demand and we are doing what we can to address that. To do that, we need to adopt strategies. As I already outlined, the "Social Housing Strategy 2020" and the "Construction 2020" strategy address in a multifaceted way the delivery of more units for those who need them and to meet the demand. Unless we increase the supply of houses, rent will always be a problem in this country. The Government has already announced how it will invest heavily in the delivery of extra units. We are prioritising and front-loading the refurbishment of voids in the main urban centres to relieve some of the pressure and a number of housing projects and allocations will be announced shortly to further enhance that. The PRTB refers to rent control, about which Deputy Paul Murphy speaks. Research shows that crude rent caps lead to a reduction in the supply of rental units. We need to be careful here that whatever interventions the Government makes do not reduce what we all know is needed, that is, an increased supply in this area.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	In the real world, rent controls and rent caps do not lead to a decrease in supply. That exists in the world of neoliberal economists who simply look at supply and demand charts, but that is not how it happens. Landlords act as landlords as long as they can make an amount of money which can be made, including with rent controls. Rising rents are a key factor in the homelessness crisis. According to Mr. Mike Allen, 52 persons were made homeless in January as a result of rising rents. Threshold has repeatedly identified rising rents as the key factor in driving homelessness. On the question of an increase in supply, I agree that we need an increase in supply of housing in the housing market. What the Minister stated repeatedly earlier, that this is the biggest house building programme in the State, is not true when measured by houses, which is surely the only way one can measure it. In the strategy for 35,000 additional social units, 11,000 plus units are leased, that is, rented from private landlords, and almost 2,500 are refurbished voids, which leaves approximately 22,500 which will be built or bought, a rate of under 4,000 units per year. That is not the biggest house building programme in the State. It is a small housing building programme when compared to those in the 1970s and 1980s, when there were 6,000, 7,000 or 8,000 homes built in a year, or at earlier stages. That is not enough, neither is the failure to move on rent controls to deal with these crises.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	As I stated at the outset, the strategy the Government is currently pursuing is showing an increase in the supply of units. We expect that to increase substantially over the coming year. This is a multifaceted approach. Deputy Paul Murphy is correct in stating that we need to protect tenants when they are in their homes. That is why the PRTB and Threshold now have a protocol that will assist tenants where they are under threat of having to leave their home. That is working around the country. Also, community welfare officers have discretion, through the Department of Social Protection, to assist tenants who are under pressure with regards to their rent on a case-by-case basis. Also, the PRTB is currently undertaking a national awareness campaign with regard to tenants' rights because often tenants are leaving homes unnecessarily due to pressure. It behoves all of us as public representatives to ensure that tenants are fully aware of their rights and to assure them that they are protected as far as possible under current legislation. I repeat the Government is considering all options. We are looking at measures to introduce rent certainty but at the end of the day the housing market must be normalised so that we create stability and, more important, sustainability within the market so that tenants can remain in their homes at affordable rates.

We need to get them up and running in the near future. What is the position regarding the availability of funds to implement this programme?
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, published its report in 2014. The report contained 34 recommendations focussed on supporting the medium-term economic development of rural areas in the period up to 2025. I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs in July 2014, and in line with the recommendations in the CEDRA report, I immediately established the CEDRA Interdepartmental Group, IDG. The IDG, which is made up of representatives from all relevant Departments, is currently working in a co-ordinated way to ensure that Departments' policy development and implementation fully consider the needs of rural communities. It is about maximising the financial resources already available for rural development and ensuring that these resources are directed in a way that best supports the sustainable economic development of rural areas. That group has a work programme and actions, and those actions are time-lined for 2015. In order to maintain strong links with those in rural Ireland who are involved in or have a strong interest in the economic development of rural areas and communities, both the Minister, Deputy Kelly and I recently established an expert advisory group to monitor progress and provide advice in respect of the implementation of the recommendations in the CEDRA report. This group will be chaired by Mr. Pat Spillane whose determination and energy was critical to the CEDRA consultation and report process in 2013 and 2014. On the Deputy's query regarding the funds available to implement this report in 2015, the intention was not to allocate a specific budget for the purposes of implementing the recommendations of the CEDRA report rather to ensure that all relevant stakeholders maximise the potential of available funding streams to support the economic development of rural areas. There is much-----

#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	This is the most important job, in Deputy Ann Phelan's role as Minister of State, to deliver on. There is undue delay since the instigation of this report for which Mr. Spillane was appointed to go and carry out a complete investigation around rural areas. He held meetings in every corner of the country. He came up with some wonderful material. He listened to all concerned. Everybody got an insight into the real deep problems regarding the devastation of the countryside which has been largely ignored, except by the Leader groups. There is a void regarding Leader at present. There is a vacuum in the provision of funding for these rural areas and for all the entrepreneurs and various proposals that need to be developed. This is like a report on a report. This is a continuation of pious platitudes and nothing being done. I ask the Minister of State and the senior Minister, Deputy Kelly, to get stuck into this. Deputy Kelly has deep connections in my county, Kerry-----

#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	I can assure Deputy Tom Fleming of my commitment to rural Ireland. I come from the rural parts that we are trying to energise. I have seen, not just since this Government was established but over the past number of years, where these rural communities were completely forgotten and left abandoned, and it is now my job to energise those. The announcement on pilot schemes for the development of the rural economic development zones is imminent.In addition, the funding that supports the CEDRA report's recommendations is from the rural development programme and particularly the Leader element of that. Some €250 million will support enterprise, innovation and job creation in rural communities. I can assure the Deputy that I am determined to energise rural communities.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	I repeat that time is of the essence in this regard. We certainly need to get down to work immediately and deliver this programme, especially with the large number of investigations and examinations of all the problems and difficulties involved. The kernel of this situation is how much additional money will be allocated for CEDRA in order to roll it out in every rural community. What is the plan for the programme and how much funding will be available? There is a great need for proper financial supports to be put in place. Regional committees and sub-committees could work locally to implement this programme to the maximum advantage of those who require it.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	I assure the Deputy that rural development programme funding will be examined in order to support the CEDRA report's recommendations. That report has been allocated a budget of €1 million for specific innovation projects. The roll-out of rural development zones is imminent and we will be working closely with local authorities on local development strategies. We must align all that funding to use it in a targeted fashion, thus supporting community enterprise and job creation. Time is of the essence for me also, so we will not be standing around. In the coming weeks, I will be accepting expressions of interest in the rural development programme. It is all coming into play.

#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	My Department's local and community development programme, LCDP, is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State. It is being implemented on a transitional basis until the end of this month, pending the roll-out of the new social inclusion and community activation programme, called SICAP, on 1 April this year. In accordance with the public spending code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP is subject to a public procurement process. Tenderers have now been informed of the outcome of their tender and local community development committees, LCDCs, are in the process of issuing contracts to successful tenderers. The public procurement process was a competitive process that was open to local development companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that could provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new programme. Public information events were held at stage one to ensure that interested parties could apply. In addition, detailed weekly questions and answers were published and circulated to interested parties. The SICAP programme design was open to consultation with representatives of the community and voluntary sector, who were afforded ample opportunity to feed into the programme framework. Indeed, groups within the sector have commended elements of the programme design with respect to the underlying community development principles and cross-cutting horizontal themes. In the meantime, my Department has continued to ensure that LCDP services for communities in the Dublin Central area have been maintained in a co-ordinated manner through LCDP interim funding arrangements until 31 March. My Department has consulted with Dublin City Council to find a workable solution for transition thereafter.  I am glad to confirm that funding of some €0.6 million outside of, and separate to, SICAP is being provided to the Dublin central groups concerned, pending agreement with Dublin City Council and the local community development committee on an optimum delivery mechanism for the area. This funding is entirely separate to the €0.63 million which is being provided to the Dublin Central area under SICAP.

What is happening for Dublin Central is welcome news. However, a meeting with the Minister, who could have listened directly to those involved without giving any commitments, would have eased some of the stress and difficulty they have been going through for the past few months. I would reiterate that the areas they are dealing with have higher than national average unemployment figures, as well as bigger numbers of lone parents and disadvantaged families. In addition, there are significant areas of poverty and deprivation. We have massive housing issues because huge numbers of people are living in local authority or private rented accommodation. We also have open and blatant drug dealing on the streets. Community projects are dealing with those issues as they arise. What is happening for Dublin Central is welcome but it could mean job losses in other areas. It is regrettable that the experience of community workers in other areas could be lost. How long is funding guaranteed for the new programme?
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	Funding begins on 1 April with the roll-out of SICAP. I have met with the public representatives concerned, but when one is doing a tendering process it is not possible to meet directly with those who will be involved in the process. We have been through these situations before and I know the hiatus that occurs. I also know all about the uncertainty, particularly when one is dealing with communities some of whose representatives may not have great expertise in the tendering process. I understand the concern it causes. I have met with officials almost daily to take on board the concerns about these projects. The Dublin area is particularly complex but the Deputy can be assured that the Department and the Ministers are there to examine issues that might arise outside the tendering process. We have provided funding for particular projects of special concern, so we are certainly taking those concerns on board.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	The inner city did not have a partnership, so it was in a different situation from other areas. There are still concerns that community development is going out to tendering and is being privatised, so there is a danger that all the expertise could be lost. While we all accept we must get value for money, community development projects and programmes cannot just be economically led, they must also be led on the basis of social justice. Will there be unnecessary levels of bureaucracy with the new process? The projects are under considerable strain with the services they are providing to lone parents, including affordable child care, second-chance education, and training. They could do without the many levels of bureaucracy, as is happening in other areas. 
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	The big concern about the tendering process was that private companies could come in and win the tenders, but that did not happen. Some 44 of the 50 companies won the SICAP programme. I take the Deputy's point on the Leader partnership in Dublin. We are working with county councils under the new LCDC structure to see how we can address the concerns of people who do not fit into the SICAP area. We will have to deal with those matters as they arise. That is the only way we can do it.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	In the past few weeks Ms Elizabeth Arnett, spokesperson for Irish Water, has indicated that it has been cleared by the Data Protection Commissioner to seek the names of tenants from private landlords and local authorities to pursue people for the non-payment of water charges. Will the Minister confirm that this is the case and that landlords and local authorities will become debt collectors and boot boys for Irish Water? When can we expect legislation from the Government on this issue and the mooted plans to get people to pay?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. The occupier of a property is liable to pay domestic water charges and legislation provides that the owner is the occupier, unless the contrary is proven. Irish Water is providing landlords with the opportunity to prove they are not the occupier by providing the tenant’s name or tenants' names. I am sure the Deputy has heard and seen the various advertisements on radio and television in this regard. This will allow Irish Water to contact a tenant to complete the registration and bill him or her. The tenant will have to register with Irish Water to avail of the water conservation grant or have lower charges than the default capped charge, €260, where he or she is a single adult occupant or his or her metered usage is less than the maximum charge. My Department is consulting the local government sector, social housing providers and landlord and tenant representatives in the course of drafting legislation to give effect to measures proposed for tenants and unpaid water charges. Further details of the modalities involved will be available on publication of the draft legislation following Government approval and the completion of the necessary consultations with relevant representative organisations. It is important that consultations be held with the various organisations involved. Once they are concluded, I will firm up the dates for the ensuing legislative process.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	It is anything but a straight answer. It is all gibberish, with no clear-cut answers. Since the Minister referred to the advertisements, will he enlighten us on how much Irish Water is spending on them? How much is it spending on public relations companies? How many public relations consultants has it employed? That is another expense leeching off the crippled taxpayer. After all the multifaceted, sustainable and front-loaded consultation, what is the Minister proposing to do about this matter? A massive demonstration will take place on 21 March which will put to bed the notion that the campaign against water charges is declining. There will be tens of thousands of people on the streets. Many of them, the ones who cannot pay, not just those who will not pay, will be council tenants and people living in private rented accommodation on low incomes who already cannot pay bills. They want to know if the Government will have landlords and local authorities acting as boot boys, demanding with the threat of pay-ins, that they pay the hated water charges.

The Deputy is well aware of the penalties in place for those who do not pay the €30 or €60 in water charges. They have been trashed out enough times across the floor of the Chamber. For those who will continue not to pay, it is not right to insinuate that local authorities will become boot boys in any way. As the Minister in charge of local authorities, I find that charge inappropriate and unfair. The legislation, following consultation, will be drafted, put to the Government and brought before the Houses. It is as simple as that.

It is unbelievable. It is this flowery gibberish that glosses over the straight answers the people want. Of course, the local authorities do not want to act as boot boys. They were rifled for all of their assets which were then handed to Irish Water. Does the Minister intend to make the local authorities and private landlords the boot boys of Irish Water in demanding payment, possibly through increasing rents or whatever other methods they will be asked to deploy against hard-pressed tenants to collect the ill-gotten gains of Irish Water? What is the Minister’s proposal in that regard? We know that landlords and the local authorities do not want to do it. We also know that people do not want to pay these hated charges.

The Deputy cannot expect me to come into the House and know the exact cost of every single advertisement placed by Irish Water. The process will be that consultation will take place, the legislation will then be brought to the Government and before the Houses, like in all other circumstances. Decisions on the mechanisms to be put in place to ensure people will pay their bills - everyone must be treated the same - will also be put through this House. This will be the process in the current discussions. When the decisions are made, I will bring the mechanisms before the House. That is straight up.

The only straight answer we received to that question was that legislation would be brought before the House. That was not much of an answer. We could have that answer ourselves. Irish Water is providing different information for the Minister. In briefings it claims legislation will be introduced to provide in concrete terms that if tenants do not pay after one year, landlords will be able to collect the bill, plus fine, from tenants’ deposits and that councils will be able to attach them to local authority tenants’ rents. Is that the Government’s intention? It is what Irish Water thinks is the Government’s intention. How can the Minister claim that this means everyone will be treated equally? It will not. It is discrimination against tenants, be they private or council, as such punitive measures cannot be taken against those who own their own homes.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. It is the occupier of a property that is liable to pay domestic water charges and legislation provides that the owner is the occupier unless the contrary is proven. Irish Water is providing landlords with the opportunity to prove that they are not the occupier by providing the tenant’s name. This will allow Irish Water to contact the tenant to complete the registration and bill him or her. I do not understand why the Deputy cannot comprehend the following. We are in the process of ongoing consultations on this matter, but the Deputy wants me to stick my neck out and pick a date for when this will happen.I would be subject to more criticism by the Deputy if I was not giving this level of detail. There are many options available to us, some of which the Deputy has outlined in his comments on Irish Water. While every aspect is being looked at, it is clear that what we put in place will not be punitive. There will be many options for people to pay their bills. There will be easy pay options for amounts as low as €5 and they will be able to go through all of the different options in using Payzone outlets, An Post and many other mechanisms.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	Is there a no-pay option?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	There is no intention to be punitive in how Irish Water will collect payments. Let us be straight that the user has to pay, that tenants will have to pay and that the mechanism by which they will pay will be brought before the Houses following the consultation and having gone through the Government. That is the simple process which always happens.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	The Minister should be straight about whether he agrees with what Irish Water states in briefings to Deputies, that it is most likely that private landlords will be able to collect the money for bills, plus fines, from deposits, while councils will be able to attach them to rents. Does the Minister agree with this? Is that the way he sees it in pursuance of non-payment by tenants? He can outline all the options he likes and make it really easy for people to pay, but the indications are that they will not. Only 17% of tenants have registered with Irish Water. The Minister has used the overall figures to suggest there will be a high level of non-payment and the corollary must be that tenants are not going to pay water charges. They have faced massive increases in rents and are often low paid workers who simply cannot afford to pay water charges. They understand that - there is a mass protest on 21 March - non-payment will defeat water charges. If the Minister is in favour of what Irish Water states is most likely to happen, will he admit that it is punitive? Tenants who already face bullying by landlords, increased rents and very difficult situations are faced with having the money to pay water charges stolen from their deposits.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	110	The Government will decide what legislation is needed and the options that will be used to ensure parity and that people will pay their water bills. The options as referenced by the Deputy are among the many potential ones that could be utilised, all of which are under discussion, with various others. We have listened to many of the representative bodies, including tenant and landlord organisations, and are taking on board all issues raised. Obviously, organisations across the board will have different items to which they will want to point and it would be wrong of us not to take their views on board. When we have made definitive decisions, they will not be punitive in any way, shape or form. The Deputy might want to keep using that word to claim a potential victory, but I am quite satisfied that the options that will be presented to tenants in rented and local authority accommodation and all other strata of society as regards parity in paying their bills will be fair. Well over 66% of people have signed up, a figure the Deputy does not like to hear, but that is the simple fact.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	111	The Minister was so happy about registration levels that he said it was, all of a sudden, a soft deadline. Senator Lorraine Higgins famously declared on "Morning Ireland" that it was not a "drop dead" deadline. Such is the level of success in the Minister's registration rates that he has now gone for a fourth deadline. I do not think this speaks to his confidence in the level of registration. If it is not going to be punitive, does the Minister agree that there should be no discrimination against tenants and no ability to rob money from their deposits which clearly are paid for a particular purpose? There are cases of tenants being bullied into registering to pay water charges. Will the Minister make it very clear that no tenant should face punitive action from his or her landlord? Any threat of eviction, for example, would be entirely wrong in a case of non-registration by a tenant. That is a matter between the tenant and Irish Water. If there will be no penalties until July 2016, they can safely and comfortably join the boycott.

We are satisfied that the number of tenant registrations is on the increase and the process under way with Irish Water will deal with the matter. Everything will be done fairly.

As I said before, I did not have the value of a private education like Deputies Paul Murphy and Richard Boyd Barrett.

Amendment No. 1 provides clarity around the provision in section 12(4)(f) and adds after the word "been" the words "(whether before or after the passing of this Act)". The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel advised that in order to clarify that this provision applies to whether the person was a designated public official before or after the passing of the Act. It was always assumed that would be the case but for the avoidance of doubt, it suggested I add that. That is the import of the first amendment.

The Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 provides the commission with authority to delegate its function to staff of the commission.

#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	132	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which introduces a number of changes to the social welfare system, some of which were introduced in budget 2015. I acknowledge the work being done in this area by the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, and her Department. This Government is very committed to a fair welfare system which supports those who need it most and helps people come out of unemployment and return to work or education. Currently, social welfare payments provide income support to 1.5 million people directly and to another 750,000 indirectly. Total welfare expenditure in 2015 will amount to €19.4 billion. This Bill covers a number of areas and is technical in parts but the main element of the Bill concerns jobseekers and lone parents who are transitioning from the one-parent family payment in July. This is contained in section 4. For people who are full-time lone parents and are not involved in work or study outside of the home, there is no change to their payments, and that is the vast majority of people. Some 30,200 one-parent family payment scheme recipients will transition from the scheme on 2 July when the maximum age limit of the youngest child will be reduced to seven years. The majority are expected to move to the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement. Under this arrangement, the money will stay exactly the same. Lone parents whose youngest child is aged seven to 13 years are exempt from being available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment work, thereby reducing their child care requirements and giving them flexibility as their young children are being reared. However, it is proposed to encourage these lone parents to become involved in education and training. This will, I hope, help them to take up full-time or part-time employment when their children are older and are in secondary school. The Minister has introduced a back to work family dividend for lone parent and long-term jobseeker families with children. The back to work family dividend will also apply to lone parent and long-term jobseeker families with children who commence or return to self-employment. The qualified child increase, which is worth €29.80 per week, will be paid in full for the first year in employment and half that amount will be paid weekly for the second year. The back to work family dividend will be additional to any entitlement the family may have under the family income supplement, FIS, scheme and will not affect the level of the FIS payment. What the Government is trying to do is to focus on opportunities to engage in training and education because where a person leaves employment, the opportunities to go back to either education or training and the chances of securing employment are much reduced for people in their 40s or 50s. The critical way to improve people's income and reduce their chances of living in poverty and to increase the chances of their children doing well at school and finding a job is to provide a mechanism through which they are encouraged to work. What most lone parents want to do is go back to education and further training as soon as their family and household circumstances permit them to do that. We need to keep the doors to education and work open for many of these young mothers who until now have had the sole responsibility rearing young children single-handedly, many without any financial support from the children's father. At the end of December 2014, there were 23,366 participating in the back to education allowance scheme. For many years, the welfare system has been a political football kicked around by past Ministers whose only solution was to pour money into benefit rather than addressing the core issues that keep people trapped in this system. Finally, this Government, through the Minister, has introduced a number of progressive measures to encourage and enable a pathway to opportunities outside the welfare system. I commend the Minister for her foresight. I recently met a young single mother who has been given the opportunity to return to education. She told me this would not have been possible if it were not for the introduction of the back to education programme this Government introduced. She spoke of the confidence this has given her and of her enthusiasm for learning, and the future possibilities for meaningful employment. This Government's aim is to ensure people who go to work are paid well and to make work pay.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	133	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The main policy objective of this Government from the start has been the restoration of the economy. The Taoiseach has constantly emphasised that the best and most immediate way to do this is to get people back to work. At the recent launch of the Commission on Low Pay, the Taoiseach said that it is morally unacceptable for families of people in work to experience poverty. He emphasised that work should always pay more than social welfare and that no household with a person in full-time employment should be poor.For some time there has been a poverty trap that prevented people genuinely seeking work from returning to work. The difference between social welfare payments and minimum wage or low wages was insufficient. There were two traps. The first was income. Now, from April the Government will pay €30 per week to mothers or fathers returning to work from long-term unemployment for each child for the first year and €15 per week for the second year. This means that over two years a family with one child would receive additional support of more than €2,300 to supplement their wage. A family with two children would receive more than €4,600 and those with three children will receive €7,000. It is important to note that this extra payment will not affect a person's ability to qualify for family income support. The other huge poverty trap preventing unemployed and lone parents from returning to work was rent supplement. Under the old system, a person automatically lost their rent supplement when they returned to work. The Government has now also introduced the housing assistance payment. This will mean that those returning to work will retain their housing support and will only pay rent at council rates, as if they were in social housing. This Bill provides that any payment made from the back to work family dividend will not be taxable. For a family with three children getting €7,000 over a two-year period, this concession is considerable. The dividend will operate during the period of the economic recovery. This will be available to jobseekers and lone parents who make up or increase the level of their employment at any stage until the end of March 2018. There are also provisions in the Bill that will be of real benefit to one-parent families. Section 4 amends the qualifying conditions to the jobseeker's transition arrangements. Some former recipients of one-parent family payments are exempt from a number of the conditions when applying to the jobseeker's allowance scheme, such as the requirement to be available and genuinely seeking full-time employment. This will apply until their youngest child reaches 14 years of age. The dividend will also be available to people who are participating in schemes like the community employment, rural social, Tús or Gateway schemes. In the case of jobseeker's benefit and allowance, recipients must have been receiving a payment for at least 12 months. However, recipients will be able to combine the time they have spent on work placement schemes. One-parent families are exempt from these requirements. This Bill is to be welcomed. It helps make work more viable for many families. This has always been at the core of this Government's policy. Some 100,000 jobs have already been created. Another 40,000 will be created this year. Measures like this will help the Government reach its target of full employment by 2018. There is a sunset clause in the legislation: section 238F provides the back to work family dividend will cease to operate with effect from April 2021. However, work will continue under the Low Pay Commission recently set up by the Government. We must continually look at the labour market and the social welfare system to ensure that taking up a job is always a better option than remaining unemployed. I commend this Bill to the House.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	Among other things, this Bill will help promote the uptake of new employment and give increased support to lone parents to find work, while also helping to protect the Irish taxpayer from increased fraudulent social welfare claims in the future. The main purpose of the Bill, as detailed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, yesterday evening is, as section 6 outlines, to provide for the introduction of a back to work family dividend scheme, which was first announced in the 2015 budget. The back to work family dividend is designed to assist families in which jobseekers or lone parents are reliant on welfare in making the transition back to employment or into self-employment. The new scheme will ensure that if one is currently in receipt of jobseeker's or the one-parent family allowance, one will now be able to retain the €29.80 qualified child allowance for each child for one full year. One can also retain half this payment for a second year when one returns to work. Therefore, over two years, a family with one child will receive additional support of €2,324 from this new scheme. Families with two children will receive €4,649, while families with three children will receive €6,973. Those who qualify for the scheme will be paid the equivalent of any increases for qualified children that were being paid on their jobseeker's or one-parent family payment for the first year in employment. Half of that amount will be paid for the second year. It is possible to combine time on a jobseeker's payment with time spent on education, training or employment schemes to meet the eligibility requirements. For example, the back to work family dividend can be paid concurrently with the family income supplement and this will not be taken into account in the means test for this supplement. This ensures that the new scheme will provide an additional incentive to families over and above any entitlement they may have from the family income supplement or similar schemes. Persons getting jobseeker's or one-parent family allowance are also entitled to keep their current medical card for three years after they return to work. This acts as a separate incentive for jobseekers to take up offers of employment because they will not lose the safety net of having a medical card and it also ensures that people accepting jobs will have income supports during the transition from unemployment to work. Getting back into employment has the single biggest impact in terms of improving family incomes and the situation for their children. It is not acceptable, as was the case with the last few Governments, that people were encouraged to languish on the live register without being given real opportunities and real support for their attempts to find work, which will ultimately have so many benefits for their families' lives. The overall goal of this Bill is to make working in this country pay. Therefore, I am pleased to see that the Government has introduced this new scheme, which will make work more appealing for so many families. It will help to support many parents of young families and convince them that welfare is not a long-term solution to their lives. Another important aspect of this new Social Welfare Bill is contained in section 7 of the Bill. This contains new provisions aimed at strengthening the current legislation surrounding authentication of a person's identity when presenting for payment of social welfare. Although this Government has introduced a wide variety of new legislation since 2011, which has sought to tackle, head on, the scourge of social welfare fraud, there are still cases of this type of fraud occurring on a daily basis throughout the State. Section 7, in particular, will introduce new requirements which will distinguish between people presenting for social welfare payments on their own behalf and a person who has been nominated to collect the payment on their behalf, making it clear for post office staff which is the case on these occasions and ultimately providing greater clarity for all involved. Section 7 also introduces new provisions which will allow the Department for Social Protection to administer payments to certain vulnerable groups, such as the homeless, who may have difficulty retaining identity documentation. Section 7 also allows for the recording and retention of any information and documentation supplied for identification purposes at post offices, which can be used as evidence by its staff, if appropriate, in cases of impersonation and welfare fraud. This new provision in particular will be a vital new measure, which will be beneficial in the fight against those who seek to carry out welfare fraud.  This new Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which introduces the back to work family dividend scheme and new provisions to combat social welfare fraud, will get more people back to work in this country by making work more appealing while also reducing the amount of fraud occurring. It should be welcomed by all sides of this House.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	135	When we look at legislation from the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, in the area of social welfare, we must look at what she has done since becoming Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection in this Government in latter times. We must ask the basic question, namely, whether she has been good or bad.If she had been good, I would have been inclined to support this measure, but she has abandoned those whom she should protect; therefore, her record in the Department and as leader of the Labour Party is one of failure. Some of the Bill's amendments are welcome, but they do not change the overall picture of a Tánaiste with an abysmal track record that should be rejected out of hand. Anything that comes from her Department must be viewed in the light of what she has done since taking office. As part of the 2012 Estimates process, the Tánaiste, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, beside her, introduced cuts of €811 million for the most vulnerable. In the 2013 budget she cut €452 million from social welfare payments and in 2014, €372 million. The total cuts for people who needed money the most were €1.635 billion. I am not referring to a reduction in the social welfare budget. The number in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and other payments has reduced because the Government has forced so many people to emigrate, as well as other factors. The cuts of €1.635 billion are in addition to the savings accrued through fewer people making claims. Many of the cuts affected lone parents and women, in particular. I have never seen any Minister attack women's benefits, entitlements and incomes so much year after year as the Tánaiste. She has cut them at every opportunity, camouflaging it with claims of aspirations to having a Scandinavian-type child care system and that everything will be rosy in the garden afterwards. She knows that we do not have such a system. As part of her electioneering last weekend, she spoke about a second free preschool year. She admitted that we did not have a Scandinavian-type system in place, yet she has proceeded with Angela Merkel-type cuts to social welfare payments. I was intrigued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's comments on his party leader's announcement in this regard. On Sunday or at some point after the party conference he was asked on radio how much the changes would cost. He replied that they might cost €150 million and that the Government would have to determine how many hours were worked and what people were paid. They might even cost €300 million. He did not have a clue. He did not even know how well the single year system was working. He stated the Government would need to assess the benefits before adding a second year, yet the Tánaiste announced that she was proceeding with it anyway. An election is due within the next 12 months or so and the Tánaiste wanted to commence her electioneering at what was probably her last conference, but at least the Minister was less forthright in promising goodies that he could not cost. Thank God, we have such people. I do not often praise him and would criticise him at other times, but at least he had the decency to fudge the costs and benefits of a second year. We need extra child care services, but when a Tánaiste comes out with such proposals, we should be able to expect at least some detail instead of having them treated like an electioneering gimmick and headline. I turn to the legislation and will change tack for one minute. On budget day last October I heavily criticised the choices announced, with the exception of one measure which the record will show I praised, namely, the work family dividend. Fianna Fáil's proposals which we produced a fortnight before the budget contained precisely the measure outlined in this legislation. People should be encouraged to return to work by allowing them to keep their child benefit payments. I am a little conflicted between having my measure implemented and supporting the Tánaiste. While the Bill has good aspects, including this measure, she must be given a fail mark on the legislation overall. I welcome this measure but reject everything else. I will revert to the Tánaiste's track record in the Department of Social Protection. For a number of years, how cuts have been introduced to one-parent family and child benefit payments has been a theme on this side of the House. Maternity benefit was taxed for the first time. This was not done by the Tánaiste's Department, as it was a taxation measure, but it was another attempt by her to target expectant mothers and mothers with young children. That is what the Government has done time and again and, tragically, it is being done by a woman. People can draw their own conclusions from this. I agree with some aspects of the Bill, including the work family dividend. I have not gone through the details of the explanatory note on the legislation, but my colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, did so yesterday. He will table a series of amendments when the Tánaiste or the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, takes Committee Stage. I have a few questions that might be answered in the course of the Minister of State's summation or on Committee Stage, but I will ask them and the answers can be given as soon as they can be given. The Pyrite Resolution Board has been included in the list of bodies allowed to use PPS numbers. I understand the reason for this, but I have been contacted by individuals with pyrite problems that were so severe that they needed to repair the damage at their own expense. They are not covered by the board because they have already done the work. Some of the people involved are from my constituency of Laois-Offaly. They want to know whether there is any mechanism to address the issue of those who did the work without knowing about the Pyrite Resolution Board. Once the problem affected Dublin, action was taken in that area by the Minister, but some people beyond the M50 proceeded to fix the problems themselves. The work has been done, paid for and verified by engineers. The people concerned want to know whether they can be covered by the board. They would happily give their PPS numbers if required to allow them into the system. I tell them not to hold back in that regard. I will address much of the Bill in more detail later, but I will speak to a number of issues now, including carer's allowance. The changes to the allowance are a cynical attack by the Tánaiste on the women of Ireland. From our own experience of dealing with people, we all know that 80% of those in receipt of carer's allowance are women. The Minister of State's Department would have the figures. Was the budget poverty proofed? It was certainly not gender proofed. I am reading the words and see that the Minister of State is consulting. This measure is being proposed to "clarify that eligibility for these schemes is determined by a deciding officer on the basis of all the information" available to him or her.The Minister of State will say half of them could be men and half could be women but the majority of carers who receive the payment are women. If this allowance is not paid and the person is still providing the care, the carer will suffer the loss of income, not the beneficiary of the care. Over the past year I have witnessed the system becoming stricter. Doctors' letters and reports can be submitted. Is the deciding officer a medical officer? That is a simple matter of fact that can be established. I understand the GP marks the form in respect of the needs of the person and acknowledges whether the condition is mild, moderate, severe or profound. The forms are submitted to a medical assessor who forwards an opinion to a deciding officer. Up to now, there was a general understanding that if the medical assessor in the Department felt a payment should be made, it would be made. However, according to the Minister, in the interest of clarification, which means in the interest of cutbacks, the deciding officer will make the decision. It was possibly always the case but it is being provided for in this legislation to tighten up the system and to reduce the number of people who will be successful in their applications for carer's allowance. I suspect the number of people who have been refused as a proportion of the number who have applied has probably increased over the past number of years. I hope I am wrong and I hope the Minister of State can say what I have suggested is not what is behind this provision but as someone who meets constituents in my clinic and who has seen this form, I can only be suspicious of an amendment such as this. It will give power probably to an administrative official who has no medical background as the decision making authority on these claims. Hopefully, that can be clarified during the passage of the legislation. People living in rarefied atmospheres believe Members should not do constituency work or work on behalf of individuals. The Minister of State, the Acting Chairman and I would be of the opposite opinion. It makes us better legislators if we know what is happening on the ground. I will reiterate that for the intelligentsia and those whose intellectual view is that we should be in a little cocoon in Leinster House far removed from ordinary people having lovely intellectual debates and passing legislation without knowing the impact on people on the ground. Everything I have said so far has been firmly based on information I have picked up on the ground as an experienced, practising Deputy and not on research, a library book or university. I do not knock the need to have scientific and authentic information to back up our decisions but it is important that we know what we are talking about when we are dealing with people's lives. I am not sure what is being provided for in respect of the public services card. People can produce this card with a photograph on it in the post office. A previous speaker mentioned that some people because of various personal difficulties have a habit of not holding on to such identification. I was surprised recently when I was informed by someone in my constituency clinic that departmental officials are visiting old, sick people in their homes to take photographs of them in their bed for their new card. Could that be right? Will the Minister of State check that out? Provisions are in place requiring people to attend their social welfare office for the new public services card. I thank the Minister of State for the letter I received some time ago asking me to go to Portlaoise or Tullamore to have my photograph taken for my card, although I have not taken him up on the offer yet. I do not know if it was personal to me or whether every Member received one.

That is all right. The Minister of State will deal with the older Members later. Some people cannot make it into social welfare offices while others are in nursing homes. Is an arrangement in place requiring photographs to be taken in these cases? If so, where is the common sense in sending officials out with cameras to take photographs of people in their sick beds? I hope the Minister of State can tell me that is not part of the system. It sounds as bad as it sounds and I do not need to add to that. I refer to the section dealing with statements of recoverable benefits. This concerns illness-related social welfare payments from compensation awards made to persons as a consequence of personal injuries claims, which were provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 and which came into effect last August. This is probably okay on the face of it. I was concerned on first reading that a compensation award would be reduced by the amount of illness benefit paid to the claimant but I am pleased that the legislation provides that the insurance company must refund the equivalent of the illness benefit payments to the Department. I was worried that this inadvertently could have led to savings for insurance companies. If that was the case, I would have sought a corresponding deduction in insurance premia. However, following a more detailed reading, it appears where a policy is in place, social welfare payments made by the State can be recovered from those companies. It is sensible to integrate the social welfare payment entitlements in the same way the State pension and private pensions are integrated when people retire. Most people receive 50% or two thirds of their pension, depending on whether it is defined benefit or defined contribution. I will not go into that debate but a pension is normally linked to a percentage of their salary minus the State pension, to which they are also entitled. That is not covered in insurance policies and, therefore, people could receive a higher pension. It makes sense to address this. If it is a question of sensible integration of the insurance awards and the Department making sure the State is not out of pocket, I agree with it. Initially, the legislation was intended primarily to deal with the back to work family dividend but it has become catch all legislation. Having examined it in detail, it will tidy up a number of issues. An amendment will be made to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to ensure the dividend is not taxable, which is good. However, will the back to work dividend be considered as means for SUSI grants, medical card, social housing and rent supplement scheme applications? If so, we have a problem. If a person applies for rent supplement and he or she is in receipt of the back to work dividend, will it be considered to be means? The Minister of State might clarify this. The note from the Department states: "In the case of the exemption of income received by way of student grants, the current legislative basis for such grants is being updated in the light of the provisions of the Student Support Act 2011". That means there is an issue to be addressed and that may be done under the student support legislation. However, I would be worried that a mechanism will creep in under which the back to work dividend could prevent the sons or daughters of claimants going to a third level college because they would be ineligible for a SUSI grant. I doubt that is the intention behind the dividend but if it is, the Minister will have to amend this provision quickly. Will the Minister of State clarify that during the debate? I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute. I am not happy with the legislation and generally with how the Minister has handled the Department. We will, therefore, vote against her proposals.

Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Tánaiste as ucht an sár-jab atá déanta aici sa Roinn. In ainneoin na gciorruithe riachtanacha, bhí sí ábalta na bunrátaí a choimeád. Bhí sé deacair é sin a dhéanamh, ach d'éirigh leis an Tánaiste agus an Rialtas an cur chuige cóir a chur i bhfeidhm. Chomh maith leis seo, tá béim nua ar chabhair a thabhairt chun fostaíocht a chruthú. Tréaslaím leis an obair fhiúntach atá ar siúl ag an Tánaiste, ag an Aire Stáit atá in éineacht linn inniu agus ag an Rialtas. Is sampla eile é an Bille seo den jab iontach atá á dhéanamh acu. Molaim é don Teach. We currently have the best live register figures since 2008. There are more people at work in this country than there have been since the previous Administration left office in 2011, when this Government inherited a country in complete meltdown. There is no doubt that there is still a long way to go. The national rate of unemployment has fallen from a high of 15.1% to marginally above 10%. There was an annual increase in employment of 1.5% in the last quarter of 2014. This represented an increase of 29,100 in the number of people in employment, bringing the total to 1,938,900. I expect a net return of emigrants over this year and next year. The back to work family dividend scheme is introduced in section 6, which inserts a new Part 7A into the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. The intention of the new scheme is to help families to move from social welfare into employment. That is the whole philosophy behind the Bill and behind the work of the Government. I am especially pleased to see that the new section 238A of the 2005 Act provides that people who receive the one-parent family payment are eligible for this scheme. This is a very good incentive for people on this payment who are making the transition from welfare to work. Under the new scheme, lone parents will be able to retain their increase for a qualified child payment, which is €29.80 per week. I was pleased to hear that the new scheme will not have an impact on the family income supplement if an applicant is claiming a payment under this scheme. That is important. The most recent census, which was taken in 2011, found that 92,326 people were receiving the one-parent family payment. This represented an increase of 59,000 on the previous census, which was taken over ten years ago. There are approximately 2,700 lone-parent households in County Cavan, with lone-parent families making up to 11% of all households in the county. A study undertaken by onefamily.ie found that most lone parents perceive considerable personal benefits from taking up work or training. However, many of them feel there are barriers that prevent participation in this area. The study found that the impact of the withdrawal of secondary benefits and allowances, such as the family income supplement, would have a negative effect on the lives of lone parents and their families. The fear of losing social welfare benefits is a huge obstacle and disincentive to those who might attempt to go into the workplace. This Bill is a further effort to remove that fear, which acts as an invisible and psychological deterrent for many parents and prevents them from contemplating paid employment. Almost one in four lone parents works within the home taking care of children. It is startling that over a quarter of adults and children in single-parent households are at an increased risk of poverty. The figure is actually 28.4%, which is almost twice as big as the number of those living in two-parent households - 14.6% - who are at the same risk. As legislators, we have a duty not to ignore these figures. In light of these startling figures, I commend the Tánaiste for introducing this legislation, which will actively and responsibly support single parents who want to return to the workforce or enter it for the first time. I welcome the decision to continue to pay the qualified child increase in full during the parent's first year in work after returning to the workforce. A half-rate payment will be made for the second year of work. I was pleased to learn that if a claimant's employment comes to an end before the two years is up and he or she finds himself or herself back on welfare, he or she will be able to re-enter the back-to-work family dividend scheme. I wish to raise the question of child care costs with the Minister of State and the Tánaiste. I would be grateful for a response when one of them is replying at the end of this debate. I am aware that the Tánaiste addressed this important point over the weekend. It is unnerving that almost 52% of the net income of a lone parent is spent on providing child care outside the home. We should be doing something in this regard. I am very attracted by the idea of a second year of early childhood education. We have a wonderful exemplar of it next door to where I live. This great initiative, which is universally available, has significant effects on children. There is an ongoing debate on whether we should use tax incentives or a second year of child care for these purposes. Regardless of how we address it, we must do so because child care costs are a huge issue in contemporary society. I would like to see something done in this regard. It is important that the proposed new section 238A of the 2005 Act provides that a "qualifying scheme" is one of the community employment, Tús or rural social schemes or any education, training or employment scheme. It is important that people are encouraged to go on those schemes and are able to come off them in a cushioned fashion without feeling they are acting to their detriment in so doing. This legislation is about maintaining the dignity of vulnerable people by supporting them as they make the transition into the workforce. When it was introduced, jobseeker's allowance was intended as a short-term financial support for vulnerable people who found themselves out of work. The vast majority of welfare recipients receive the payment to which they are entitled and no other payment. Sadly, some people act wrongly in this area and engage in what is described as welfare fraud. In September 2011, the Minister launched the Department of Social Protection's fraud initiative. While we should be proud to note that some €669 million had been saved by the end of 2012, we should not be complacent. The Minister has set a target for 2015 of €510 million, which is staggering. There are progressive steps in this regard. I would be aware of anecdotal evidence of that. When people go to the post office to collect a payment, they have to provide proper identification cards. This is a welcome initiative. While I welcome the fraud initiative and the support given to people on jobseeker's allowance and the one-parent family payment who are trying to get into employment, I would not want the Chair or any other Member of the House to misunderstand my position and that of the Government. When we talk about eliminating fraud, we are not trying to get at people who deserve social welfare assistance. It should be a proud priority of the Government to support people who are in need. I refer, for example, to people who are unemployed through no fault of their own but are making genuine efforts to go through training, etc. It is important to support people who have various forms of disability and to support carers. All of these supports are vital and should be increased. I would like to see the carer's allowance increased and the respite care grant restored to where it was. I would like to see improvements in all of our welfare payments. We cannot do that unless we eliminate fraud and encourage people to work. Ultimately, we do not want a paternalistic welfare system like that which seemed to be perpetuated in the past. We want a person-centred welfare system that is supportive of need but is not paternalistic or patronising. Such a system should give people the dignity of being allowed to break out of it. The way out should always be accompanied by a safety net. That is what we are now achieving very neatly and with subtlety. It is important for us to advertise this scheme in the national media. I appeal to the Minister of State to take this on board. We must advertise it because many people will be unaware of it. A lack of awareness may perpetuate the fear of going into employment. It is a great scheme. We need more of this kind of thing. We need to support those who are in need in the fullest way possible. We should provide for a transition into work for those who can work.
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	141	I thank Deputy Joe O'Reilly for sharing his time. The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is welcome and I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Bill on the introduction of the back to work family dividend scheme, as announced in October. The scheme will assist jobseekers with families and lone parents in returning to work. It will provide those who wish to get back to work with all of the supports possible, which is of the utmost importance. Great strides have been made in reducing the levels of unemployment and figures released this morning show unemployment at 10.1%, which is a 34% decrease since March 2012. This is a significant figure for the Government to stand over but the fact remains that too many people continue to be outside of the workforce. While 90,000 jobs have been created under this Government, we must continue to work towards our aim of achieving full employment by 2018. The implementation of programmes, such as the back to work family dividend scheme, is essential in helping us to meet this goal. The introduction of this scheme, as announced in budget 2015 in October, further reiterates the commitment to getting people back to work and ensuring the benefits of the economic recovery are felt in every home throughout the country. The scheme of continued payment for qualified children, which provides that increases in jobseeker’s benefit or allowance can continue for up to 13 weeks after a person commences full-time employment which is expected to last up to four weeks, will be discontinued upon the introduction of this scheme. While the back to work family dividend scheme will not come into effect until the Bill is enacted, I am pleased that applications for the scheme are being accepted from those who have commenced employment or self-employment and from those who have increased their working hours since 5 January. This will certainly allow the implementation of the scheme to get off the ground and up and running. I note the Taoiseach's remarks about reducing the tax burden on the self-employed. Above a certain rate of income, the tax burden is quite punitive. We have still to take any action about providing a safety net for young, and not so young, entrepreneurs starting out in self-employment. They do not have any social welfare support if their businesses fail. Whether a number of schemes are available in the Department, self-employed persons are not entitled to social welfare support. That is something we must address. It is important to note that a person can apply for both the continued payment for qualified children and the back to work family dividend scheme for the period from January up to the enactment of the Bill. However, payment will only be made under one of these programmes. It is certainly positive that the Bill contains measures which provide for the payment of continued payment for qualified children up to the date of enactment, whichever is the more financially beneficial option, or backdated payment of the back to work family dividend scheme where it will be more financially beneficial. I welcome the extension of the jobseeker’s allowance transitional arrangements to all lone parents whose youngest child is between the ages of seven and 13 years, as contained in the Bill. Under these transitional arrangements, such lone parents are exempted from certain eligibility requirements that apply to the jobseeker’s allowance scheme, particularly the requirement for them to be genuinely available for and seeking full-time employment while the child is under the age of 14 years. Until now, only lone parents who have been in receipt of the one-parent family payment could benefit under the transitional arrangements. However, thanks to the Bill, all lone parents will receive the same supports under these arrangements, regardless of whether they have previously been in receipt of the one-parent family allowance. In order to facilitate the continuation of our economic recovery, the provision of assistance to lone-parents and jobseekers with families is an absolute necessity. I am sure the Minister of State agrees and I commend the Minister of State and the Department on the work in this regard. I concur with the remarks of Deputy Joe O'Reilly about the cracking down on fraud not being targeted at those legitimately receiving social welfare supports. The Minister is aware of one of the major issues I have come across because I put it on record in the Dáil by way of two parliamentary questions, neither of which was answered in a way that addressed the issue. In the case of a constituent of mine, rent supplement payments exceeding €6,000 were made to an individual but the payments were not passed on to the landlord. While the payment of such social welfare support was suspended, it was suspended for one week without investigation. I am positive no investigation took place because, if one had taken place, it would have been very clear to the Department that an instance of fraud had occurred. A rent supplement payment meant for the landlord did not reach its intended recipient. There has been no attempt by the Department to get back the money. The person has vacated that particular property but has moved on to another property and is in receipt of rent supplement. This amounts to €6,000 in one case and I know of another three cases over the past number of years. Individuals in receipt of rent supplement have not passed on the money and the Department has not thoroughly, or in my view properly, investigated the payments being made. The Minister of State is aware of this as I have brought one particular example to his attention and it is on the record of the House. Notwithstanding that, I compliment the Department on the work done to crack down on inappropriate payments, payments made to individuals who no longer qualify, payments in error, or when it is brought to the attention of the Department that individuals are in receipt of payments they should not be receiving. I compliment the Minister and the Department on cases where sums are being repaid because the figure amounts to a huge amount of taxpayers' money, through PAYE, PRSI and USC and everything else that goes with working in this economy. Any fraud in the social welfare system is wholly unacceptable and we must do everything to ensure it is eradicated. I reiterate points made by Deputy Joe O'Reilly with regard to this not being targeted at those legitimately receiving payments and the purpose of the Bill is to give more support families so that they can hopefully avail of one of the 90,000 jobs this Government has facilitated the creation of, or the 40,000 jobs the Government is hoping to facilitate the creation of in 2015. The inclusion of measures to allow for the recovery of social welfare benefits from compensation in personal injuries cases, and the clarification of the circumstances in which a person is determined to be in need of full-time care and attention for the carer’s benefit and allowance payments and the respite care grant scheme are important in terms of ensuring our social welfare system is as efficient as possible in supporting the most vulnerable and those in need.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Burton, for her work on this Bill and the Cabinet for announcing it in October. It will assist those who want to get back to work and, in doing so, save the State approximately €20,000 per person who exits the social welfare system. That money can go back into job incentivisation schemes, among other things, and social welfare supports for those who need it most. That is why measures such as these are so important for our economy and the society in which we all live. I thank the Minister of State for his attention and I request that he investigates the matter brought to his attention previously. It is frustrating when we can see something blatant like this and where the Department has not taken any action.I compliment the Minister and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, for his attention.

It must be remembered that family support in this country has been savaged over the past eight years. It took the Government a long time to wake up to the reality of the impact of this savaging on the poorest people and families in this country. While I welcome the provisions of this legislation, it does not address the issue of low paid employment. Low paid employment has a very damaging effect, not only on those in receipt of the low wages but on wider society and the economy. It is widening the gap between the wealthy and the poor in this country. Shamefully, we have the highest rate of low paid employment in Europe. If, as legislators, we cannot change this, we should not be here. A proliferation of our workers are employed on a part-time basis by way of the detestable zero-hour contracts. These contracts continue to be utilised by employers for their benefit and against the best interests of workers and their families. More than 100 years ago James Larkin marched on the streets of Dublin against zero-hour contracts. As we approach the centenary of 1916 hundreds and thousands of our workers are on zero-hour contracts. It is an indictment of Government and of the trade union movement that this reprehensible practice is allowed to continue.  Instead of creating real employment with real wages for young people this Government established the bogus JobBridge scheme. What this has led to is free employment for unscrupulous employers. It is a form of slavery. Unscrupulous employers are taking advantage of this scheme, under which employees are being paid €50 on top of their social welfare entitlement on the basis of their being trained for something better. Participation in this scheme is not optional. People who refuse to participate lose their social welfare entitlement.

People are being told that if they do not participate in the scheme their entitlements will be called into question. It is a national scandal that must be condemned and stopped. Under JobBridge restaurants are taking on people to wash dishes; garages are taking on people to wash cars and pubs are taking on people to wash down tables and collect glasses. Is that training? Not only is this an abuse of people, in the main young people, but it is damaging the prospect for real jobs in the economy. That is the scandal. These are people who should be in real jobs and paid decent wages. More than one third of workers in this country will be paid less than €20,000 this year. How can we expect people to keep a roof over their heads, put their children through school, put food on the table and keep homes warm and secure when more than one third of people in employment here will earn less than €20,000 this year? To put this in perspective, €20,000 is one eighth of what a Minister can expect to earn this year.  The Government must implement a strategy to tackle low pay in Ireland and bring about real change in the lives of the many people who fall into the low paid worker bracket. Increasing pay for low paid workers would have an immediate and direct benefit on the Irish economy. Increasing the purchasing power of people will in itself create more jobs. That is the way it works. It is what the economists tell us. The money earned by low paid workers is money that will be spent in this country. Low paid workers are not the people who will be buying property abroad. They will spend their earnings in their local economy. While this Bill is welcome, more needs to be done to address the plight of those earning low wages in Ireland. Another issue that needs to be addressed, although it may not be necessarily relevant to this Bill, is the number of income maintenance schemes in place here. The last time I checked there were approximately 57 of them. We could be paying more to people who need it if the income maintenance structure here was restructured. People in receipt of income maintenance and income support cheques are concerned not with how that payment is described but the amount they are being paid. A rationalisation of this process would allow for payment of considerably more to people dependent on income maintenance, and from within the same budget. Should this be considered? Our objective must be payment of decent support to people dependent on it and to do this as efficiently and effectively as we can. We must also ensure that people who are working can have a decent standard of living, so that they do not have to be continually worrying about from where the next penny will come to meet the cost of heating their homes, feeding their children and putting them through school. This Bill goes some way towards this but there is so much more that needs to be done. I think the Minister of State knows that.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	148	I raise the question of how we are treating elderly people in our hospital system and the complete absence of dignity in such treatment. We were all appalled last week when we heard the story of Gerry Feeney, who spent more than five days in the emergency department in Beaumont and was denied the basics of daily living, such as eating, dressing, bathing and getting out of bed, when he was moved to the geriatric ward. Essentially, there was an absence of dignity at the end stage of his life. A number of us have come across an extraordinary letter written by a specialist registrar in emergency medicine in Beaumont hospital, some of which was reported in the media this morning. This individual, who has experience in many hospitals across the country, wrote that the emergency department at Beaumont is unequivocally the most dangerous unit in which he worked. He described it as a poor starting point that critically unwell patients, who have the misfortune to need acute unscheduled care, have their care delivered on chairs. Similarly, he could not fathom how patients on trolleys in front of the nurses' station could ever be regarded as an acceptable solution. He suggested that exposing these patients to sleep deprivation over a period of 24 to 48 hours in a noisy and chaotic emergency department is the equivalent of a health care Guantanamo. He has regularly witnessed elderly patients actively deteriorating and developing delirium during their time in this no-man's land. He thought it a sad indictment of the system that such practices form an accepted part of the day-to-day operation of emergency care in the hospital. He also made a number of disturbing points about heart-breaking apologetic conversations with patients. While he pointed out that there is a need for a change of culture in Beaumont, I put it to the Taoiseach that last week the Minister for Health stated unequivocally to the Joint Committee on Health and Children that he needed more resources for the fair deal scheme, home care packages and home help provision for elderly people. We are aware of the link between delayed discharges and the chaos in emergency departments across the country, particularly in Beaumont.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	153	The Minister commented on the case of Mr. Feeney and the situation that arose in regard to him. This is not the first time I have seen letters from medical personnel working in hospitals. We had many cases over the years of doctors, consultants and specialists writing letters about the difficulties in the health system. It is not an acceptable situation. The Minister responded to the issue this morning on national radio. He has established a task force to deal with delayed discharges and the situation that has arisen in a number of hospitals, some of which have traditionally been worse than others in the sense of being able to deal with delayed discharges and beds being blocked. The Minister has pointed out that when he worked as a young doctor in Beaumont hospital, the situation was equally bad even though it was a time when there was a lot more money. That is not to say the situation is in any way acceptable, however, and for that reason the emergency task force dealing with the question of delayed discharges and access to further beds is critical. As Deputy Martin pointed out, there is clearly a link between people who have had treatment in hospitals, the insufficient availability of accommodation for them and delayed discharges. The result is that back-ups build at the point at which people require admissions. The prioritisation of home care services for those who require discharge to their own homes is one area. In regard to the provision of transfer care beds, the HSE has approved more than 1,000 places across the country since 6 January 2015. It is also in the process of opening a number of public beds across the country. Some 173 are being targeted and community health care organisations are currently sourcing staff and making arrangements to deal with this as quickly as possible.

Twenty beds are available in the Royal Hospital Donnybrook on a temporary basis, with five currently open. In Ballinasloe, County Galway, work is underway to commission additional beds, to a maximum of 25 in this unit. In Merlin Park in Galway city, five additional beds were opened last week. In Ballina District Hospital, there is potential to open ten beds, with five targeted immediately.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	The Taoiseach said that the situation is not "satisfactory". That is a mild word given the content of the letter from the specialist registrar and the experience of people attending emergency departments. The Minister for Health told the Joint Committee on Health and Children last week that additional resources are needed for the fair deal scheme. He outlined two realistic options, namely, reprioritising spending or bringing forward a spending plan later this year. He also outlined a third, pretending the problem will go away in the summer, which he indicated is not really an option. The latter is a total nonsense which few people believe. This is the same man who three months ago said he had a realistic budget and expressed the hope that matters would become more manageable in October, particularly for those working at the front line. How naive was he last October? The bottom line is that matters have not become more manageable; they have become worse, as the Minister himself has acknowledged. Yesterday he agreed it is undeniable that the system is struggling. The Taoiseach can sort this out.

Does the Taoiseach accept that the funding levels are not adequate to deal with this situation in the coming months, including in respect of delayed discharges and their impact on emergency departments, to take people out of their misery and bring some dignity back? Funding is part of the answer to that. The Minister has said as much. Will the Taoiseach now take the decision, as Head of Government, to do something about it?

The HSE submitted its service plan which is now being implemented. Clearly, there are challenges in that, which is why the Minister established the task force to look at the fair deal scheme, the review of which is being brought to him very shortly, and at the question of opening 1,000 beds across the country to deal with delayed discharges so people who are treated in hospital have the opportunity to have suitable accommodation and beds made available while they recuperate.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	The number of citizens lying on trolleys in hospitals this morning stands at 520. Within my constituency, there are 40 people on trolleys in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. Conditions in the emergency department at Beaumont Hospital are now so bad that a senior emergency department doctor in a letter to hospital management and the HSE described them as the equivalent of health-care Guantanamo. According to Eilish O'Regan in the Irish Independent this morning, the letter was written in December and prior to the escalation of the current crisis. The doctor says that critically ill patients are receiving blood transfusions on chairs and heart attack patients are regularly treated on chairs. He struggled to get a trolley for a man with liver failure while two patients with advanced cancer were doomed to sit on chairs for 24 hours. He had to resuscitate a patient who suffered a cardiac arrest after being placed in an annex corridor. A HSE report shows that there are 705 hospital patients who no longer need to be in hospital. They should be discharged to nursing homes, rehabilitation beds or their own houses with home care packages. However, the Government will not put the money into that. Age Action Ireland has described these patients as prisoners of the State. Will the Government now prioritise a solution to this crisis by immediately increasing the number of step-down beds and ensuring the fair deal scheme is adequately funded? Will the Taoiseach speed up funding for house adaptations and home help packages?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	173	I have already read out details on some of the 1,000 extra beds that are being opened across the country and set out the fact that the Minister is awaiting the finalised review report in respect of fair deal. The number of elderly people over 65 years of age this year is 604,000 and that will rise by 100,000 in the next five years to over 700,000. A task force has been established by the Minister to look at the question of delayed discharges and step-down facilities and the issue is being addressed through the opening of 1,000 beds nationally. As I said to Deputy Martin, this is not the first time we have had letters written by senior medical personnel about the conditions they find in hospitals. Even if one had the money to allocate in the morning, one would still have a problem with the range of available accommodation, which is acutely a problem at Our Lady of Lourdes and the general region there. To deal with delayed discharges, we are opening 1,000 beds, but clearly there are challenges at which the task force is looking. This is the first year in a number of years that there has been an increased allocation in the health Vote and rightly so. The health service plan submitted by the HSE is being implemented. Trolley numbers are generally higher in the morning. The Minister commented on that this morning. Generally, they reduce substantially during the course of the day and go back up again during the night period. This is a matter that is being focused on as an absolute priority by the task force set up by the Minister and I hope it can be managed effectively in patients' interests in the time ahead.

The audit report also found that a former retired employee was rehired on a contract of six hours per week for a salary of €156,000. That should be compared with the plight of those citizens who are prevented from going home because the Government cannot give them the financial support for a home care package or basics like a grab rail or other appliances. It is little wonder that people are angry or cynical when they hear the Taoiseach and his health Minister. The Government allocated a mere €25 million towards extra nursing home beds under the fair deal scheme. In my constituency, the Government closed public beds.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	180	Cuirim an cheist anois. The Tánaiste is telling us that a recovery in public finances means the Government will make long-term investment, but there has not been one word about the hospital crisis or the 24,369 patients who are awaiting elective surgery for more than six months. Contrary to what the Taoiseach claims, his Minister did not respond to this matter this morning. He waltzes on as if he were a health commentator or a spectator.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	182	Let us focus on a solution. The current health budget is entirely unrealistic and insufficient to deal with the crisis. Getting medically discharged patients home or into nursing beds will relieve all of that by giving them the protections they deserve as citizens. I ask the Taoiseach to refrain from smart alec remarks and to try to deal with a solution to resolve this problem. For once, the Taoiseach should be a problem solver.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	183	I thank Deputy Adams. Yesterday, he commented that the solution to water was to have a general taxation scheme to provide a proper water service. By that, he means an increase in income tax and commercial rates and the introduction of a land tax.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	184	The Taoiseach is playing election slogans while people are being treated on trolleys.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	Deputy Adams might comment on that at the weekend when he has the opportunity.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	188	When he is up in Derry, he might also say that he regrets the closing of 20 beds in the Bangor area as announced on television last night.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	189	Why does the Taoiseach not come up to Derry?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	190	Deputy Adams always has the solution, which is more money. Without reading the detail, I will comment on a draft audit report I have seen from the HSE.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	191	The Taoiseach has only 17 seconds to do it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	192	The report was circulated to members of the Seanad.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	193	The Taoiseach's time is up.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	194	It is a draft audit and obviously the HSE must follow the process through.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	Deputy Adams should believe me that if it is not acceptable, moneys paid in the wrong should be paid back and people who were not authorised to travel should reimburse those things. It is a draft report and obviously the HSE must answer to the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of it. I have referred to the fact that the Minister for Health is one of the few Ministers who is dealing with the real problem here following on the difficulties that were tackled by the former Minister, Deputy James Reilly.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	197	If he is one of the few, then the rest of them are not. What are the rest of them doing?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	We had a situation over here when the Minister for Health of the day, Deputy Micheál Martin, refused to accept any responsibility for the health budget at a time when €16 billion was being spent on it. He said "I have no responsibility for my Department and for the expenditure". At least, Deputies Varadkar and Reilly faced up to the problem and hopefully we will get it under control for every patient in the country.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	200	Only three Ministers are doing their jobs. There are 12 not doing their jobs.

#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	205	There is a huge issue, particularly in rural Ireland, concerning the eligibility of marginal land and commonage for direct EU payment.There is an intensive and what I regard as an over-zealous inspection campaign being carried out by Department inspectors on, by and large, hillside, mountain and commonage land under the commonage framework plan. This inspection campaign is governed by unfair methods. There is a need for a method that is favourable towards farmers who are finding it very difficult to maintain an existence and a living on this marginal ground. In assessing their farming activity it must be carried out within the EU criteria laid down. Farmers have adhered to their responsibilities diligently. Now the same Department is coming back to imposing very unfair penalties on farmers who have adhered to very good practice according to the letter of the law. They have been the custodians of the land and developed traditional farming methods during the years. They maintain stocking rates and take account of weather conditions to try to make a living and maintain the family land.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	206	A question, please.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	208	Will the Deputy, please, put his question?
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	209	They are a very important element of rural Ireland.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	210	I am sorry, but the Deputy is over time.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	211	I apologise, a Cheann Comhairle, but, as the Taoiseach is well aware, there are severe implications in terms of penalties.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	212	I appreciate that, but there is a time limit.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	213	Will the Taoiseach look seriously at adopting Article 4(1)h of EU Directive 1307/2013 and make a submission to the European Commission to try to resolve many of these matters? Article 4(1)h has been adopted in Wales, for instance and would ensure compliance with all of the various EU directives involved. There is flexibility in the measure. Will the Taoiseach take this on board and ensure an application is made to the European Commission?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	214	I am not sure whether the Deputy is talking about eligibility for the GLAS scheme or whether it is a particular problem on upland commonages or marginal land. There were a number of teething problems in the introduction of the new GLAS scheme in terms of the eligibility requirements in that over 50% of active farmers should be on commonages.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	222	This is Deputy Tom Fleming's question. Will Deputies, please, show respect to him as he wants to hear the Taoiseach's answer? The Taoiseach to continue, without interruption.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	223	The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, met IFA representatives and farmers involved on marginal land on a number of occasions. Recommendations were sent to the European Commission in respect of approval of the scheme. In so far as I understand it, the vast majority of the issues raised were sorted out and the scheme is open for applications from farmers to draw down funding in keeping with the eligibility criteria. Where commonage or marginal land is involved, there are conditions governing eligibility for payment in terms of extent of usage by farmers and so on. I am not sure whether Deputy Tom Fleming is referring to particular instances in his constituency, but these are matters that have received a great deal of attention from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I understand most of the matters raised have been resolved-----

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	227	Please allow Deputy Tom Fleming to ask his question.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	228	We all welcome the GLAS scheme and hope maximum payments will be made to all those farmers who are submitting applications, but that is not the core issue. Will the Taoiseach ensure clear and objective criteria are set for the assessment of eligibility? Probably the best formula to adopt is Article 4(1)h, to which I referred. There is a lack of flexibility and a hardness to the attitude being adopted. A hatchet job is being done on many of the farmers concerned. The worst aspect is retrospection. Many will be ruled as being ineligible to receive any payment, which will further ensure the decimation of rural Ireland. We are all aware that meetings are being held up and down the country. Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice is very proactive in this respect.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	229	A question, please.

#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	232	I am talking about the west. This issue has serious implications and there will be the abandonment of land. The landscape is our great tourism asset. The farmers concerned are doing a very good job in their farming practices to protect the landscape of Ireland. We do not want to lose this significant part of our tourism product. I, therefore, ask the Taoiseach to intervene with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and take immediate action. The farmers concerned are very fair and have been struggling against all the odds, as the Taoiseach is well aware. I ask him sincerely to resolve this issue and address it as a matter of urgency.

There are conditions and regulations that must be followed, but they have to be clear, effective and achievable. I think that is what Deputy Tom Fleming is referring to.

All I can do is appeal to them from the Chair. I want to tell the Deputy something - they are not doing themselves any favour because the public watching will get on to our offices to complain bitterly about them. Those who continue to shout are not doing themselves any good because they are heard and seen on television.

Conas atá ag éirí leis an Rialtas maidir leis an ngeallúint sin? Cé mhéad daltaí atá ag déanamh an Ghaolainn ag ardleibhéal san Ardteist faoi láthair? Maraon le sin, tá sé soiléir sa chlár Rialtais go gcuirfí cláir infheistíochta i bhfeidhm ionas go mbeadh an Ghaolainn ar fáil i bhfad níos éasca do thromlach na ndaoine. Ar tharla é sin? Cathain a bheidh Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla tríd na Dála? Deirtear sa chlár Rialtais chomh maith go mbeidh an Rialtas ag tabhairt faoi chéimeanna chun múineadh na Gaeilge a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí agus níos fearr agus é a fheabhsú, agus, nuair a bheidh sé sin déanta, go mbeidh an Rialtas sásta machnamh a dhéanamh ar chóir an Ghaolainn a bheith riachtanach don Ardteist. Ní aontaím le sin ach sin atá sa chlár Rialtais. Cad é tuairim an Taoisigh maidir le sin ag an mbabtha seo? An bhfuil an Rialtas chun aon chinneadh a dhéanamh ar sin sna míonna agus sa bhliain atá le teacht?  Dúirt an tAire, an Teachta Brendan Howlin, ag an deireadh seachtaine gurb an botún is mó a dhein an Rialtas, dar leis, ná deireadh a chur leis na comhairlí bailte ar fud na tíre. Bhíos i gCathair na Mart an Aoine seo caite. Bhí díomá an domhain ar thromlach na ndaoine go bhfuil deireadh curtha leis an gcomhairle baile a bhí ann. Tá an tuairim mar an gcéanna ar fud na tíre. Cathain a bheidh an reachtaíocht ag teacht os comhair na Dála chun an cinneadh sin a athrú agus na comhairlí bailte a thabhairt ar ais? Dúirt an tAire, an Teachta Howlin, go gcaithfidh an Rialtas an cinneadh sin a athrú agus iad a thabhairt ar ais. Cathain a bheidh an reachtaíocht againn?

Tá cinneadh déanta ag an Rialtas maidir le seo agus níl an cinneadh sin le hathrú. Beidh Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla á thabhairt isteach i mbliana. Tá sé sa chlár reachtúil. Is féidir leis an Teachta ceist a chur ar an Aire Stáit faoin obair atá déanta ó thaobh ardú céime a thabhairt don Ghaeilge agus an infheistíocht atá á déanamh ionas go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ar fáil go coitianta ag chuile duine ar fud na tíre.

Foilsíodh an tuairisc dheireanach acu anuraidh, measaim an lá deireanach de mhí an Mhárta an bhliain seo caite. Tá beagnach 12 mí imithe tharainn ach fós nílimid tar éis 14, nó ar a laghad 13, tuairisc a phlé. Gealladh dúinn go mbeadh díospóireacht nó, ar a laghad, freagra ón Rialtas againn lastigh de cheithre mhí ó foilsíodh na tuairiscí. Faoin am seo, is masla é dóibh siúd a ghlac páirt ann. Is mise duine acusan. Experiment maith a bhí ann. Mhol mé é ag an am agus ba chóir é a dhéanamh arís, ach ní fiú tráithnín é muna bhfuilimid sásta cloí leis an amchlár. Cén uair a bheidh díospóireacht againn sa Teach maidir le cearta vóta a thabhairt do shaoránaigh ina gcónaí lasmuigh den Stát, leasú a dhéanamh ar an Dáil agus cearta eacnamaíochta, sóisialta agus cultúrtha? Chomh maith le sin, cathain a bheidh díospóireacht againn faoin gá do choinbhinsiún eile chun déileáil le ceisteanna móra eile a bhfuil fós le plé?

Tá obair ar siúl faoi láthair i gcuid de na Ranna maidir leis an gceist seo. Thug mé gealltanas, nuair a bheidh sé sin déanta, go mbeidh an Príomh-Aoire ag tabhairt na tuarascála chuig na Dála ionas go mbeadh díospóireachtaí ann. Tabharfaidh mé tuilleadh eolais don Teachta nuair a bheidh sé agam.

Cuirtear an cheist uair sa tseachtain. Ní an Fhreasúra amháin atá ag cur na ceiste ach tá Teachtaí ar bhinsí an Rialtais ag cur na ceiste chomh maith. Níl sé maith go leor ag an staid seo nach bhfuil dáta ann maidir le díospóireacht ar na tuairiscí sin. An rud a chuala muideanna ná go raibh na cinntí déanta lastigh de na Ranna agus go bhfuil an locht orthu. Ní freagra iomlán é an freagra a thug an Taoiseach. Tá a fhios agamsa go bhfuil na Ranna críochnaithe le seo. Is don Teach seo an cinneadh a dhéanamh agus ní na Ranna. Ba chóir don Aoire glacadh le seo agus na tuairiscí a chur faoi bhráid na Dála chún iad a phlé. Ba chóir don Taoiseach iarraidh ar an Príomh-Aoire é sin a dhéanamh.

In this instance we are looking for further and urgent consultation between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, community groups and Muintir na Tíre on the seniors alert scheme. I am raising this matter on foot of serious concerns and reservations I have received from local communities regarding the move to transfer the administration of the scheme to Pobal. The scheme, as it stands, is for the supply, delivery, installation and warranty of telecare equipment related to elderly and vulnerable people, equipment such as personal alarms and so-called panic buttons. The majority of the community organisations registered with the senior alerts scheme are community councils, community alert groups and neighbourhood watch groups. They have played a major role in caring for the elderly members of their communities. The transfer of the seniors alert scheme from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to Pobal has caused much concern among the voluntary community which administers the scheme on the ground, however. Muintir na Tíre has also expressed concerns regarding the lack of proper engagement with the current service providers and stakeholders prior to the announcement of the tender.I have been contacted by community groups all over the county, and they have each told a similar story. This tender was announced without any consultation and its terms cast into real doubt the continued excellent level of service provided by community groups and service providers. I and my colleagues are asking that this process be put on hold in order to allow for proper in-depth engagement with community groups and service providers.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	359	There is serious concern about the present plan to transfer the security alert scheme to Pobal. This scheme, by all accounts administered in an efficient and cost-efficient way through community and voluntary groups since 1996, has stood the test of time. There are hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under it. There are approximately seven or eight companies as well as around 15 to 20 alarm companies involved. One company has 30,000 connections across the country. The new tendering process envisaged would limit this company and others to tendering for three areas out of the ten that Pobal has identified. This would inevitably lead to job losses in areas of maintenance, repairs, monitoring and supply. There is a huge risk that prices will increase and standards will fall. With over 150,000 customers, Pobal will be denying existing companies their ability to tender in a fair and equitable way, with no guarantee they would even win one of them. Relationships have also been built up with elderly people and other groups. What consultations took place? Were existing businesses, community groups, suppliers and, most importantly, the consumers consulted? Is this another cost-cutting exercise? If so, lives could be put at risk if standards fall. Pobal has no experience in this area. Standards in alarms and what they do vary. Some are quite sophisticated, monitoring movement, smoke levels, carbon monoxide, medicine reminders, fall detections, and bed occupancy. We need to place a hold on this and consult further because I do not believe this is in the interests of the people. Any person or group I have spoken to has said that the system has worked well. Why do we need to do this?
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	360	My Department manages the seniors alert scheme, SAS, which encourages community support for vulnerable older people in our communities by providing grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons over the age of 65 and of limited means to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind. The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department. The maximum grant per beneficiary for equipment is €250 in respect of monitored personal alarms with pendant and €50 in respect of an additional pendant or re-installation. The annual monitoring costs, generally between €60 and €80, are borne by the beneficiary. I am glad to say that from 2010 to the end of 2014, in excess of 41,000 people have benefited from the scheme at a total cost of €11 million. I have maintained the allocation for the seniors alert scheme in 2015 at €2.35 million, and that level of funding is sufficient to meet current demand levels for this important scheme. It is not a cost-cutting exercise. Following the review of the old community support for older people scheme, CSOP, the forerunner for the seniors alert scheme, one of the key recommendations was that a centralised procurement process would simplify the scheme. By decreasing the level of administration for groups, this would allow them to spend more time on the key aim of the scheme, which is more and better interaction with older persons and would also achieve value for money through economies of scale. The Department undertook to consider new approaches to the seniors alert scheme in 2014 and arising from this it was decided that the scheme would be managed by Pobal. Pobal's management and administrative services for the scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014. A panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specified regional areas while maintaining the benefits of local service provision. The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete. As the market for the equipment is well established, it was neither necessary nor appropriate to engage in consultations with the market on the matter prior to the tender process. Following discussion and advice from procurement consultants and input from my Department, it was agreed that the procurement would be split in two parts. The first part is equipment procurement. A three-year framework agreement for the direct procurement of the SAS equipment, that is the alarm units, was published in October 2014. A series of minimum quality standards, based on research from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, Private Security Authority and various agencies in both the UK and Ireland, were set as part of this tender. The tender was broken down into ten regional lots to ensure that SMEs were not disadvantaged due to excessively large sizes. This is pursuant to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 10/14. There will be a panel of suppliers chosen in each regional lot. These suppliers will be ranked and the first supplier will be the supplier of choice for all local organisations in the lot unless they cannot meet the demand, whereby the next ranked supplier will then be chosen to supply the equipment. These rankings will be reviewed annually and poor performance can result in demotion in the panel. The choice of suppliers will be managed by Pobal to meet public procurement rules. The second part of procurement is monitoring services. A voluntary monitoring services advisory panel was published via eTenders in October 2014. The purpose of this panel is to inform the beneficiaries of the level of costs and service associated with various suppliers' monitoring services. Entrants to this panel will need to meet a series of minimum quality standards to ensure that the older person is getting a good quality of service. I must emphasise that the use of this panel is voluntary and the older person can choose to continue with their existing monitoring company or can choose any supplier to provide this service. Entrance to this panel is on a rolling basis over the course of 2015.

#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	362	Other Deputies such as Deputy Michael Moynihan of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Tony McLoughlin of Fine Gael and also Deputy Michael Creed have received similar communications and share our concerns. This is a genuine cross-party call to the Department and to the Minister of State. We all share the concerns of the community groups that are dealing with this on the ground. They are the experts and they feel they have not been consulted properly. Efforts need to be made to facilitate real consultation on this matter in order, perhaps, to amend the terms of the tender to protect what is good and what works in the current scheme. The big question is, what is the objective of the change? What is it supposed to achieve? The scheme works well as it is and the customers are very happy. What problem is the Department trying to solve? It is not clear. I ask the Minister of State to respond positively to this genuine cross-party request to consult with all stakeholders before bringing the current tendering process to a conclusion. It is important to listen and respond to the concerns of the customers of the scheme and the community groups that have played such an important role in making it a success.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	363	I reiterate Deputy Ryan's point that this is an all-party request. We have received representations across the board from various people, including the people who avail of the service. Is the Minister of State aware that the companies currently engaged in this have collectively paid back more in VAT than the €2.3 million allocated to the scheme? The Minister of State has said this would promote more SME participation. What about the existing SMEs and the jobs and services they provide?The Minister of State said it was not a cost-cutting exercise. There will be ten regional lots but if one can only tender for three and if one has 30,000 customers spread across the country, then one is limited and jobs will be lost. It will have a very serious impact. The Minister of State did not answer the question properly in terms of engagement with the different bodies, customers and suppliers. She said that in some cases it was not necessary. I do not accept that and believe they should have been consulted.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	364	Over the next 30 years, the number of people in Ireland over the age of 65 is predicted to double to between 1.3 million and 1.4 million while the number over 80 is expected to quadruple to about 440,000. The Government recognises that quality of life and enabling older people to live life to the full at every stage will become increasingly important as the numbers of older people increase. The fact that more people are living for longer is to be celebrated and is one of the great successes of our age. Research has shown that loneliness and isolation have a significant impact on the health and well-being of our older people. The risk factor involved in loneliness is as significant as smoking and greater than obesity. Unlike other schemes, applications under the seniors alert scheme do not come directly from the beneficiary but instead from the local community and voluntary groups. A key benefit of the scheme is the interaction between the beneficiary and the local groups which have a track record of working with, or providing services to, older people within their communities. The community group and the beneficiary enter into an informal social contract to remain in touch for a period of at least five years. This scheme has benefitted 90,000 older people at a total cost of some €32 million over the past ten years. Not only is it a fine example of preventative spend, it also improves the well-being of our valuable older citizens. The operational hand-over between my Department and Pobal is proceeding and should be completed in June of this year. In the meantime, community and voluntary groups wishing to participate and draw down grant support under the seniors alert scheme can apply to my Department in the usual way. Pobal proposes to host a number of regional information sessions to assist local community groups in the transition to the new scheme. The regional information sessions will highlight any new processes and the benefits of the new approach. It will give the local organisations an opportunity to engage with Pobal staff and address any concerns they may have. It is important to note that my Department will retain responsibility for the strategic policy direction of the scheme. It will also have an oversight role in regard to Pobal's delivery of the scheme and will ensure that the valuable community support for elderly persons provided by the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups across the country will be maintained.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	I am very glad the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, is here to take this issue. I was appalled to learn of the brutal murder of Boris Nemtsov last weekend, as were the overwhelming majority of the Irish people. Mr. Nemtsov was a prominent opposition politician in Russia and his RPR Parnas political party is a member of ALDE, the same political grouping to which Fianna Fáil is affiliated at a European level. Over the course of his life, Mr. Nemtsov worked to speak up for the most marginalised in Russian society. He was a committed democrat who fought to strengthen the political institutions in Russia and he highlighted the scourge of corruption at every opportunity. In recent months, he had also been an outspoken critic of the conflict in Ukraine, which has claimed so many innocent lives. The murder of Boris Nemtsov must also act as a warning sign to all people who believe in liberal democracy in Europe and in Russia. It is evidence that all is not well with the political system in Moscow. The increasing Russian aggression towards its neighbours and internally towards political opponents is a most frightening development. From what we see and listen to through the media reports, there appears to be an increasing culture of fear in Russia. State authorities are said to act in an exceptionally partisan way in how law and order are maintained and in how laws are implemented. It seems the regime in Moscow is exhibiting increasingly fascist-like tendencies, where state and party merge into one and where some opponents are even forced to leave the country.  We are all aware of the desperate carnage with the loss of life of so many innocent people and we think of one particular incident alone, the shooting down of the civilian aircraft MH19, resulting in the death of 298 innocent people. I mention that in the context of the current Russian foreign policy that has resulted in war in Ukraine with untold devastation and the undermining of that country's sovereignty. As a Parliament we should be very conscious of the sovereignty of other nations. The West has responded with sanctions which have had an impact but which have not provided a long-term solution. Even Ireland, a country which has traditionally had a distinctly cordial relationship with Russia, has been touched by this aggression through the infringement of Irish-controlled airspace by Russian military aircraft. This, we have learned, resulted in commercial traffic having to be diverted or suspended when travelling to and from Irish airports. The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, need to take up this issue directly with their counterparts in the Russian Government. I know from Question Time last week that the Minister had instructed senior officials in his Department to meet the Russian ambassador and senior officials in the Russian embassy. However, at this stage, with another recorded infringement of Irish-controlled airspace, it is time for the Minister and the Minister of State to raise this matter directly with the Russian authorities and to state very clearly that any infringement of Irish-controlled airspace is not acceptable.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	366	I thank Deputy Smith for raising this important matter. In the early hours of last Saturday morning, a prominent Russian opposition leader, Boris Nemtsov, was shot dead in central Moscow. His murder was a brutal and cowardly act which was met with widespread shock and disbelief. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has expressed his deep sadness at Mr. Nemtsov's death and extended his sympathies to his family. Tributes have poured in for Mr. Nemtsov since his death. He served his country with distinction in many roles, including as former Deputy Russian Prime Minister under President Yeltsin. Mr. Nemtsov was a courageous champion of democratic reforms and a strong advocate for a more open and tolerant Russia. His loss will be deeply felt not just in Russia but around the world.  The high regard in which Mr. Nemtsov was held was evident by the large crowd which attended a vigil in his honour on Sunday. Some 50,000 people turned out to mourn his loss and honour his life. While the vigil march included a wide range of political parties and movements, the attendance of so many ordinary Russia citizens was notable. Their presence in such numbers was a tribute to his legacy as a fearless reformer who was not afraid to speak out against the direction that Russia was taking and the policies being pursued by the current government. Large numbers of mourners also attended his memorial service yesterday. As was the case with most other EU member states, Ireland was represented at the service by our ambassador to Russia. Mr. Nemtsov's murder highlighted the vulnerability of opposition figures in Russia currently, where any form of criticism of the government is seen as an act of disloyalty. He had been a vocal critic of Russia's actions against Ukraine. In fact, the vigil on Sunday in honour of Mr. Nemtsov replaced an opposition demonstration which he had been instrumental in organising to protest against the economic crisis and Russia's role in the destabilisation of Ukraine. President Putin has condemned the killing. His spokesperson said that the President had written to Mr. Nemtsov's mother promising that he would personally oversee the investigation into her son's murder. Many theories are in circulation as to the motives for Mr. Nemtsov's murder. For this reason, it is all the more important that the Russian authorities promptly conduct a full and transparent investigation into his killing and that the perpetrators of this callous crime are brought to justice.There should be no culture of impunity in the face of such an appalling deed. It is also important that the rights to freedom of assembly and expression that Mr. Nemtsov fought so fearlessly to defend are recognised and fully protected.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	367	I thank the Minister of State for his response. As a society, we need better relations with Russia on a political, social and economic basis, which would be to the benefit of both countries and the European Union. There is great potential to grow trade for the benefit of Ireland, the European Union and Russia. However, there is one thing from which the European Union and this country cannot flinch, that is, being strong advocates of the need for democratic reforms in Russia and, as the late Mr. Nemtsov was, being active as a strong advocate for a more open and tolerant Russia. What we have seen in recent times is not acceptable. The Government, at head of Government and ministerial level, must convey in the strongest possible manner to the Russian authorities that what has been happening is not acceptable. There must be no stone left unturned to bring to justice those who carried out the hideous murder of an excellent man who was doing important political work in difficult circumstances. The most important lesson we can learn from the brutal killing of Mr. Nemtsov is that we can no longer ignore what is happening in Russia. We can no longer say it has no impact on us. We can no longer turn a blind eye when another political opponent of the current regime is silenced or when more innocent victims are killed in Ukraine or elsewhere. We have seen recent reports on concerns in some of the other Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Norway has also expressed concerns about Russian aggression. The Government and our partners in the European Union must say loud and clear that this is not acceptable and that if Russia continues these actions, we will not tolerate them. That message must be sent clearly to President Putin and his government. We cannot pretend that the Russian Government and President are our allies. Carrying out actions that have the characteristics of enemy actions makes a state an enemy. A change in policy by President Putin and his government is needed to build better relations with the European Union and the rest of the world. What happened last weekend was an appalling attack on an innocent man which resulted in the loss of life. It was also an attack on democracy.

A failure to find and prosecute Mr. Nemtsov's killers would raise serious questions about Russia's criminal justice system. A culture of impunity must not be allowed to develop in Russia and cannot be tolerated. In remarks on behalf of all EU member states at yesterday's memorial service the head of the EU delegation to Russia said Mr. Nemtsov had personified values that we held dear: respect for human dignity, a commitment to democracy, a strong civil society and the need for authorities to be publicly accountable. Defending and promoting these fundamental values is becoming increasingly difficult in Russia. Developments in recent years in terms of political pluralism and civil liberties have been disappointing. Although our perspectives may sometimes differ, it is important that we continue to engage with Russia in all areas, including political pluralism, the role of civil society and civil liberties generally.
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	I raise this important issue about the retention of Department of Social Protection jobs in Ballybay, County Monaghan. Ballybay is a small town, with a population of 1,500 people, and the loss of 30 jobs there would be devastating. It would be the equivalent of losing 300 jobs in a town with a population of 15,000 people. This must be taken seriously by the Department of Social Protection and all efforts made to retain the jobs in Ballybay. That is imperative. I am very concerned about the way the Department has handled the issue, the answers emanating from it on how it has conducted a review of the offices in Ballybay and the answer given by the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to a parliamentary question submitted by my colleague in Cavan-Monaghan, Deputy Brendan Smith. I am annoyed that five property owners who have offered premises in Ballybay, which would mean the retention of the jobs in the town, have not been given adequate responses from the Department of Social Protection. I spoke to one of them this morning. He submitted his request in time, but he has not been contacted by either the OPW or the Department about his offer to provide adequate space for the Department. He also met the Minister of State with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Simon Harris, before Christmas. He has made it clear that he is prepared to foot any cost to ensure the jobs are retained in the local area, but he has not been afforded the opportunity to provide a quote. The other property owners are in the same position. This issue must be taken very seriously by the Department of Social Protection. The answer to the parliamentary question suggested the decision had already been made by it. It was believed locally that this was a done deal and that the decision had been made long before the property owners were consulted. Can this issue be revisited? It is of great concern to me, people in my constituency and those working in the Department of Social Protection in Ballybay that adequate consideration is not being given to these alternative proposals. There is adequate space in Ballybay to retain the jobs in the town. At the last meeting it was made clear that if there were new jobs to come in terms of a public service card, it could be done either in Ballybay or elsewhere. There is no need for the jobs currently located in Ballybay to be moved elsewhere. It is welcome that we have a new Minister of State with special responsibility for rural economic development, but I am concerned that the Department of Social Protection is not taking the issue of rural development seriously. I have no issue with jobs being moved to another rural town, but why should a small rural town, in which these jobs have been located for over 30 years, be treated in this way when there are people who are prepared to put their money on the line to retain the jobs in the area? It is a retrograde step. It looks very bad from the Government's perspective and from that of the Department that adequate consideration is not being given to the various offers made.  I also spoke to the county council which had offered the Department Monaghan town council offices for issuing the public service card. The council has not been consulted adequately either. Its offer also seems to have been ignored. It is welcome that the 30 jobs are located in Ballybay and it is important that they be retained there. It is also welcome that the Department of Social Protection has stated it wants to create more jobs, but they can be adequately sourced, resourced and facilitated in Ballybay which is in the centre of the county and within easy reach of all parts of the county. In a previous response from a departmental official I was told there was no adequate public transport service available. That is a failure of the Government which needs to provide a proper public transport system throughout rural Ireland. It is a lame excuse. This issue must be revisited. The Minister of State is present. He has said he is looking at the issue and I look forward to hearing his formal reply. This issue will not go away. It is believed locally that adequate consideration has not been given to the offers made.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	370	I acknowledge the Deputy's concerns. He has worked extremely hard on this issue.  The 29 staff in two adjoining buildings on the main street of Ballybay, County Monaghan were redeployed from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the Department of Social Protection in July 2012. They are engaged in the processing of public service cards.The card is intended to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible. It has been designed to replace other cards in the public sector such as the free travel pass and the social services card and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers. The project is a key initiative in the public service reform plan, with the aim being to expand the use of the card to cover a greater range of services. Card registration is being expanded to encompass all departmental scheme customers and, over time, the adult population of Ireland. The card operations in Ballybay have been expanded to include eight additional temporary staff. The two current buildings are in separate ownership and, unfortunately, poor condition and not considered appropriate for the existing business processes or future operational requirements. In this context, the Office of Public Works, OPW, has been working to identify alternative locations to which the functions could be relocated. The OPW has investigated all of the options in Ballybay and inspected a number of properties with a view to adapting buildings to meet the Department of Social Protection's requirements. I have been informed that a significant investment would be required to bring the proposed properties up to modern standards. In addition, other technical surveys and reports, planning permissions, fire certification and physical works would take approximately one year to complete. Unfortunately, this timeframe does not meet the Department's business requirements. It was decided that the properties on offer in Ballybay could not meet these requirements in terms of cost and time. In this context, a decision has been made to move the current facilities to Monaghan town where the preferred location is suitable for the services currently located in Ballybay. The location can also facilitate the Department's requirement to establish a public office for the purposes of issuing public service cards to County Monaghan residents. Monaghan is the only county that does not have a customer-facing public service card office. As far as I am aware, the situation for all Departments is the same, in that we inform the OPW of our requirements and it sources properties. I stated this at my meetings with local Deputies and councillors. The OPW was given specifications, but I will not interfere in the sourcing. Information was sent to me on suitable buildings, including by the Deputy, and it was passed on to the OPW for investigation. The OPW reported and perhaps the Deputy might raise the issue with it. My role is not to lobby for any particular office in Ballybay. It would be preferable to keep the services there, but that is what was included in the report that was returned to us.
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	371	The Minister of State may not be aware of something. I was informed this morning by county council officials and the property owners that they had not had proper engagement with the OPW on a number of the proposals. Two of the owners have committed to spending whatever money is required to ensure jobs are retained in Ballybay. They are honourable people and want it to be made clear to the public in the area and the Department that they, rather than the Department, would incur the costs necessary to bring the buildings up to modern standards. They should be offered the opportunity to do this. Before Christmas they asked for the Department's requirements in order that they might carry out the works. The works could have been started three or four months ago had the Department engaged with the property owners. It is important for the people of County Monaghan - my constituents - that the jobs be retained in the area. Ballybay is the centre point of Monaghan and the public offices there are easily accessible from all areas of the county. Thirty jobs in a small town like Ballybay are vital to the enhancement of rural Ireland. What is the point of public investment if it does not enhance the regional spread of development? The private sector will always veer towards larger population centres, but the public service should target areas where the private sector cannot provide investment. This is balanced regional development and where the Department should be focusing its attention. The idea that it would somehow not be advantageous to have a public office in Ballybay is false. The Minister of State should return to the senior Minister and re-engage on the issue, as the way this issue has been handled is unacceptable. It needs to be dealt with properly and there needs to be honest engagement with the local community and all five property owners so as to ensure they are given an adequate opportunity to put their proposals to the Department. A value for money audit would be advantageous from the Department's perspective. The owners are prepared to incur the costs. That is their point. The argument that it would cost the Department money is untrue. It would simply rent the building from an owner.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	372	There is far more to this issue than the building that is currently occupied which we all accept is unsuitable, particularly for the expanded service. There is also the question of planning permission and fire certificates. I met the local public representatives and agreed to make a request to the OPW to hold off on signing any lease for premises in Monaghan town. This allowed representatives and officials to propose alternatives in Ballybay. I do not have the answers to many of the Deputy's questions, as they are within the remit of the OPW which we commissioned to source the premises for us. On foot of my meeting with several Deputies from the locality, I requested the OPW not to sign any lease. That did not happen and there was a further investigation. If the Deputy has an issue with the level of engagement between the OPW and local businesses, he must raise the matter with the OPW.

#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	374	It is a truism to say the best route out of poverty is through work. I am confident that the back-to-work family dividend will prove to be a successful initiative for out-of-work parents with dependent children. It will help people to build a better financial future for themselves and their families. As such, the Bill is intended to provide the legislative basis for the introduction of the dividend, as announced in budget 2015, to help jobseekers with families and lone parents to return to work. It also provides for a number of other changes to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, including the extension of the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangements to all lone parents where the youngest child is between the ages of seven and 13 years. Under the transitional arrangements, certain former recipients of the one-parent family payment are exempt from a number of the conditions applying to the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment, up until their youngest children reach 14 years of age. Budget 2015 provided for the introduction of the back-to-work family dividend scheme to provide a financial incentive for recipients of the one-parent family payment and jobseekers with children who had ceased claiming their social welfare payments on account of these persons or, where applicable, those persons' spouses, civil partners or cohabitees, to take up employment, increase hours of employment or take up self-employment. In addition to family income supplement, FIS, the dividend will act as an incentive to work. It will operate during the period of economic recovery and be available to jobseekers and lone parents who take up or increase the level of their employment at any stage up until the end of March 2018. A person who meets the eligibility criteria for the scheme will be entitled to a weekly payment for up to two years following the ending of the claim for the jobseeker's one-parent family payment.The rate of the back-to-work family dividend will be based, in the first year, on the rate of qualified child increase being paid to that person immediately before they cease to claim the jobseeker's payment or one-parent family payment, subject to a maximum overall weekly payment of €119.20 and will be half of that rate in the second year, subject to a maximum overall weekly payment of €59.60. While the dividend scheme will commence on the enactment of this Bill, applications are being accepted from people who have taken up employment or self-employment or increased their hours of employment since 5 January 2015. However, the first payments will not be made until the legislative provisions underpinning the scheme come into operation on the enactment of the Bill. Payments will be backdated where the date of application is between January and the date of enactment. The Government is making significant progress in getting people back to work but momentum for this needs to be increased. Budget 2015 introduced this new and innovative scheme to help jobseekers with families and lone parents to take up employment. Essentially, it will provide a financial incentive to jobseekers and recipients of one-parent family payment with child dependants to take up employment, increase the hours they work or become self-employed. The dividend will be paid in addition to the family income supplement. I commend the legislation to the House.
#PaulConnaughtonJnr	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate. All sides of the House should welcome legislation that makes it easier for people to return to work. Over the past few years I have dealt with constituents who have been offered short-term contracts or jobs but they did not want to take the chance of taking the offer in case they lost social welfare support. Those who did and who subsequently lost their jobs had to start all over again, which was hugely frustrating. The provisions in the legislation are, therefore, a welcome step forward. In fairness to the Department and the Minister of State, much of what they are trying to do relates to labour activation in addition to providing social welfare payments. They want to help claimants into full-time employment, which is a welcome step. However, I am concerned about community employment, CE, schemes, which have been a huge success. I have written to the Minister of State about this in the past week and I hope to receive a response outlining what can be done in this regard. My concern relates to a cohort of CE participants who are in their late 50s and early 60s. CE schemes work and they are an invaluable resource for participants and communities. As CE has became more of a labour activation scheme and the period participants can stay on it is reducing, the focus has turned to training participants and, hopefully, moving them on to a job, which is ideal. However, let us be honest. Those in their late 50s and early 60s will not find employment easily. They attend my clinics in Tuam and Loughrea and they are frustrated. Some of them have left schemes at the age of 62 or 63 only to go back on jobseeker's payments for three or four years before they are eligible for their pension but that is the last thing they want to do. As far as they are concerned, they have provided an invaluable service in their communities and they want to continue to do that, if possible. While I welcome the fact that the scheme is changing to mirror what we need as a country moving forward, we must address a scenario where these people are being told they are finished on the scheme, there is no future for them and they should find a job. Opportunities do not exist for them currently, particularly for those who were never trained or had skills. They may have had a job for 20 or 30 years before taking up a CE scheme. We need to be more creative in how we deal with them. For example, could we engage in some joined up thinking and move some of them on to the rural social scheme, RSS, or Tús until they reach pension age? I acknowledge there is a cost to this. CE has more to do with labour activation than being just another statistic on the road to getting a job. Mental health is a major issue. The lives of many people changed remarkably when they joined a CE scheme because they had somewhere to go every day and they could meet like minded people of the same age. They were getting out of the house and doing work on the ground. This was of huge benefit to them. The Minister of State is well aware of these issues but I have had a number of calls over the past few weeks since I began to highlight them. CE supervisors say do not feel safe taking people off a scheme because they know what it means to them. They could be going through a tough time in their lives at a delicate age. The Department should be more creative. Labour activation is a hugely important element of CE but mental health and self-esteem are important issues. Many of the participants are unable to handle being told that they should return to a jobseeker's payment. I do not say this is easy. Members can make plentiful observations to the Minister of State and say it is easy to implement this and that but it would be nice if we could acknowledge that people in their late 50s and early 60s will not find it easy to get a job. Given what they have done on these schemes is important and their communities have benefitted, their participation on the scheme should be extended for a few years until they get to pension age. I understand the Department has a limited budget and while "labour activation" are, rightly, buzz words, a cohort of people in this age bracket need to be protected and facilitated. A little joined up thinking would make a huge difference to their lives.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	Budget 2015 provided for a number of welcome initiatives, including tax cuts, an increase in the USC threshold and increases in child benefit and the living alone allowance, which were the first steps in putting money back in people's pockets with an intention to do the same in budget 2016. The back-to-work family dividend scheme is a positive development and I welcome the publication of the legislation to put that in train. The Department has changed from a State body that only makes welfare payments to one that incentivises putting people back to work over the past years. The dividend will incentivise work and it acknowledges that the transition to work is not always easy. There are added costs relating to child care, transport and so on. The dividend also acknowledges that those in receipt of social protection payments need a little extra to help them on returning to work. The Government has a strong record of supporting job creation with 90,000 new jobs created under its watch. It has set an ambitious target for this year and there have been positive jobs announcements in many sectors in recent weeks. The plan is to provide 40,000 new jobs this year. Last year the unemployment rate was 12% but it fell to 10.1% today. When we entered office, the rate was 15% and while it is still too high, it is going in the right direction. The Department's new role in assisting jobseekers to get back to work and supporting those who are able to work to get work is welcome. The back-to-work dividend scheme will enable people to retain the child-related portion of their social welfare payment for up to two years and it will be available to recipients of a number of social welfare schemes, including jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance, transitional jobseeker's allowance and the one-parent family payment. People on community training schemes such as RSS, Tús or Gateway will also be facilitated under this scheme. I support the comments of Deputy Paul Connaughton in this regard. To qualify for the payment, claimants must be aged under 66, have qualified children and be habitually resident in the State. Such recipients must have been receiving payment for at least 12 months in total, and at least six months in the previous year, before claiming the dividend. The time spent on education, training and supported employment will also qualify towards satisfying the 12 month requirement. The dividend will be payable for two years as long as the claimant is not in receipt of another payment. It will be paid at a standard weekly rate of €29.80 per child, subject to a maximum payment overall ceiling of €119 and the scheme will be in place until 2021. The authentication of identity when presenting for payment is another initiative under the legislation. Social welfare fraud may be exaggerated but those who pay tax and contribute to society want to know their taxes are being spent properly and correctly and that only those who are eligible for payments receive them.Of course that is the case in the vast majority of cases. This strengthens the legislative provisions relating to the identification of a person who presents at a post office for a social welfare payment. These requirements are in line with the relevant procedures that have been arranged between An Post and the Department of Social Protection for those who present at a post office on behalf of themselves, those who present on behalf of another person, those who have permission to do so, those who are appointed on behalf of a registered medical practitioner and those who are unable to manage their own financial affairs. Section 8 relates to the repayment of amounts due where fraud is committed. I would like to highlight the distinction between those who purposely go out to defraud the State and those who fail to disclose something they should have disclosed. I have come across a number of cases in which Department of Social Protection inspections have led to somebody being presented with a bill asking them to repay some moneys on the basis that they failed to disclose money or property they inherited a number of years ago. I think a distinction needs to be made between people who have failed to disclose something and people who have shown an intent to defraud the State. I welcome the initiatives that have been taken in this legislation. I wish the Tánaiste well with the passage of the Bill.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys. Before I go into my analysis of the legislation, I would like to support what my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, said about community employment schemes. I am strongly of the view that we need to be creative and radical on this issue. We have all had positive experience of community employment schemes changing the lives of vulnerable people. I urge the Minister of State to note the cross-party support for such schemes. That could be something positive. In fairness to the Minister of State, he has an open mind on this issue. I strongly endorse what my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, has said. I thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015. This debate should be about people who do not have jobs, the extremely low-paid, the many children and families that are living in poverty and lone-parent families. There can be no running away from this matter, which must be our focus. The Government needs to face facts and act in a calm and compassionate manner. Of course we have to support our approach with sound economic arguments rather than soundbites. The money that is required for social welfare, education, disability, lone parents or investment, all of which are issues that need to be prioritised, has to come from somewhere. Priority must be given to children in poverty, people on trolleys and people with disabilities. I apologise to guys and girls for pointing out that when one has such priority issues, other issues have to wait. There are other issues that can wait until we resolve the priority issues. The most recent Exchequer returns, which were published yesterday, show that the Government has €925 million more than it had last year. It is €345 million ahead of target. I welcome that because it is important. When one examines those figures, one can see that there is room to make improvements in the priority issues I have mentioned. I will give an example of a priority issue with which I have been dealing over the last week. Child Vision provides an excellent service to blind and disabled children in Drumcondra, which is in my constituency. Over the last six years, Child Vision has sustained cuts in excess of €821,000. It has had to contend with a 20% cut in its funding in the last five years. Child Vision's annual cost of governance is in excess of €70,000. It has had to pay an additional €50,000 for HIQA registration and works. Child Vision has received no additional funding to meet these costs. In other words, costs and bureaucracy are coming at those involved with Child Vision. To date, it has seen voluntary staff wage cuts of 10%, reduced maternity pay by 50%, reduced the staff costs of lower-paid staff, stopped using agency staff, made changes to sick pay policy, reduced its number of staff members and increased its fundraising activity to meet its annual shortfalls. I raise this today because we saw the figures and the positive news yesterday. At the same time, the HSE is seeking to impose a cut of €54,000 on Child Vision in Drumcondra. If this cut is implemented, on top of the increased costs since 2009, Child Vision will have to consider making more cuts to its services. It has completed its budget for 2015 and there is an estimated shortfall of €120,000. That is chicken feed compared to some of the figures we heard yesterday. If Child Vision does not get this €120,000, it will be forced to close a residential house which currently allows six children who are blind and have multiple disabilities to access independent living skills and education. These children will be left with no option but to leave. Six social care professionals will be cut and Child Vision will have to pay redundancy packages, the minimum value of which has been estimated to be €100,000. I raise this in the context of where the money comes from. When we are talking about social welfare, it is important to think of the welfare of blind and disabled children. The main purpose of the Bill itself is to amend the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to provide a legislative basis for the introduction of the back to work family dividend. This measure, which was announced in budget 2015, will help jobseekers with families and lone parents to return to work. We have to ensure we protect the rights and incomes of loan parents.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	381	As I listened to the Tánaiste yesterday evening, I noted with interest how all of this is being presented. It is clear that a great deal of work has been done in the area of spin in recent times. It was amazing to hear the Tánaiste say that the way out of "poverty is fairly-paid work". While that is true, the problem we have is that work is less well paid than it used to be. Since 2008, which is almost seven years ago, many people have lost good well-paid jobs. Now we are seeing numbers increasing again, but the jobs in question are predominantly low-paid and have poor working conditions. Many people have zero-hours contract arrangements. Throughout this episode, certain people have refused to allow a good crisis to go to waste. When the crisis hit in 2007-08, people involved in economic philosophy at the time were adamant that this was probably the death of neoliberalism. In fact, neoliberalism has probably never been as rampant. Whether the Tánaiste likes it or not, the Labour Party has signed up to a neoliberal philosophy. It is frightening because it has undermined living conditions and made life more difficult for an incredible number of people in Ireland. I would say over half the people of Ireland now find it difficult to pay their bills at the end of the month. I do not think that could have been said at any previous time in my lifetime. It was not true then, but it is true today. Not only has life become more difficult for the less well-off - life was never easy for them - but we now have a new poverty, in so far as many people who were traditionally regarded as middle class have found themselves in a very difficult place.It is interesting to hear the statistics and analysis of Mr. Michael Taft, which is in big contrast to the Government, on the serious level of child poverty and material deprivation and how we compare with other European countries. We are struggling to look well against them. We must listen to Ministers telling us we have the fastest growing economy in Europe but that does not mean a lot to most people if they are struggling to pay bills and life is more difficult for them. Life is so difficult for so many people. People felt that the reason banks were getting so much money was to deal with the fact that a whole lot of people could not possibly pay back the money they owed on property because they had paid too much for it at the wrong time. They found themselves in crazy negative equity. As things have transpired, the banks are pursuing people and forcing them to downsize and forcing them out of their homes. It is a race to the bottom and there is no protection for people. The banks are still too big to fail and too big for the Government to tell them what to do. We cannot tell them what to do. Is that a healthy situation and is it fair to the people of Ireland, who will pay for the bank bailout for many years? I am not saying it was all the fault of this Government but the previous Government was no different. A bailout was organised and the taxpayer and the ordinary citizens are paying for it. What happens? The banks now turn around and kick people in the teeth. It is too bad.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	382	The basis of the Bill is to provide for the introduction of the back-to-work family dividend scheme. This is supposedly to help jobseekers with families and lone parents to return to work. We cannot look at this in isolation, we must look at it in the context of the virtual assault on the living standards of lone parents who have been pauperised under this Government. They have been particularly targeted and the measures proposed do not address it. In many ways, they exacerbate it. I reiterate the call of FLAC, which suggests the Government should reverse the changes to the one-parent family payment and carry out a social impact assessment of the changes to the payment to determine the extent to which changes to the scheme have had a detrimental impact on families. We have had a lot of jargon and sloganeering about getting people off welfare as if it was like getting them off heroin. It is as if they are addicted to the poverty lifestyle that being dependent on social welfare is in Ireland. It demonstrates a complete lack of understanding from Government representatives of the real lives of lone parents. This follows what went on in Britain, which was the demonisation of lone parents and playing to a stereotypical and unreal vision of lone parents lounging around in their pyjamas all day and who could not be bothered going to get jobs. Everyone knows the reality is that it is not a lack of willingness on the part of lone parents, who would like nothing more than to have a break from the family environment and go out to work, but the lack of opportunity, of decent and well-paying jobs, and affordable child care. One of the reasons things are so bad is the policies implemented in other areas. This includes the JobBridge scheme, where companies like Supervalu are advertising for shop assistants under JobBridge. Hewlett-Packard, a wealthy multinational corporation, is looking for interns under the scheme. These schemes are replacing well-paid jobs that should be available. Lone parents find it very difficult to access the support when there is no child care. I hope the Government has read the study and survey by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul showing that people on welfare would like nothing better than the opportunity to get a decent job. As Deputy Mick Wallace said, those opportunities are few and far between. The situation was summed up by a 31-year-old mother of three from the country who contacted us. She has a maintenance arrangement, made through mediation, of €5 a week but has never received it. She receives a fuel allowance of €20 and her total income for herself and her children is €267.60 per week. With the help of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, she has had the confidence to try to return to education. She wants to become a midwife and be self-supporting in that regard. She received a letter saying the one-parent family payment will be cut off from 1 April. Now, she spends one morning a week, at a cost of €10, travelling to an education centre. She says it might seem a small amount of money but to her it is the difference between having bread and milk, or not, on Wednesday. Nevertheless, she is investing this money because she wants to pursue her education and does not have any family support. In September, she wanted to study five days a week but it would cost €50 in petrol and 15 hours in child care either side of school hours. With the changes introduced by the Government, it would make it inaccessible to her. She asks how this is incentivising lone parents to return to the workplace. Some people have characterised these measures as a deliberate act of structural violence against lone parents. I do not see that as an exaggeration. We are structuring a scenario where lone parents cannot access educational opportunities or decent jobs and are being allocated Springboard courses with little chance of advancement or meaningful employment at the end. We must step back. I reiterate the call made by FLAC to reverse the cuts and take stock of where we are in our dealings with lone parents rather than pursuing this project of social vandalism and the targeting of this vulnerable group once again.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	383	I propose to share time with Deputy Pat Breen. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. We must acknowledge the latest figures from the CSO, to the effect that 4,300 fewer people are on the live register compared to this time last month. There is a decrease from 10.3% to 10.1% of the population. It remains far too high but the rate of decline is increasing and that must be welcomed. To contextualise that, the Department of Social Protection is introducing this Bill as part of a suite of measures to make it more attractive for households to take up employment where it is available and to avoid poverty traps becoming more of an issue. More than any country in the European Union, there is a major issue with jobless households in Ireland. Figures presented by different institutes make for stark reading. The reasons for it are not clear but perhaps the Department of Social Protection has a better background on why, in the EU context, Ireland's figure for jobless households is so high and so out of sync with other European countries.This is leading to the creation of huge social problems and is the main factor in the consistent poverty rates in many sectors of our society. This figure, when combined with the figure for intergenerational unemployment, and the blackspots in this regard in both urban and rural areas, indicates there is an amount of work still to be done to address the poverty issue. This Bill which, as I said, provides, among other things, for transition payments for lone parents is one of many measures being introduced to tackle what is a difficult nut to crack in terms of getting back people into the labour market.  I am familiar with people from my constituency of Cork South-West who, in terms of their having been unemployed for years, are most vulnerable and would not at this stage, without careful coaching and nursing, be capable of returning to the labour market. We need to be more proactive in how we deal with these people. As I said, many of these people have been unemployed for so long they are in a rut, have lost all of their confidence and see nothing beyond their weekly social welfare payment. While the Department of Social Protection plays a vital role in terms of getting people off the system and back into work, employers are more inclined to take on people who are just out of college or people, who because they only recently lost a job, have not been on the register for a long time. The latter people are attractive to employ. A huge cohort of people do not fit that bill.  The recently established Intreo offices and supervisors of schemes are playing a positive role in getting people back to work. The Department could be far more proactive in identifying through the transition supervisors those people who, because they lack confidence, have an intellectual or physical disability or are experiencing other issues because of, for example, the environment in which they are living, will not, without help, ever again access work. These people must in the first instance be identified and then dealt with in a sensitive, proactive manner. Through address of this problem we will make significant progress in terms of reducing our long-term unemployment and jobless household figures. If we fail to tackle this problem the result will be a continuing albatross around our necks with respect to social protection. There are many other initiatives that could be introduced to attract people back into employment which offers dignity, an increased standard of living and hope. One such initiative is the provision of an online portal, which when accessed by people using their PPSN or a PIN would provide them with information on their entitlements under the social welfare system. The current system in terms of submission of the initial application, time spent awaiting a decision and, perhaps, the appeals process, is time consuming, unwieldy and, in many cases, far from efficient. The minimum wage issue is being examined by the low pay commission. Many people have raised with me the issue of a possible increase in the minimum wage leading to a decrease by the labour market in work hours, which will be of no net benefit to people on low pay. This issue needs to be addressed. In an effort to combat employers decreasing work hours should the minimum wage be increased, perhaps consideration could be given to the introduction of a tiered structure in respect of the minimum wage, whereby the person working a 20 hour week would be paid a slightly higher per hour rate, the person working a 30 hour week would be paid a slightly lower rate and the person working up to 39 hours would be paid the national minimum wage as recommended by the low pay commission.  Another issue which I have previously raised in the House, which although not relevant to this legislation needs to be addressed, is that of people who have been assessed on PRSI payments made over their working lives. This is an issue that affects in the main women who left the workforce when they got married who, because they made no PRSI contributions during the period they were not in employment, when they return to the workforce are crucified when it comes to drawing a State contributory pension.  The Intreo offices rolled out to date have been a hugely positive development in the social protection system. They act as a one-stop-shop for people who find themselves in the unfortunate position of having been given their P45 by way of assisting them to get back into the workplace as quickly as possible. This service needs to be ramped up nationally. There are parts of this country in which social welfare services are very fragmented. In many cases, local offices, CWO offices and so on are located in different buildings. For example, in Bantry these services are located in three different buildings. I appeal to the Department to consider roll-out of the Intreo office template nationally. People who engage proactively with the system are dealt with positively. As I said in my opening remarks, there will always be people for whom we will have to go the extra mile in terms of encouraging them back into further education and work. My final point relates to the high rate of overturned decisions on appeal and whether this is the result of front-line staff making the wrong decisions. This issue needs further examination. In many cases initial decisions by deciding officers in respect of claims for disability payments and so on are being overturned on appeal. I again welcome this Bill which forms part of a suite of measures that need to be undertaken. I look forward to further progress in the coming months and years with respect to jobless households.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	384	Like other speakers, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, the main purpose of which is to give effect to the back-to-work family dividend scheme flagged in budget 2015. The Bill also addresses a number of other issues and clarifies the circumstances in which a person is considered as requiring full-time care in respect of the application of the carer's benefit, carer's allowance and respite care grant. It also deals with the legislative basis of the means test and its application for students grants, on which I hope to comment later during the course of my contribution, time permitting.Approximately 250,000 people lost their jobs in this country at the height of the recession. The key priority for this Government was to fix our finances and create a pro-jobs environment which would drive job creation. The improvement in our economic fortunes has not been by accident; it is a direct result of the policies which this Government is pursuing. Our unemployment rate now stands at 10.1%, down from a high of 15.1%. The positive indicator from these figures is the fact that our long-term unemployment rate has fallen. In the first quarter of 2012, 204,000 people were defined as long-term unemployed but the figure had decreased to 139,000 by quarter three of 2014, a very significant drop of 32%. Making work pay and protecting supports has been a key priority for this Government. I commend the Minister for Social Protection on the various initiatives which she has introduced. It is important that nobody is left behind as our economy recovers. If a further reduction in the long-term unemployed figures is to be achieved, it is important that so-called welfare traps are removed. That is why the introduction of this back-to-work dividend is so important. It will help families move from social welfare into employment by providing them with financial support whereby they will receive a weekly payment for two years after they return to work. This dividend will be available to those in receipt of jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangements and one-parent family payments, as well as those in specified education, training, supported employment or work placement schemes, including community employment schemes and rural social schemes. However, there is no mention of those who are in receipt of carer's allowance. Perhaps the Minister can clarify that matter in her concluding remarks. I have come across several cases involving constituents whose time as a carer had come to an end, sadly in a number of cases due to the death of their loved ones, only to meet with road blocks in their efforts to get back into work. For example, if a person who was in receipt of carer's allowance wants to participate in the Momentum programme, time spent in receipt of that allowance is not considered and they are deemed ineligible. Carers make an invaluable contribution and they should not be penalised for something that is no fault of their own. They should be supported to get back into the workforce and I ask the Minister to consider including time spent on carer's allowance in the qualifying criteria for access to this payment. Part 2 of the Bill provides clarity on the operation of the carer's benefit, carer's allowance and respite care grants. Under the current system, a person requiring full-time care is assessed and medical evidence is provided from a registered medical practitioner to the Department. The deciding officer makes a determination on the basis of all the information received, including all relevant medical evidence, and if the application is refused there is a system of review and appeal. Section 3 changes the current system so that the deciding officer will have regard to an opinion provided by the Department's medical assessor as well as the medical evidence submitted by a registered medical practitioner. I ask the Minister to clarify this section and the implications the change could have for existing applications or in cases deemed unsuccessful by the deciding officer. What will it mean in terms of appeals? At present further medical evidence is usually submitted with the appeal but if the deciding officer will now take into account the Department's medical assessment and the medical evidence submitted, who is going to review the appeal and will the appeals format change? I am dealing with a number of cases for constituents who have submitted carer's allowance applications last year and are still awaiting a decision on their cases. This is a difficult situation for the applicants, as well as time consuming for the secretaries in our constituency offices and staff in the Department. I am concerned that if the deciding officer has to wait for the medical assessor to make a determination, there will be further delays in processing times. Sections 12(2) and 1(2)(b) specify the various types of income regarded as assessable means for the purpose of calculating means for social assistance. In the area of student grants, given the changes in the family types which now exist there is an anomaly in the current system in the assessment process for cohabiting couples in respect of third level grants. When a cohabiting couple apply for a top-up grant for their child, their reckonable income must include an eligible long-term social welfare payment. The problem arises in cases where the social welfare payment for the entire family unit is in the name of the partner who is not the legal guardian. They will not qualify for the top-up grant because the social welfare payment is not actually being claimed in the name of the parent with whom the partner and child resides even though the parent is receiving a long-term unemployment payment in the form of a qualified adult payment. I raised this last week in the context of the Child and Family Relationships Bill 2014. A change in the criteria is required in order for SUSI to be able to award a grant in these cases. I ask the Minister here today to facilitate these genuine cases. The thrust of this legislation is well intentioned. The saying, "a rising tide lifts all boats" is still true. Overcoming the obstacles that prevent the long-term unemployed from getting back into the workforce is critical if everybody is to share in our economic recovery. Other speakers have referred to issues such as child care, which is a prohibitive cost for many people trying to return to work. While time does not permit me to speak in detail on that issue, I hope something is done to address it in the budget. I understand the issue was raised at the Labour Party conference last weekend. The introduction of the back-to-work dividend is an important step in supporting families to get back into work and in time I have no doubt that it will contribute to a further decrease in our long-term unemployment rate. This Government's goal is to achieve full employment by 2018. We are heading in that direction. There was great news today in that regard, with our unemployment rate down to 10.1%. The news will be even better when we get it down to single digits. I commend the Ministers and Ministers of States in the Departments of Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on their efforts in this regard.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	385	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, which gives rise to a number of issues.The Government has appointed Mr. Bobby Kerr to review the post office network nationally and to establish how more Government work could be put through it. The single biggest income source for the post office network is social welfare payments. It is important that this issue is developed. It is an issue I raised with Deputy Pat Rabbitte when he was the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and I have raised it with his successor, Deputy Alex White, also. It came to my attention recently that when the Revenue Commissioners introduced the local property tax it spent over €500,000 putting a paper-based system in place to collect it. It would have made far more sense to let the sub-post office network operate the paper aspect of that system rather than to require the Revenue Commissioners to put a separate system in place. People could have gone to their local sub-post offices where sub-postmasters could have inputted their data into the system and electronically transferred it. Payments could also have been made at local post offices thereby saving the taxpayer €500,000 in administrative costs. That is just one example. The Department of Social Protection has plenty more. The cost of processing the physical paper forms that must be submitted to the Department is high. As there is a great deal of personal information on some of those forms, I could understand that the Department would not want it being processed through a local sub-post office. However, it is important to remember that postmasters sign the Official Secrets Act. They are the only people outside the public service who sign it and they are in a unique position to deal with many of the schemes that are there at the moment. Significant savings could be made by the Exchequer across the board as we would not have to put an alternative paper-based system in place if we used the services already in place in local communities through our sub-post offices. It is a win-win for everyone. Another bizarre situation that arose involved the new driving licence system which 40 offices across the country are now administering. One must either go online or physically present oneself in one of those offices to make an appointment. For a lot of people that is not possible, particular older people. They are left in a situation where they have to make two journeys; one to make the appointment and the second to go back and fulfil it. Why could that not have been rolled out through the post office network? The technology exists already within the post office network to facilitate it. It would have brought the service to a far more accessible network of sub-post offices across the country, putting more business through them and providing services in communities. Instead, we have made it much harder for people to access. I hope the Minister of State will talk to his colleague in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and postpone any decision to close any post office until Mr. Bobby Kerr's report is published. While I understand the Government is doing that, it should back-date decisions on publication of the report to cover any of the sub-post offices which have been closed since the Government announced this initiative last December. I include in that a post office just outside my constituency at Cappataggle in east Galway. It is well known to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who will support me on that. When the Minister of State comes back to me, he will make the point that An Post signs a contract and must guarantee that 95% of social welfare recipients can access their payments within a 15 km radius of their homes. The Minister of State will say that gives a guarantee that we will have a network right across the country. However, that requirement relates to 95% of the population. If the Minister of State takes his mobile phone and travels to parts of my constituency, he will see that while there is more than 95% coverage for most mobile networks, it is far short of that as he goes west through my constituency and out further. It is easy to meet the criterion of 95% coverage when one is talking about large population centres like Dublin, Cork and Galway. However, people in rural communities who have to travel are looking at round trips of 30 km, or 19 miles, to collect a social welfare payment. While I am on the issue of round trips, I received a letter today from the midlands north west division where again we are seeing the closure of more community welfare officer clinics. The community welfare officer provides a very valuable service. The system is meant to be flexible, particularly for people who are in difficult financial circumstances. They may be accessing social welfare payments but also an emergency payment for a financial crisis a family faces. In rural Ireland, people will not go to a community welfare officer or, as they were known historically, relieving officer, unless they really need to. They just do not go to the relieving officer unless they have to. With the closure of these clinics, Keadew in County Roscommon is now being closed, for example, and relocated to Boyle, which is a 44 km round trip. It is the same as asking someone with no money in his or her pocket here in Dublin city centre to go to Wicklow town for assistance. However, there is no public transport to get there and the person must either get someone to assist with a lift or borrow money to get a taxi. I guarantee the Minister of State that when one goes to the community welfare officer, he or she will not give financial assistance to pay for the taxi needed to get there in the first place to make the case that one needed money for a particular emergency. That is the type of twisted logic we have at the moment. I received notice today that three clinics are about to be closed at Keadew, Ballinlough and Roosky, respectively, in County Roscommon. We should be expanding clinics in some of these rural communities by making them available if not on a weekly basis, then on a fortnightly basis. Instead, we are seeing a reduction in clinics making them less accessible at a time when public transport is being cut. We had an announcement last week from Bus Éireann which is now looking at reducing the bus service from Athlone to Westport. That will directly affect the people in Ballinlough who want to access the community welfare clinic in Castlerea. We are making it far more difficult for people in rural Ireland to get the support they need. I urge the Minister of State to reassess the decision on these and other clinics across the country. I was interested today to see the breakdown in relation to delayed discharges from hospital. People are stuck in hospital who are trying to get out and they are usually older people. Many of them are trying to get into nursing homes while others want to go back to their own homes but cannot because no grab rail is provided or it is not accessible without small works. One of the barriers in this context relates to carer's benefit. It is an issue I raised with the Minister of State before Christmas and I thank him for his assistance in that regard. The delay in processing a carer's benefit application is currently three months. This is an application on behalf of a person who has paid his or her PRSI over a long number of years and wants to take a period out of employment in order to care for an older or disabled person. He or she applies for carer's benefit, having had to give notice to his or her employer of his or her intention to leave work. Usually, a person will tell the employer he or she will be leaving in four weeks given that the case is black and white in terms, for example, of a mother's complete disability and an uncontested medical assessment. Given that the person has been paying PRSI for 20 years, for example, he or she will consider that there is no issue in relation to the required contribution. Nevertheless, it takes 12 weeks to process that application. There is no justification for that period of time. The reason, of course, is that the handful of staff in Longford is inundated by the volume of applications.Only a handful of staff is available to process these applications and no additional resources have been provided for them. In fairness to them, they are more than accommodating in trying to facilitate people, particularly in emergency cases, but all cases are emergencies and the staff can only do so much. I urge the Minister of State to provide the resources required. There is a lack of joined-up thinking between Departments and also the problem of silos. The Department of Social Protection and the Department of Health are not joined. For example, because carer's benefit or carer's allowance has not been approved for a person, his or her elderly relative cannot leave hospital and it is costing the State €850 a night to keep him or her in a hospital bed because we are not prepared to process an application for €230 a week in order that he or she can return home, have some dignity and remain there for as long as possible. In the interests of those poor human beings who are in Guantánamo, in accident and emergency departments across the country, in the interests of those patients who are lying on trolleys or who, sadly, do not even have the opportunity to lie on a trolley and are queueing to be given a chair in an accident and emergency department, I ask the Minister of State to please prioritise this issue, release beds in order that patients in accident and emergency departments can be given hospital beds. This problem has arisen because we are not providing the resources needed to process applications for carer's allowance or carer's benefit and it would make far more sense to do so. I will make one further point on the need for joined-up thinking. There are many thousands in low-paid employment who do not know that they are entitled to a top-up payment from the Department of Social Protection in the form of family income supplement. If they have children and are financially better off on the live register rather than working, the Department has a very innovative and positive scheme - family income supplement - but there is a significant problem in increasing the uptake of the scheme. Rather than waiting for people to apply for the payment, I ask Department staff to pick up the telephone and call the Revenue Commissioners to ask for a list of those on low pay. The Department could write to them and ask if they have children and if they are in low-paid employment and in such cases that they may be eligible for family income supplement. The Department could identify such families by linking child benefit payments with those in low-paid employment through the PRSI database. Revenue and the Department have improved their data sharing in cases in which people are claiming benefits while in employment and paying PRSI. We should make efforts to encourage people to stay in employment by offering the possibility of a top-up payment which would makes things manageable for them and help them to make ends meet. We could be proactive and employ joined-up thinking instead of having departmental silos where the Department of Social Protection will not talk to the Revenue Commissioners and where the Revenue Commissioners will not talk to the Department of Social Protection. This would ensure access to the scheme for those who need it. A related issue is highlighted by a conversation I had this week with an employer in my constituency. This employer offered work to four people at a rate of €10.75 an hour, which is higher than the minimum wage. Each of these individuals was receiving between €340 and €370 a week in social welfare payments and each of them refused the work being offered. They were quite willing to take the job if they were paid cash in hand, but they were not prepared to take it if it was to go through the books. One of the issues raised was the loss of the medical card, while some of them were not prepared to take up full-time employment. These anomalies need to be removed from the system. The employer took on an employee under the JobsPlus scheme; the person concerned had been unemployed for seven years. The employer only recently became aware of the JobsPlus scheme and is very happy with the employee. The opportunities for that individual to find paid employment would have been virtually nil without access to the JobsPlus scheme. Schemes are available, but in many cases employers do not know about them. As in the case of family income supplement, employers need to be made aware of them.  I refer to the barriers in taking up employment. Another employer told me that he was offering a job for five half days a week, but he could not find anyone to take it. This is understandable because anyone who takes up the offer will lose his or her social welfare payments because of the regulation that a person who works five days a week is not entitled to such payments. That aspect of the system needs to be changed. People are being precluded from gaining access to employment because of this rule and employers are precluded from offering part-time employment which might turn into a full-time job in time. I welcome the announcement today of possible tax changes for the self-employed. This is a very positive development. Self-employed persons are the risk takers, the ones who are prepared to take a gamble, take on additional employees in the hope they can make things work while developing the business. However, the self-employed do not have a safety net. The Tánaiste spoke about making changes to the long-term disability or illness benefit scheme, but nothing has been announced to date. Those who are prepared to take a gamble and ready to grow their business and, by extension, the prospects for others to gain employment are the real drivers of the economy. They need to have both a short-term and long-term safety net if they get sick. If a business goes to the wall, the employees will have a safety net, but the employer will not. This needs to change. My final point is topical as it relates to the proposals to be put in the same-sex marriage referendum. One of my constituents worked with a major catering company and then moved to work in her partner's business. She continued to pay PRSI class A contributions until she walked up the aisle to get married. She walked down with far fewer rights, as she could no longer pay class A contributions purely because she was married. The fact that she was in a relationship with her partner had made no difference until her date of marriage, but once she got married, she could no longer continue to make these contributions. She was blatantly informed that, in the view of the Department of Social Protection, her husband should provide for her from that date forward. This is an anomaly in the system and it is one of those marriage bars that have historically been in place in the social welfare system. This question will arise again for many more people should the referendum be passed later this year. I ask the Minister of State to remove this anomaly because people should not be discriminated against because they happen to get married.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	387	I welcome the Bill and support its provisions generally. I will deal first with the two clarifications provided for in section 3 in respect of qualification for carer's benefit, carer's allowance and the carer's respite care grant. These clarifications are necessary and should be welcomed, even though, on the face of it, it seems they might make eligibility more difficult. In reality, all of us who live in families give some level of care, at some time, to other members of our immediate or extended family. This is as it should be and most people do it gladly and with no expectation of payment. The majority do that caring work in conjunction either with work in the home or in a place of employment. Having been a carer, I am aware there is a continuum of care required, depending on the level of need. At one end of the scale would be people with a minor dependency which requires a minor level of care while, at the other end, there are people who are totally dependent on their carers. I clearly recall the debate leading up to the introduction of the carer's allowance. It was specifically envisaged as a maintenance payment to people caring for individuals with a level of dependency such that no remunerated employment was possible for the carer. It was never intended as a compensation for people who provide the type of caring most of us do at some point and which people always did in the past. There is a cohort of people, however, as identified by Deputy Harrington, who fall between the two stools. These people are not so involved in caring that it takes all of their time, but nor are they free to take up employment in the way most of us are. Identifying these people and the particular disincentives to employment they face is important if we are to support those who genuinely want to return to work while, at the same time, continuing to provide some level of care. The clarification of the level of care and attention required for eligibility for the carer's allowance as it exists now and provision for the verification of that eligibility by a medical assessor from the Department are essential to ensure the scheme remains viable, is not abused and will remain available to those who are giving full-time care and are genuinely dependent on the payment. Moving on to other aspects of the Bill, I particularly congratulate the Minister on the provisions in sections 4 and 6. Both of these measures give long overdue recognition to the trap that exists for people who have been out of the workforce for extended periods. The Minister has targeted these issues in the past and the various anomalies that exist. These provisions serve to change the role of the State from one of providing payments for unemployment to one of providing incentives to employment. As Deputy Harrington noted, it is very important to offer people who have been long-term unemployed the opportunity to improve their standard of living, avail of the dignity work brings and give them and their family some hope for the future. When one has been out of the workforce for years, there may be real financial barriers to returning to work, particularly where the opportunities for employment, initially at least, are in low-paid jobs. In addition, at the outset, it may be that only part-time employment can be entertained, particularly in the case of lone parents. We are gradually addressing these barriers, which traditionally have made unemployment more rewarding financially than a return to work. Deputy Naughten spoke about how the loss of a medical card, particularly for families with children, can represent such a loss that the possibility of taking up employment becomes a real challenge. Tackling those anomalies by, for instance, the introduction of free GP care for children under six, is a vital step in assisting people to return to work. Where there are several children in a family, having a medical card can be crucial. In addition to the financial considerations people will take into account when contemplating taking up a job, there are psychological disincentives. Being out of the workforce for a long time can mean people lack confidence or their skills, particularly technical skills, are out of date. This can rule them out of the running for jobs for which they might have been qualified in the past. An especially welcome aspect of these measures is their recognition that there are multifaceted issues for people moving from dependence to employment. The provisions seek to deal with those issues, in so far as the State can do so. Sometimes, of course, it is necessary to acknowledge that the State cannot do everything. The provision that part-time or temporary work arrangements will not preclude qualification for the jobseeker's transitional allowance for lone parents is a crucial measure. For parents who may well have been out of the workforce for many years and may in the past have never even considered going back to work, this is a real incentive to contemplate so doing. The back-to-work dividend is targeted particularly at families, and rightly so because it this cohort for whom a return to work can be a particularly costly undertaking. Deputy Naughten observed that some people have turned down jobs simply because benefits, particularly their eligibility for a medical card, offer such an advantage relative to those available from low-paid work. By allowing welfare payments people receive while unemployed to remain in place for two years, these measures provide a cushion for families in that crucial period when parents are returning to work, and will apply equally to jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's transitional payments and one-parent family benefit. As Deputy Breen noted, however, this provision does not apply to people coming off carer's allowance. I expect this is an oversight and I ask the Minister to review it. By any assessment of fairness, those people should be included. In addition, the Bill recognises that returning to work may require access to certain specified training, supported employment work placement schemes and so on. There are other disincentives to returning to work, each of which the Minister is tackling gradually. One that comes to mind because I was discussing it earlier with several colleagues is the difficulty that arises for people as they transition from a weekly welfare payment to a monthly salary. The challenges this presents can actually preclude people from taking up employment because they simply cannot survive for a month without any income. The problem is exacerbated because community welfare officers cannot use their discretion to assist people who are in employment. That is another anomaly we should examine to see whether anything can be done to address it. Certainly, the ability to help people in those circumstances should be included as one of the areas of discretion for community welfare officers. It is not an issue for everybody, but for those without back-up family support or the ability to borrow from a credit union, for instance, there would be a much better chance of their returning to employment if that facility were available. Deputy Áine Collins mentioned a case she was aware of where a person gave up a job recently because she had borrowed so much and put herself so far behind in her first month of employment. That is tragic. Jobs are not yet so plentiful that we can afford to have people falling into that type of trap. Having said that, the figures released today showing falling unemployment levels right across the country are very welcome. Now that we are beginning to see more new jobs available month on month, the measures in the Bill are timely. The legislation includes measures to deal with social welfare fraud. For as long as I can remember, this has been a major issue. I congratulate the Minister on her efforts to tackle it, which have led to a significant improvement in this area. We owe it to taxpayers, who fund all the benefits people receive, to do so. We also owe it to those who are in genuine need of support. If benefits are to remain available, it is imperative that it is not seen as speaking out of turn to report instances of suspected fraud.It is absolutely essential that fraud be wiped out of the system and that the system is perceived to be absolutely clear and fair. Otherwise, taxpayers rightly will object to a system that is not perceived to be entirely fair and is not a system in which every possible effort is made to ensure there is no fraud.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	388	I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this important Bill. I acknowledge and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, for being present today and wish to raise a couple of items. Part of me was somewhat reluctant to comment on community employment schemes because of the contribution by Deputy Connaughton, for which I was present in the Chamber. However, another part of me wished to speak in support of his comments. I am approaching this issue from a real-life experience, having worked in an earlier life as a FÁS community employment scheme supervisor for eight happy and quite rewarding years. On taking up that post in 1995, which now is 20 years ago, one thing I appreciated deeply from the outset was the value of a community employment scheme for many people, including some who probably would never find themselves in mainstream employment. In my community in Lucan, a number of those community employment schemes were wound up over the years because full employment was about to be reached and I had hoped that at least one scheme would remain for the very reason I have identified. Through networking with other schemes and supervisors over those years, I gained a further appreciation of the importance of community employment schemes because many people who participated in such schemes probably would never aspire to employment as most of us would know it. Moreover, it had a value in keeping some people out of pubs, bed or bookmakers' offices and in keeping others out of hospitals and off medications. It was a real benefit to the quality of life of some of those who participated in some of these schemes nationwide. At that time, I found myself with a deep appreciation of the value of community employment schemes and I suspect that value still remains today for those people. I acknowledge the Minister and the Department of Social Protection are very much constrained and restricted because of the financial circumstances but I make the point that it is important to maintain focus on, as well as interest and investment in, community employment schemes for some of those reasons. The other point I wish to make pertains to post offices. A number of Members have referred to post offices, including Deputy Naughten for whose contribution I was present. Sometimes one does not get the full picture. I acknowledge there have been financial restrictions and reconsideration of the locations of post offices. As for my own community in Lucan, however, on becoming a Deputy four years ago, I engaged with An Post in what I thought was a meaningful fashion and I acknowledge and thank An Post for that. The net result of this work over the past three and a half to four years has meant the opening of a new post office in Lucan. As someone told me recently, we probably are bucking the trend in this regard. Nevertheless, the point I wish to make is that where there is real engagement and the putting forward of a proper case study, in my experience I have found An Post to be fair and amenable. In this case, such engagement marked the agreement to open a new post office, which hopefully will take place within the next few weeks. Reference was made to social welfare. I have engaged with the Minister, Deputy Burton, and her Department over the past four years. Lucan, for example, is the fastest growing community in Ireland but does not have a social welfare office at present and I ask the Minister of State to make note of this point. I acknowledge there are particular issues relating to the acquisition of the suitable modern facility that is required but because of the particular circumstances in Lucan, I believe there is a definite need for a facility. Finally, I congratulate the Minister and her departmental officials on the work they have undertaken on fraud over the past four years since the Minister took office. There has been significant improvement in this regard. While more is needed because outstanding issues remain, there has been remarkable effort and investment, which is to be welcomed. I wish the Minister, her officials and the Department continued success. Members may be aware of the old story from years ago about when someone got on a bus. From my earliest days, I can remember hearing people tell the bus conductor "here are a few pence, go ahead". What was happening was the person concerned was paying under the rate and the bus conductor then pocketed it. However, the net result was the fares were increased for the rest of the people. For as long as fraud continues to take place, the people of Ireland are paying for it. Everyone will benefit in wishing the Minister every continued success in her efforts, as well as those of her Department, to eradicate the scourge that is fraud.

I must confess that even after everything that has happened since 2011, I am surprised by how condescending and how out of touch was the Minister's speech, its tone and some of the nuanced language here this afternoon on certain aspects of social welfare fraud. I found that clearly, there is an increasing detachment on the part of the Government with respect to the reality of people's lives. The Minister, clearly understanding the changes she proposes to make to the payments to lone-parent families mainly will have an impact on women, stated, "As a woman, I simply do not understand why [receiving welfare payments] would be a more attractive option than becoming involved in education or training". All the lone parents who have approached me with their concerns are women. They are approaching me, are contacting Members' offices and are in distress about the Labour Party's proposed changes with respect to the lone-parent family payment. They are mystified as to how the Minister seems to have deliberately ignored the concerns of these women but in particular, has ignored the child care costs. Not one welfare dependency has been discussed in this House today from a Government perspective without dealing with the main block in this regard. Members can talk about training and employment opportunities but not once have they heard any talk about the Scandinavian model of child care that has hundreds of women attending the offices of Members of this House about the impending changes to lone parents' payments. Once upon a time, the Minister would recall a different reality for women on low incomes because in 2012, she declared she would introduce a Scandinavian style of child care. There have been three successive austere and regressive budgets and one still discerns a rarefied attitude on the part of the Government about the area of child care. Child care costs remain as the elephant in the room of this debate in terms of enabling women - it is primarily women - to engage in employment, training or education. Last week, my colleague, Deputy Troy, presented a roadmap for the provision of adequate child care needs of families in Ireland. I acknowledge it was expensive and no one believes it can be delivered as a yellow-pack proposal. However, Members must begin to move on this issue if these changes are going to be sustainable. I wonder whether the Minister or her colleagues really believed that the Scandinavian style of child care she promised would ever be delivered; I doubt it. I got my answer in the headline of today's edition of The Irish Times, which states the recovery allows for income tax cuts. That is the core of this issue because the Government is not interested in extending State services in child care.It is only interested in protecting existing services or running them down to prioritise tax cuts for the well-off but some Government Deputies, however, claim they are social democrats. There has still not been one proposal on how we will enable women to re-engage, retrain and reskill to get back into the workforce. What exactly is the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection’s problem with women? Of the 38 cuts, changes and reductions in entitlements, totalling €1,431 million, which she has imposed on low-income families and individuals, eight of them, totalling €438 million and almost one third of the total, have been targeted at payments that predominately affect women and their children. That figure does not include the vicious attack on maternity payments introduced by the Government. Lone parents, again predominately women, are the main target of this Bill. It is beyond understanding how anyone concerned with poverty rates could focus cuts and deprivations on this cohort in society and vote in favour of these measures. Since 2012, the consistent poverty rate among lone-parent families has increased from 17.4% to 23%. The deprivation rate now stands at over 63%. The cuts the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection has imposed have contributed to this increase. The measures she now proposes in the absence of adequate child care provision will only increase them again. Will she postpone this proposal until clear front-loaded investment is made in child care provision? Yesterday, Deputy Willie O'Dea outlined to the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection the monetary effect her proposals will have on the domestic circumstances of the most vulnerable people in our society. She must take heed of his statement of these simple mathematical facts and radically amend this Bill on Committee Stage. The Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection’s assumption, explicitly stated in her Second Stage speech yesterday, that lone parents can simply increase their working hours at will is evidence of her detachment from the reality of the lives of those affected. As I said yesterday during the debate on the issue of family home repossessions, I have a sense that I am looking across the Chamber at a Government that no longer sees ordinary individuals and their families at the end of their decisions. The Government sees euro and cent, percentages and statistics, pluses and minuses but it fails to see any interest in the reality of what is occurring in people's lives. Contrary to her claims yesterday that there had been proper consultation with representative organisations of lone parents, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection must listen to them properly. The stakeholder group, One Family, states the issues relating to lone parents have been known since 2012 and lack of planning and implementation in respect of such parents is of major concern. It finds it quite astonishing that research on labour activation among lone parents is only being commissioned now and will become available in June when 39,000 lone parents are due to be activated on 2 July. The major concern for One Family in this regard relates to the lack of planning, support and information provided and responsibility taken by the Department of Social Protection in these actions. Along with SPARK, Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, One Family also states child care is one of the main barriers to entering employment. A two-parent family will spend 34% of its income on child care but a one-parent family will spend 53% of net income. There needs to be affordable, accessible and quality child care, underpinned with a sense of urgency, to facilitate those affected, mainly women, to return to the workplace. All stakeholders observe that lone-parent families are already among the poorest in society and are not in a position to withstand any further cuts to their incomes. FLAC, the Free Legal Aid Centres, called for the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection to carry out a social impact analysis of this Bill's measures. There have been debates in this House on the need to equality-proof such measures. While I welcome any proposals with respect to this that may emerge in the near future, we need to equality-proof this Bill and the proposals for payments to lone-parent families this summer. The rhetoric must be put to one side and such an analysis carried out. As it stands, this Bill is a retrograde and austere initiative which will affect the most vulnerable in society, the very people holding on by a thread. Another measure missing from this Bill is a move to reverse the cuts to jobseeker’s allowance imposed on those under the age of 26. The Labour Party passed a proposal at its annual conference last week to reverse this cut. Leaving aside the issue of discrimination against the young, there is another discrimination that in other contexts would rightfully be forbidden under equality legislation, namely the indirect impact of such measures on minority groups such as the Traveller community. Last Monday, I had an example of such a case in my constituency office, one which I know will resonate with the Minister of State opposite, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, because he too is connected to the front line. Many Travellers marry young and this has left many of them and their families in a precarious situation. My case this week involved a young man who is an amateur boxer with 17 provincial medals representing his province, nine national titles and three silver medals representing his country at European level. This young man, his wife and their two children have been reduced by this Government's social welfare policy to living with his parents-in-law and sister-in-law - seven people in total - in a three-bedroom house. These are the cuts that have forced people to make sacrifices that should never happen in any modern decent society. He and his family have been four years on a housing waiting list while their rent allowance and other social protection payments have been cut. Good people who have represented their country at the highest sporting level are forced to make such decisions.Was it equality-proofed, no more than the decision to attack women in this country? I ask the Minister of State to suspend this initiative, leave it to one side, equality-proof it and stop using this fake language. The language used has been pathetic; we would not hear it from the Tories. What is going on in this Chamber? The Labour Party has not protected core social welfare payments and its own youth wing has confirmed it. Appalling language is used in the most draconian attacks, whether on the under 26s or lone parents. It is unacceptable. The language used this morning by the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, in her comments on the Bill was also appalling. She has morphed into the Taoiseach and lost her touch with people. No right-minded person would proceed with this measure in June and July this year, discommoding thousands of families on the edge. I ask the Minister of State to listen to the stakeholders who have spoken about this and say it is insanity. Where are the other Labour Party Deputies? Where are the troops on this one? I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, is very hardworking. He is the salt of the earth and knows what I am really talking about. He hears the same stuff in his clinics. I know him to be assiduous, which is not in dispute. I am asking him to do the right thing and not to attack the most vulnerable. There is no argument that can equal those set out by Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and the Social Policy and Aging Research Centre, SPARC. The impact on vulnerable persons can be addressed by the Minister of State in providing for a pause. I ask him to go to the committee and start amending this legislation. In the interests of social cohesion, I ask him not to let the legacy of the Government be the continual attacks on the most vulnerable in society.  I was appalled this morning when I looked at The Irish Times. It is now cheerleading on the issue of tax cuts. We are going to cut taxes for the well-off and continue to attack and fry the most vulnerable. That is appalling. Where are the social democrats?

The Minister of State knows deep down that it is wrong and he should not let these Tories twist his arm. He can do the right thing and leave a proud legacy. He was put into government to protect the most vulnerable and this is an opportunity to do so. The Minister of State should think about the consequences for families, mainly women, who are already struggling. The impact on their pockets will be significant, no matter how we do the maths. This is going to leave a distasteful legacy among many other very difficult decisions the Government has had to make and it is completely unnecessary. It does not add to anything in terms of progression. I hear people in the corridors asking if the Labour Party has done a deal to sell Aer Lingus. Let us not politicise this issue. The Minister of State should man up and protect the people in question. There is a wonderful opportunity to slow down this measure on Committee Stage, listen to stakeholders and do the right thing.

This scheme will allow some people who have ceased claiming jobseeker's allowance or the one-parent family payment by moving into or increasing their hours of employment since 5 January 2015 to hang on to their qualified child payments for the first 12 months and half the amount for a further 12. Collectively, most of us in the House welcome this provision and on that basis will not be opposing the Bill. However, as other speakers have said, the Bill is a missed opportunity to do much more to improve social protection which has come under strain from the Government's two-tier recovery project, as all sides of the House would agree. The back-to-work family dividend, though a welcome development, fails to compensate for the incremental cuts already made for lone parents, a point that was touched on by the last speaker, nor does it take into account the changes that will be made this July when the cut-off age for receipt of the one-parent family payment scheme is lowered to seven years, with a significant consequential loss of income for lone parents in work on low pay. At the beginning of February the Central Statistics Office, CSO, published its annual survey of income and living conditions and the findings pointed to the rocketing rates of deprivation amongst lone-parent households. We were all concerned about the figures, which seem to be following a pattern. The CSO has reported that 63% of lone-parent households are now living without basic necessities and additionally are strained by the absence of affordable after-school care. Many of us have been arguing about the crisis in this sector for years. This should have been a wake-up call for the Minister for Social Protection and another reason for her to abandon her proposals to lower the cut-off age for receipt of the one-parent family payment. If this savage cut goes ahead on 2 July, almost 12,000 lone parents will suffer a financial loss of up to €86 per week. Even for those from a wealthy background, taking €86 from someone's income represents a huge loss, particularly so for those already suffering from deprivation. Children in lone-parent households are being forced to go without heating in their homes, or a warm coat or sufficient food. How many more children will be forced to go without new clothes, a joint of meat or a birthday party this summer when their mother's or father's weekly income suddenly drops by €30, €50 or even €86? The figures from the tenancy protection service which was set up as an emergency measure to protect families facing homelessness in Dublin show that more than 60% of households seeking urgent assistance are lone-parent households. We received figures the other day for the numbers of people facing homelessness who were being forced out because they could not afford the rent in much of the accommodation available in Dublin. Does the Minister of State agree that the cuts will lead to greater deprivation?They will result in more families facing homelessness. I again take this opportunity to urge the Minister to abandon her plans to lower the cut-off age to seven next July. I call for the deletion of section 3, which concerns eligibility for caring payments, such as the carer's allowance, the carer's benefit and the respite care grant. The Government presented this as a benign change of a technical nature but FLAC, the independent law centre, said it does not seem to have any other purpose except to make it more difficult for carers to access income supports. In what direction are we going? It seems to be part of the process to make it more difficult for people to access what they are entitled to. FLAC believes this to be the case because it alters the conditions for eligibility by introducing a presumption that claimants are ineligible unless they can prove otherwise. This constitutes an unacceptable shift in the burden of proof placed on the applicant. I am putting forward weaknesses in the Bill. I hope the Minister of State is listening and can come up with some changes. FLAC is in no doubt that this will have the effect of increasing the number of legitimate claims that are rejected which will, in turn, lead to a corresponding increase in the number of appeals submitted to the social welfare appeals office. This is completely unacceptable because according to the social welfare appeals office report in 2013, an average of 58% of those appealing decisions in respect of carer's payments were successful. We have a situation where it is almost part of the system for someone to apply for the grant, to be turned down, to appeal and to perhaps wait two years after which he or she possibly gets the grant. It is a crazy system at which we again need to look. It prevents people who are entitled to the payment from getting it. In addition, the appeals process can take six months, although at one stage it took up to two years. The proposed amendment would increase the rate of appeals and cause further delays in processing appeals, resulting in undue hardship and distress for claimants who are entitled to this payment. We have all had individuals come to our advice centres to talk about their personal circumstances and how this is impacting on them. Unfortunately, the Bill does not reverse the Government's policies, which are based on low-paid, insecure and precarious work and actually increase the need for social welfare to subsidise poverty wages into the future. The Government needs to end measures which actively drive down wages, including JobBridge and the soon to be commenced JobPath. The Minister of State is a cheerleader for those schemes but my experience has been the opposite of his. I am sure some people swear it has worked for them but, unfortunately, it is the opposite in the majority of cases with which I am dealing. Although some individuals have had a positive experience, the scheme leaves thousands of jobseekers vulnerable to exploitation. Last week's damning report on JobBridge by the National Youth Council of Ireland confirms this viewpoint. Some 44% of those surveyed in the report believe they were treated as free labour. How can we treat people like that in a fair society? People believe they are being exploited. Key stakeholders and unions unanimously agree that the JobBridge scheme is failing young people by displacing paid work and compounding unemployment. The scheme maximises the benefits to the employers through free labour and the Government through lower live register figures, while minimising any real benefits to workers. Sinn Féin is committed to bringing about a fair recovery. It is focused on getting people back to work and bringing our young people home. My colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, brought forward an alternative, which was launched two weeks ago. This alternative envisaged a substantial increase in the range of apprenticeships available. The model Sinn Féin proposes would not displace apprenticeships, paid in-work training or jobs but it would afford those genuinely in need of some work experiences with meaningful opportunity. Tailored internships would be developed sector by sector in full co-operation with trade unions and the education training boards. Employers would be supported to be the best mentor that they can be. Sinn Féin's proposals will maximise decent pay for decent work. We will support the Bill but we have concerns in regard to elements of it.

We have the Low Pay Commission which we are told will be a panacea for tackling issues around low pay but the Labour Party has fundamentally undermined the remit of the group's work by simply limiting its remit to the minimum wage. This was a wasted opportunity and it failed to take into account the lessons learned by the British Low Pay Commission. An independent report on low pay, which was endorsed by the Labour Party's sister party in Britain, called for a strengthened role for the Low Pay Commission in tackling poverty and a new role across sectors where low pay is prevalent. There is not a single mention of inequality or low pay in the legislation that will underpin the work of the Low Pay Commission and the Government has taken no action in regard to zero hour contracts. It is currently waiting for a report to tell it what everyone knows. It could have received the necessary data if it had simply tasked the CSO with collecting data on zero hour contracts as part of the quarterly national household survey. This is done currently by the Office of the Central Statistics in Britain. The sad fact is that the Government, of which the Minister of State is part, has deepened inequality in our society and insecure and badly-paid work is now embedded in the labour market.The sad fact is that the Government Labour has been a part of has deepened inequality in our society.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	395	This Bill has many shortcomings and is disappointing in many ways. The new system of allowing those returning to work from the jobseeker's or one-parent family payments to hold on to qualified child increases for 12 months will make a difference to those it applies to. The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the back-to-work family dividend announced in budget 2015. This scheme will allow some people who cease claiming jobseeker's allowance or the one-parent family payment by moving into employment or increasing their hours of employment from 5 January 2015, to hang onto their qualified child increases of €29.80 per child for up to four children, for the first 12 months and half that for a further 12 months. In that respect I welcome the Bill but it is a missed opportunity to roll back on the less favourable moves by this Government in regard to social welfare payments and the social welfare system generally. This Bill will affect all too few people because we still have a lack of good jobs, regardless of what the Government would lead us to believe. The jobs a person leaving unemployment can obtain today are generally low paid, insecure and precarious. The maintenance of certain social welfare payments is all the more necessary because if a worker was to take one of these positions without those payments they would be disadvantaged by taking up the jobs. They would be disadvantaged not, as some Thatcherite voices including the Tánaiste might claim, because they are lazy and they do not want to work and just live on the meagre pittance of social welfare payments. They would be disadvantaged because they would lose that pittance and have it replaced by another pittance for the pleasure of working for a company that does not see fit to pay its workers enough to live in any level of comfort. The Tánaiste and this Government have clearly set their goal for the social welfare system to be a crutch to exploitative employers who would rather not pay their workers for the work they do. We see this in the exploitation of young workers with the JobBridge, Gateway and First Steps schemes, which seek to undermine that principle that a part of Labour should strive to uphold and protect, that a fair day’s work deserves a fair day's pay. The idea that young people, some with degree certificates, diplomas and apprenticeships, will be forced into a free labour scheme which provides no training in many cases is scandalous and something the Labour Party, if it does not cease to exist in the near future, will look on with great shame in years to come. There are people being threatened with a cut to their entitlements if they do not take up a role as a trainee chip-cutter, juicer or labourer. The JobBridge site is full of ads for recruitment companies. The irony seems to be lost on them. It would not be lost on the intern getting €50 on top of their dole to work getting other people paying jobs. The businesses that exploit this are an insult to the people who run their company and pay their workers for work done. What is equally shocking are the ads for highly specialised workers who have worked hard and trained already for their qualifications. The prevalence of universities like Trinity College advertising for research assistants when they already underpay PhD students, who are overworked in labs doing important research, is truly shocking and an utter disgrace. Through this and other cuts to exceptional needs payments and supplementary supports the Government is creating a two-tier social welfare system, which barely supports the unemployed while propping up exploitative businesses and promoting low pay. Who would want to believe that the Labour Party would be such an active cheerleader for driving down wages, displacing workers and undermining organised labour? The point of social protection is to protect those worst off from poverty, not to place everyone from the unemployed to low-paid workers into a pit of poverty. This Government must cease all measures that actively drive down wages including JobBridge and the about to be commenced JobPath. The dividend in this Bill is welcome but it does not come close to compensating for the myriad cuts already made to the supports lone parents depend on. This July we will have another one when the cut-off age for the one-parent family payment scheme is further lowered to seven years with significant consequential loss of weekly income for lone parents who are in work, but on low incomes. I must also oppose strongly section 3 concerning eligibility for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant. This will make it more difficult for people to successfully apply for these payments and so there will be more appeals and more delays. We already have people waiting up to one year for an appeal. If anything, these criteria are far too strict. It is an utter disgrace that we are paying €5,000 a month in some cases to private homes like the one owned by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, but the State seems to do everything it can to deny €800 a month for a carer to look after their loved ones in their home.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	399	I think there are only two of us. There has been a lack of trust in politics. Part of the reason for that is that what is said does not match the reality in people's lives. They can see that very well. Terms like "protecting the core rates of social welfare" are used. The core rates were protected, but many things were lost, for example, in the case of pensioners there were losses of things like the telephone allowance, the electricity allowance and things like that, which did matter for people's income. People know that the language of Government is different from their reality. The one type of legislation I will always examine in an almost forensic manner, is legislation coming from the Department of Social Protection, because it is, by a mile, the worst offender. I am not referring to the Department itself, rather to the Minister. I regret that this is coming from the Labour Party. This Bill comes at the time of the mantra, "the age of austerity is over". There were good numbers yesterday in terms of tax take. That is to be welcomed, but when it comes to redistribution, it appears that will be on the tax side rather than on the investment in services side. There are two particular elements in this Bill, which is presented as a family dividend. That presents it in a very positive light. When it comes to July, it will not be at all positive for those who will be losing a great deal of money, for example, if a person has a seven year old and does not happen to have a family member who can support them. There is a presumption that everybody has family members to support them. The stereotype that was presented in the Minister's speech last night of the age cohort that constitutes lone parents does not mirror the reality. It goes across a wide age range. What does one do with a seven year old if one has no option but to go to work? What does one do if one does not have family to fall back on? The €29.80 per child per week works out at about €120 or €130 per month. Child care costs about €800 to €1,000 per month.There is little in the way of community child care services. They are patchy. Let us consider what happened in Britain. One need not look at the Scandinavian model. Like many others, I was in the Chamber when the Tánaiste asserted that this change would not happen until child care services were in place. She could not have been more categoric. In Britain the Labour Party's sister party used several clever approaches to support lone parents in returning to work while providing child care services. Many were offered places on accredited child care training programmes, effectively creating a child care workforce. The UK Government provided tax credits in respect of child care costs. It used EU money, a fund that was open to Ireland but not availed of by us, to send people on employability courses. It was called the Train to Gain programme. Although some of it has, unfortunately, been rolled back and significantly restricted by the Conservative Party, one would have expected a similarly progressive approach to be adopted by the Government. For some, there are many poverty traps that do not just make work unattractive but unaffordable. It is not only a question of child care provision, although that is the major one. If one works more than a certain number of hours, one loses rent assistance and the housing assistance payment, HAP, has not been rolled out everywhere. The Minister of State knows all of this. That is why it is so difficult to fathom why this change is proceeding. While Deputies will not want to vote against the family dividend, it will reinforce the policy of returning people to work when their children reach seven years of age. For that reason, I cannot support it. If a seven year old was left at home on his or her own, the HSE would be sent in and the child taken away from the parent, rightly so, because he or she would be too young to care for himself or herself. If someone does not have family to rely on or money, what is he or she to do? My second concern about the legislation relates to an issue that smacks of the same redefinition that occurred in the case of special needs assistants, SNAs, where the reclassification meant reduced numbers and the work being done was subsequently deemed to be minimal. I am referring to the redefinition of those who are considered to be in need of full-time care. It appears that the Bill will tighten the definition. Such issues can be complicated and every one is unique. My fear is that there will be wholesale refusals. I am not talking about armageddon, but wholesale refusals are typical in other contexts. It is alarming that the decision has been moved from the medical assessor. The Department has had a difficulty in retaining medical assessors. I have asked numerous parliamentary questions on this matter. The new deciding officer will essentially be an administrator who will second guess the letters of proof for which people have paid consultants and the like. Applications will be refused by people who do not have the medical qualifications to make such judgments. Moves such as this can be found throughout the changes made by the Department of Social Protection. Wherever there is a long-term obligation, the Department tries to determine whether an application can be refused or changes the rules to refuse it. I realise that, although matters are improving, money is still tight, but there is a presumption of refusal now rather than of entitlement. Often, people suddenly find themselves acting as carers. They must leave work and getting decisions is difficult, even though they need them quickly. If they are to be refused wholesale, the decision-making process will be stretched. Invariably, judgments favour those who appeal. As such, we should be concerned about making this change, which I cannot support. The legislation could have done a great deal more to roll back on certain measures. Recently, I spoke to a young woman who had left care at the age of 18 years to live with a parent. Her parent died within months, something that had formed part of the reason she was in care. She is entitled to €100 per week. It is difficult to get one's head around this next point, but her income is too low to enable her to qualify for a medical card. It is not the first time that I have encountered such a case. When a constituent contacted me previously about getting his property tax deducted from his social welfare payments, the Department of Social Protection told me that it could not do so because he would have found himself below a level that would have been insufficient on which to live. Anomalies such as these show what can occur in a system that has been designed like ours. The Government's approach to lone parents will have long-term consequences because families will have to struggle with poverty and do without if they are to look after their children. When the effect on children is known, people will ask who made the decision. Unfortunately, it is the party that they believed would protect them in government.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	400	I am delighted to have time, for which I thank the Technical Group, to contribute to the debate on this Bill. According to the Government, its main purpose is to provide for the introduction of a new back to work family dividend, as announced in budget 2015, to help jobseekers with families and lone parents to return to work. "Back to work family dividend" are lovely words; I wonder who the scriptwriters were and I mean no disrespect to the staff of the Department. I am shocked that a Labour Party Minister would introduce this Bill. I have great time for the Tánaiste who has done much good, but she should see that this is a failure and not go ahead with it. I sat on the Government benches for a number of years before the current Government took office. I heard the Tánaiste, while she was on this side of the House, make many good and passionate pleas for single parents and those on lower incomes. I listened carefully to Deputy Colm Keaveney who was part of the Labour Party's platform at the last general election. He spoke passionately about the ideals the Labour Party had put before the people and from whence it had come. The Labour Party was founded in my town of Clonmel more than 100 years ago. It has a proud record of service, including by a former Ceann Comhairle who is still alive, Mr. Seán Treacy, and others. It is now the mud guard of a regressive and repressive Government, peddling this so-called legislation and, worse still, voting for same. Where is its social conscience? What has happened to it in four years? It knew where the books were before it entered government. It was going to burn the bondholders. The fires of Hell were not going to be as hot as the ones the bondholders would make. The Labour Party was going to do everything. It sought and saw the books from the Department of Finance before entering government. This was facilitated by the late Brian Lenihan. The Labour Party knew what the situation was; therefore, it cannot blame everything on the last Government. Where is its moral compass when it comes to ordinary single parents who are struggling? This comes from a small businessman who has employed people. Many good single parents of both genders are working or trying to find work. It is not that they are all at home watching big screen televisions, as the former Tánaiste once said.That could not be further from the truth. If I heard that coming from the Fine Gael benches, I would say, "Fine", because they were never interested in the little people or the ordinary people in my constituency. It is the ranchers and the people with the daffodils and tree-lined avenues that they are mainly interested in and we know who lives in those houses. More than 30,000 single parents will lose their one-parent family payments in July, according to the Department. Groups representing lone parents told the joint committee that the forthcoming changes will hit the incomes of impoverished single parent families and make it harder for them to work because of the way the new social welfare supports are structured. Work is the kernel of this. Every day we hear plaudits about the unemployment figures but we have to unshackle the bureaucracy and allow people to work and allow the self-employed in my constituency and elsewhere to take them on part time before, hopefully, migrating to full-time employment. This will benefit them and the community. There is nothing more demoralising than to be unemployed and to be unable to secure work. The Government parties have lost all context and vision in supporting these people. SPARK says the youngest child aged over seven and under 14 years will transfer to the jobseeker's transition, JST, payment. This is another lovely acronym. However, the problem is getting an appointment. I say nothing against the staff of the Clonmel social welfare office. I salute the work they do but people cannot walk into the office and get an appointment. They must have an appointment before they go in. Community welfare officers who always advised people on the ground have been withdrawn. One would not think the Labour Party was part of the Government. Instead of rolling out CWOs, they have taken away their services. Claimants must apply by May, engage with job activation and attend a seminar. This is wonderful stuff. I heard on the news that the Department does not have enough staff to deal with the conversation grant relating to Irish Water. The Department does not have enough staff to do what it has to do, yet there will be seminars, transitional payments and so on. On JST, lone parents can keep a part-time job. However, as the income disregard is only €60, they will lose money from their incomes. It is nothing short of a con job. I am surprised the Minister of State would peddle this kind of stuff. It is a con of the highest order, as are most other schemes like this. Siblings and parents are trying to support lone parents with young children. What kind of families will we have? In the same breath, the Government talks about marriage equality and equality in everything else, yet we are rushing through legislation to victimise these people. It is regressive and it will impoverish single parents. It beggars belief that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing in the Government. The parties are anxious to introduce liberal legislation yet they are passing regressive legislation in tandem with it, which is an attack on single parent families and their young people. Where will these people go? The Government has offered a few hundred places but 40,000 people will demand them.  If someone currently works less than 19 hours in a part-time job, he or she will have to choose between living on jobseeker's allowance or income from part-time work. That will lead to confusion for the prospective employer and the new employee because no one will know where they are. There will be more schemes and seminars. The self-employed who might employ these people part time do not have time for the Minister's seminars, fancy acronyms and descriptions and, above all, for the codology and tomfoolery she is engaging in. It is sending the fool farther. Lone parents who receive half rate carer's allowance together with the one-parent family payment must change to full carer's allowance when the youngest child turns seven. This equates a loss of €84 per week. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste said that a charge of €2 per week for water was not much but these people will lose €84 a week. What planet are they living on? Why will the Minister of State not listen to the groups representing one parents if he will not listen to them in his clinics? Only 500 affordable after school places will be made available for approximately 40,000 one-parent families this year. What good will that be? They will be in the Minister of State's clinics and my clinics out of frustration and they will be depressed in doctor's surgeries and so on. In tandem with this, the Government will introduce free GP care for those under the age of six in spite of the fact that there no services for anybody else and the doctors and parents do not want it. Lone parents want this because their children will be sick as they themselves will be sick and depressed. It is a mean-spirited, lousy and shabby attack on single parents and as soon as the Minister of State sits up and smells the coffee in this regard, the better. Groups representing lone parents have said this. Social Justice Ireland and anybody else one cares to listen to are saying it. The Minister promised she would not go ahead with these changes unless a Scandinavian child care model, about which we hear so much, was in place. We have a scandalous child care service, not a Scandinavian model. Only 500 after school places are on offer but 40,000 lone parents will be affected by these changes. They are deprived and under-privileged enough and have been affected enough by all the cuts. On one occasion the Labour Party called the cuts introduced by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Charlie McCreevy, the "dirty dozen". The Government has introduced countless dozens of cuts. There has been attack after attack on ordinary working class families and single parents, the people the Minister of State's party was proudly set up in my town of Clonmel to represent. However, it has abandoned them because it entered a Thatcherite and Tory-light coalition and got into bed with the Taoiseach and company. When the Taoiseach was asked a question about agriculture earlier, he talked about a scheme that he was not asked at all about. Ministers have so many spin doctors around them that they do not know what the questions are about and have no answers and, therefore, they give an answer to a different question. Shame on the Minister of State as far as this change is concerned. Thousands of one-parent families will be pushed into extreme poverty. It is important that we reach out to single parents to fights these cuts. Where are the so-called social democrats with social consciences who are supposed to represent them? The Minister of State has lost it. He has gone so far down in his psyche that he has no hope of regaining it. I would not like to be him approaching doors during the next election. Shame on him if he goes through the lobby to vote in favour of legislation such as this that is being pushed through. It is a disgraceful attack on young families with small children. Many resource centres are under attack and community services are trying to support these people. Together with the withdrawal of CWO services, it is an absurd, disgraceful attack by the so-called Labour Party. It is not entitled to carry that brand anymore. It should hand it up and give it to somebody else.

I will enlighten him regarding Intreo offices. They are working well and the group engagements have been beneficial to those who have participated in them, as they have led to progression plans and so on. We are active in County Tipperary engaging with employers to make sure they are aware of all the schemes, benefits and 80 additional steps to help SMEs. I hope the Deputy will assist us in making sure employers know about the benefits of JobsPlus and so on. A number of employers are participating in the scheme but it needs to be promoted more and perhaps the Deputy will play an active role in this. We doubled the number of JobsPlus places in budget 2015 from 3,000 to 6,000 and more than 2,000 people have taken up a place. I spent time in County Tipperary recently. The Deputy referred to resource centres being under attack and so on. I visited some good centres, which are playing a positive role. I have worked on the CE and Gateway schemes and they have an important role in the county. That is evident in the Tidy Towns scheme as people progress from it.I certainly hope the Deputy will go back to Tipperary after today's debate and encourage small and medium-sized businesses to get involved in their local Intreo and Department of Social Protection centres and thereby make sure people on the live register have an opportunity to get back into work. I was keen to reply to the Deputy immediately and in his presence because I knew he probably wanted to head off because he is busy with engagements.

This will help jobseekers with families and lone parents to return to work or to increase the number of hours they work. We are also enhancing the support for lone parents with children between the ages of seven and 15 by extending eligibility for the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangements and making changes to the eligibility for families with lone parents. I am using the term "jobseeker's allowance", rather than referring to it as "JA", to assist Deputy Mattie McGrath with the jargon. All of these improvements have been made possible as a result of the many sacrifices that have been made by the Irish people and the difficult choices that have been made by this Government. This is delivering an economic recovery that is gaining real momentum, as highlighted in the latest quarterly national household statistics and the live register numbers that were published today, which show that the standardised unemployment rate has fallen to 10.1%. In my early years in this House, when we rolled out our plan to get the unemployment rate back down to single figures, we were shouted down by those who said it would not happen within five years and we would not see single-figure unemployment in this decade. We are now at 10.1% and I expect to see us below 9%, or in 9%, within the next couple of months. When that happens, it will be due in large part to the sacrifices of citizens throughout the country. Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned the increase in taxation when she spoke about the revenue returns. We need to peel away the statistics to look at what was happening at an earlier stage of this country's limited recovery, which unfortunately continues to be based around many of the urban areas and has not stretched out beyond them. Deputy O'Dea, who has joined us, will agree that there has been some recovery in the main urban areas like Dublin, Galway, Cork and Limerick, but that has not yet been rolled out substantially into rural areas. We have to work on it. People have rightly pointed out that when we first started to see an improvement in the job numbers, much of it related to part-time work. In the latest figures, we are seeing much more full-time employment, thankfully, which means that more people are on good, decent wages. The revenue returns mentioned by Deputy Catherine Murphy show that wages are actually improving. Deputy Tóibín mentioned that in 2008, just 5% of postgraduate students emigrated, whereas that figure increased to 20% more recently. I hope we can encourage many of those postgraduates to come back into the Irish economy. We are now showing that we have skills gaps. I look forward to seeing many of my friends and their children coming back to work in Ireland. We have one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU. It has been quite difficult to reach this point. As I said earlier, many commentators said we would never reach it. They said unemployment would keep growing and we would face another bailout. Thankfully, we have proven those commentators wrong. I know Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are actively trying to encourage some of our emigrants to come back and take up the well-paid jobs that are starting to appear in our economy. Many Deputies raised issues relating to the impact of the age-related reform of the lone-parent family payment scheme. I reiterate the point made by the Tánaiste at the start of this debate that despite the strong welfare support given to lone parents over the years, the results have been disappointing in poverty terms, even when the economy was doing well. That is why these reforms are essential. They will address the passive nature of the scheme, which results in welfare dependency, while protecting the entitlement of lone parents with young children to jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangements. These reforms will also protect those who are caring by extending their one-parent family payment until their youngest child reaches the age of 16. They will incentivise lone parents to increase their employment by allowing them to access the family income supplement and the back to work family dividend. They will support those moving to jobseekers' payments by giving them activation support and access to education, training and employment programmes. The revised structure will help lone parents to return to work and build a better financial future for themselves and their families over time. I am committed to these reforms. I would like to respond to Deputy O'Dea's comments about the reform of the one-parent family payment. I know there are those who argue that lone parents should be given the one-parent family payment until their children reach the age of 18, or for even longer. It is clear from the poverty rates that this approach adds to the welfare trap for lone parents. It is important to recognise that since the commencement of these reforms, a number of interventions have been introduced further to assist the support of lone parents. These include the introduction of jobseeker's allowance transition arrangements, which give lone parents with young children the flexibility to work part-time or engage in full-time education, enable them to access subsidised child care through after-school child care schemes and community employment child care programmes and allow them to access the back to work family dividend. The Tánaiste announced yesterday that lone parents will be able to retain their entitlement to the one-parent family payment and will be able to receive a half-rate carer's allowance payment until their youngest child reaches the age of 16. These are significant supports. Unlike other jobseekers, people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance transition arrangements can also avail of full-time education. As such, these customers can receive the maintenance portion of the SUSI grant. This flexibility has been in place since the introduction of jobseeker's allowance transition arrangements in 2013. Recipients of the one-parent family payment who are participating in training and education can also move back into educational allowance schemes when their entitlement to the one-parent family payment ceases. However, I am aware that this can result in a financial loss if these customers are currently in receipt of a SUSI grant. I think Deputy O'Dea highlighted this point yesterday.

#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	407	I was listening to it very closely. I think Deputy Clare Daly might have read from a similar e-mail when she was making her contribution. The eligibility rules that govern payment for student maintenance grants are matters for the Department of Education and Skills. However, I am mindful that the principal aim of the reform of the one-parent family payment is to support customers in education. For that reason, this issue is being considered by my officials and by officials from the Department of Education and Skills. Deliberations on this process will conclude very shortly. We heard a number of contributions on various aspects of the JobBridge scheme, which was introduced to target people who were at a distance from the labour market. The qualification for it was that one had to have been unemployed for six months. I know from my own community that when people drift into unemployment and move past the six-month period, it is very difficult for them to get back into work. Equally, it is difficult for people to get a job for the first time after leaving school. Highly critical remarks have been made about the JobBridge scheme, but the figures stand up for themselves. I have spent a great deal of time over the last six months talking to JobBridge participants and interns who have actually gone through the process. The vast majority of them are extremely positive about it. They say it gave them the experience which got them back into work. I met a man in Waterford who had worked for Waterford Glass in quite a niche area. He got an internship with a local employer and that led to a managerial role in an area in which he never thought his career would go. He thought he would never get back into employment, but he got a JobBridge internship and that led back into employment.Another young lady came from abroad and her argument was why she should have to wait six months being unemployed because she knew that JobBridge would lead to her gaining experience that would lead to her finding a job. The robust investigations that take place when the Department receives complaints show a tiny minority of employers take advantage, but the complaints are dealt with. Just under 40,000 positions have been advertised since the introduction of JobBridge and 458 complaints have been made, all of which have been thoroughly investigated. Deputy Dessie Ellis referred to a recent survey of 87 people, which is not a good sample size, but the majority of it was positive about JobBridge. Many of the schemes we operate in the Department of Social Protection help people to gain experience and get back to work. Persons who are unemployed for two years can get into the practice of good timekeeping, which has been helpful in people getting back to work. I do not take lightly the criticism of the scheme because I have seen dedicated individuals become involved and it has led to work. I visited one Gateway scheme in River Valley in Swords where I talked to participants. One young man said it was the first time he had felt he was contributing to his community and that he was very proud of the work he was doing. He believed it would lead to full-time employment because he had never experienced working in an outdoor setting and saw it as a real career move. He can contribute to his community. The back to work family dividend forms the main part of the Bill, but it was the subject of little discussion. I welcome the broad support of Deputies for it.  Deputy Willie O'Dea raised a number of issues, including the reason the dividend should be withdrawn if workers qualified for illness benefit for more than six weeks and why the welfare status of a child would impact on entitlement to the dividend. The dividend is based on the concept of supporting families exiting the welfare system. If a person returns to the system, whether an adult family member or a child, the dividend may be reduced or withdrawn. This makes the scheme simple and easy to understand. In the case of illness benefit, the benefit paid may be less than the wage and the dividend is, after a period of 36 days, withdrawn. Support must be withdrawn if people return to welfare payments. Otherwise, the scheme would not incentivise people to exit the system; rather, it would have the opposite effect. Children's support will be withdrawn if people are engaged in a programme under which they are paid an allowance. This is logical and will also protect against double incentives. Deputy Willie O'Dea mentioned something that struck a chord with me. He said people received a full payment for the first year and a half payment for the second. I believe he reported that people had asked him why they should work if they would lose the payment after two years. I think I took him up correctly, but perhaps it was he who was saying this.

#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	409	The intention behind the dividend is to encourage people to go back to work. When they go back to work, other opportunities arise from networking, promotion and overtime. I always encourage people to go back to work. Deputy Denis Naughten raised various issues about post offices. I would like to see further services being given to the post office system. Mr. Bobby Kerr will come forward with good suggestions, but one of the downsides, although it is a pleasant unintentional consequence, is that the number of people going back to work means that payments to postmasters will reduce over time because postmasters are paid according to the number of transactions. We must be conscious of this. The Deputy also mentioned community welfare officers and the closing of clinics. I will be happy to discuss that issue with him at a later stage. My information is that in the areas in which offices were closed the level of usage was low. Community welfare officers are available on the telephone and will call to people on appointment, especially in rural areas. The Deputy referred to the lack of staff in Longford. We must best utilise the staff we have and I will be quite happy to discuss the issue with him later. Community welfare officers are a resource and we must maximise their use. We have facilitated a telephone or call-out service where clinics close locally. A number of Deputies referred to appeals. Deputy Willie O'Dea published a Private Members' Bill dealing with the issue. We have reduced considerably the length of time involved. One of the points that prolongs the appeal mechanisms is that at every stage the applicant is entitled to provide additional information. I would not like to change the system because the applicant should be entitled to do so at every stage. Our colleagues overseas do not allow this facility and I would hate to go down that route. We must continuously improve the length of time it takes to complete appeals. Many Deputies referred to small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs. Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to the gaining of social welfare allowances should a company go bankrupt. In principle, I have no problem with entrepreneurs or the owners of small and medium-sized enterprises being able to draw down unemployment benefit, but they must contribute at the same rate as everyone else. They contribute at a lower rate of PRSI and it cannot be done on a voluntary basis because it would have to be universal. Further studies must be carried out. Deputies Peadar Tóibín and Sean Crowe referred to low pay and zero hour contracts. While the Bill does not deal specifically with that topic, the Low Pay Commission has been set up and will report very quickly to the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash. It is expected that we will receive the first report early in the summer. It is much better that it is focused. The Labour Party and Fine Gael restored the €1 reduction Fianna Fáil had taken off the minimum wage. I am proud that the Labour Party was able to do this and influence it at an early stage in the life of the Government. There is a need to increase the minimum wage and the Low Pay Commission will probably make similar findings.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	428	This is a timely debate. In the coming weeks we will be abolishing the dairy quota regime across the European Union in what is probably the most significant policy change in agriculture for the last 30 or 40 years. It will have a dramatic and positive impact on rural communities and the rural economy for the foreseeable future. Dairy expansion will also bring challenges but we have been preparing for them for some time. We will be providing family farms across the country, from west to east and north to south, with opportunities for sustainable expansion. Farmers will be able to grow their businesses and build on their potential for increasing milk output in a way that is very exciting. Anybody who doubts the significance of the level of investment being made on the back of this opportunity should drive from Cork city towards Limerick. Driving into Mallow, one will see an investment by Glanbia worth €80 million. This is the biggest investment made in Mallow for many years. Further along the road to Limerick, a similarly large investment has been made in Charleville as part of a joint project between Kerry Group and Beingmate to project infant formula on the Cork-Limerick border. Again, this is the biggest investment that town has seen in many decades. Along the main Dublin road from Cork, Dairygold has invested €60 million in Mitchelstown on the back of dairy expansion. Glanbia has invested €180 million in Belview, County Kilkenny, in the largest ever investment by an indigenous Irish company, to prepare for what is going to happen to the Irish dairy industry starting in three weeks' time. Investments amounting to approximately €1 billion have been made in farms over the last four or five years in preparation for dairy expansion. In respect of recent reports prepared in anticipation of the likely positive impact of these changes, County Cork is one of the only counties for which a specific report was produced on the impact of dairy expansion between now and 2020. In that county alone, 4,000 jobs and a capital investment of €1.2 billion are expected over the next five years. This is a big deal. For the last three or four years, we have been planning for these dramatic changes in European policy on dairy production. Ireland is going to take advantage of these changes.Effectively, we have been operating within a straitjacket since 1984 owing to European policy on the volume of dairy we have been allowed to produce. That supply control policy was introduced for good reason at the time, but it is no longer relevant in the context of current global demand for dairy products. We are anticipating and planning for an increase of approximately 50% in volume over a five-year period. There is no other European country that is planning for more than a 15% or 20% volume increase in the same period. Ireland has the natural competitive advantage to take advantage of the opportunity in terms of our production systems, but we need to plan properly and work with farmers, co-ops and the dairy industry as a whole to ensure this is done in a way that protects standards, safety and quality and guarantees sustainability on the journey. I refer to financial sustainability for farmers to ensure they will not become overly indebted, sustainability in terms of the biodiversity that must be protected on farms and the management of the greenhouse gas emissions that will come from increased herd sizes farmers will be managing into the future. It is also about the sustainability of the fabric of rural Ireland which all Members hold valuable. That means protecting the family farm structure in Ireland which is the very heartbeat and fabric of rural communities. There is no reason small and medium-sized family farms cannot benefit, as well as larger farms. That is why we have needed to plan to the extent that we have for the opportunity that will unfold in the next five to 15 years. We talk about the end game for the Food Harvest 2020 strategy as that is what was put in place by the previous Government, but 2020 is just a point in time. The dairy industry will continue to grow long after that date. It is reasonable to anticipate this. We will soon have figures as we are putting together a set of targets for 2025 which will be in place by the summer. Certainly, it is reasonable to assume that in the next ten to 15 years the dairy industry will double in terms of the volume it produces, but it may happen before then. When one considers what has happened in New Zealand, where the volume of milk produced has quadrupled in the past 30 years, one sees that while our target is ambitious, it is very achievable. As a policy maker and Minister, the important thing for me is to ensure this happens in a way that is managed and controlled and anticipates all of the problems around price volatility, quality standards and opening new markets. We must plan for the challenges before they arise to make this as smooth a journey of growth and expansion as possible. For that reason, a number of my colleagues, particularly Deputies John Deasy and Michael Creed, have been speaking to me about the need to put a structure in place to monitor progress in the next five years. We are, therefore, going to establish a dairy forum which will be modelled in some ways on the beef forum, although it may be a little less adversarial. Its purpose will be to ensure all stakeholders interested in the expansion of the dairy industry, of whom there are many, are part of the discussion in monitoring progress year on year and month on month. The forum will meet either two or three times a year and I will chair it. I hope that after I leave this office, the Minister for Agriculture of the day will continue to chair the forum as the journey towards dairy expansion develops and delivers the positivity we can expect from the sector. Nationally, we can conservatively predict that the next five years of dairy expansion will deliver approximately 10,000 new jobs in rural Ireland. This is not an overly ambitious target. We are talking about hundreds of millions, if not billions, in extra investment on the back of this in terms of growth. In a practical sense, we are talking about moving from producing about 5.5 billion litres of milk per year which is what we currently produce to producing close to 8 billion litres of milk per year. That is approximately an extra €1 billion of export value coming from the dairy sector in the next five years. This is an exciting period. It merits and is receiving the attention of all political parties and those interested in and concerned about the future of rural Ireland. It gives them an opportunity to speak and I am delighted that there are so many Members in the Chamber. I will refer to some of the challenges we face rather than read a long script. I hope Members will raise concerns and questions which I may be able to answer at the end of the debate.  The theme of the Food Harvest strategy is smart, green growth in agriculture. That is as it should be. It is about doing things better and being more innovative than we have been to give farmers the tools, knowledge and skills set to be able to produce a product more profitably and sustainably than in the past. That is why we have seen the roll-out of a dairy sustainability scheme across dairy farms. I expect all 18,000 dairy farms in the country to sign up to the scheme. It will mean that they will be inviting an audit of their farms from a sustainability point of view to help them to build on their businesses in a successful way. We are also encouraging innovation and new ways of doing things through the new Common Agricultural Policy and the new rural development programmes. We are encouraging generational change as the ambition for growth and expansion we are delivering will not be fulfilled where only 6% of farmers are under 35 years of age, as they are. That needs to change and it is changing. In the last budget we introduced tax changes to provide for a hugely comprehensive agri-tax policy. It includes 23 recommendations, primarily around changing attitudes to the leasing of land to move from a conacre to a long-term lease system. This is essential for dairy farmers if they are to expand and grow their land availability. One simply cannot build a dairy herd while leasing land for 11 or 12 month periods at a time, given the lack of certainty. Instead, we are incentivising in a way that anecdotal evidence suggests is working. Landowners, including those looking to retire from active farming, are now thinking about leasing their land on a five, seven or 15 year lease which will provide the level of certainty dairy farmers and others need to expand. They know that they will have access to land in the medium to long term which will assist them significantly in terms of expansion. Likewise, our treatment of land consolidation from a tax point of view is relevant. I refer to where a farmer sells one piece of land to buy another which is next to his or her farm in order that he or she can build better grazing management systems, which is of particular importance to dairy farms. This is about helping farmers to reorient their farms to facilitate opportunities for growth and expansion if they want to take them. We have spent quite a lot of time and resources through Teagasc to ensure farmers have business plans for expansion and will not expand on a whim, making the assumption that because they move from 70 to 90 cows they will automatically make more money. It is not necessarily the case that they will. Where farmers move from having fewer than 100 cows to more than 100, they often must look at taking on someone to help with the extra work involved. This may involve a family farm paying a salary for the first time to someone from outside. It changes the economics of the entire farm. Expansion must take place on the back of a professionally put together business plan for growth that any business seeking to expand would put in place.I have spent quite a lot of time talking to banks in Ireland about the facilitation of dairy expansion and the need for caution to ensure that we do not allow a new generation of dairy farmers in Ireland to get into significant debt which would essentially result in them working for the bank for most of their lives. This has happened in New Zealand and it was one of the big mistakes in that country's growth journey and which we are not going to replicate here. Even though farmers tell me that they would like easier access to money from banks, in actual fact, we need a banking system that is cautious in terms of how it lends to a sector that is planning to expand dramatically.  One aspect in which banks could improve, in my view, is the rate at which they lend money. Much of the available loan facilities provided to farmers in Ireland involves an interest repayment rate which is significantly higher than the rate for loan to farmers in other European countries. We need to examine this aspect and to ensure sufficient competition in the banking system. Believe it or not, farmers represent 6% of the Irish workforce and last year, 23% of the value of bank loans were going to primary agriculture, to farmers. It is a case of 6% of the population getting nearly one quarter of the loan facilities currently being signed off by banks. We have an appetite for growth and a farming community that is up for that. Between 70% and 80% of our farmers are planning for expansion and growth at different levels. The processing sector has invested heavily to make this happen and new pricing models are currently being developed so that we can hedge against the kind of price volatility of which there have been some examples in recent months. Most important, the Government and the sector have invested significantly over recent years, in markets both at home and abroad, to ensure that Ireland can avail of the extraordinary opportunities for expansion and growth that is really only available to Ireland in Europe, given the structure of agriculture in this country and the opportunity for dramatic sustainable dairy expansion over a relatively short period of time. The Government will continue to do everything possible to facilitate that expansion and to help to guide it. We will consult with all stakeholders to ensure we are all in this together and that we anticipate and solve problems together. If we do that, in my view, the next five to ten years will be an extraordinarily exciting period for the dairy sector in Ireland as it will be for many in rural Ireland who will be linked to this industry.

However, I would be very surprised if there is anyone in the dairy industry who does not know what is happening with regard to the superlevy.

I was raised on a farm that was confined to quotas since 1983 and having been a full-time farmer for almost eight years under the quota regime prior to coming to this House in 1997, I know at first-hand the difficulties and the significant constraints of the milk quota regime imposed on many family farms over the past 32 years. The date of 1 April 2015 is a date which many family farms across the length and breadth of the country have been eagerly awaiting in order to begin farm expansion. A number of issues need to be dealt with. I refer to Food Harvest 2020 which was initiated by Deputy Brendan Smith and the previous Government and which set the parameters for the expansion of the food industry and the dairy industry in particular, as the date for the abolition of milk quotas approached. There has been significant investment in co-operatives, in milk processing and in farms. I had a most interesting conversation with an excellent dairy farmer whom I met in Mallow yesterday afternoon. He confessed to being a supporter of the party opposite. We had a great discussion about milk and milk policy and the issues related to new people going into milk production as opposed to the farmers already in milk.  The Minister alluded to some of the issues when he referred to a farmer milking 70 cows who then expands to milking 90 cows and an agenda is to get more money out of milk. However, many issues need to be teased out. I refer to the sound advice from Teagasc and the cost of production. There should not be expansion just for the sake of it, in particular, on family farms. We must ensure that farmers are completely equipped with the best possible information so that they get the most milk out of the number of cows. The number of cows may be important to farmers but the productivity on those cows is important. Some farmers may expand production by 50% or up to 70% and they are borrowing very great sums of money at 5% and 6%. However, they will spend a generation working for the bank in order to pay off those loans. I refer to the price guarantees over a number of years offered by milk processors. I have had many discussions with dairy farmers on this issue. The year 2014 was a very successful year for milk prices. The volatility that was perceived to be in the market has somewhat abated. My concern is to ensure that the farmers are given the best possible advice. The Minister, the Department and Teagasc are looking into a crystal ball in this respect but it is important that the best possible advice is made available to farmers when they are going into a milk contract. The price volatility in the past couple of months reminds me of 2006 when the progressive farmers' conference at the beginning of 2006 was one of the leading farming meetings to be held in January which is the quiet period on dairy farms. They looked at the price volatility during 2006 and they predicted an almost collapse in that price. As it turned out, what happened was almost the direct opposite. I kept saying to farmers to wait and see what would happen over the next while. The point I am making is that there needs to be better research about price volatility although it is not an accurate science. Everyone was saying that the price would collapse down to 24 cent, 25 cent or 26 cent, and farmers were saying they could not produce milk at that price-----
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	435	Fixed milk prices are making a big difference.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	436	I agree but there needs to be more research undertaken. These things do not happen overnight. I know we are in a global market and what is happening in the United States or in China has an influence. Six weeks ago I thought it was time to ensure a floor price for milk because many farmers would have borrowed money.Young farmers have been taking the opportunity to produce more milk, as have others who have been farming for 20 years and were not able to do so before. It is always the Holy Grail to be able to produce as much milk as one possibly can. Now, however, some of these farmers are saying they are slowing down production. That issue will need to be examined in the context of prices. As we go forward into the post-quota landscape, we must focus on our emerging markets, the markets we are looking to under Food Harvest 2020, to ensure we have the best possible security in those markets. We are producing one of the best products in the world on the backs of farmers who have taken on board an enormous volume of regulation in the past two decades. Looking back to 1996, farmers in my part of the country were drying off cows in August and September because of non-availability and many small family farms did not have any income coming in for months at a time. The dairy industry and food industry in general all depend on the farm gate. Farmers, as I said, have accepted huge regulation and have, by and large, almost to a fraction of a percentage, ponied up to those regulations and done the groundwork and investment at farm gate level in terms of upgrading their facilities. Many have spent huge amounts of money, whether on slurry storage facilities, dairy equipment or other upgrade works. They have put massive money into getting their systems right. That is why we have one of the best products in the world and it should be acknowledged by everybody who is buying milk at the farm gate. There has been some debate in regard to the co-operative movements that were set up to protect farmers, some of which are looking at huge profits. There is an issue there but it is for another day. Farmers have adhered to a range of regulations at enormous expense to ensure they have the best possible product and the companies buying it, whether plcs or co-operative movements, must give fair and accurate prices at the farm gate. There are people making enormous profits on the backs of farmers and that is an issue we must examine. The Minister mentioned the interest rates that are being charged on farm loans. Farmers come to me constantly saying they are being charged 5%, 6% and 7% rates. These are penal rates. At this stage, it can no longer be about talking to the banks; they must be told these practices are not acceptable. This is a growth industry, an industry that was put on a sound footing over generations. Farmers have heeded the advice they were given and made the necessary investments to improve their product. It is a credit to every farmer out there, whether they are milking 20 cows, 200 cows or more. They have delivered a product of which we can be justifiably proud. We must ensure no farmer is penalised, regardless of how many cows he or she is milking. Everybody must be treated the very same and given the same price per litre of milk in whichever sector they are in. The Government must do more to ensure banks treat farmers fairly, which is not currently happening. There are many farmers seeking to expand and who, when faced with volatility, are being hauled in by their bank managers or bank liaison people. I spoke recently to a very successful dairy farmer whose family have given their lives to building up a massive business. When they sought to transfer some intergenerational loans because the farm was being taken over, they experienced great difficulties. The banks are not doing what it says on the tin in terms of their function. We in this House, in government and in opposition, should be facing them down and saying this is not acceptable. There are many farmers who have massive opportunities and are prepared to work hard to realise them. At this time of year, from January through to April, they work 24 hours a day, seven days a week to get the work done. Many farmers are feeling the pressure and dealing with stress-related issues. We must ensure every advice and help is available to farmers in all categories. Representatives of farming communities are telling us they are very concerned about people's welfare. We should be conscious of that. We must be stricter on the banks, because what they are doing is wrong, and we must challenge them to tackle the problem. We need to ensure dairy farmers, who are working extremely hard, are getting a fair price, whether from a PLC or a co-operative entity, and are given due recognition for the mighty product they have developed over the generations. Many farmers are looking forward to 1 April but they have a superlevy bill hanging over them. We should challenge the system in that regard. Those levies should not be paid in the first instance.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	437	I thank the Minister for his statement. Like other speakers, I welcome the ending of the quota regime. It provides enormous opportunities, as was identified by the former Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, when he set about developing a strategy for increased output from this sector of farming. There is undoubtedly a growing demand for our product across the world. The opportunities are there, but there are considerable challenges facing farmers, of which the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is well aware. The extreme costs of inputs is one of the challenges for farmers. For those who have planned expansion to meet the expected output, there are significant challenges around financing. I fail to see why the superlevy must be paid this year. I accept the Minister would not have told farmers that in advance and that we were coming to the end of a regime. However, an agreement should have been reached that we would not hinder or hamper the capacity of farmers at a time when we need them to invest in their business and expand in a substantial way and when they are challenged by historic loans arising from the requirement to invest in recent years. Some farmers experienced really dire financial straits in that period, when milk prices dropped below the cost of production. They are only getting back on their feet and now they will be hit with a superlevy. Of course it is not the Minister's fault and I am not attempting to put it at his door, but we need to recognise where the market is going. If the Minister explained the situation to a person who has no involvement in farming, he or she would scarcely believe that farmers are to be penalised for overproduction in the year prior to the year in which they are being asked to ramp up production. There is a difficulty in selling that to the wider world and, in the meantime, farmers are trying to cope with it. Collectively, we should all be doing more to assist them. Milk prices fell in 2014 by 21%, which has tightened margins considerably and placed a very real burden on some farmers. More needs to be done on the superlevy issue. The Minister indicted that the deal which was proposed has been signed. However, it is not really the answer. In fact, it is retarding the capacity of farmers to produce. 2015 probably will not be as bad as was initially projected. Teagasc gave very troubling indications at the very beginning of the year, but that prognosis seems to have been mitigated somewhat based on world prices and issues happening elsewhere. Nevertheless, it will be a bleak year ahead.

People who have to pay back borrowings are experiencing difficulties in their dealings with some of the banks, particularly those that are exiting the marketplace. Danske Bank, for example, is making it very difficult for the farmers it is trying to move off its books. More work needs to be done with the pillar banks to support farmers. The Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, needs to build on his superlevy proposals. EU market supports, especially intervention, must be revalued to reflect the strong increases in product costs. The 2025 strategy must be focused on on-farm profitability and promoting measures to help farmers to cope with income volatility. Access to fixed-price margin contracts or other types of hedging must be promoted.Taxation measures, such as those proposed by the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, must be enacted to help farmers mitigate income variations in a more flexible way than the otherwise welcome five-year averaging and certainly will be part of that strategy. In addition, banks must be prevailed upon to work much more constructively with this sector. I need not chart out for the Minister the importance of agriculture to both the rural economy and the entire economy of the State. A hell of a lot more buy-in from the banking sector is needed, which, as the Minister is aware, has been bailed out by all taxpayers in the State, including farmers. While there certainly is a need for education and training opportunities in farming best practices, training in financial and budget management also must be provided and this will require the proper resourcing of Teagasc. As the Minister is aware, Teagasc is in regular dialogue with Members of this House, who must continue to support that authority in its efforts to support the industry.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	440	The Minister was right when he stated at the outset that we are living in exciting times. The abolition of milk quotas on 31 March no doubt will be a major change for Irish dairy farmers. While we in Sinn Féin do not call for their retention and realise this is a decision that comes, like many others, from Brussels, we are concerned by the many consequences of this development. It is forecast that there will be a massive increase in production and this could herald a drop in prices. I do not refer to an increase in production in Ireland alone but right across Europe, which could have detrimental effects if it affects the price the farmers are getting. It stands to reason that an increase in production would do this and it could leave more vulnerable those who operate on a more modest level such as the small family farmers with small dairy herds mentioned by the Minister. Where the profit margin is small, a drop in prices could endanger the livelihoods of small farmers. The Department and the advisory bodies have advised farmers to invest and prepare for the abolition of the quota and, as the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine heard recently, banks are really up for making money available for this purpose. It was interesting to hear the Minister state that at present, approximately 23% of the value of bank loans is going into capital investment to prepare for the abolition of the milk quota. As the Minister also mentioned, much of that is based on a business plan worked out in advance. Obviously, to secure one's business plan, one will be operating on the assumption that one's production will be profitable. However, there is no absolute guarantee in this regard. That brings me to the European Milk Board, EMB, which represents producers across the European Union and which includes the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, among its members. The EMB is so concerned about the consequences of a drop in price that it is lobbying hard for a cut in production to be imposed across the European Union. It states that supply will be obliged to adjust to demand in circumstances in which EU farmers will be obliged to deal with higher production and to compete with cheaper imports from outside the EU. The EMB goes so far as to propose protectionism for dairy farmers and I seek the Minister's views on that proposal when he responds. The European Milk Board has produced a market responsibility programme, which is designed to deal with impending crises and, all going well, to offset any crisis. It would start by implementing accurate monitoring of production, prices and production costs. The plan is to apply the programme in three phases, the first being an early warning mechanism that would kick in were the price to fall by 7.5%. According to the EMB, what would happen is that private storage would be opened and incentives for extra consumption would be introduced, such as suckler production and milk-fattening of heifers. This would continue until the market index returned to 100. There are many positives to this mechanism but part of it would entail ascertaining how it would work structurally. Only if that failed and were the market index to fall by 15% would the next phase be introduced. That would roll out restraint of supply by giving bonuses for reducing production, levying over-production and, of course, a defined reference period. The third phase suggested by the EMB would mean that production would have to be obligatorily cut back by 2% or 3% for a period, which they suggested could be of six months. These proposals deserve proper consideration. The Minister has stated his intention to set up a structured dairy forum and I imagine those suggestions which were within its domain would form part of its deliberations because the last thing one wishes to see is overproduction and a cut in prices that again would make the weaker family-farmer producer far more vulnerable. There may be other suggestions and perhaps these proposals need some fine tuning but the Minister should raise these suggestions in Brussels and not allow this risky situation to continue. All Members realise there are farmers who may not survive the abolition of quotas. In addition, there are larger farmers who, on foot of problems with the superlevy or from previous borrowing, may be heavily in debt. While they may be trying to prepare for what some quarters suggest will be a bonanza, they may be unable to realise the capital borrowing that would be necessary to make them as productive as they could be. The dairy sector is the largest of our food and drink sectors. It is worth approximately €3 billion per year to this economy and is far too valuable to be allowed to swing at the whim of the market into a boom-bust cycle. While I can accept that quotas could not go on forever, at the same time their abolition must be heralded with caution and precaution. The first possibility after this month is an massive increase in production with a consequential drop in prices, leaving those who operate on a more modest level, such as small farmers with small dairy herds, more vulnerable than those who can afford to expand their herds and get credit from the banks to so do. Smaller family farmers are far more vulnerable to the price margins. They are fine when there is a price margin and a credible profit to keep their viability sustained. However, when the margin goes below that, it creates many risks. Getting credit has its own risks and there are many who already have borrowed to expand their enterprise and increase their production without having any guarantee about how the industry will develop in the near future. The Minister made the point that banks have indicated their intention to look favourably on the sector for borrowing for capital investment. Some farmers think they may get rich quickly but they could go broke equally as quickly. Members should consider the huge disparities in income that were evident one and two years ago. In addition, I recall the projections made by Teagasc in the fall of last year, which suggested farmers might be getting a price as low as 27 cent per litre. While that projection sent shock-waves, Teagasc has revised its position subsequently. It is the job of the Government to take some control of this situation and it cannot be allowed to turn into another disaster for Irish farmers. Projections under Food Harvest 2020 indicate that Irish milk production could increase by up to 50% in five years. However, a recent Bank of Ireland report suggested it might be 30%. Whatever the projections, it is clear there will be an expansion in production over the next five years, depending on how everything goes. I have mentioned the superlevy and the concerns it will cause to those who will be obliged to pay it. Some people who may be obliged to meet their superlevy penalties also may be attempting to borrow to improve their enterprises and therefore will find themselves in a precarious position. There already have been appeals by the Irish Dairy Board to the Minister to talk to the EU about getting this superlevy reduced, if not abandoned. In his opening remarks, the Minister stated it could not be abandoned and that he would not be allowed to so do. I would not give up on that because its imposition will inhibit investment for some. A crisis could result with the combination of the superlevy imposition and the uncertainty about prices in the short term, coupled with the borrowings of those who have tried to rise to the occasion and expand. While dairying is the most valuable of the food sectors, worth more than €3 billion per annum, there also is concern that the biggest and most valuable market, China, to which the Minister has brought several delegations, is not yet secured for Irish farmers. In this regard, given the access afforded to New Zealand and so forth, one would be competing with them, which could create its own difficulties.The value of exports has increased by 8% by the weakening of the euro. It is likely to take some time before producers feels the trickle-down effect of this, however. Sinn Féin believes a price structure should be put in place to protect the most vulnerable in the sector. The processors too have a role. They cannot be allowed to call the shots without any intervention from the Minister. Many of the processors were once co-operatives owned by the farmers but are now plcs. A stable contractual price with the producers would be desirable, if not even essential, for the abolition of quotas not to create chaos in the sector. The introduction of a guaranteed minimum price for production up to a certain level with the rest going by market trends might be an option. There could be a 50:50 split on this to afford some guarantee to farmers facing into this new scenario. Some processors have indicated they might look favourably at such an option. This is an opportunity for co-operatives to negotiate with farmers on a fixed price structure which would be a welcome move. An essential feature of all this will be planning and caution for what is going to happen. There could be a tsunami of milk coming our way. We must ensure the small farmers who have played their part in building a fine reputation for Irish dairy produce abroad do not drown in it. We are hopeful that new markets in Asia will open up to Irish dairy produce, boosting the milk producers of this island. We are hopeful too the opportunity will be taken by the Government and the dairy processing industry to create more jobs here at home. The Minister indicated 10,000 jobs could be created out of the increase in the milk quota. If handled properly in a structured way, with precautions to protect the producer, this could very well be the case. Those co-operatives which have become multinational operations should be encouraged to look to their own country for labour, as well as developing and expanding their operations here rather than going abroad to set up factories. It is well known, as well as saddening, that many of the plcs are chasing cheap labour. The end of quotas should bring new prosperity to those in rural areas, including to those not directly involved in agriculture. These are people who have often been forgotten and who are the most likely to have to emigrate. We all know the stories of small towns and villages hard-pressed to field a football team. It is an old story but a new one too. Many of those in the Skype generation want to come home. The end of milk quotas, along with a bit of patriotism and encouragement to the large indigenous dairy companies, could result in healthy job creation in rural areas. Jobs in the processing and manufacturing of dairy produce are all under our own control, as well as the raw materials involved, the skills and the expertise. They should not be jobs here today and gone tomorrow because of cheaper labour somewhere else. Real industrial development in Ireland will begin with the agrifood sector. The forthcoming increase in milk production could be the start of a new focus on the sector which will bring benefit to all our people. It has to be structured with incentives in place. Above all, we have to keep as many of our 18,000 milk suppliers active. To allow otherwise would be to fail and contribute to the decline of our rural population with the social consequences associated with that. While I give this development a cautious welcome, I have concerns around the weaker and smaller family farm. The Minister stated 6% of our dairy milk producers were under 35 years of age, an alarming statistic. Incentives such as the early retirement scheme for farmers, installation aid and so forth tried to address that terrible age imbalance in the wider farming communities. We need to look again at how we can encourage younger people to be more active in farming. I am aware from presentations from the Minister that the agricultural colleges cannot cope with the large number of entrants, which is good news. The possibility of exciting times for the sector lies ahead. Sinn Féin wants to see this working to the advantage of the greater common good. In that light, we will be giving our support to the Minister’s endeavours to ensure a positive outcome for the dairy sector which every Member wants.

As I do not have a background in farming, Members will have to pardon my ignorance on some matters. Only last year at the agriculture committee and in the House there was much discussion about how positive the end of the milk quotas would be in 2015. There was going to be no downside, only an upside for the dairy sector. Several weeks before the end of the year, however, the commodity price for milk collapsed on international markets and, next, we were overrun with doom and gloom, crises and predictions that 2015 will be a bad year for farmers. It shows the vagaries of the market and how prices can fluctuate. This will be a feature of the dairy sector for the next several years. There are some positives in this change which are to be welcomed on a national basis. However, I come from Killybegs, a fishing port. In the 1970s, there were up to 90 boats fishing from there. Today, there are only 25, mainly due to rationalisation and increased capacity. I know more ex-fishermen than fishermen in Killybegs now. Will this be a feature of the dairy sector over the next several years? Of the 18,000 dairy farmers, 6,000 produce 60% of the milk. I cannot see any other way but that there will have to be some rationalisation in the sector. Some farmers will, through no fault of their own, end up being squeezed out, as will others through their inability to increase production significantly and maximise their income. While preparing for the positives to the end of the milk quotas, we should also be preparing for this development. The Minister outlined the significant investments in the sector planned to take place in the south to gear up for this increase in production. At the same time, we will see a change in the farming and dairy sectors where some farmers will have to move out and farms will have to increase in size and capacity to be able to avail of extra production. Prices will settle out at a lower rate than they have been over the past several years. Quotas are ending right across Europe. In every other European country, dairy farmers are gearing up to increase production and to capitalise on the ending of quotas. This will bring on pressures on price. It was outlined that we are at an advantage in this regard because of our predominantly grass-based production which helps keep costs down. Several weeks ago the Positive Farmers group made a presentation to the agriculture committee on how farmers could maintain and increase their margins positively by becoming more grass rich in terms of production.I always understood that our agricultural sector was already very grass rich and that was one of its big selling points. I am wondering how much more capacity there is to improve on that for the dairy sector. Perhaps the Minister could expand a wee bit on this in his response. In order to be able to maintain incomes and avail of the benefits of increased production, farmers have to be able to increase the amount of grass they are using in production while keeping their input costs lower. I do not want to see a situation where farmers have to increase production endlessly just to stand still and that is a real risk following the end of the quota regime. We recently visited the agricultural committee in Stormont and heard a presentation on the dairy sector in the Six Counties. It effectively has not had quotas for the last 20 years. Since the UK did not use up its full quota, there was extra quota available for Six Counties farmers. They increased production to take up that slack and are suffering from very severe price pressures and input costs. I saw comparisons whereby the cost of feed was over €1,000 per hectare in the North and about €260 per hectare here in the South. That leads me to think that we already have very grass-rich production, and I wonder how much more can be squeezed out of increasing production in that way.  Inevitably, there will have to be rationalisation within the sector. The tradition we have in our dairy sector of the small family farm providing an income for a family will change, although I do not know by how much, and that presents challenges. Progress always brings change, as does increasing production and production methods. We have to try to minimise those changes and if the big selling point for our dairy sector is that it is based on green, grass-led production, how does that marry with the rationalisation that will take place? There could be in the region of a couple of thousand farmers who would end up out of dairy production and possibly out of farming completely. There will be other opportunities for other jobs in the rural sector because of the investments that are taking place but it is something that will have to be managed and will lead to change across rural Ireland. The Minister has been fairly active in terms of things the Government can do, and the dairy forum will help to smooth out some of those problems. Taxation measures have been introduced and increasing the five-year averaging, which allows farmers to ease out their taxation bills, will help them to compete. I am worried about how we are pressing the banks to be flexible. If we are relying on the banks, we are in big trouble. The experience people have of banks across the country is not that they are there to serve the interests of those who are in debt. The banks have always looked favourably on lending to farmers because they have assets that can be leveraged against debt. When those assets come under pressure, we will really see what faith the banks have in the sector. I hope it will work out okay but we cannot set too much store in the banks to look after people.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	443	With the abolition of the milk quota, the Irish dairy sector will be given an opportunity to pursue efficiencies through increased volumes and will hopefully assert itself on the world stage. Farmers and their co-operatives are gearing up for an increase in milk supply in the order of 50% by 2020 and are making the investments necessary to produce and profitably process and market this milk. Ensuring that farmers and processors will have the capacity for this increase will be challenging. Our international competitors, particularly those in the southern hemisphere, benefit from low-cost milk production on huge farms and from processing on a similarly massive scale. The Irish dairy industry has operated within an EU quota system since 1983. Milk prices were relatively stable but this did not prevent a dramatic reduction in numbers of milk suppliers, with a drop from about 65,000 in 1983 to about 18,000 at present. Farmers need changes in such areas as taxation, hedging and access to credit to help cope with price volatility, especially in the shorter term. There is a huge potential for return for investing in upskilling farmers and there should be greater and more targeted resources for training and placements for aspiring young farmers. Lower milk prices in 2015 will hit the Irish dairy industry, the farmers' cash flow and the general rural economy by up to €500 million. These are very disturbing and alarming statistics. I am sure the Minister will agree that the European Commission really has not done too much to give us a soft landing. It previously gave assurances in that respect but it did not happen. Milk volumes will inevitably rise. The systems and farm land are in place to boost output above 5 billion litres per annum. The global demand for dairy products will rise with the development of a new middle class and shift towards a Western diet in emerging economies. This will create more demand for our dairy and beef products including cheese, butter and other products. The price of raw milk after 2015 cannot be guaranteed by anyone and will be totally dependent on supply and demand, both of which will undoubtedly be volatile. Without quotas, supply will swing around as the price moves. Demand will rely on economic factors in parts of the world where growth rates and foreign exchange rates fluctuate in a rapid fashion. The cost of money after 2015 is not known. It is at record lows worldwide at present as central banks continue to adopt an emergency stance towards the financial sector. On the law of averages, I cannot see how the rock-bottom interest rates of the past four years will last for the next 20 years. That means the cost of money will rise, which will have implications for debt. There are also some other immediate downturns. For instance, the dairy markets are expected to be depressed for the first half of 2015. Fertiliser is expected to rise in cost by anything up to 7% or 8%. On a litre basis, the net margins are to fall by 82% in 2015, which will leave an average of €0.02 for a litre of milk. Young farmers starting out are most vulnerable. I would ask the Minister to intervene with the banks with regard to access to money at reasonable rates. With the sharp plunge in incomes, the farmers need co-operation from the banking sector and moneylenders. On the positive side, in the medium to long term, Ireland is well placed to capitalise on the quota changes as our grass-based methods of production allow us to produce milk cheaper than most competitors. While New Zealand and the US are expected to increase production by 2020, Europe as a whole is only expected to deliver a modest growth rate, allowing Ireland to benefit through some price deflation. This is expected as Europe opens up to markets and we are well established internationally as an innovator of dairy based products. Companies like Kerry Group and Glanbia are world leaders in food and ingredients.Despite the success of the Irish dairy industry in cultivating new products and markets, there are still obstacles that need to be removed because of the limits in the trade agreements between other countries. For example, New Zealand has a bilateral agreement with China since 2008 which, effectively, prohibits Irish milk producers trading there. There is potential for further development of niche premium quality dairy products for the huge Chinese consumer market, in particular, rather than focusing on the bulk selling of milk. The Irish Dairy Board launched a Kerrygold brand of UHT milk product, which has been developed specifically for the Chinese market in recent years, with the involvement of Lakeland Dairies. Glanbia launched a new whey protein brand for the infant formula market in China. The volume of dairy ingredients exported to that market is 9,000 tonnes. Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur, another global brand, is a huge success and it is a big asset for the Irish dairy industry that it is growing at such a rate. It is vital there be consolidation and more co-operation in the existing co-operative sector of the Irish dairy industry if we are to compete competitively internationally. Teagasc is playing a key role at producer level and is working closely with farmers to improve their efficiency levels and the quality of the product by focusing on animal health, nutrition and breeding issues, moves which will also lead to more cost-competitive production. Encouraging better farming also has a knock-on effect on Ireland's sustainability agenda as Bord Bia markets our green product credentials worldwide.

It is very hard to encapsulate in ten minutes what is going on because a great deal is happening. The Minister was struggling to cover everything given the amount of information on what is going on in the industry right now. Deputy Creed and I asked for this debate because even though an enormous shift will occur at the end of the month in our domestic dairy industry, my experience here is that, when it comes to agricultural issues, they are not dismissed in any way but they tend not to inspire as much political interest as the likes of the sale of Aer Lingus, for example. That is fair enough as farming is not for every political correspondent. It is not their area of expertise but if one spends a little time looking at what is about to happen in our dairy industry and what the implications are for the entire country, people might agree this is very significant and that it requires very careful management because of the financial potential alone. To a certain extent, the Minister probably pre-empted much of what Deputy Creed and I were going to say because he pretty much accepted the proposal for the new structure and a new forum for the dairy industry to be created. Perhaps I will give an idea as to how we arrived at that point and why we believed it was important for that to be set up. However, we appreciate the Minister's comments. When it comes to rural Ireland, in many parts of the country agriculture is the predominant industry. It is the only show in town and it is the mainstay of our rural economies. Over the past couple of weeks, I have noticed many people writing about the demise of rural Ireland and, to a certain extent, I have seen that in Waterford also. What interests me in a county like mine, which has, by and large, 752 large dairy operations, is the enormous potential for rural Ireland if it is the case that milk production will increase by 50% between now and 2020. That is an estimate but according to some of the people I met over the past few weeks that 50% figure is conservative. It depends on who one asks but that has been put to us in our meetings with different people are say it could be a much higher.  In terms of job creation, the study Cork Institute of Technology mentioned a figure of 4,000 jobs in Cork alone, which gives one an idea of the kind of figures one is talking about when it comes to jobs. When quotas were introduced in the early 1980s, there were a lot more dairy farmers than there are now. I listened to Deputies Tom Fleming and Pringle give the statistics. They are pretty astounding figures and the contrast between where we were back in the 1970s and 1980s and where we are now is stark. The figure was 65,000 in 1983 while it is 17,000 or 18,000 now. Deputy Pringle is right that one of the challenges, which I think is being dealt with, is to keep as many people in this business as possible. The steps are being taken and what can be done is being done but the Deputy is right when he says that keeping as many people as possible in this business is the major challenge for us. If one looks at where the figures were and where they are now, they are stark. One of the critical factors in milk, which started to emerge in the mid-2000s with the ending of key supports from Brussels, is volatility. Suddenly with supports being withdrawn, we saw milk prices go up and down and the trend has continued. In 2009, we were back down to 19 cent per litre while, a couple of years ago, we were at 40 cent per litre. We are in the high 20s now and maybe the figure will be 30 cent per litre soon. In the discussions Deputy Creed and I had over the past few weeks, it was agreed that there will be volatility which will, and almost has to, continue. We asked how we are prepared to manage that volatility or how can we react as best we can as an industry and country in the most efficient way possible. Somebody in the IFA said to me it is about capitalising on our competitive advantage, which is correct. When the decision to have this debate was finally taken, we decided to meet different farming groups dealing with dairy producers, including the Irish Farmers Association, processing groups and also the banks, which are critical in the post-quota era. It is fair to say the banks are ready and willing. Collectively, they have identified the Irish dairy sector as one which has incredible growth potential and are financing it accordingly. Deputy Dooley said we need to encourage the banks to lend. One cannot stop them at this point. We met AIB and Bank of Ireland and they are competing. If anything, the new forum will need to take a look at their lending practices over the next three years and keep an eye on those. There is no stopping the banks when it comes to lending as they see this as a good bet and a massively growing industry. Critical elements for the offering of credit, such as low farm debt, are good compared to other countries. There is sufficient farm efficiency across the dairy sector to allow for expansion and the financial requirements that go with that. Notwithstanding issues such as superlevy payments, the dipping of milk prices recently and certain tax considerations, the banks made it clear to us that, in their opinion, the fundamentals for a large expansion of the dairy sector are in place. To make a long story short, they are in serious competition with each other to get a piece of an expanding industry which they have analysed. Their conclusions are similar that there will be volatility but, if managed correctly, the gains massively outweigh the downside. The most productive meeting we had was with the Irish Farmers Association and I thank Ms Elaine Farrell, Ms Rowena Dwyer and Ms Catherine Lascurettes, the head of the dairy section. I will mention two points from that meeting and explain why we proposed a new oversight structure for the dairy sector. I refer to the issue of fixed milk price contracts. Glanbia is the leader in this area and is opening up Belview tomorrow. In my area of the south east, 15% to 20% of Glanbia suppliers have taken up the contracts and the scheme is now in its fifth year. In some respects, banks are more likely to give credit when that kind of financial underpinning is in place. However, these fixed milk price contracts are not the norm and have not worked everywhere for various reasons. They are an example of the variances that exist in the relationships between the different co-operatives and their customers. Others have expressed the view that the co-operative scene is slightly fragmented in some respects. I also refer to the level of collaboration and information throughout the dairy sector.The IFA is a very good example of this, working with Teagasc and the banks to hold seminars and workshops around the country. That dynamic is occurring and the elements for increased production, such as the new technology centres, have been put in place. I can be critical. I looked at this sector. I am not being critical in any respect. The Minister has done a very good job. What we are proposing and what he has accepted is just something that could assist in this. I do not see any weakness so far in this strategy. We are talking about a centralised and structured oversight system for the dairy sector to manage the volatility we expect to occur, the value this industry has for rural Ireland and the potential gains we will accrue across the board. The other organisational change that leads us to believe that would be a constructive step is the sizeable number of people within the Department dealing with milk quota issues. They should be used to co-ordinate and assist in managing the growth and change in the sector. Their institutional expertise would be maximised by incorporating that kind of expertise into a structure that manages the type of volatility we expect to see, for example, in the superlevy discussions the Minister mentioned earlier. This structure could deal with the policy aspects that come up in the next five to ten years efficiently and quickly. We talked about the Minister chairing this new forum. Our idea was to have the Secretary General chair it, but that is a better idea. Our idea was to call it the dairy industry partnership, but the Minister can call it anything he wants. Our idea would be that this would evolve. Once put in place, one of the roles of that forum would be to evolve over time as the industry changes and to react to volatility if it occurs. The idea is simple: to bring all the players in the sector together. It would meet on a quarterly basis and include all the groups from the dairy sector, including co-ops, the banks, the IFA and other farmer representative groups. We will have little control over the global markets, but if such a group were formalised within the sector, it would assist in managing the volatility, the unknowns and the uncertainty by identifying the changes and trends that will occur in the dairy industry in the years ahead. There will be no quangos, no new budgets, just a reorganisation of the sector to fit the completely new environment the dairy industry finds itself in.

The time allocated for it is relatively limited and, as I indicated at the outset, it is a pity we did not make provision for a question and answer session, because there are a number of questions that need to be addressed and in which the industry would be very interested. The introduction of the milk quotas in 1983-----
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	446	If the Deputy asks questions, I will try to answer them.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	447	I will summarise them at the end and I hope the Minister will address them. The introduction of the milk quota in 1983 came at a very inopportune time for Irish agriculture. For a number of years after our entry to the EEC, we simply were not sufficiently developed for such restriction. The increase in the New Zealand level of production since 1983 graphically illustrates the degree of disadvantage rural Ireland was placed at because of the introduction of the superlevy in 1983. The same explanations for its introduction that will be advanced now were also given then - the assured market supports, the issue of curtailing overproduction and the capacity of the market to take the production at the time. They are all the issues that were teased out across this floor at the time. Deputy Brendan Smith, as Minister for agriculture, was the instigator of Food Harvest 2020, which set out the roadmap for the expansion of agriculture, with dairying identified as a clear growth area. The context for it is the growth in world population and the buying potential of the middle classes in new markets, which the Minister has been endeavouring to identify and to pursue through a decent marketing strategy. Last year was a relatively good year for milk prices. Prices softened in the middle of the year and into the tail of the year there was a steady decrease, and there was decreased demand for reasons I will come to later. Unfortunately, the predictions for milk prices in 2015, particularly the quite dismal predictions we had early on in the year, which hopefully will not materialise, will have profound implications for people who have borrowed heavily to invest in the expansion and development of their farm enterprises, not to mention the significant investment decisions processors have taken around the country. Approximately 17,000 dairy farmers are facing a superlevy bill of €88 million. Every 1% of overproduction represents a €15 million bill for the dairy industry. Let us think about that figure for a moment. Some €88 million will be taken out of an industry that is making significant repayments. Various speakers have mentioned the interest that the banks, particularly AIB and Bank of Ireland, are taking in the expansion potential of the dairy sector. Farmers who are locked into repayment commitments in those circumstances will receive bills for tens of thousands of euro. When will this have to be paid? Are we talking about a payment date of November 2015? The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development has been talking about it being paid over a three-year period. Farmers reading the front page of
the Farming Independent last Tuesday must have sat down and asked themselves where the clarity was on this matter and what their position would be at the end of 2015. In 2015 we will have the bill of €88 million coming collectively to individual dairy farmers. We are going to have a significantly increased farm taxation bill.

We do not know it will be €88 million. It will be less than that, but it will be a big figure.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	449	Overproduction of 1% is €15 million. If it is 3% or 4%, the sums are relatively easy to do. They are the ballpark figures we are talking about. In a debate like this we must take the more extreme figure because it will be the most penal for the industry. Individual farmers will be faced with this. They will also be faced with an increased income tax bill. The income levels for 2014 were such that individual farmers are going to have the accountants dropping in from the Revenue Commissioners saying that they will have to pay additional money come next October on the basis of their production figures for 2014. In many ways, the background to this debate is 2014, the perfect storm. There was a weakened global dairy market position and we had a period of good weather and good prices with increased milk production in every region of the world. Irish dairy farmers produced a record 5.6 billion litres of milk in 2014, 4.5% more than in 2013. It was the perfect storm - falling prices, the Russian ban, world oversupply and a big tax bill on 2014 profits. In late 2014, Chinese demand dropped to a very low level when the Russian ban came into effect.

I have only a limited time to finish. There are a number of issues we need to address regarding the superlevy bill. I said earlier that 1% represented €15 million of a bill. We need clarification as to when it is going to be paid. Is it going to be paid over a three-year period? If so, is a processor going to pay it or is the Department going to pay it with the recovery of that money from individual farmers over that period? Who will have to pay the interest accumulation on the borrowings or will they be factored into the final bill?

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	457	The front page of the Farming Independent sets out the uncertainty in the industry. Tonight is an opportunity for the Minister to clarify the position. Earlier this year we debated the butterfat adjustment. The 2% figure would have represented a saving of €30 million for the industry. Where is the possibility of a butterfat adjustment due to our exceptional circumstances? We are glad to see progress being made on the various issues, for example, the investment in processors. We are also delighted that the industry is expanding at such a rate. However, we must remember something. Expansion and intensification bring their own problems that individual dairy farmers milking 20 or 25 cows 20 years ago did not have. The phrases "BVD", "IBR", "neospora" and "salmonella" were not in the veterinary dictionary at the time, but they are common currency today. They are the challenges that individual farmers will have to meet on a daily basis. The superlevy regime is extraordinary when one thinks about it, particularly the fact that we have not been able to negotiate a soft landing in the changeover.

I am glad to be in a position to say that they are coming on stream. However, it is extraordinary that such a bill would drop into the Irish dairy industry at that time and in those circumstances. I would appreciate if the Minister addressed my few points when he replies.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	466	When I hear Fianna Fáil talking about a soft landing, I must confess that it puts a shiver up my spine. I hope that Fianna Fáil's history with soft landings is not replicated in the dairy industry post quota. When the history of the Irish agricultural sector, particularly its dairy industry, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries is written, there will be an interesting chapter on the quota regime. In the early 1980s when I began cutting my political teeth, one of the hottest topics in politics was the introduction of quotas and the carnage they inflicted on farmers who were participating in, if memory serves, the farm modernisation scheme. Bureaucracy built up and there was political and legal uncertainty. There were Mulder quotas and High Court, Supreme Court and European court rulings. In light of the figures outlined by Deputy Tom Fleming, there was carnage when economic opportunity collapsed. Prior to the introduction of quotas, there were 65,000 dairy farmers. Today, there are only 18,000. As we face into a new dawn for the industry post quota, many have spoken about consolidating the number of dairy farmers at approximately 17,000 or 18,000, but we must be more ambitious. With the quota going, 400 or 500 new entrants are lining up and have invested significantly in recent years. The tragedy of quotas was the economic opportunity lost to the country. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, referred to an anticipated €1 billion of additional export value to the dairy industry under Food Harvest 2020. That is significant, but the industry has lost many farm families along the way. The countryside is littered with milking parlours that have been decommissioned because of this lost opportunity. We must be ambitious for the sector and maximise opportunities. When the history is written, one of the interesting anecdotes will tell of farmers' endeavours in the environment of capped production to grow their industry. Reference has been made to the farming organisations. It was part and parcel of the work of any public representative to apply to tribunals for additional quota on behalf of dairy constituents. Some of the Minister's officials are present. I wish to pay tribute to all of the officials in the Department who gave sterling service to the industry at a time when the glue that bound policy together was quotas. With representatives from the IFA, Mr. Michael Slattery, Mr. Con Scully of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, and various others, we used to send out applications for additional quota. Farmers would fill them up, we would send the farmers to talk with people, we would talk to the Minister and we would try to secure 1,000, 1,500 or 2,000 gallons here, there and everywhere. It is a credit to the ingenuity and endurance of those involved in the dairy industry at the farm gate that, in such a difficult environment, they grew that industry by hook or by crook and through lease, purchase and every other policy instrument available to them. Their commitment to investing in it puts those who have survived to this juncture on a par with business people in any sector.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	467	Absolutely.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	468	It is because of that acumen and ability that the processing sector has equally prospered, as they are the same people who populate the boards of our dairy co-ops the length and breadth of the country. I take my hat off to them. When it was not the sound bet for the banks that it might be today, these people were prepared to put their money where their mouths were and invest in their industry. The fundamental ambition for the industry must not be to consolidate around the 17,000 or 18,000 farmers, but to remember the 65,000 who had ambitions in the early 1980s to be part and parcel of the dairy industry and to try to reopen opportunities for them. I welcome the fact that there are new entrants, but we can facilitate even more. I wish to make a number of points on the expansion in the dairy herd, although I am conscious that the clock is ticking more quickly than I would like. If managed through the advisory service, for example, there is a significant opportunity to create an alternative model for beef production. If policy in the dairy sector has been inextricably linked with quotas for too long, policy in the beef sector is inextricably and almost exclusively linked with the suckler cow. The suckler cow has played a tremendous role in improving quality, but there is a need to develop a model of beef production that is parallel to suckler cow and bull beef production and is tied into the opportunity presented by the expansion in the dairy herd. What is the hallmark of the global dairy market in the post-quota era? That the tenor of this debate has been largely positive is welcome. The positivity is well founded. If one considers the market, one's first conclusion must be that it is growing by approximately 15 billion litres annually. That is three times what Ireland produces in any year. One could say that much of the growth in the market is far removed from us geographically, but we are well positioned with our low cost base to tap into it. When Teagasc published its report last year, a cloud gathered over the industry and there was a bit of uncertainty. The message that dairy farmers know better than anyone else is that, post quota, volatility will be at the heart of the industry. It is a question of managing that. Like Deputy Deasy, I thank the Minister for taking on board our suggestion of a dairy industry partnership. Farmers and processors have established track records. The Irish Dairy Board should also be involved, as should the banks. Its membership should not just include the Glanbias and Dairygolds, but be representative of all processors. Farmers' representatives should be included, as should the advisory service.They can track trends and anticipate global developments, including political developments, for example, in the Russian market, and outline what policy measures need to be put in place in that regard. They can anticipate consumer trends and analyse how the processing industry needs to shift if necessary. That is the advantage of such a partnership. The Deputy referred to the beef forum. This would be more of a partnership because it is a more harmonious construct than the forum, which is understandable given who owns the processing plants. Farmers have a stake in processing and that is why this could be much more productive. Much comment has been made about banks. I met bank officials along with Deputy Deasy in anticipation of the debate and average figures were trotted out. Average debt is low at €24,000; average debt in the dairy industry is low at €62,000; and average debt among those in the industry who have borrowings is low at €92,000. I am not worried about average debt but I am worried about individual cases because that is where the problems arise. We need to explore the possibility of providing cheaper credit to the dairy sector, although I welcome the availability of Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland funding, which is cheaper. Our money is expensive in an international context and it should not be. The banks must be included in this partnership because we need to be prudent about lending. We need to be better dairy farmers before we are bigger dairy farmers. There was almost a headlong rush into expansion because of an artificial deadline created by quotas ending in early 2015. A farmer can expand at any time but the prudent time to do so is when he or she has maximised the output of his or her current operation and has potential to expand. Perhaps the necessary rein on the enthusiasm of banks to lend could be provided within that partnership and could encourage farmers to be better before they are bigger. Deputy Kirk made a constructive point about cashflow problems on farms and banks are key to solving that this year. Cashflow issues will arise because of the superlevy, preliminary tax liabilities and falling incomes. The Minister needs to work with banks in that regard. There is a legacy issue primarily, although not exclusively, in the agriculture industry in Cork, relating to the withdrawal of the ACC banking operation. A substantial number of farmers in the county find that their capacity to borrow is restricted. The ACC has surrendered its licence and these farmers cannot get credit from other banks without moving their banking facilities lock, stock and barrel. They could do that at the risk of losing the lower cost of funds they currently enjoy. I find it incredible that a bank can surrender its licence and operate in such a cavalier fashion towards its remaining clients. The Governor and the Central Bank should examine this, given it is putting a handbrake on development in the sector, particularly for a handful of farmers in Cork. Cork County Council commissioned a study, to which Deputy Deasy referred, which was carried out by CIT. The council has no axe to grind and there was no political agenda. The impending change is perceived by the researchers as a win win scenario with caveats inside and outside the farm gate and growth in jobs. That is what this is about for the economy and rural Ireland in particular. There is potential for 4,000 jobs in Cork alone. We need to manage the volatility. The partnership structure, which is key to this, is the way to do that with all the stakeholders on board.

I welcome the opportunity to contribute and I also welcome the Minister's announcement that he anticipates the creation of 10,000 jobs following this regime change. This will be welcomed by everybody in rural Ireland, which has not experienced the best of fortunes over the past few years. He said that, on the Dublin road out of Cork, there was a €80 million plant and, on the Limerick road, there was a €130 million plant but, sadly, he did not make announcements relating to when he took the Boyle road out of Carrick-on-Shannon or the Roscommon road out of Ballinasloe. I did not hear any announcement relating to the west and I would like an emphasis to be put on that.

That has put pressure on local farmers in all the western counties and I hope the Minister will take this on board. There seems to be a move towards having bigger farms but I am very much in favour of always protecting the family farm. According to farmers, they were basing their borrowing on a milk price of approximately 28 cent per litre. A few months ago, it was anticipated the price per litre would drop during the first six to eight months of this year. Luckily, the devaluation of the euro is probably saving the day but I urge caution in this regard. I have said to farmers all over the country that they should be prudent in their borrowing because we do not want a return to the 1980s. In New Zealand following the abolition of quotas, there were significant farm repossessions and marriage breakdowns. This was because farmers went head first into expansion because they thought they had landed the lotto. We need to make sure the changeover is handled in an orderly fashion and farmers are protected at all times. The Minister referred to the increased milk production that would result but something else will suffer because the cow will not milk twice as much as she did last year. There will probably be 50% more dairy cows in the country and, therefore, more land is needed for that. We must consider what we are getting rid of to provide for the increased production. He also talked about more efficient production. In Cork, a cow may go out to grass in February but it could be April or May before a cow will go out in the west. We have to make sure there is a regional balance to production. If there are more cows producing more milk, will we be playing into the beef barons' hands? In recent years, the more cattle that were in the country, the greater the capacity they had to press the button in their factories when they were ready for killing and this enabled them to drop their prices and screw the farmer. I am worried about this. Calves born out of the dairy herd must continue to be exported. Teagasc told every farmer a few years ago to hold on to bull beef because that was the way forward. We held on to them and our pockets were emptied. I urge the Minister to look at this. I also urge him to incentivise young farmers as much as he can. Some have missed out on the upcoming change. He should examine their position again because we need young farmers. We used to have 300,000 farmers but we are down to 120,000. I ask him to make sure the beef sector and the suckler cow sector are not taken apart.

It is time for people within the industry, government, farming organisations and agencies such as Enterprise Ireland to take off the blinkers and recognise that there is huge potential for the development of the dairy industry in the west and north west. Scale is an issue and that will be a challenge but we need to support the development of projects such as the cheese project proposed by the creameries in the west and north west. They wanted to come together to develop a cheese manufacturing facility.Sadly, the Minister at the time, Ms Mary Coughlan, did not facilitate that project to allow it to go ahead. I think it would have had a huge impact in our part of the country. It has been projected that milk supply will grow by between one quarter and one third in the west and north west. That will be supported by the Aurivo plant in Ballaghaderreen. As a result of the significant investment that has been made at the plant, the company now supports 150 milk manufacturing jobs in the area and exports to 50 countries around the world.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	479	I am delighted to have an opportunity to participate in this discussion on the real opportunity that exists for Ireland in this sector. When the curtain came down on milk production in Ireland 30 years ago, it stifled people in rural areas, particularly young farmers who wanted to get involved in milk production. We are now facing a new dawn that will bring huge opportunities for many people in rural Ireland who are yearning and crying out to get involved in milk production. I returned to my constituency in County Tipperary on a Wednesday night six weeks ago to meet approximately 300 young farmers who had gathered in a hall to try to get information on the grants that were available and on how to get involved in this growing industry. Deputy Creed mentioned that approximately 3,000 jobs could be created in Cork. I believe between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs will be created in Tipperary simply as a result of the expansion of the dairy industry. Deputies will be familiar with the announcements made by Dairygold and Glanbia, which is opening a new facility tomorrow. Two weeks ago, Arrabawn launched a €30 million programme of investment involving Teagasc, the dairy co-operatives and the University of Limerick. This will involve undertaking further research on the entire dairy industry and looking into the future to check what the markets are. When an industry like dairying is on the crest of expansion, it must consider where it can sell its products, such as the various ingredients that are made from the milk that is produced on the land of Ireland. On the basis of my experience in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have no doubt that there are huge opportunities across the world for milk exports. The Irish Dairy Board is now working with the co-operatives to try to develop the growing middle class market in South Africa. There are opportunities in the Chinese market and throughout the world. In January 2014, I stood in a supermarket and saw a German housewife picking out Irish butter above any other butter. She did so because it was produced from an environment that was second to none. Ireland is established right across the world as having a clean environment and producing a unique type of butter and milk. That is what we should be standing up for. We are on the crest of a huge opportunity for this country. Rather than knocking this country and talking about its disadvantages, we should see the opportunities and seize the challenges that exist for it. There are certainly signposts of which we should be aware. I agree with those who spoke earlier about the dangers of overenthusiasm. In the past, people got involved in overborrowing. We saw it in the 1980s, when people borrowed too much and interest rates went higher. I caution young people, in particular, about the need to be careful and prudent and to cost what they are doing. We do not want to revisit the mistakes of the past. We have a good story. We are producing a high-quality product that we can market all over the world. The source of that product is the family farm, which we want to protect. This Government has stood solidly behind the protection of the family farm, the people on the land and the many rural communities that depend on agriculture. As I said, we have to be very careful about the dangers of overborrowing and overexpansion. Deputy O'Reilly asked me to mention the recent expansion of Lakeland Dairies in his part of the world, where land is poor and farming is difficult. That company announced last week that it intended to create 83 jobs, with another 180 jobs in the construction phase.

Deputy O'Reilly and others are committed to that. We want to support the industry. It sends out the wrong signal to be negative about it. Those who talk about the demise of rural Ireland should focus on the great opportunities that exist. We need to stick together. We have a good industry, a good environment and a good climate. All I want to say in support of the Government's position is that this is a good project. I hope it can be replicated in many other areas of agriculture and the country more generally. If we can do that, we will be doing a very good job for our country.

#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	490	I was struck by the contrast between the Deputy's contribution and that made by Deputy Naughten, who represents the same constituency. As a beef and tillage farmer, I know that any farmer would wish to be free of market supports and to be able to make a living by producing top-quality produce for the market. The Government has worked to create such an environment. It has worked tirelessly to bring an end to the quota regime and this will happen in the coming weeks. Many Opposition speakers have concentrated on the challenges and risks that will be presented by this abolition, for which we pushed. I would like to mention some of the massive opportunities that exist, and not just for the primary producer. A new Glanbia plant will be opened tomorrow as part of the expansion of that company. Dairygold and Kerry Group are also expanding. This will lead to the creation of value-added jobs - top-quality jobs for our graduates - that are linked to food and drink exports. Irish graduates who had gone abroad to work in places like Holland are coming home to work for Kerry Group in my county of Kildare. That is an example of the positive impact these good quality jobs are having in regional and rural parts of Ireland. It is phenomenal that approximately 10,000 jobs are to be created in this sector in the next five years. As the Minister pointed out, Ireland is the only country that is targeting 15% growth in 2015 and year-on-year growth up to 2020. I have always said we do not need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to fixing our economy and improving how things operate in Ireland. We need to get back to what we are good at. The dairy industry is a perfect example of an area on which we should concentrate because we have the climate, the topography, the top-quality grassland and, most importantly, the expertise among our farmers, who know how to produce more high-quality dairy products into the future. Our strong international reputation for high standards of quality, safe food is absolutely key. As some of the farming organisations are represented in the Gallery this evening, I would like to take this opportunity to ask farmers who tend to complain about the inspection regime that is in place to understand that this system exists to protect them and safeguard the reputation we now enjoy. I accept that dairy farmers are less likely to do this than other farmers. It is because we have those higher standards that our beef sector, for example, is able to access markets like China and the United States before any other European country. That is in the best interests of primary producers. I would like to refer to the 2007 and 2009 baseline figures for dairy market exports. In those years, we produced dairy products worth almost €2.2 billion. That figure had increased by almost one third to €3 billion by 2013. It is worth mentioning the dairy growth targets for the period between 2013 and 2020 in this context.In 2007 and 2009, almost 5 billion litres were produced; in 2013, 5.5 billion litres; and the target for 2020 is 7.5 billion litres. This is a phenomenal target and with it come huge opportunities and challenges. The per capita consumption of dairy products in developing countries is expected to increase by 1.2% to 1.9% per year with the further globalisation of diets.

I could give a technical critique of the Bill and why it would protect tens of thousands of men, women and children but there is no point because it will be voted down in 90 minutes. Instead, I would like to take the time I have to tell a quick story. In late January, a couple came to see me in Wicklow. They had a mortgage and were both working and getting on with their lives when he suffered health problems and they went into arrears. They went to a personal insolvency practitioner who came up with a proposal. They had the agreement of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, went to court, proposed it to the judge and the bank came in and vetoed it. The judge adjourned the hearing to try to make it happen but the bank vetoed it again. They were forced into bankruptcy and the official assignee has granted a five-year income attachment order. For the next five years, everything they earn goes to the bank. Her wages have fallen as well and now they cannot meet their rent. The rent allowance rules mean that if the rent allowance allocation does not meet the full market rent, people get nothing. Rent allowance does not come close to current market rents in many places. The couple came to me in January not to talk about the mortgage but to talk about their options when they were made homeless. I am sick and tired of meeting Irish men and women who come into our offices with these stories. I am sick of hard-working men and women having their dignity taken from them and coming in in fear because they were unlucky enough to get sick or have their wages cut. This Government and the previous Government have done nothing. Inaction by the Government means this couple will be homeless, their lives will be destroyed, it will cost the State a fortune and the bank will not get a fraction of what it would have received through a binding solution. The Bill is a small step in the right direction and should be passed. A non-whipped vote in the Select Sub-Committee on Finance would see it voted through. I commend the Bill to the House and I congratulate Deputy Michael McGrath.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	494	I support the Bill and think it should be passed. It is very similar to a Bill I introduced two years ago. It is similar in seeking to remove the veto of the banks and seeks to use the machinery set out in the Personal Insolvency Act. In 2009, I noticed this when I was knocking on doors during the local election. We knew that things were happening behind closed doors but only in that election campaign did we start hearing people talking about huge mortgage arrears. This is a crisis but one does not get that impression from the Government's response to date. Deputies are aware of the pressure and the distress of tens of thousands of families struggling to keep a roof over their heads. In 2011, a family from Ballyfermot came into our office. The man had lost his job, the woman was on part-time work and they had three young kids. They had purchased a house a year before that and I could see the stress, grief and anger in their faces. We managed to get a mortgage-to-rent arrangement and it was like seeing a new couple walk in the door a month later. They were completely different people. Deputies are aware of the increasingly ruthless and heartless approach by banks. The banks want their pound of flesh and, with house prices rising rapidly, we can expect to see an increase in repossessions, which is a polite term for eviction. The code of conduct and insolvency legislation are, to put it bluntly, useless. I tried to introduce legislation recently to make it legal. This is not a solution but a pretence at a solution. The mortgage to rent scheme is the only sustainable option for many families but it was never an option about which the banks were enthusiastic. The limit is €220,000 and that must be increased to €300,000 in Dublin. I ask the Minister to consider it.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	495	I welcome the Bill from the point of view that it is an attempt to dilute the power of the banks and enable people to stay in their homes with sustainable mortgages. Keeping people in their homes is best for them and economically best for society, not to mind the personal trauma of that upheaval. The current arrangements mean that, while the final decision rests with the banks, there cannot be an equitable solution. The interest of the banks is not in keeping people in their homes but in tidying up their books and moving things on. Sound human, economic and common sense do not prevail in that situation. There are many examples but, like Deputy Joan Collins, I will refer to one. Two unconnected families, both of which engaged with the financial institutions about mortgage-to-rent scenarios, had set up arrangements with a voluntary housing organisation almost one year ago. The bank dragged its heels and is now hiding behind the fact that the valuation levels set in 2012 are redundant for today's market of rising property prices. As the value has gone up, those people are being told the mortgage-to-rent scheme is off even though they met the criteria at the time and everything had been lined up. They faced the prospect of almost immediate eviction and of uprooting their families from their schools and the areas in which they lived. We paid the piper and the taxpayer bailed out the banks. These schemes need to be adopted to take account of the current changes in the market. The Bill is a step in that direction.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	496	The Government is basking in what it reckons are good employment and Exchequer returns figures of the past few days. The Bill puts its finger on the great weakness in the figures coming through. There is human suffering going on and a seriously good Bill like this is being turned down to perpetuate people being evicted and homes being repossessed. This is unacceptable and what is extraordinary is that the enormous problem, which everyone acknowledges and every Deputy finds in every constituency, is not being tackled by the Government. The Government has missed every target and evictions are about to begin in an organised and distasteful way, yet Members are sitting back and saying we do not accept a Bill like this. The big difference between Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill and the Government's attitude is the craven way in which the Government has continuously allowed the banks to have the last say on mortgages. The Bill removes that, although I do not think it is radical enough.I do not see any reason why those who provided the initial reckless loans - and undoubtedly they were reckless loans - should be given the power to review and decide the new terms of those loans and to not support the solutions proposed under this Bill. The solution to the problem lies in debt forgiveness. That is where we need to start because it acknowledges the fact that the banks rather than the borrowers made the mistakes.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	497	The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, does not need me to tell her that there are many people in Ireland in a very difficult place with regard to property. With every passing month of the past seven or eight years since the crisis started, the situation has become starker. I know more about banks and receivers than I want to know. Given my involvement in the building industry, I have been contacted by people from all over the Twenty-six Counties whose stories in terms of what has happened to them are very sad. In bailing out the banks, people were of the opinion that, because they were paying to sort out the banks' problems, their problems would, in turn, be dealt with. However, that is not what happened. Allied Irish Banks, which is owned by the taxpayer, is becoming increasingly aggressive in trying to dispose of its distressed assets because it is likely to be sold soon. It does not give a damn about the people at the receiving end of its actions. That is the sad truth. We have not put manners on our financial institutions or receivers. Institutions apply the letter of the law when it suits them and they also bend it as they see fit when it suits them. Over the past seven years, it has been the case that power walks tall and the rest can stuff it.

#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	499	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil and acknowledge the situation of people in mortgage distress. I wish there was a quick fix but, unfortunately, there is not. Since taking office, this Government has been working very hard to fix the economy and is making good progress. This is reflected in the growth in international confidence in Ireland. In 2010, when we were in recession and faced with financial insolvency, we sought a €67.5 billion international rescue. In 2011, our deficit was over €22 billion. By the end of 2015, it will have been reduced to less than €5 billion. This is the result of the hard work and determination of the Government and, particularly, the people of this country who have suffered for so long because of the major disaster created by Fianna Fáil. When in government, it borrowed funds to meet social welfare costs, etc., rather than invest in areas where it was badly needed. Fianna Fáil caused the property bubble and subsequent crash. It is responsible for many young people and couples having purchased houses which were beyond the reach of the average working person or couple.  This Government is doing its best to help the people now being contacted by the banks and brought before the courts. In this regard, it introduced the Personal Insolvency Bill, which was passed in December 2012, and launched the Insolvency Service of Ireland in March 2013. It has also put in place a range of measures to assist ordinary people who cannot pay their debts, including their mortgages. The Insolvency Service of Ireland has already helped large numbers of people in an understanding way. The service puts people in touch with a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, who can help them work through their difficulties with the banks and other creditors. People are being proactively encouraged to avail of this service. Since the suspension of application fees, there has been an increase in the number of people availing of personal insolvency arrangements, which are solutions to their arrears problems. More people should be availing of these types of solutions. The first step is to make more people aware of what is possible and to encourage them to actively engage with the insolvency service. This will be the focus of this Government into the future. The Government is also reviewing the operation of the insolvency service to ensure it has the power to support families willing to work their way through their debt problems. Of course, each situation is different and needs an individual solution. The primary focus of the Government is a solution to keep families in their homes. The Government is making headway. The most recent statistics show a significant improvement in arrears, particularly in respect of family homes. The Central Bank figures, which indicate that the number of family homes in arrears has decreased over the last five quarters, underlines this trend.  In 2014, the number of mortgages in arrears decreased by 25,000. Figures from the Department of Finance in respect of the six main banks indicate that the number of cases of arrears in excess of 90 days has fallen by more than 15,500 since the start of 2014. In August 2013, 2,500 split mortgages were put in place by the six main banks. Currently, this figure stands at 19,000 and is rising. During the same period permanent restructuring for family homes provided by the six banks increased from 41,000 to almost 115,000. This is the proper way to go about helping people. We must lead people into the insolvency service where they will meet with people who can help them through their financial difficulties, rather than work against them. Like other Deputies, I could cite many examples of people attending my clinics who are distraught because of the level of debt in which they find themselves. We need to help people to resolve their problems and to do so we need to work together. This evening I call on the banks, which announced huge profits in the past couple of weeks, to do likewise. Bank of Ireland's pre-tax profits for the year ending 2014 was €920 million. Ulster Bank made an operational profit of €606 million. It is time for the banks to step up and do what is required of them. The Irish people and the Government have helped to resolve the problem and it is now the turn of the banks.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	500	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Family Home Mortgage Settlement Arrangement Bill. The purpose of the Bill, as described by Deputy Michael McGrath, is to assist mortgage holders in arrears and to address the current haphazard and inconsistent manner in which arrears are tackled. Every week, I deal with people in my constituency who are in mortgage arrears and meet with them and their banks to try to put in place amicable arrangements that are workable for both parties. As recent figures indicate, my home county of Louth has one of the highest percentage of people in mortgage arrears, which is a direct result of the policies, or lack of policies, of the previous Government in keeping lending and house prices under control. For example, the cost of a standard three-bedroom semi-detached house in Dundalk rose from €35,000 in 1998 to over €220,000 in 2007, which is an increase of €185,000 in under ten years. This situation was unsustainable. We now know the Government of the day, led by Fianna Fáil, did nothing to keep the situation under control. It did not attempt to cool the market. Its inability to regulate the banks, despite the many warnings to it in this regard, led to continual overheating of the market. Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill proposes a number of provisions, including the introduction of family home mortgage settlement arrangements whereby the mortgage holder in arrears may instruct a personal insolvency practitioner to work on his or her behalf in coming to an arrangement with a financial institution. The Bill also provides that the mortgage holder in arrears can enter only one arrangement. Section 7 provides that a protective certificate can be issued for 180 days and be extended only once. Section 9 provides that the personal insolvency practitioner shall prepare on behalf of the person in arrears a proposal for a family home mortgage settlement arrangement as soon as is practicable after the protective certificate is in place.Section 11 of the Bill provides that, once the family home mortgage settlement arrangement is in effect, a financial institution can apply to vary or terminate it. I cannot support the Bill as it currently stands. As I noted earlier, I deal with this issue on a weekly basis on behalf of my constituents. The Bill will not help them in any way. It does not acknowledge the Government's ongoing commitment to assist home owners in mortgage arrears or the progress we have made to date in this area. The number of people in mortgage arrears has fallen by more than 25,000 since 2014 and nearly 115,000 restructuring arrangements are in place. The Bill fails to address the complex nature of debt solutions in a fair and equitable manner. Personal insolvency legislation already provides remedies for mortgage holders in arrears and all of the options proposed are already provided for under the personal insolvency arrangements. The Bill is not only deficient but will also create a series of negative repercussions for everybody involved in this process, including mortgage holders in arrears, the courts, lending institutions, new applicants for mortgages, particularly in respect of principal private residences, and the continuing operation of the personal insolvency system. It ignores the fact that settlements on family homes can be made through personal insolvency arrangements. Even if I were to agree with the principles of the Bill, it would not be possible to accept it as it is currently drafted as it is very weak. The Deputies opposite are well aware that the Government recognises the importance of ensuring the banks engage with personal insolvency arrangements. The Departments of Finance and Justice and Equality are currently working on proposals for making the insolvency legislation more effective in supporting the many people who are trapped in unsustainable debts and reaching solutions that are sustainable for all parties. I recommend that the matters raised in the Bill be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for its consideration.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	501	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the matters raised in this Bill. As long as many of our citizens struggle with mortgage debt, we have to keep revisiting this issue. The banks have been given targets and timelines for restructuring and dealing with individuals in arrears. I welcome that the number of private dwelling home mortgage accounts in arrears declined by 25,000 during 2014 and that more than 115,000 restructuring arrangements are in place. However, home owners in mortgage arrears continue to encounter serious problems with their banks despite assurances given by the latter to the Taoiseach and the Government. The stories that home owners recount of their experiences in dealing with banks bring into doubt the latters' assurances that they are engaging meaningfully or doing their utmost to avoid putting people out of their homes. The banks are occupying parallel universes when it comes to dealing with mortgage arrears. These problems are manifest in the county registrars' courts around the country. These courts are where we can find empirical evidence of how the banks are dealing with people. The cases are often uncontested because people are overwhelmed, owe the money and end up in court. The issues that are being revealed are very troubling. In many cases, people have made no payments on their mortgages for three or four years, which is a considerable length of time for any family or individual to live with the fear of losing a home. The legal proceedings for repossessing a home, which the banks are entitled to pursue, appear to career along with little regard to the process the Government has put in place whereby banks engage meaningfully with people in arrears to ensure that putting someone out of his or her home is the last resort. On the legal side, civil bills issue and proceedings go undefended because the individuals concerned believe they are dealing directly with the banks and therefore do not file a defence. The solicitor goes into court to say the case is undefended and that there was no appearance but the individual, who is representative him or herself, complains that he or she contacted the bank repeatedly only to be put on to different people each time. There is no resolution other than questions about how the debt will be paid. The individual might be asked to submit a proposal but there is still no resolution. There is no meaningful engagement and it appears in many cases that individuals are getting through to glorified call centres where their details are taken and questions are asked about what is going to be done. Unless these individuals can get help from MABS or legal practitioners working on a pro bono basis, they are left high and dry by the banks. We all know if we do not pay our mortgages the banks are entitled to repossess our properties but that is an old conversation and we should have moved on to the point where the banks recognise they have been rescued at the expense of the taxpayer. They owe more to society than their obligations under a mortgage agreement and they need to be continuously pressed in that regard. In County Mayo, 100 cases for final possession orders are being pursued by the banks every month. Many of these are adjourned repeatedly because banks cannot present evidence that they have complied with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. Solicitors are being instructed by the banks while customers in arrears are trying to engage. It is ridiculous that such people should end up in court. There is no evidence that the banks are distinguishing between people who were unwise to borrow in the first place and have no hope of repaying the loan, strategic defaulters and those who are in difficulty because they lost their jobs and who may come into better times in the future. The Government has to press harder on the banks. With money never cheaper to borrow, the same provision given to State in extending the terms of repayment of the national debt should be offered to borrowers whereby they could extend the terms of the loan on their family homes to 50 or 60 years. Those who will never afford to repay their loans need a more extensive mortgage to rent scheme to allow them to remain in their homes. This is a pressing issue that is not going away.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	502	While I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, we cannot give people false hope. We must encourage engagement both on the part of the banks and people who are in mortgage distress. Banks should be mindful that the importance of the family home cannot be underestimated. It is not a question of bricks and mortar or the number of bedrooms; it is about a lifetime of memories and a key part of a family's sense of place and belonging. Any threat to a family home gives rise not only to financial challenges but also places an emotional strain on every aspect of life and affects the physical and mental well-being of families. All of us deal with constituents who have issues with their banks for various reasons. Perhaps the most devastating impact of the economic crisis has been the tens of thousands of family homes that have been placed at risk by the policies pursued by Fianna Fáil when it was in Government. Husbands and wives, partners and children have been directly affected but there is also an impact on the wider family and neighbours. Unfortunately, the latest figures from the Central Bank indicate that 89,476 mortgages are still in arrears.While this is far too many, there is, thankfully, a decline from previous months. There also has been a decline of 1,930 in the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for more than 90 days to 62,266. Last December, the number of permanent mortgage restructures increased by 1,916. They are not just figures, they refer to people's lives. I keep making that point. What we must all do is collaborate to put in place a solution to look after these families. The Minister has confirmed to us in the House that she has completed a review of the personal insolvency legislation as promised under the statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016. She has said she will bring proposals to Government for any necessary legislative changes following consideration of the review. The wheels of change turn slowly in the House and many parts of the Civil Service. I ask the Minister and Minister of State at the Department to ensure that every effort is made to bring forward proposals to put in place further measures to help all of the families affected. The mortgage market is a delicate one and we must be careful to ensure that any changes do not discourage lending. At the same time, we must hold banks to account for how they do their business. We should take a more comprehensive look at the types of mortgages available. Currently, when a mortgage is surrendered and the bank sells the property, it can go after the mortgage holder personally for the balance of any money not recovered. In America, they have the non-recourse mortgage which means that when the keys are handed back, the bank cannot go after the home owner personally. It can only sell the property. The advantage of this system is that it forces banks to have an interest in reasonable and realistic prices. It means that if banks engage in excessive lending, they carry the risk also. If we are to avoid a repeat of the disaster we have had, non-recourse mortgages might be considered as a real alternative when it comes to family homes. As banks already use non-recourse mortgages in some commercial deals, why not use them for family homes? Non-recourse mortgages could be restricted to the first loan to purchase a property and it could be provided that they would remain in place only while the property is the primary residence of the mortgagor. We require creative and effective solutions for mortgage arrears, but we must also look at long-term mortgage policy. I hope the Minister and her colleagues in Cabinet can bring forward proposals as soon as possible in the interests of the families and people who require the assistance of all Members of the House. We must work collaboratively to ensure that we preserve and protect the family homes of so many people.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	503	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill tonight, not to provide people with false hope, as Deputy Buttimer said, but to provide them with some hope. Deputy Michael McGrath has been engaged with this issue over a number of years. For the last four years, it has been one of the topics I have held closest to my heart. I come from the younger generation most affected by negative equity and loan arrears. At one time, Deputy Stephen Donnelly and I sat down to see if we could tackle this problem, but its enormity made it clear that it is best dealt with at Cabinet level where Civil Service support is available. I am disappointed that it has come to this. We have done the State a disservice and there are better aspects of society. If we are talking about protecting the family unit, the home must be an integral part of that. We should not get carried away with what we have done on this as there is a huge problem of money that must be addressed to resolve the problem. There are some people living in principal dwelling houses, PDHs, where the house in question is far beyond their means. There is a very high profile case at the moment where the home is worth multimillions. I am not in favour of protecting just any home, but am particularly interested in cases where there are young children and the borrowers did nothing more than what we all aspire to do, which is put a house over the heads of our families. So many people have been left financially and mentally pressurised and, in some cases, without jobs. The numbers are of an avalanche scale, but they have not crashed just yet. Delving into my inner cynic, I can say as a former banker that the banks have behaved in an appalling fashion to date.

#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	507	One cannot say that those in the institutions governing the State are not culpable. The enormity of the crash was a result of the way the economy was run on construction and credit. It was a fallacy which has resulted in the privatisation of debts on the people who are carrying this forward. I refer in particular to my generation, which I call "Generation Jinxed" as so many have left the country and carried enormous debts. I am passionate about this as I am one of them and my friends and family feel this on a daily basis. I find it particularly difficult to understand why NAMA was established for developers under the Administration I call "the FIGS" for Fianna Fáil, Independents and Greens. Anybody with debts of more than €20 million was put into an institution and received a massive debt write-down that is not politically influenced at this point in time. The average person at home is dealing with privatised debt, variable rates are going up and those on tracker mortgages are having their tracker mortgages removed. Increased outgoings, including water taxes and property taxes, and job losses have made it a particularly difficult time for a large number of people. I welcomed the fact that we had a Cabinet that was of an age that could show maturity, that had experience and could go into the teeth of the abyss of the biggest catastrophe the State has every faced. I welcomed the fact that their shoes had been around the table before. However, it is a different generation that is feeling the brunt of the problem. I welcome that there are so many young speakers on this tonight. I do not know what quantum of money we will get, which is where I get to the problem I have. The banks have played masterful chess in this regard. They are now putting the boot in as their balance sheets have started to be repaired. Every loan they have is on a balance sheet and if property prices were suppressed and as low as they were five years ago, there would be no point in trying to squeeze people. They have left people at the end of their tethers due to the fact that they were not dealing with them. Now that they are dealing with them, they are saying "Hey, if you cannot afford the house, there is only one option". On the other side, is the State coming in and are local authorities providing homes for these people? Are we providing rent allowance immediately? This is only going to get bigger. According to the figures with which I have been provided, Court 9 in the High Court is potentially dealing with 15,000 houses. That represents 15,000 families and 15,000 homes that may be removed from them. Time is too short on this. The finance committee has done an enormous amount of work and we have beaten the living daylights out of the banks when they have been in front of us. There is only one way this will be resolved and that is with an enormous chunk of money. It is not like the money that was given to NAMA. No money was left behind by the previous Administration and no money was provided for in the contributions of any Member of the Opposition in the debate on this Bill. The banks should not be sold until such time as they deal in a meaningful manner with the majority of those who can be accommodated in their homes. The debt must be socialised, not privatised to screw the individual.

I congratulate Fianna Fáil on bringing the matter before the House at this time. It is an issue many Members have dealt with privately and face to face with banks in recent years. My history on this goes back to 2008, when the issue first raised its head. What we need as a matter of urgency is support for those who find themselves under pressure. I hold no brief for those who have made no attempt to deal with their debt problems. The fact is that there are a great many people out there who I, and I am sure many Members, have advised that they must pay something. They must pay what they can. Many people have done that and they are entitled to be treated with respect. They are entitled to be treated with the same respect with which the banks were treated just a few short years ago when they found themselves in difficulty. The taxpayers of this country - perhaps without their permission, which is a matter for another debate - came to the rescue of the banks and bailed them out. That is what happened. Now, the banking institutions have an opportunity to repay the trust they received in the first instance.I will not mention banks by name. I have been in and out of most banks in the past years and in the past week as well. I have been in and out of the courts on numerous occasions over the past five or six years along with constituents. Some banks went out of their way to help the borrowers and they were prepared to draw up a restructuring of loans. However, some banks did not do so; they looked at the debt and they decided they would wait until the equity changed and the price of property rose and repossess the property at that stage. Some banks showed no compassion from day one and they were absolutely callous in how they dealt with a borrowers' circumstances and situations. They were certainly not prepared to accommodate borrowers. We need to deal with that kind of situation as a society because it is our duty to stand by people who have made a genuine effort. Some people bought property worth €1 million and they have also taken a hit but I would not expect the State or anyone else to help them to live in that kind of luxury. However, I would expect in the case of a family home that some provision would be made to assist those who might otherwise become homeless on the side of the road. We have a moral obligation to help them. I sat across the table from a lending institution three times this week with three different customers. I was told that the banks, by their criteria, had determined that the borrowing was unsustainable. This was the same borrowing that the lending institution had afforded the borrower just a few short years ago. Did the bank take into account that the individual might not stay in the same job forever, that circumstances might not remain the same? These circumstances were brought about by the lending institutions' own stupidity, for want of a better description. I will not dwell on the situation where people were loaned money on an interest-only basis with no proposal for repayment, good, bad or indifferent. The lending institution has now informed them that their loans are unsustainable; they were unsustainable the day the loans were awarded in the first place, so I ask what are they talking about. This Bill is not what I believe is required because we need regulations specifically to oblige the lending institutions to elongate their loans, to extend them over a longer period and to provide for a warehousing of part of that debt for a period of time, just the same as the country was obliged to do because otherwise we would not have survived. Unless the country was given that kind of facility from the IMF and from our European partners, we would not have been able to survive. I congratulate the Government on the tremendous success it has achieved in that area. The Irish people have been trusting of the lending institutions. They agreed on the necessity to ensure the lending institutions prevailed, that if everything went to the wall then everyone would suffer. There is an opportunity for the Central Bank to put in place regulations to ensure nobody is evicted from a family home once he or she has made an effort - in some cases a valiant effort - to meet his or her commitments.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	510	I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath for introducing this Private Members' Bill. He has caught the mood of the discussion in the media and on the airwaves in view of some recent highly publicised cases. A total of 37,484 families have mortgages in arrears for more than two years and are in danger of having their homes repossessed. This is a very chilling figure. I hope Deputy McGrath's Bill, the Family Home Mortgage Settlement Arrangement Bill 2014, will remove the bank veto on solutions for mortgage debt. Banks should not be allowed to dictate the pace of any restructuring arrangements but it is a very worrying fact that repossessions have doubled in the past few years. Decisive action is required to ensure the number of repossessions is not increased in 2015. The Bill proposes to refer these cases to a court of law but these cases have already come before the Circuit Court, with more than 8,000 civil bills for an order of possession lodged in the Circuit Court. Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, as well as many Ministers, have stated they are not happy with a situation where some banks ignore the recommendations of personal insolvency practitioners to deal with distressed mortgages. I am very concerned that banks have been allowed to use legal action as a means of meeting the targets in the mortgage arrears target programme. More than 15% of mortgage accounts for family homes are in arrears and they account for more than 20% of the outstanding value of all family home mortgages. The Central Bank figures show that the mortgages on 117,000 principal home dwellings are in arrears and 60,000 of those are in arrears for one year or more. With rising prices there could be a greater risk of homes being repossessed. I refer to an article in last Monday's The Irish Times by Dr. Rory Hearne, about the housing crisis, as he termed it. He wrote that Central Bank rules have allowed banks to reclassify mortgages as restructured if a legal notice for repossession has been issued. This has been done to 50,000 homeowners, with a potential flood of repossessions and evictions if the trends in the courts continue. I cite the lovely Irish saying that a problem shared is a problem halved but a mortgage problem cannot be halved and this is becoming very clear to people. I have met constituents who made that point to me. I would welcome any assistance from banks but there is no engagement to deal with the serious issues facing people. I hear information about interest charges and surcharges on loans and the banks are very quick to explain the charges per month and per annum applying to accounts in arrears. This is an issue which demands our urgent attention. Growing numbers are facing the prospect of losing their family home because they cannot repay their mortgage. The House has been informed that the number of home repossession cases has increased so dramatically that additional court sittings are being scheduled to deal with them. The Seanad was told recently that 8,000 civil bills for an order of possession were lodged in the Circuit Court last year. The pressure is so great that some cases are being heard by county registrars rather than by a judge. The problems are clear. It has been suggested that this surge is because the banks believe that rising house prices in Dublin in particular have given them an opportunity to recoup some of the losses they had faced when forced to sell a property. Deputy Michael McGrath said the banks should have a clear strategy to ensure they do not take any further legal action for repossession. His Bill is a fair response and it should be supported as an appropriate legislative intervention which could have significant implications for people who are in mortgage distress.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	511	I welcome the opportunity to speak to this extremely important issue, which affects tens of thousands of people across the length and breadth of this country. I raised this issue as a Topical Issue before Christmas. The Minister who was taking the debate said I was scaremongering, that the issue was not so serious. We now know its seriousness because each of us meet constituents every day in our clinics who tell us about the special court sittings every month in Mullingar, Athlone and Longford, for example. On average, 40 to 50 cases of family home repossessions are being presented to the court. This is not scare-mongering.These are the hard, cold facts of what is happening at the moment. Two weeks go, we had the pitiful situation where the Taoiseach, in reply to a question from my party leader, said he was "not happy" with the banks ignoring the recommendations of personal insolvency practitioners for dealing with distressed mortgages. He was hopeful, he said, the PIPs and the banks were listening to him when he brought in their representatives and articulated his concerns. Where is the leadership there? It is greatly missing. Where is the hope for the thousands of affected families looking on? Where can they find evidence the Government is taking this issue by the scruff of the neck? The reality is that the banks are still calling the shots and the personal insolvency legislation that was initiated more than two years ago by the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is not working. When the former Minister brought that legislation before the Dáil, he predicted that 21,000 applications would be dealt with in the first year. As we know, at the end of 2014, just a handful of cases were dealt with and only a fraction of them related to family cases. This is happening at a time when 118,000 families are in arrears, 60,000 of them for more than one year and 37,000 for more than two years. In my own constituency, almost 20% of mortgages in Longford are in arrears, while the figure for Westmeath is 15%. That is confirmation that the system introduced by the Government to help these families is failing. It is proof that the banks' veto is intolerable and must be changed. We advised against including that veto in the Bill when it was published.  We are not the only ones making these points. Members of the Minister of State's party are saying the same. This week we heard on "Morning Ireland" that a number of Government backbenchers are bringing forward legislation in recognition that the Government's system is not working. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the courage of those Government backbenchers in producing legislation to address the problem. I ask the Government to do the same by, at a very minimum, affording the Deputy in whose name the Bill will be tabled the opportunity to bring it to the floor of the House. That Deputy should have the chance to present his proposal that the period of bankruptcy be reduced from three years to one year. Let us have the opportunity to debate that proposal. In indicating his intention to bring forward legislative proposals, this particular Deputy referred to what he called the "shocking statistics" relating to the lack of help available to people with mortgage arrears. That is why he is bringing forward his proposal, in order to give ordinary Joes a hand. I ask the Minister of State and his colleagues not to do to that legislation what they did to the Bill the same Deputy introduced concerning the erection of wind farms. The latter proposal was allowed to be brought forward in the House but has been gathering dust on a shelf somewhere ever since. People might argue that some of the problems we are facing today are a consequence of decisions made and policies initiated by previous Governments. That is true in some cases. There was an over-reliance on incentives for property investment, but two wrongs do not make a right. This Government has been in office for four years and it is high time something is done to support struggling families. Since 2011, the number of people in arrears for more than 90 days has doubled. The banks, once again, retain control. Bankruptcy is an option for some of the investors, entrepreneurs and risk takers in our society who have created employment down through the years. Those people must be supported to be in a position to create more employment. However, for the purposes of the Bill before us today, we are talking about ordinary family homes. The vast majority of people in mortgage difficulty who come through the door of my clinic, as is surely replicated throughout the country, want to retain home ownership. Their home is their castle and they want to keep it. A couple came to me recently who had borrowed €135,000 to buy an apartment, which reflected the value of the property at the time. Today, it is valued at €50,000. This couple are making a repayment every month, but the bank wants them to sign up to an agreement to pay €1,000 per month for 30 years. For an original loan of €135,000, they are being asked to repay €360,000 and they were told to take it or leave it. There is nothing to bind the banks to be reasonable or practical in their dealings with people in that situation. Dealing with this issue is necessary as a social good. It makes good social sense as well as good financial sense to ensure people can remain in their family homes. The reason the banks are ramping up their efforts is that house prices are increasing. They have only one focus, namely, to return to profitability and to hell with the consequences. The Government, unfortunately, is stuck in the mud and seems to consider it acceptable that the banks should direct and dictate the pace. Why does the Government not accept this legislation? Members opposite are forever saying there is nothing positive coming from this side of the House. Here is a positive proposal which will ensure that where home owners can come forward with a real, sustainable and practical solution, which is independently evaluated, it is binding on the banks to accept it. In such circumstances, the banks could look at such options as splitting mortgages, implementing a debt for equity arrangement or reducing the repayment capacity. This would ensure people who have the wherewithal to put forward a sustainable solution are accommodated. I acknowledge that in some instances, no sustainable solution will be available. Where that is the case, the mortgage to rent scheme should come into play. This was another scheme the Government claimed would keep people in the family home. Fewer than 100 home owners have qualified for that scheme in two years. I am attending a meeting with their bank next week of a couple who have no hope of repaying the mortgage they took out. They bought out their local authority home and owe some €200,000 on it. Both are in their late 50s and their only income is social welfare. Their application to avail of the mortgage to rent scheme was rejected because there are only two of them living in a three-bedroom house. The bank is telling them they cannot stay in their home, but it will ask the local authority to provide them with a two-bedroom house. That is terribly unjust. We must ensure the mortgage to rent scheme is available to people who cannot come forward with a sustainable solution. The time for procrastinating over this issue is long gone. The time for platitudes and bringing forward proposals without any follow-through is past. The time for being hopeful, as the Taoiseach described himself some weeks ago, is over and finished. It is time now for action. It behoves all of us, across all parties and none, to bring forward legislation that will ensure, at a very minimum, after all that people have gone through, including wage reductions, job loss and so on, that they can hold on to their family home and have a roof over their heads. If we can agree on nothing else in this Dáil, we should agree on that and put all supports in place to ensure it happens.

Most of the solutions that have been put in place to address this issue are not actually solutions.It appears the Government is hoping that if it sits there for long enough, this problem will solve itself and it will not be obliged to get involved. I am absolutely stunned that the Taoiseach thinks this Bill might be unconstitutional. I would be very surprised if he was given that legal advice. When one looks at the constitutional sections on private property, they state that one cannot pass a general law abolishing private property as happened in the Soviet Union, for example, during the 1930s. However, the Constitution does state that property rights are subject to the "exigencies of the common good". Were the Minister of State to check the emergency legislation Fianna Fáil introduced when it was in government on the advice of a well-informed Attorney General, he would notice that at the beginning of that legislation, there is paragraph after paragraph outlining the crisis we were in and stating that therefore, the exigencies of the common good meant that property rights, including pension rights and so one, could be interfered with. The Government of the day was given rough guidelines as to how far one could go with that interference. Nobody can be absolutely certain unless a court case is taken. The Government is stating that despite there being hundreds of thousands of people in mortgage crisis and despite the steps taken by the Government having been utterly ineffective, the exigencies of the common good do not involve curtailing the absolute veto of powerful banks against the people. I find that extraordinary. I find it extraordinary that anybody would believe a court in this country would rule that a curtailing in a detailed process of that right might be unconstitutional. I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath on his excellent Bill and note Fianna Fáil does not suggest the mortgage holder should have the whip hand in this regard because the process involves allowing a judge in a court to make the final decision as to what is right and reasonable in the case. Therefore, the discretion or the balance is not on one side but it is a balanced solution.

The bank takes the house, sells it at €120,000 and then tries to collect the balance in some future debt on that family.

I will hear this great argument put forward to the effect that the Government could not help the ordinary people because of the moral hazard. Most ordinary people who bought family homes did so in good faith and paid the price in the market at the time. In the case of family homes, they bought them because they wanted to have a family home. Talk to them about moral hazard when, at the time at which they bought, it was the only price they could pay. I do not refer to trophy houses here but to ordinary three-bedroom houses and other ordinary houses or apartments people bought. Second, there were reasonable expectations, as I often have pointed out. In the case of two civil servants who bought a house together back in 2006, in the normal course of events they would have expected that by 2014, not only would their income not have fallen but that it would have increased. Things change and it was necessary to make hard decisions but to talk about moral hazard in such a situation and for banks and bankers to talk about moral hazard is absolutely obscene and absurd.

The Government is like a guy sitting in a boat who has allowed the oars to fall out and who is letting the boat drift down the river. In the meantime, the rate of repossession is escalating. Next week, representatives of Phoenix Project Ireland are coming to Leinster House. I have worked with the project closely since I was a Minister and its representatives will tell one of the problems being faced by people week on week because of the intransigent view of the banks. What is it all about? It is that the bankers wish to make as much money as possible and will walk over everybody in this country, including the Government, to do so. They know the Government will sell its share way ahead of time and the bankers then wish to make a killing on the market when the banks go on the market. The Government should make two decisions. First, it should force resolution that is reasonable and balanced in favour of the citizen and second, that no further bank shares will be sold until we as a people have recouped all of our investment into all of the banks.

#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	526	I owe a big debt of thanks and gratitude to Fianna Fáil colleagues present and in particular to Deputy Michael McGrath for bringing forward this legislation. It is shameful that the Government has not attended to the huge problem that has arisen and that has been staring it in the face since 2008 or 2009. Because my time is short, I intend to read a statement into the record. The real banking inquiry should be what Members are talking about. The other one being held by the Oireachtas joint committee is looking in the rear-view mirror. Here is where the problem lies and here is where the citizens are hurting, as Deputy Ó Cuív has noted. The bank boards and the auditors clearly and measurably are at fault. I have evidence to hand in a one and a half page statement, which I will read into the record because I do not have enough time. A couple of things happened within the last 48 hours. The chief executive of Bank of Ireland announced with pride that profits of €900 million are being reported in the most recent results, a turnaround of €1.5 billion due to the real hard work of the bank and its people. He stated the bank made mistakes and that he was on the team that made the mistakes. Why is he not paying for them? I have been involved pro bono in five cases with the two so-called pillar banks where, again on the evidence, they are out of control operationally. They are not even communicating with the customers who are being beaten up and assaulted financially. I use those words advisedly because I have had 20 years of experience in banking and restructuring loans and coming to agreements. There are no agreements at present. Although they say there are agreements, there are not; there are guns to the heads of customers. Split mortgages are a joke and are not done for businesses or people. It is obscene to believe that 60,000 mortgages in arrears for more than a year means, at a multiple of three per household, that 180,000 citizens are in deep distress. How dare a temporary investor like Wilbur Ross make a profit of €500 million on an investment in Bank of Ireland guaranteed - maybe not on paper but in reality - by the State? He, the most powerful and influential director on the bank’s board, put in place a policy of no loan write-downs or write-offs in restructurings. How obscene was that? He has even left the country. The Government should wake up out of its arrogance. It accuses us on this side of scaremongering but this is reality. I told the late Brian Lenihan in 2009 that there will be true losses in the Irish-owned banks of €65 billion on commercial-type loans and a minimum of €30 billion on the mortgage loan books. That is exactly what occurred. Deputy Troy gave an example of negative equity. There is no such thing as negative equity; it is a loss. It is forcing a loss or realising a loss by putting in receivers on loans. My paper shows how the banks and their boards should be collectively at the banking inquiry answering questions about the evidence in their balance sheets of how they broke the domestic banking sector by bringing the system from three times to over five times the size of national income in six years. That was a recipe for a Ponzi result to a credit pyramid bust.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	527	This is important legislation and we are all grateful to our colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, for introducing it in Private Members’ time. It is timely and important in getting to the nub of the problem affecting many families as various Members outlined. Having 37,484 families in mortgage arrears for over two years, with many more in arrears under that time, graphically illustrates the challenges involved. The intransigence of the banks in this regard is clearly a problem. Only 129 personal insolvency arrangements involving secured debt have been made by the Insolvency Service of Ireland since it was established in 2014. This highlights the problems we need to confront. There is an avalanche of cases for repossessions coming before the courts. Ours is still a local and community-based society. At the core of many of the difficulties with mortgage repayments is unemployment. Loss of a job diminishes or eliminates a person’s or family’s repayment capacities. Should we have a State employment agency that registers those with distressed mortgages to ensure they will be advised of the availability of employment from the large range of jobs that are thankfully coming on stream? For someone in a distressed mortgage situation, foraging for employment is a much greater challenge than it is for someone who is not. Given this particular problem, it is important to have a support mechanism in place to help those with distressed mortgages. If a personal representative of someone in such a position could tell the courts in a repossession hearing that their client had just secured employment and their circumstances had changed because of the intervention and advocacy of a State agency, then it would change the dynamics very considerably. I suggest the Minister of State gives some consideration be given to an arrangement such as this.

I am always happy to take legislation in the spirit in which it is drafted and on its merits. Every Member is doing their best to find solutions to the issues in question. The finance committee has done some sterling work in tackling the issue of mortgage arrears. Many Deputies opposite made constructive comments. However, before they lose the run of themselves, they remind me of arsonists giving out to the fire brigade on how best to put out the very fire they started. The Government is proposing that the House declines a second reading of this Bill introduced by Deputy Michael McGrath for several reasons. The approach proposed is overly simplistic and risks creating a range of serious negative effects. The Minister believes the introduction of such measures would most likely discourage lending for house purchase purposes and exert a negative impact on a recovering housing market. The Bill is not fully thought out on fundamental issues. It would create extensive legal uncertainty and lead to a high risk of legal challenge which does not serve anyone's interests. The Minister has already completed a review of the insolvency legislation and has clearly indicated to the House her intention to bring forward proposals in this regard. The Minister appreciates, as does the Government, the genuine concerns that Deputy Michael McGrath and others have in raising this important issue. She is fully aware of the stress experienced by families living with unsustainable mortgage arrears who want to pay their way and keep their homes. It is for this reason that she has underlined her intention to put forward proposals focusing on this situation. Some of the figures cited in the debate on the Bill give a distorted picture of repossessions because they risk causing further alarm, unnecessarily, to borrowers who want to engage. Preliminary figures available to the Department of Justice and Equality indicate the number of civil bills for repossession issued across the country in January 2015 was fewer than the monthly average for 2014. While this is not a cause for great celebration or to belittle the fact that proceedings are being issued, it belies some of the language used and some suggestions of an explosion or avalanche of repossessions. For example, while I have no doubt the figures for the number of repossession cases listed before the Donegal courts quoted yesterday are correct, the fact is those figures refer to the number of repossession civil bills issued, not to the number of repossession orders actually granted. That is a very important distinction. For the whole of 2014, the average numbers of civil bills issuing each month in Donegal were higher than those issuing in January 2015. Nevertheless, for the whole of the year, only nine possession orders were granted in Donegal. In stating this figure, I am not by any means downplaying the stress felt by people arising from court proceedings. However, it is important to emphasise that it absolutely is not the case that all or most civil bills for possession issued will lead to possession orders being granted by the courts or to a borrower who wishes to engage, losing their home. Lending institutions often issue civil bills for possession in an effort to seek engagement with borrowers who have not previously engaged with their lenders. Many of these actions result in further negotiations between borrower and bank and in an arrangement which allows a borrower to stay in his or her home. It remains the Government's priority to ensure repossessions of family homes are absolutely a last resort, where all other avenues to resolve the arrears situation have been properly considered by the lender and have been exhausted. It is for that reason the Minister's proposals intend to focus on this issue, as she indicated yesterday. The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 was raised by several Members. The Act’s objective was to deal with the legal uncertainty which had arisen as a result of several High Court judgments concerning remedies proposed by lending institutions in cases of mortgage default. The Act merely restored the position which was thought to apply when the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 was enacted, namely that the relevant provisions of the law in force prior to the commencement of that Act on 1 December 2009 would continue to apply to mortgages created prior to that date.It does not give any new powers to lending institutions and includes a new provision which benefits borrowers in mortgage distress. Section 2 of the Act provides that in any future repossession proceedings in respect of a borrower's principal private residence, the court may adjourn proceedings so that a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may be fully explored as an alternative to repossession. Unfortunately I have to conclude at that point.

If he is accusing us of being arsonists on this side of the House, his party was certainly the accomplice with the bellows in the sense that the policies it was advocating when it was in opposition were equally expansionist and inflationary. There is no point in trying to hide the fact that it campaigned in numerous elections to spend more and tax less. The Minister of State should not just dismiss a well-intended Bill that addresses a fundamental need, not only in the context of families facing repossession, difficulties and mortgage arrears but also in establishing a principle whereby banks would be brought to heel to an extent by Parliament, ensuring they address the fundamental need of home ownership which we all espouse in this House. We do not like to see families dragged from their homes and put on the side of the street. Every effort should be made to retain a family within its home. That is the purpose of this Bill. It is about tipping the scales away from the advantage the banks have over distressed families and towards giving people a break and another opportunity in life. We are not talking about trophy homes here. We are talking about people in three-bed semi-detached houses in estates throughout the country who have a home they want to reside in. They do not see it as a capital investment but as a place where they live and rear their children. They should not be under constant pressure and stress from banks that have been saved by the State at a very high cost to the taxpayer and to the country in general. We talk about morality and moral hazard, and there is a moral obligation on us to ensure that the banks behave in a manner consistent with basic decency and fairness. That is not happening and, as the Minister of State can see, the number of repossession orders is increasing dramatically in courts throughout the country. That is going to move forward consistently in terms of the numbers because the banks now see a recovering property market and increased equity in the home. The mortgage holder is still distressed in the sense that he or she cannot service repayments but the gap is closing and the banks are now moving with haste on repossessions.  The Bill is well thought out. The most disturbing point in all of this is that it was forewarned in the sense that when the Government brought forward the personal insolvency legislation and established the personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, it was pointed out that the banks retained the veto. When we talk about morality, it would be an oxymoron to put banks in the same sentence as that word. It simply is not credible for us to suggest the banks will behave in a moral way or take into account the needs of individuals in society. Their fundamental loyalty is to the balance sheet and their shareholders and that is whom the banks are out to please. The Government is fundamentally wrong and complicit in allowing the banks a free run on assessing what is a sustainable solution, what a family should pay, or whom they pursue through the courts. We have to tip that balance back in favour of homeowners for many reasons, but first and foremost because it is the right thing to do. These people bought homes full of expectation, belief and very often hope and now all of that is shattered through no fault of their own. This was brought about through irresponsible lending practices by the very same banks that the State has saved. The Government should not take credit for a recovering property market. The two groups that have most interest in a recovering property market and an inflationary housing policy are the banks and the Government. The Government is complicit in trying to inflate the property market again to repair the balance sheets of the banks and let them off out the gap again.

The banks do not behave in that way. The Government was accused of being arrogant. It is not arrogant; it is weak and meek when it comes to the banks and that is its problem. If there was a bit of arrogance or cut about the Government, it might stand up and square up to them on repossessions and mortgage arrears. It has thrown in the towel very quickly and did not even rise a gallop or raise a sweat in trying to force the banks to come to heel in some way that is fair, reasonable and rational. The idea that this would undermine and overwhelm the legal system and there would be fundamental change in property and entitlement does not stack up. The Bill provides for giving independent oversight to somebody who can adjudicate independently, in order to ensure that a fair assessment can be made as to what is a sustainable solution. This would allow a person to present to the bank without the bank having the whip hand or the veto. We have that every day of the week in the context of the independence of our Judiciary, where an independent person sits on the bench and assesses and makes a decision. We have it in this House, where the independent Ceann Comhairle adjudicates and makes findings. However, the bank will decide what is sustainable, fair and affordable, but it will be always from the point of view of the bank, the shareholders, the balance sheet and profit. Deputy Mathews is right that we now have banks clapping themselves on the back for the profits they are accumulating. We need only look at the way they are addressing variable rate issues. It is very easy to make profits when they have a captive audience. People cannot pack up their mortgage application and go to the next bank because there is no competition in the marketplace. Everybody is trapped or indentured to the bank they are currently with. The idea of going somewhere else for a loan is an aspirational notion. It is time the Government stood up and was counted in the context of addressing a societal issue that goes to the heart of what we are about here, that is, fairness and decency.

Taking the whip from their hands and giving it to somebody else is a sensible, solid proposal which has already been highlighted in this House. I am disappointed in the dismissive approach that has been taken and am not accepting the fact that 37,000 people are two years in mortgage arrears. It is highly unlikely that they are all up in Gorse Hill in Killiney. There are ordinary families throughout the country who would like to be able to pay their mortgage and make an effort to settle their debt, but want a certain element of security and to know they can do so in a manner that has been validated independently. Over the next months, the Minister of State is going to see an increase in repossessions because the banks now know that the Government, using its moral authority, will say nothing but will sit meekly and weakly on its Government benches. Every now and again, the Government Deputies will stand up and say, "well, we told you so when we were in opposition, we did not support bank guarantees and would have stood up to the banks". The bottom line is that the Government now has an opportunity to do the right thing, not for the banks but for the people.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	534	I thank every Deputy who contributed to the debate over the past two nights. I am sure we all agree that we are elected to this House to do what we regard as the right thing. I have no doubt whatsoever that if the Whip was not applied tonight, this Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill would pass with overwhelming support. If I was generous, the reasons cited by the Government for not accepting the Bill are flimsy, but if I was honest and realistic, the reasons cited are nothing short of pathetic. The Taoiseach said yesterday during Leaders' Questions that the Fianna Fáil Bill was unconstitutional. The Minister gave a very detailed response last night and said nothing of the kind. The furthest she went was to say one aspect of the Bill might engage constitutionally protected rights. That is entirely different from what the Taoiseach said during Leaders' Questions yesterday. The essential premise of the Government is that if a bank owns 34% of one's debt, it has no veto, but that if it owns 36%, not giving it a veto would be unconstitutional. When I read the Constitution, I certainly do not see this in it. It is absolute nonsense. The only constitutional rights the Government is seeking to protect are the constitutional rights of the banks because it is certainly not seeking to protect those of ordinary families. If constitutional change is required to bring about this change and enact the Bill to protect family homes, let us make it. Two referendums will be held on 23 May. There is a perfect opportunity to put this question to the people if the Government was interested in protecting family homes. I am ashamed, as a person and a Member of this House, at the manner in which some of the banks are treating people. I mention people's physical and mental health. People are under enormous stress and going to bed every night wondering whether another threatening letter will arrive the following day or if there will be a move towards repossession proceedings. I mention the numbers of suicides and families divided. People are absolutely distraught and coming to our clinics every week with stories about how they are being treated by the banks. The Bill is about protecting the family home, not mansions in Killiney which are caught up in a complex web of commercial debt. It is about protecting ordinary homes for ordinary people who are under extraordinary pressure.  Let me contrast how ordinary people are treated by the Government with the way private equity funds, or so-called vulture funds, are treated by it. Does the Minister of State know how many times the Minister for Finance and his officials have met representatives of private equity funds since beginning of last year? They have met representatives of vulture funds no fewer than 28 times, including Apollo, Lone Star and Soros. I could name all of them. How many times has the Government met ordinary people? They will get a hearing at a constituency office from the sympathetic Deputy, the very same Deputy who will come into the House tonight and copperfasten the power of the veto the Government has given to the banks. That is the reality. It is also the reality that the Government does not know how many mortgages it has allowed to be sold to private equity funds with no statutory protection being afforded to these mortgage holders. The Minister said it could be approximately 16,000, but we do not know. People have been left in limbo and a legal no man's land and we are all hearing about the situations that arise as result. The two major responses of the Government to the mortgage crisis have been failures. The Insolvency Service of Ireland is not dealing with the issue of mortgage debt in a satisfactory way and the mortgage arrears target programme has been hijacked by the banks because they are allowed to define a sustainable solution and use a threatening legal letter as a sustainable solution. The Bill is not perfect, but it is an honest effort to address what is a huge social crisis. The Minister of State might be interested to know, in putting forward his version of the repossession statistics, that for every house lost by way of a repossession order, three family homes are lost by way of voluntary surrender or a voluntary sale forced on a family by the banks. The Government's answer seems to be to force people down the bankruptcy road. Under no circumstances should ordinary people in mortgage arrears have to become bankrupt to extricate themselves from a mortgage arrears problem. The bank veto must be brought to an end. The Government mistakenly gave the banks the power of veto under the Insolvency Service of Ireland. That is one of the reasons it is not working and this is the time to remove it.
