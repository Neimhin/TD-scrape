On behalf of both myself and the Cathaoirleach, I wish to welcome the Members of both Houses and Mr. Michel Barnier to this sitting in joint committee. We are here for an exchange of views with Mr. Barnier, who, as Members will know, is the chief negotiator of the task force for the preparation and conduct of negotiations with the United Kingdom. We will now go into committee. Accordingly, I invite Mr. Barnier to take his seat in the Chamber. Monsieur Barnier, au nom de tous les Membres du Dáil Éireann et du Seanad Éireann, soyez le bienvenu ici aujourd'hui. Nous sommes ravis et honorés que vous ayez accepté notre invitation à vous adresser aux chambres de l'Oireachtas, réunies en séance commune. The decision by the United Kingdom last year to withdraw from the European Union will have a profound effect on Europe and its citizens but it also raises a number of specific and important issues that are unique to Ireland. For instance, concerns have been raised about its impact on Northern Ireland and the peace process as well as its impact on the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom. Since the formal notification on 29 March 2017, of the UK’s intention to withdraw, preparations for the start of the negotiations have intensified. As Members will be aware, the European Council agreed guidelines for the first phase of negotiations on 29 April 2017. Last week the European Commission published its draft negotiating directives. Our exchange of views today is therefore very timely and we hope it will contribute positively to the preparations for the negotiations. Let me also say I firmly believe today’s sitting demonstrates how national parliaments can contribute effectively to public debate on matters of concern to the Union, which of course is one of the principal objectives of Article 12 of the treaty. Mr. Barnier, we are conscious of the very challenging road ahead. We wish you and your task force well in your important work and it is our sincere hope that an agreement can be reached that protects the principles of the Union and the interests of its member states while maintaining a strong relationship with the United Kingdom. With those few thoughts, I invite you now to address us.

Mr. Speakers, Taoiseach, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, a chairde, I am very happy and honoured to address both Houses of the Oireachtas and to greet you, as the representatives of the people of Ireland, in all your political diversity.I take this honour as a responsibility: the responsibility to listen to all those who will be affected by the decision of the UK to leave the European Union; the responsibility to listen to your concerns, build our positions together and negotiate in our common interest; and the responsibility to explain that we need each other - that Ireland is stronger in the Union, and the EU is stronger with Ireland. Your country has had deep historical, cultural and intellectual ties to continental Europe for many centuries. In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Irish colleges were set up around Europe - from Madrid, where I was yesterday, to Leuven, Paris, Rome and Prague. They contributed to writing the history of Ireland and the history of Europe, and they spread Irish culture to the Continent. Centuries later, in 1972, the people of Ireland massively voted to take part in the European project. At that time I was 21 - that was the last century. France had a referendum on the accession of Ireland, the UK, Denmark and Norway. It was my very first vote. I campaigned for a "Yes" vote. For the UK's accession, back then, voting "Yes" was not so easy for a member of the French Gaullist Party. I did it with my full heart and I never regretted it. I regret that Brexit is happening now. I would have liked to have seen the UK staying in Europe, with Ireland and all the 26 other member states, but we are where we are. Since 1972, we have accomplished great things together. The European Union has helped Ireland become what it is today, and Ireland has complemented and strengthened our Union. The Irish people are known as hard working and open minded. They saw EU membership as a chance to modernise their economy and society. We see this now in innovative companies and in the creation of new jobs. Investors see Ireland as being central in the European market, not peripheral. We see it across Irish cities, towns and villages. They have been enriched by fellow Europeans who have come here to work, study, travel and live.  As Seamus Heaney said to mark the enlargement of the EU in 2004: So on a day when newcomers appearLet it be a homecoming and let us speak ...Move lips, move minds and make new meanings flare. Ireland has welcomed, like you were welcomed 30 years earlier. Ladies and gentlemen, for 44 years, Irish people have shaped the Union. They have helped turn Europe into a more open and innovative Continent. Ireland's first European Commissioner, Patrick Hillery, played a major role in improving equality between women and men before serving as your President. Another Irish Commissioner, Peter Sutherland, supported the creation of the Single Market and he established the ERASMUS programme, bringing young Europeans closer together for 30 years now and showing what free movement of people really means. Today, Phil Hogan is in charge of developing what is the Union's most complete economic policy, the Common Agricultural Policy. Speakers, ladies and gentlemen, for my part, I am proud to have been Minister with responsibility for the farmers and fishermen in my own country. Some in large countries with imperial pasts like my own seem to think that the EU makes them smaller. This is simply not true. In smaller countries, people are often more aware that being part of the EU increases influence and opportunities, and that being part of a common project and identity does not prevent a country from keeping its own identity and making a name for itself in the world, as Enda Kenny reminded us all in his excellent St. Patrick's Day speech in Washington. Pooling national sovereignty increases our European sovereignty. Since they are part of the EU, citizens of all our countries can study, work and settle down in another member state and be treated like nationals. European consumers can access high-quality food and agricultural products from across the EU because they all meet strict standards. Suppliers do not have to worry about border checks. Since they are part of the EU, citizens travelling to another EU country will soon be able to call without roaming charges as if they were calling from home. Airlines, from whatever member state they come, can offer direct flights between any two EU airports. They can rely on our Open Skies agreement with the US. The EU has made travel easier. Irish airlines have been among the first to take advantage of these benefits and have profoundly changed the market. I experienced it first hand myself when I flew to Dublin last night on a rather well-known low-cost carrier - there was still no coffee but there was a little bit more seat space than before. Honourable Members, being together makes us all stronger. Since we are part of the EU, businesses can trade goods without customs duties and documentation requirements are very simple. As part of the EU's Single Market, companies can rely on fair competition and a level playing field. Because the EU has consistently put in place high levels of environmental protection, citizens enjoy cleaner air and water. Governments can resist a race to the bottom and fight climate change more effectively together. EU companies have privileged access to 60 foreign markets such as South Korea, Vietnam and recently Canada - thanks to the free trade agreements negotiated at EU level. Banks, insurance or investment funds can provide services throughout the Single Market, based on their establishment here in Dublin, thanks to the so-called passporting rights.  Since they are part of the EU, judges can rely on the European arrest warrant. It ensures the rapid treatment of requests for surrendering suspected criminals from another member state to bring them to justice. Since they are part of the EU, universities receive funding for research and innovation. They form one of the widest academic networks in the world.  Speakers and honourable Members, as a Union member, this is what we enjoy, and this is what a member state loses when it leaves the Union; but let me also be clear: Brexit will come at a cost also to us, the 27.I am fully aware that some member states will be more affected than others. As chief negotiator, my objective is to reach a fair deal, one that defends the interests of the entire EU but also of individual member states.  Due to its historical and geographical ties with the UK, its shared Border and strong economic links, Ireland is in a unique position. With the fall of sterling, Brexit is already having an impact on the value of Irish exports to the UK, particularly in the agrifood sector. Many in Ireland fear the return of tensions in the North. Today, in front of these two Houses, I want to reassure the Irish people that in these negotiations, Ireland's interests will be the European Union's interests. We are in these negotiations together and a united EU will be there for Ireland.  Tomorrow I will travel to the Border with Northern Ireland and will meet farmers and workers in a dairy co-operative. I want to learn from them and listen to their concerns about how they are affected by Brexit. Some might be concerned about exports to the UK or the return of customs checks at the Border while others might fear a return to the instability of the past. In Northern Ireland, lifting the Border took time and it was only 15 years ago that checkpoints and controls totally disappeared, thanks to the Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of violence. I was the European Commissioner in charge of the PEACE programme and I have not forgotten my conversations with Mr. John Hume and Mr. David Trimble on that point. I understand the European Union's role in strengthening dialogue in Northern Ireland and in supporting the Good Friday Agreement. European integration helped to remove borders that once existed on maps and in minds. Now, Brexit changes the external borders of the EU but I will work with Ireland to avoid a hard Border.  The UK's departure from the EU will have consequences. Together, we have a duty to speak the truth in that regard. Customs controls are part of EU border management. They protect the Single Market, as well as our food safety and standards. However, as I have said many times, nothing in these negotiations should put peace at risk. This was recognised by the 27 Heads of State and Government two weeks ago. They were very clear that the Good Friday Agreement must be respected in all of its dimensions. I also made it very clear that the Border issue will be one of my three priorities for the first phase of the negotiations, together with citizens' rights and the financial settlement. We must make sufficient progress on these points before we start discussing the future of our relationship with the UK. The sooner this happens, the better.  If the conditions are right, a close partnership with the UK is in everybody's interests, particularly Ireland's. Currently, Ireland exports 14% of its goods and 20% of its services to the UK, which is twice the EU average. The agriculture and energy sectors are fully interconnected on the island of Ireland. Of course, such facts must be put in perspective. Before Ireland’s accession to the EU in 1973, the UK accounted for over 50% of Irish trade. Today, Ireland exports much more to the other EU countries than to the UK and the Single Market is a key asset for its financial and pharmaceutical industries. Nevertheless, the specific issues that Ireland faces deserve all our attention. Ireland shares a land border with the UK and most of its trade to the EU goes through the UK. This is why I engaged with the Dáil and Seanad, the Government and its administrators, as well as all the Irish Members of the European Parliament immediately after taking up my position. Ireland has done remarkable preparatory work and we must use our combined strength and work together to deliver solutions. I want to listen to the concerns of the Irish people but I also want to pass on a message of hope and determination. For all the problems it creates, Brexit also reminds us of what the EU has built together, what each of us enjoys as EU citizens and how we can further improve the European project. The EU is not perfect; we know that. President Juncker put it candidly on the occasion of Europe Day this week. There are lessons to draw from the crisis and not only in Ireland. There are lessons to draw from Brexit and from the rising scores of populist parties in many countries, including mine. Let us not confuse public opinion with populism. We should listen to people's feelings and respond with policy change. This is how we will fight populism. I am convinced that Ireland will play a major role in these changes, as a centre for innovation, a strong and sustainable agrifood producer, a bridge across the Atlantic and as a supporter of the future relationship that we need to build with the UK.  Our objective is clear - we want these negotiations to succeed. I want us to reach a deal. The UK has been a member of the EU for 44 years and it should remain a close partner. We will need to negotiate a bold, ambitious but also fair free trade agreement. We will also need the same ambition for our research and innovation networks and for the fight against climate change, as well as in foreign policy, international co-operation and development. Almost 27 years ago, Nelson Mandela spoke in this very room just a few months after he was released from jail. He praised Ireland's leadership within the European Community to maintain strong pressure on the apartheid system in South Africa. Tomorrow, our international partners should be able to turn to the EU and the UK and find in them strong and united advocates of our shared European values. We also need the same ambition in the field of our internal and external security, whether it is the fight against terrorism, the exchange of information, the fight against hybrid threats or cybersecurity.  If we put things in the right order, if we negotiate with mutual respect, without any aggression or naivety and are open to finding solutions, there is no reason our strong Europe cannot maintain a strong relationship with the UK.  Dear Speakers and honourable Members, I have been a national parliamentarian for more than 17 years, both in the National Assembly and the French Senate. I will now listen carefully to the views of the Taoiseach and of all party leaders. In these negotiations and the public debate that now starts you have, as a national parliament, an essential role to play together with the European Parliament and civil society. That is why I have been so honoured by your invitation to address the two Houses of the Parliament of Ireland. Go raibh míle maith agaibh.

I call the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	3	I am pleased to address the Houses today in the presence of Michel Barnier. Thank you for your fine contribution, Michel. I thank him for his statement in which he outlined the complexities of the Brexit negotiations and for his acknowledgement of their importance for Europe and of course for Ireland. Michel Barnier is a long-standing friend of this country, not just as a leading French politician and Minister, but also as a European Commissioner. Indeed, his time as Commissioner for Regional Policy gave him a particular insight into the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, which will be central to the talks ahead. I also want to thank him sincerely for his willingness to engage with Ireland since his appointment as head of the Commission Brexit task force last July. This is his second visit to Dublin since that appointment but we have also met on other occasions, including on my visits to Brussels in February and March, and at the European Council. Michel and his colleagues in the Brexit task force have been more than co-operative and accessible to our Ministers and senior officials. I know that he has also been open to a range of other important stakeholders from Ireland. I thank him for this engagement. The challenges for this country arising from Brexit are extremely serious; and it is essential that all those affected have the opportunity to make their voices heard. This has also been the approach of the Government here. Along with ongoing sectoral analysis across Departments, we have engaged widely with industry and civic society, holding almost 280 separate meetings. The all-island civic dialogue, which I convened with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has included 16 sectoral events and two plenary meetings, with more than 1,200 delegates representing industries and organisations from across the country. This kind of consultation has informed our positions on the negotiations, and enabled us to publish our thinking in a comprehensive Government document last week. Events have moved on quickly since Prime Minister May formally notified the European Union of the UK's intention to leave. The European Council agreed the EU negotiating guidelines on 29 April and on 3 May, the European Commission proposed its draft negotiating directives, which build on the guidelines and provide more detail on the issues to be addressed. The extensive preparation by member states, the EU institutions and Mr. Barnier's task force meant that the guidelines were agreed very quickly. This was by no means a given. We know just how complicated and serious the issues are for Europe as a whole and particularly for Ireland. For over two years, the Government has been analysing the issues and engaging with sectors across this island to identify our main areas of concern and to develop our priorities. Some of these have been referred to here by Michel Barnier. These are the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, including by avoiding a hard Border; to retain the common travel area; to minimise the impact on our economy and to work for a positive future for the European Union. We have also been extremely active at political and official level in engaging with our EU partners and the EU institutions, with a view to highlighting and explaining the significant implications for Ireland arising from Brexit, and the need to take account of our particular concerns in the negotiations ahead. Indeed, since the UK referendum last June, we have had over 400 engagements on Brexit with our EU partners. In all these meetings, we have explained the background and context of the Northern Ireland peace process and emphasised the need to avoid the re-imposition of a hard Border on the island of Ireland. As I have stated previously, this is a political challenge and we will have to be both flexible and imaginative to deal with it. Thanks to this strategic and patient work, and the understanding and support of our European partners, I am pleased that Ireland's specific concerns - Mr. Barnier has mentioned this specifically - and the unique circumstances that apply here are fully acknowledged in these guidelines. Supporting and protecting the achievements, the benefits and commitments of the peace process, avoiding a hard Border and protecting the common travel area will now be addressed as part of the withdrawal negotiations. The guidelines provide an excellent basis for the negotiations. It was crucial that we got this right from the start and again, I would like to thank Mr. Barnier for his role in making that happen. In more general terms, we are pleased with the tone of the guidelines, which is open and constructive, while nevertheless clearly and firmly outlining the EU's objectives and principles. They highlight the importance of getting clarity in respect of EU citizens' rights, a key issue across member states and important in terms of providing certainty for people and for families. The approach to the sensitive question of the United Kingdom's financial liabilities is also welcome. It is only reasonable that the United Kingdom be asked to honour the commitments it entered into as a member state of the European Union. Mr. Barnier's approach to this is sensible: to focus first on the principles and methodology before considering the numbers or the structure of payments that might be involved. Importantly from our perspective, the guidelines acknowledge the need for transitional arrangements. This will be crucial in order to provide a level of continuity and certainty for our citizens and businesses. As Ireland stands to be more affected than any other member state by the departure of the UK, we believe it is necessary to begin work as soon as possible - and I am glad you referred to this - on scoping out the future EU-UK relationship. I am pleased therefore that the guidelines acknowledge that the shape of the future relationship can be considered once the European Council, that is, the Heads of State and Government of the 27 member states, agrees that "sufficient progress" has been made on the withdrawal issues. This phased approach is also a sensible and pragmatic way forward. From Ireland's perspective, our objective is for a close and positive future relationship with the UK, and we are pleased therefore that the guidelines indicate the EU wants an ambitious agreement, not just in economic terms but also in areas such as security. We will continue to work with partners to achieve such an outcome. Consequently, I welcome the European Council guidelines from a substantive perspective and that their principles and approach have been carried forward into the draft negotiating directives. I appreciate the thorough preparatory work carried out by Mr. Barnier and his task force, as well as the European Council team and other EU partners, whose willingness to listen to us, to listen to our story and to acknowledge our unique and special circumstances has brought us to this point. The outcome is an endorsement of the approach by Government and a clear recognition of the specific challenges we face. The Government has robustly defended the Good Friday Agreement process throughout these negotiations so far, making clear that, as a legally binding international treaty, it provides a unique political and constitutional framework on the island of Ireland. We know that it was vital to provide reassurance that Brexit does not in any way undermine any provision of the Good Friday Agreement.In that context, we secured an acknowledgement that, in the event of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, brought about in accordance with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement and the principle of consent, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would be part of the EU. I have been consistent in my view that now is not the time to have such a referendum on Irish unity and that the conditions set out in the Good Friday Agreement for the calling of a Border poll do not currently exist. However, the statement agreed by the Heads of State and Government of the 27 EU member states, which will be recorded in the minutes of the European Council, was hugely important in order to dispel any doubt or uncertainty that the UK exit from the EU would negatively impact on this crucial constitutional provision of the Good Friday Agreement. With the EU guidelines now adopted, including the language about our unique concerns, the Government last week published a comprehensive document which reflects the findings of our extensive preparatory work and consultations on the island of Ireland and at EU level, and outlines the positions and priorities that will underpin our engagement in the Brexit process over the next two years. At EU level, the more detailed draft negotiating directives are now being discussed at ministerial and official level with a view to agreement at the General Affairs Council on 22 May. These are again broadly positive from Ireland’s point of view. Mr. Barnier and his team have shown that, in addition to being open to meet with us, they are also listening very closely to what we have to say, which is why I welcome the Ceann Comhairle's decision today. This is vitally important if the negotiations are to proceed in a calm and ordered way, and end up at a point which is as good as possible for all sides. As I said in my statement to the Dáil on Tuesday, it became very clear at an early stage of our analysis that the economic impacts of Brexit would be severe. With the EU guidelines now adopted and work under way on the directives, the Government will intensify its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to protect it from the potential negative impacts of Brexit, to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, which is so important, and also to pursue all opportunities that might arise. In this context, I should also mention Ireland will bid, along with other countries, for the two EU bodies currently located in London - the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority. I believe that Ireland offers an excellent opportunity as a location for these. As I have said before, and in conclusion, Brexit is a British policy. It is not an Irish policy and it is not an EU policy. For its part, Ireland remains committed clearly to the European Union and its future. Indeed, a poll published on Europe Day this week showed that 88% of Irish people agree that Ireland should remain a member of the European Union. Participation and membership have transformed our country, as Mr. Barnier is well aware, over the last 40 years. We are committed to playing a strong and active role as a member of the EU 27. We are well prepared and will continue to ensure that our concerns and priorities are reflected in the European Union negotiating position as it evolves, and that we work closely with our EU partners, the EU institutions and Mr. Barnier and his task force, towards a strong and constructive future relationship with the United Kingdom.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	4	On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I would like to thank Mr. Barnier for taking the time to address this session today in such an effective and comprehensive manner. His eagerness to listen and respond to the concerns of Ireland continues an approach seen during the many important roles which he has held in the French Government and in the European Commission. This is not an occasion where we can or should get into the deep specifics of the negotiations. I am confident that Mr. Barnier's team and the European institutions will continue to be accessible for constructive discussions. Fianna Fáil sees this exchange of views as an opportunity to link our approach to these negotiations with the fundamental issue of Ireland’s place within Europe. This is not just about the outcome of the Brexit process but also about how we see the long-term future of relations on this island, with our neighbour and with our partners in the European Union. No one underestimates the scale and complexity of the task Mr. Barnier faces. Last year’s referendum was an ugly and negative affair. No amount of warm words and earnest statements can cover this up. There was no strategy for implementing Brexit. There was just a strategy for winning the vote through a combination of bluster and aggression. It was not a positive assertion of sovereignty; it was the culmination of 30 years of an increasingly corrosive scapegoating of Europe and immigrants for the homegrown divisions in British society. Those false prophets who promised an economic bonanza are now claiming that they have defied the critics and Britain is booming. This is nonsense. Public borrowing and taxes have already risen since the vote and the long-term damage to employment and standards of living is becoming ever more certain. Fundamentally, the narrow Brexit majority represented a rejection of strong rule-based co-operation between states. It asserted a narrow vision of sovereignty that developed in the 19th century and directly led to the two bloodiest wars in history. Let there be no doubt about where Ireland stands. We want nothing to do with a backward-looking idea of sovereignty. We remain absolutely committed to the ideals of the European Union. We see the Union for what it is - the most successful international organisation in world history. While the extremes of right and left join together to attack it, they have no credible response to the fact that every member state has secured a significant rise in living standards and a Continent once defined by conflict is today defined by co-operation. The Union is flawed, but its successes are undeniable. There are certainly different views here. There are those who buy into the anti-EU narratives, but the overwhelming majority of the Irish people are determined that Ireland’s future will remain a European future. It is important for Mr. Barnier to understand that Ireland’s approach to Europe and to international commitments is deeply intertwined with our national identity. Last year, we marked 100 years since the most important founding event of our Republic. The nationalism of the Rising of 1916 and the Proclamation of Independence is a generous one. It defines the Irish nation as having diverse elements and seeks a State which works with others. Our republican Constitution, adopted in 1937 at a dark moment in world affairs, goes even further and explicitly recognises the role of international law and co-operation. We have no nostalgia for a lost empire and no wish to assert superiority over others. We have never sought to stand apart from the world, jealously guarding the right to say "No" to everything. We fully understand that only when states work together can they secure peace, progress and prosperity for their people. That is why we will remain active and constructive members of the European Union. The most basic challenge for the agreement that Mr. Barnier will negotiate is to protect the essential contract that underpins the European Union. This essential contract is that all members must have the opportunity to achieve progress.  When new circumstances arise, new responses must be possible. If Europe ceases to be a vehicle of hope then it ceases to have a purpose. Brexit represents a dramatic disruption which poses permanent challenges which are unevenly spread within the Union. The referendum result and the British Government’s decision to opt out of both the Single Market and the customs union are deeply destructive for businesses and communities on this island. The only long-term option for us is to take a more ambitious and urgent approach to diversification and innovation. Even more importantly, we must now find a way of fixing the damage caused to the agreed approach to building a lasting reconciliation in the place of sectarian division. I remember well that when a Government of ours approached Mr. Barnier concerning EU support for the peace process, he was active, engaged and generous. We have no doubt that he will do everything possible to honour the clear support for the Good Friday Agreement contained in the negotiation guidelines.It is important to emphasise that the Good Friday Agreement establishes structures and policies which are intended to evolve over time. It is not a question of having either the status quo or reunification. In fact, the real spirt of the Agreement is to be found in provisions which facilitate greater shared action over time in important practical matters. The text incorporated in our Constitution permits this Parliament to delegate functions to bodies which are not solely under its direction. Tourism, trade and European Union funding programmes are three of the areas already covered. Whatever is agreed in the negotiations, it must do nothing to undermine the ability to permit shared cross-Border institutions and action to develop. On the issue of wider trading arrangements, Fianna Fáil considers that the maintenance of a close trading relationship with the United Kingdom is in Europe's best interests. Given the scale of disruption Brexit will cause even with a soft border, a form of special status should be considered in the negotiations. There are many models of special economic zones across the world which could be adapted here. The rights of long-term residents of and persons born in Northern Ireland to Irish and therefore European citizenship must be protected fully in the final agreement. We welcome the reassurances provided in this regard as well as the commitment to maintain the common travel area. As Mr. Barnier knows, the commitment is referenced currently in Protocol 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The protocol is, in essence, meaningless once the UK leaves the EU because Ireland's rights are defined in terms of its relations with another contracting partner to the treaty. This raises what may be a fundamental practical issue in the negotiations, namely, the status of the agreement which emerges. The guidelines limit what measures can be agreed to those which conform to the existing European Union order and laws. It is, frankly, very difficult to see how issues having to do with Northern Ireland or the common travel area, as well as essential economic adjustments, can be addressed without some new EU legal measures. We hope Mr. Barnier will be willing to recommend new legislation where it is necessary. However, where a doubt exists in relation to the treaties, the final agreement should provide a means to adopt new measures, following Council unanimity, such as an enabling provision to facilitate new North-South arrangements. The ratification process for the British agreement is similar to the one adopted for accession treaties. It should be possible to agree minor treaty provisions at the same time where such provisions are essential to meeting basic objectives. This session does not allow me to go into more detail, but my party will forward to Mr. Barnier specific proposals once the negotiations are under way. On this very day 45 years ago, the votes were counted in our accession referendum.  An overwhelming 83% voted in favour of membership. The campaign saw the promotion of many scare stories about how Europe would reduce Ireland to a barren wasteland, build nuclear plants at every crossroads and parade missiles down our main streets. The people, however, chose to place their faith in the positive vision of Ireland growing and prospering within the European community of nations. Our European path was, in fact, the final public contribution of our great revolutionary generation. As a 16 year old boy, Seán Lemass escaped from home in order to fight in the 1916 Rising. As a politician a decade later, he read and was inspired by the idea of a united Europe proposed by the great French statesman, Aristide Briand. When Seán Lemass became Taoiseach at the end of the 1950s, he called for our country to open itself up. His Governments laid the foundations for sustained progress, central to which was securing agreement to apply for membership of the then European Economic Community. He told us that while there would be challenges, the opportunities would be far greater. This father of our European path and of modern Ireland died on 11 May 1971, exactly one year before the result of our accession referendum was announced.  His legacy is as important today as it has ever been. Europe faces a moment of great uncertainty and, in many ways, of fear. There is no positive side to Brexit. If, however, we look to our shared history, we will see that we have come through many difficult times before. If we remember the core ideals of the Union, we will get through this process and secure for another generation the promise of shared progress and prosperity among the nations of Europe.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	5	Céad míle fáilte, cuirim fáilte - bienvenue - roimh an Uasal Barnier go hÉirinn, go dtí Baile Átha Cliath, agus chuig an Oireachtas. Tá súil agam go mbeidh cuairt fhaisnéiseach agus shuimiúil aige. Is mise an Teachta Gerry Adams agus is uachtarán Shinn Féin mé. On behalf of Sinn Féin, I welcome Mr. Barnier's presence and his remarks and I would like to tell him a wee bit about the party. Sinn Féin is an Irish republican party. It is an all-Ireland party and it has the largest group of Irish MEPs in the European Parliament. Sinn Féin members include TDs, MLAs, Senators, MPs, MEPs and local authority members. It has a significant mandate and is the only party which is substantially organised across the entire island. Sinn Féin is opposed to the partition of Ireland. Ours is a united Ireland party and we want an end to British Government involvement in Irish affairs. We are working for the unity of all the people of the island based on equality, respect and reconciliation. We believe absolutely in the core values of equality, liberty and fraternity and that the foundation of these values is in the 1916 Proclamation. Like others, Sinn Féin has played a central role in the development of the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements. We helped to bring about and engaged in the international efforts which ended conflict on this island, not least those of the European Union which has been a critical partner for peace over the past 20 years. For those who were previously denied the right to work peacefully for a united Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement commits the governments to legislate for that if the people consent. Sinn Féin campaigned against Irish membership of the EEC in 1973. Since then, every European treaty has taken further powers from the Irish State. Sinn Féin wants a different type of European Union. We want a social Europe which promotes peace, demilitarisation, economic and social justice, international solidarity and greater democratic accountability. Today's European Union is wedded to neoliberal policies which have created widespread hardship as austerity, deregulation and privatisation have undermined the social function of states and the rights of citizens and workers. As Mr. Barnier acknowledged in his remarks, people across the EU are increasingly uncomfortable with this state of affairs and this discomfort has assisted the growth of far right parties which exploit people's fears. Brexit is a consequence of that. During the Brexit referendum, Sinn Féin campaigned for a remain vote in the North. It is clearly not in the interests of the people of this island, whatever their background or views, to have one part of the island outside the EU while the other part is inside. Mr. Barnier values the peace process and the Good Friday agreement. He has worked for peace going back to the time of John Hume and David Trimble. I am sure he is aware that any EU agreement which violated an international treaty, which is what the Good Friday Agreement is, would contravene EU treaty obligations. Brexit is not only an issue for the North. It will adversely affect the entire island if we let it. As such, it is vital that its challenges are met on an all-island basis. As Mr. Barnier and the Taoiseach acknowledged in their remarks, it is clear that Brexit will have a serious and detrimental effect. It is already having this effect on Irish jobs and businesses, in particular in the agriculture and agrifood sectors. The aim of the European Union, if I may say so, should be to prevent a land frontier between the European Union and Britain on the island of Ireland. That should be the key objective and the priority. To achieve this, we have advocated that the North be afforded designated special status within the European Union. We also believe that Ireland should have a veto on any agreement reached between the European Union and the British Government that does not include this position. Designated status is the best and only way to ensure that the entire island of Ireland will remain within the European Union. I commend this proposal to Mr. Barnier. It is an imaginative solution that addresses the complexities of the problem. It does not affect the constitutional status of the North. That will be changed only by a referendum. Designated special status within the European Union is the position endorsed by this Dáil. It is the position of this Parliament. It is endorsed by the majority of MLAs in the Northern Assembly. It recognises that the people of the North voted to remain part of European Union. Is that just going to be placed to one side, ignored and driven over? It is a solution being advocated by representatives of Border communities, some of whom are here in the Visitors Gallery. I welcome them. The Tory Government in England should not be allowed to reject the vote in the North and set aside the decision of people there. It should not be allowed to drive the North out of the European Union against the democratic wishes of citizens. Designated special status for the North within the European Union is not about a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit; it is about the best interests of our economy, our peace process and our people. It is also a democratic imperative. It is about retaining the freedom of movement of goods, people and services on the island of Ireland. Any restriction whatsoever on freedom of movement would represent a hardening of the Border. Believe me, this will severely damage social and economic cohesion. It would be unacceptable to those who live in Border communities but also to people right across our island. Special status would ensure the North's trading relationship with the rest of Ireland and the European Union, particularly in the context of business, tourism, the all-Ireland energy market, agriculture and the agrifood sector. All the relationships in this regard would be maintained. It is about allowing all of Ireland to remain in the customs union and the Single Market and under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. It is about maintaining the European Convention on Human Rights and it is about protecting the rights of citizens in the North who have a right to Irish citizenship and, therefore, to citizenship of the European Union. Access to EU rights and services across employment, workers' conditions, social security and health care must also be protected. None of this is beyond our collective wisdom or ability. It will require political flexibility from the European Union. Of course, the little Englanders may object. Let me remind Mr. Barnier and them that they are looking for special arrangements with the European Union for themselves. There are already unique arrangements in place for other states. Therefore, the European Union has been flexible on these matters. There are different forms of integration and relationships for member states and non-member states. These include overseas countries and territory status, the European Free Trade Association and the separate customs union. In light of the provisions for Irish unity in the Good Friday Agreement, the European Union should not diverge from these norms. Sinn Féin, unlike the Taoiseach, would like to see a referendum on Irish unity within the next five years. The immediate challenge facing the European Union and the people of Ireland, however, is how to meet the threat of Brexit. This is all about what kind of Ireland will emerge after Brexit. The only way to shape that positively is through special designated status for the North within the European Union. Merci beaucoup, Monsieur Barnier. I thank you for your presence. Go raibh míle maith agat. Go n-éirí an t-ádh leat. Míle buíochas.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	6	I am standing very close to our guest. I add my welcome and that of my Labour Party colleagues to Monsieur Barnier. Although my speaking time is very brief, I will use my proximity to him to emphasise the points I want to make. Mr. Barnier and I met many years ago. We were both environment Ministers. I know his commitment to the ideals of Europe. I also know he appreciates that the Brexit negotiating mandate is about our vital national interests and the vital interests of this island as a whole. We have many concerns. We are an island off an island off the mainland of Europe. Inevitably, our geography must dictate our policies and our priorities. The negotiating guidelines, with their insistence on an orderly first-things-first approach, postpone until later consideration of what for us will be, in fact, most vital interests. To be specific, while the guidelines do recognise the special position of Northern Ireland, albeit with the real challenges that others have already underscored, they do not sufficiently recognise the unique challenges that would be faced by us south of the Border. For us, Brexit means that the idea of achieving the European Single Market has been set back a generation. That is the undeniable truth. To put it bluntly, once the United Kingdom leaves, it will no longer make any real, practical day-to-day sense for us to talk about membership of a true single market in regard to the goods and services that we import and export. Talk of the Single Market will, from our perspective, revert from being almost a practical reality that we almost had fully achieved towards something more closely resembling an aspiration. As I stated earlier, the basic reason is one of geography. There will, in future, be a large chunk of non-Europe between us and the rest of the Union. Brexit will impact on every aspect of our economic, social and cultural lives. It will impact on every network to which we are already connected. This includes, in physical and infrastructural terms, our transport, energy and telecommunications networks. Therefore, it will impact on Ireland's ability to adhere to EU law. It will affect, for example, our ability to comply with the EU directive requiring a single EU market in electricity since our only power connections are with Northern Ireland and Britain. Another directive requires EU-wide television without frontiers when most of our external television programming comes from Britain. EU directives are based on internal markets, common markets and interconnectedness. They are designed to cover enormous territories and immense distances and to bring them together as one. They are not designed to leapfrog over other countries operating completely distinct and separate rules, to which we in Ireland will nonetheless remain truly tied in terms of geography, infrastructure, networks and trade. Our challenge after Brexit, therefore, is for Ireland to adhere to policies and laws that were designed for an internal EU market when we will find ourselves removed from direct access to that market, having few direct infrastructural connections and remaining connected instead to a country outside the Union.All these factors make Ireland's case unique in the negotiations Mr. Barnier is about to lead on our behalf. I hope the views expressed by Members in the few short minutes we have here and in the ongoing dialogue we will have with him will make sure that he will bring as effective as possible a conclusion in our interests.

I ask in all sincerity if we can trust Mr. Barnier with the issues of international solidarity or free movement of people as they pertain to Europe or to this country. This week, 250 desperate refugees fleeing north Africa drowned in the Mediterranean because of the EU's fortress Europe policies. These are not free movement policies, rather they deny free movement to desperate people. Can we trust Mr. Barnier with international solidarity when Jean-Claude Trichet threatened to let off a financial bomb in Dublin if our Government even suggested burning the gambling bondholders who crippled our economy and whose activities inflicted cruel and vicious austerity on hundreds of thousands of our citizens? This has left us today with the legacy of the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State, a health service which has been savaged and incredible hardship imposed on some of our most vulnerable citizens. Even now the EU fiscal rules, of which Mr. Barnier was a significant architect, cripple our ability to deal with those problems. I do not trust the European Union to do a deal that will vindicate the needs and aspirations of the citizens of this country because it has failed to do so in recent years. Indeed, it has imposed similar hardships on countries like Greece, Spain and Italy.  If we are to give Mr. Barnier any credibility in his commitments today I would like answers to a few simple questions. Will Mr. Barnier guarantee - not consider - that Europe will not try to break up the free travel area between Ireland and the UK? Will Mr. Barnier guarantee that the European Union will not impose a hard Border between the North and South of this country? If the EU believes in democracy as it professes to do, will it give us a vote on the final deal in the negotiations between the EU and the UK in order that we can decide democratically whether we believe the best deal has been done? If Mr. Barnier cannot give those guarantees, frankly all the noble aspirations mean very little indeed. It is the failure to give guarantees and promises on democracy and rights and to vindicate genuine international solidarity that has caused the existential crisis the EU is now facing. The EU should address itself very quickly to that issue, if the dangerous forces that are rising in Europe are not to gain further advance.

Solidarity also must stand against the consensus expressed by Mr. Barnier and most of the other parties. The growing alienation against the EU - which Mr. Barnier has labelled "populism" - is actually largely a reaction to years of a neoliberal agenda within the EU that has favoured the interests of big business and banks against those of workers and the poor. EU directives, state aid rules and fiscal compact treaties are continually cited in this country to our successful anti-water charges movement, to striking Bus Éireann workers and to the thousands on the housing waiting lists here as reasons nothing can change. What Mr. Barnier represents actually has more in common with the Tories than he would have us believe. Both camps want bargain basement societies. The issue of a hard Border is causing huge uncertainty and anxiety in Northern Ireland and we should just put an end to the idea. Nobody wants, and there is no requirement or need for, a hard Border. Speaking of borders, the Mediterranean has become a graveyard for thousands of people thanks to fortress Europe, which Mr. Barnier favours. It is a migration policy of which Donald Trump would be envious.  The big business-dominated agenda of the EU consistently undermines the standards of living of the majority in the EU. Today's attempt at a neatly packaged consensus will be challenged by those of us on the left who seek to create a society where the needs of the millions, not the millionaires, are fundamental.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	18	I welcome Mr. Barnier to the Chamber today to engage with this committee of the Dáil and Seanad and to hear directly about our concerns surrounding the UK's decision to leave the European Union and the negotiations that are about to take place on the future relationship with the UK. I believe the EU does not have a history of having at heart the interests of the Irish people in dealing with us in the past. Hopefully, through the negotiations around Brexit, an outcome can be achieved that will change that. I represent the constituency of Donegal, which is the most northerly part of Ireland. Donegal has a land border of approximately 15 km with the rest of the Republic of Ireland. We stand therefore to be the most impacted region of Ireland from Brexit. My county has suffered from its isolation since the partition of Ireland after independence in 1921, and has only in recent years started to recover from that isolation. A hard Brexit, if it comes, will have a huge impact on the county. There are three main areas that could particularly be affected, which are the economy - and the fishing industry in particular - cross-Border workers and students, and the provision of health care. While an arrangement for trade will probably dominate the negotiations, access to fishing stocks is vitally important for the entire Irish fishing industry but particularly for the industry in County Donegal. Unfortunately, the EU does not have a good record when it comes to the treatment of Irish fishing, going back to when we negotiated to join the EEC, as it then was in the 1970s. It will be vitally important that access to fishing grounds is negotiated alongside the trade negotiations that will take place. This is the only way to ensure the survival of communities that depend on fishing. As more than 35% of the Irish quota that Irish fishermen catch is caught in UK waters, the continued access for fishermen to the fishing grounds is vital. Indeed, the value of fish caught in UK waters is higher than the percentage would suggest, being almost 50% of the total value of our catch. The importance of a fair negotiation and outcome cannot be over-stressed for us.  There is a compelling case for special status for Northern Ireland after Brexit that will recognise that we will have the only land border with a UK jurisdiction and that the possibility of a future reunification, as has already been outlined, has been provided for in the Good Friday Agreement. Approximately 30,000 people cross the Border to work every day, and many more thousands of students are studying in the North. Maintaining the common travel area in order that these workers and students can continue to participate is vitally important for us.Donegal's isolation has meant we have suffered from under-developed health services and neglect in provision from successive Governments that have had a totally Dublin-centred model for the provision of services such as health. Just last year, a radiotherapy centre was opened in Derry city, part-funded by the Irish Government, to give access to cancer patients from Donegal within a reasonable journey time from their homes for treatment. The future relationship with Northern Ireland has to ensure bilateral arrangements such as these can continue to be developed for the betterment of all our citizens, North and South.

I want to say bonjour, Mr. Barnier, and welcome him to our Parliament, Dáil Éireann, on behalf of the Rural Independent Group. This is a landmark occasion for this country as we, together with our European Union colleagues, enter negotiations on the UK's exit from the EU. These negotiations are as profound to Ireland today as those when we applied to join the European Economic Community almost 50 years ago. For Ireland, disentangling from our closest neighbour will be more difficult than for any other member state due to our common border and our common economic and cultural connections. Mr. Barnier's presence here today is a tangible recognition of the unique difficulties we face. Our main concerns relate to the still delicate nature of the peace process underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement, the nature of the border between the UK and the EU on this island, the close trading relationships between Ireland and the UK and the free passage of people, goods and services. These are all critical to Ireland. Our farmers tell us that Brexit presents the most serious economic threat to our agricultural sector, such is the large percentage of our high-quality exports which go to the UK. Border tariffs and customs, border checks and regulatory changes will cause serious restrictions on these exports. The negotiators must make every effort to secure favourable trading relationships between Ireland and the UK to avoid direct negative impact on our farm incomes. We must also find alternative markets in Europe and beyond for these goods and we request that Mr. Barnier assist us in that regard. As we will have a new land border with the EU, this needs special attention from Mr. Barnier in his negotiations with the UK. Ireland needs to know what this future border will look like in every scenario of British withdrawal. Economics may well dictate if a united Ireland will be the best option for all on this island. Only time will tell. We are a resourceful people and we must not be sacrificed to a hard Brexit because of our geography or because of our small size. Brexit makes us think of new opportunities and new potentials and there are new potentials in relation to developing our maritime and deep-sea ports. For instance, we have the asset of a number of uncongested deep-sea ports in the Shannon Estuary which should act as a trans-shipment location for the distribution of goods throughout Europe and should offer freight and cargo companies shipping to the United States preclearance facilities similar to those enjoyed by air passengers flying from Shannon. From a Brexit point of view, this is an opportunity to attract industry from right across Europe which is exporting into the United States and would benefit companies throughout the region. United, we will negotiate the best strategy for both the EU and the UK. There is nothing to be gained by making life difficult for everybody. After all, the UK will still be our nearest neighbour after these negotiations have been completed. We must appeal to people's hopes and not to their fears, and in adversity there is also opportunity. A united Europe can deliver a more prosperous Union where Ireland plays a prominent role.

In regard to Ireland's geography and small population, our big fear is that our voice will not be heard clearly at the negotiating table. Our fate is inextricably linked to that of the UK and for that reason it is essential that our concerns and interests are kept to the fore. Many Irish people continue to have to endure the cruel reality of austerity arising from the bank bailout. Ireland was forced to carry a burden for Europe on that occasion and we have no desire to do so again. If there is one message that might be taken back from today's engagement, I hope it is that the preservation of unrestricted free movement across the island of Ireland and between Ireland and the UK for people, goods and services must remain. This is vital to Ireland's national interest but it is also vital to the success of the European project, a project which must encompass all citizens of Europe working together to achieve a strong, equal, fair, economic and social Europe.

Je suis avec les Verts. I am with the all-island Green Party, proud, united, part of the European Green Party and best of mates with our Green Party colleagues in Scotland, England and Wales. We are very glad that in the first phase of these talks, Mr. Barnier has agreed that one of the three conditions we have to work on is the border issues, particular to Ireland and Gibraltar, but we are concerned about our Border issues here. I am glad that is front and centre stage. I have one request about how Mr. Barnier might approach the work that he has to do. As Mr. Barnier said, we are in a unique position that we are very close to Britain. We are closely connected to Whitehall and as a country we are well-regarded in each capital and in every European council, that is my experience. We should use this position, this place we have that is close to Berlin as well as Boston. Let us use this position.
Mr. Barnier said today that one of the things we should seek in these negotiations is ongoing co-operation in innovation, research and particularly on climate change. I agree. We can play a role in this. I ask Mr. Barnier to start straight away, perhaps in informal but flexible, safe space talks, which we can provide here in Ireland, to start working with the British immediately. What are the regulations on which we can agree in order that we make this necessary great climate change leap?
What are the digital rights that we have to agree in the information revolution that is taking place? What are the standards in the transport revolution that we need to do to improve our urban system and our quality of life in every way? Those three issues are not contentious. They are some of the critical issues that we will have to get right here. Do not wait until the Brexit bill or all the other citizens' rights are all sorted. Let us start straight away on those areas of co-operation. Doing that will be good for all of Europe. We can test it here, as Mr. Barnier said, in the first phase when we think about the Border relations between Ireland and the UK. That is what is good and strong about the European Union, that is against the race to the bottom, and that will raise all our spirits in the Union and set a future of which we can be proud.

He has pointed out that the issues Ireland faces call for imaginative and flexible solutions. Many things have been said here today with which I agree, and others with which I disagree, but it is up to the Irish now, North and South, to participate in the process of devising imaginative and flexible solutions and coming up with models for consideration by Mr. Barnier. Some people here have impugned the good faith of the European Union institutions and perhaps Mr. Barnier himself. I have trust and confidence that he does appreciate our needs and that he will be open to imaginative and flexible solutions which address the real problems in Ireland if we come forward with them to him.No institution or politician has a monopoly on imagination or flexibility. What we need in Ireland is a coalition of the willing, North and South, including all aspects of civil society and all economic interests, to try to ensure the implementation of Brexit is done in a manner which is least harmful to all the people of Ireland, North and South, over the next few years. We in the Senate are conducting an examination of these issues. We think the common travel area will survive and is no threat to general principles of European law such as freedom of movement but there are other issues, as Mr. Barnier mentioned. There is a need to have, as far as possible, free trade in goods with Britain, as a close partner of the EU after its exit, as well as the need to have, as far as possible, the free movement of goods on this island and between these islands.  I draw to the attention of Mr. Barnier that prior to the reunification of Germany, East Germany was given a special status for the export of goods to West Germany. It was regarded as inside the customs union in the days of the European Economic Community. That is the kind of flexible arrangement we should aspire to if we can. It has been suggested, in particular by Deputy Adams here today, that Northern Ireland should effectively remain within the European Union. It is not a practical possibility but there is a great opening to explore special status for the island of Ireland and its two parts without going that far. I agree with the Taoiseach that we do not need a Border poll now as part of the process of sorting out where Ireland should be in the short or medium term. I agree with Deputy Martin very strongly that the all-Ireland institutions contemplated by the Good Friday Agreement provide a framework, for instance, for a new agrifood dispensation on this island and a new cross-Border body to deal with all of those kinds of things. I will finish on that note. Mr. Barnier has said there is a need for flexible and imaginative institutions. The Irish people have to play their part in developing those responses to Mr. Barnier's challenge. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	25	On behalf of the Civil Engagement group in Seanad Éireann, I thank Mr. Barnier for his presence here today and for the special and appropriate consideration he has given to Ireland in advance of the forthcoming negotiations. The four fundamental freedoms must be protected, in particular the freedom of movement, which is of great importance for Irish citizens and all those who live on this island. Although the question of the Border has already been discussed, I will raise one further point on it. Can Mr. Barnier assure us the EU will not lead to any militarisation of Ireland's Border with the UK, as we have seen in other EU external borders, or attempt to press ahead with any further development of an EU military that could risk or compromise Ireland's neutrality, something of deep and valuable importance to our State and citizens and to our international role in peace building? Others have spoken about the importance of our peace process. One crucial pillar of the Good Friday Agreement was the co-guaranteeing of human rights. The Human Rights Act in the UK was brought in alongside the Good Friday Agreement to underpin that commitment. It is therefore of great concern to see the UK recently speak of repealing that Act. Will Mr. Barnier, in his negotiations, seek to protect this important Act, ideally linked to the European Court of Human Rights, or, at a minimum, demand a commitment to full and ongoing equivalence on human rights standards?  On the wider question of standards, it is vital that European and international principles and policies that have been agreed in areas such as employment, equality and the environment do not face a roll-back in this process. A race to the bottom is a race nobody wins. On the environment, the prospect of the UK moving away from common rules and commitments could seriously endanger collective progress in this area and could risk direct environmental damage for those of us in Ireland. How does the Commission see negotiations with the UK proceeding in the area of environmental regulation and what leverage can be employed to secure them? How, for example, will we guarantee that any deal with the UK preserves the principles and measures of sustainability which currently underpin the Common Fisheries Policy? Access to and transit through UK territorial waters will also be vital for Irish fishermen. It is an area Mr. Barnier understands with great depth. Others have spoken of transport, telecommunications and energy but there are other areas of important co-operation between the two parts of the island, as well as between Ireland and the UK more broadly. There are areas of practical co-operation, many of which predate or operate outside and alongside the EU's remit. Practical co-operation in areas such as education, health and social protection, particularly pensions, is of immense importance to the real lived lives of our citizens and must not be lost in these negotiations.  We, in Ireland, will be watching the forthcoming negotiations with great attention. They will also be watched by many across Europe and across the world at a time of great difficulty following periods of austerity and conflict. The nature and tone of the negotiations will send an important message about Europe and about what Europe is. It is vitally important the message is not simply of a Europe that is strong or a Europe of the economy but that it is a Europe grounded in social rights and social cohesion and which works for peace, values all its members, values democracy and listens to civil society. The message should be of a Europe committed to all its citizens, all who live in it and to positive leadership and partnership in our shared world as we face the challenges ahead. We entrust Mr. Barnier to convey that message.

I thank Mr. Barnier for his address today to the Dáil and the Seanad. The potentially adverse political, economic and social consequences of Brexit for Ireland have been highlighted by the Houses and by the Irish Government both before and after last summer's referendum in the United Kingdom. Mr. Barnier's presence here today has afforded a valuable opportunity to hear directly the concerns of the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. His direct engagement with the Members of a national parliament of the EU also speaks to the strength of his commitment to the spirit of treaty principles. The outcome of the Brexit negotiations will very much set the framework for the foreseeable future for decision-making for Ireland and for all of our fellow member states of the European Union. We, in Ireland, fully appreciate the enormity of the task Mr. Barnier and his team face as they negotiate the withdrawal of the United Kingdom. We wish him well in his work and we hope he will be strengthened in his endeavours by the goodwill of the Members of these Houses. We look forward to continued engagement with Mr. Barnier on this crucial issue in the period ahead. As he conducts the negotiations and seeks to achieve the best outcome for the European Union we ask him to keep in mind the particular situation we have here in Ireland. Merci beaucoup.

However, before I do, I wish to say something that I think is important. I acknowledge and commend the work that is done every day in this country by members of An Garda Síochána who protect our communities and enforce our law. I also commend and recognise the role that has been played in the past by members of An Garda Síochána who have served this country proudly. I say that at the outset because, unfortunately, recent controversies have significantly damaged the reputation of An Garda Síochána. It is unfortunate, to say the least, that we are now in a situation where we are expecting to hear scandal after scandal in respect of the force. This is having a significant impact on the morale of the force. More seriously, it is having an impact on the good relationship that has historically existed between An Garda Síochána and members of the public. As politicians, we have a responsibility to ensure we rectify that relationship and rebuild the status of An Garda Síochána in our community. It is seven weeks to the day since senior members of An Garda Síochána told the public that there were 937,000 false breath tests on the PULSE system and 14,700 wrongful convictions as a result of Garda error. At the time, my party stated that we needed answers and accountability. Regrettably, from the force to date, we have not got answers or accountability. Neither have we got political answers or accountability from the Government, which is responsible for An Garda Síochána. After the breath tests scandal, we had another scandal in respect of what was happening down in Templemore. An audit, which displayed considerable financial irregularities, was conducted. Last week, the Committee of Public Accounts was informed of a litany of financial irregularities in respect of the Garda College at Templemore. More worrying, there was open disagreement in An Garda Síochána between civilian members of senior management of the force and the Commissioner, who is a member of the officer band of the force. This has caused significant concern. The issues in respect of Templemore were only brought to the Tánaiste's attention by the Commissioner 14 months after she was apprised of them. Under section 41 of the Garda Síochána Act, there is a legal duty on the Commissioner to bring to the Minister for Justice and Equality's attention "significant developments that might reasonably be expected to affect adversely public confidence in the Garda Síochána". It is unquestionably the case that the issues concerning financial irregularities in Templemore have affected public confidence in An Garda Síochána. Is the Tánaiste satisfied that she was told about this 18 months later? Why is it that when she was told, she did not ask the Commissioner the reason she was not told about it earlier? The Tánaiste needs to answer those questions and explain this to the House.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	30	I agree with the point that the Deputy makes regarding the work of the members of An Garda Síochána day in, day out throughout the country tackling crime. We should do everything in this House to support the work they do, which is extremely challenging at this time. We should do everything possible to restore morale in An Garda Síochána. That has been my goal and aim since I became Minister for Justice and Equality. Every action I have taken has been to support the reform that is necessary and to support the work of An Garda Síochána. It had been starved completely of resources due to the lack of investment, the closure of Templemore and the lack of investment in the fleet and so on. This is what I inherited from the Government previous to the last. That was the situation I had to deal with. That is the reality of the situation An Garda Síochána was faced with when the Deputy's Government went out of power. I would not want to underestimate in any way the seriousness of the finding of the interim internal audit report on the finances of the Garda College in Templemore. While it is an interim report, it paints a disturbing picture of the manner in which the college's finances were run, including the existence of a large number of bank accounts and investment accounts linked to the college, staffing issues and issues relating to the ownership and non-use of certain lands. In short, it found that the financial controls in place could not be stood over. While the report did not identify misappropriation as such, the question of whether any criminality might be involved is now being examined, and has to be examined, separately by an assistant commissioner of An Garda Síochána. As the House will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for An Garda Síochána. As such, she is liable to account to the Committee of Public Accounts on the Garda Vote. The Committee of Public Accounts plays a vital role in ensuring there is proper accountability with regard to public moneys. It is quite clear that the committee is determined to protect the interests of the taxpayers and to examine fully the facts behind what happened at the college. I am aware from its meeting this morning - I saw some of it - that the committee is determined to proceed with this examination. It spent a lot of time discussing precisely how it should proceed, the documentation that is needed and the ambit of its discussions. Many members of the committee emphasised the need for fair procedures to be followed. This should be borne in mind by all Members of the House. Very particular responsibilities lie with Accounting Officers, and the House will appreciate that I must be careful not to interfere in any way with the work of the committee. I can tell the House, however, that I will pay careful attention to the proceedings of the committee and, in particular, any report it may make. If action is required on my part as a result, I will not hesitate to take it. As I stated yesterday, I cannot have a running commentary on these proceedings. There is a danger. Some people want the examination of these issues to proceed but to reach conclusions before it has been concluded. Some people want to reach verdicts before all the evidence has been heard.

We want political responsibility in respect of this matter. I asked the Tánaiste a straightforward question. It concerned the legal obligation of the Commissioner under section 41 of the Garda Síochána Act. Is the Tánaiste satisfied that she was notified in adequate time about these significant issues of public concern affecting confidence in An Garda Síochána?That is the question I asked and I would like the Tánaiste to answer it. Our concern on this side of the House is that it appears to be the case that the Government is allowing the Garda to drift from one scandal to another - the scandals are simply being identified, with no one accepting political responsibility for them. More important than accepting political responsibility, someone in Government must come forward with a plan as to how we will rectify the position regarding public confidence in An Garda Síochána. The force has done too much for this State for us to abandon it politically by saying we cannot come up with a solution. The Tánaiste and the Cabinet have that responsibility, so I ask her again: is she satisfied with the notification she received under section 41, or does she think it was delayed?

The Tánaiste does so in the wake of damning documentation presented by the head of Garda human resources, Mr. John Barrett, to the Committee of Public Accounts. This documentation substantiates Mr. Barrett's contradiction of Commissioner O'Sullivan's statement to the committee last week. It details his concerns about how his efforts to raise financial irregularities at Templemore were frustrated. In fact, he expresses the very real worry that the approach of senior gardaí could be perceived as a cover-up. The documentation reiterates the fact that the Commissioner ignored her legal advice and her legal obligation to inform immediately the Tánaiste of the financial irregularities at Templemore. Now we discover that the Tánaiste is, it seems, happy to be left in a state of blissful ignorance in this regard. Worse still, she suggests that the happenings at Templemore were not serious enough to merit a report under section 41. This is quite incredible. The leadership of the Commissioner has become a conveyor belt of crises, each scandal flying in the face of the central mission of the Garda, that is, to uphold the law and protect the people. Since public confidence in the Commissioner has been torn to ribbons by persistent malpractice, corruption, arrogance and a blatant lack of accountability, it is now the Tánaiste's responsibility to act. It is a disgrace that she refuses to hold this Commissioner to account. The Tánaiste is the Minister for Justice - she is the Commissioner's boss - yet she has done nothing. Deputy Enda Kenny is An Taoiseach - for a few more weeks at least. He is the Tánaiste's boss and he, in turn, has done nothing. Is it any wonder the Commissioner refuses to do the right thing and resign? The Commissioner knows full well that the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach will both keep their heads firmly stuck in the sand in an attempt to wish all of this away, but it will not go away. The Tánaiste's handling of the scandals surrounding the Commissioner's leadership of An Garda Síochána is a scandal in and of itself, and the story is now wider than the Commissioner's intransigence. We are in the throes of a serious crisis of governance that fundamentally undermines the credibility of the Tánaiste's Government and the rule of law. This has been brought about by her refusal to act and her incredible insistence that Commissioner O'Sullivan remains the best person to lead An Garda Síochána. The position of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael's partners in government, is equally nonsensical on this score and on the test of accountability. The Commissioner needs to go. Her position is completely untenable. In no other walk of life, in no other job, would a person so compromised be allowed to stay in her position. The Tánaiste's approach to this crisis has made a laughing stock of the political process within and outside this institution, and her continuing refusal to do her job will only ensure that ordinary people become more angry, more alienated and more cynical.

I suggest to her that what the public will find quite extraordinary is that, without waiting for the evidence regarding the issue, she, as a member of the committee, has given an opinion on the final outcome. Quite clearly, the issues that have arisen at Templemore underline the need for the reform to which everyone in this House is committed and to which the last Government was committed, which was shown by the establishment of the Policing Authority. This was the first time there has been such oversight, the first time there have been public hearings regarding An Garda Síochána and the first time appointments have been made independently of Government - assistant commissioners appointed already and chief superintendents being appointed. No other Government except this one set that in place, so do not talk to me about not being committed to reform. No other Government has supported An Garda Síochána with the resources as this Government and the previous one has done. We are determined to ensure the reform takes place. A modernisation programme is in place for the first time-----

The first report regarding the implementation of that reform has already been published by the Policing Authority. I do not believe there is anyone in this House who does not have trust in the work done by Josephine Feehily and the Policing Authority. We set up the Policing Authority. We made those appointments to ensure there would be the kind of oversight to ensure that these issues emerged and that the Garda would be held publicly accountable instead of doing things in private. That is what I am committed to, namely, public accountability, procedures in place to ensure oversight, acting on the recommendations that come to me and the Government and ensuring that budgetary provision is made so that instead of people not having the management they need, not having the civilian staff in place and not having recruitment, that is all now in place. That is what this Government is doing, that is what the previous Government did and that is what the commitment is - to support members of An Garda Síochána to go about their daily work, to give them the resources to do so, and absolutely to have accountability and to call them to task when there is not accountability.

She talks of accountability but she resolutely refuses to take the first action of accountability, which is to hold the boss - the Commissioner - to account. She will not do that. Let me say, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, that we are well conversant with our role and our responsibilities. Let me reiterate: we will get to the bottom of all of this. Let me also tell the Tánaiste that we and, more importantly, the internal audit function of An Garda Síochána have already established the facts.These facts, which are accepted by the Garda Commissioner, are that 50 bank accounts were opened by An Garda Síochána without the sanction of the Department of Justice and Equality, that An Garda Síochána entered illegally into land leasing arrangements and took the benefit of the revenues that accrued and that the Commissioner was advised of her obligation under section 41 to inform the Minister of the shenanigans in Templemore and refused that advice. These are not matters of contention but established facts. All of the Tánaiste's hot air about accountability amounts to very little. She is not serious about accountability because if she were, she would call Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan to account and relieve her of her duties.

What I mean by accountability is having in place procedures and organisations, such as the Policing Authority, where there is that accountability. What I mean by accountability is that all of the facts are brought out into the public arena. The Garda Commissioner of the day does not hold office on the basis of political expediency. I am not free to decide the fate of a Garda Commissioner on the basis of a headline or expressions of confidence or otherwise by Members of the Oireachtas. There are very specific legal provisions in place in respect of these matters.

They protect our communities. I have to support the actions that I believe will ensure the safety of our communities. That is what guides my decision-making.

That there is a growing level of crisis in and about An Garda Síochána is undeniable. It is not conjecture or fanciful thought. Perhaps the most concerning development of recent days is the clear division opening up between senior civilian members and other members of An Garda Síochána. The intention behind civilianisation of An Garda Síochána and giving civilians senior roles was twofold, namely, to bring additional expertise that the Garda did not have into the heart of the force and to open up and change the closed culture that I, the Tánaiste and others know exists within the force. In the past week, three senior civilian officers have sharply disagreed with the stance of senior Garda officers. Mr. Gurchand Singh, the civilian head of analysis, made clear to the Policing Authority that the report on mistakes in the homicide figures were not his work. He also made clear that he did not even get to read the report submitted to the Policing Authority, although he is the head of analysis. Mr. Niall Kelly, the civilian head of audit, told the Policing Authority that the review of breath test figures repeatedly referred to by the most senior members of An Garda Síochána as an audit could not be regarded as an audit and was not done by him. Then we had Mr. John Barrett, the civilian head of human resources, whose detailed recollection of meetings with the Commissioner regarding profoundly disturbing matters in Templemore clearly and flatly contradicted the assertion of the Garda Commissioner that their meeting was a short encounter over a cup of tea. The leadership of An Garda Síochána is in crisis management mode or, more accurately, crisis reaction mode. It is staggering from one emergency to another. It is clear that the ability of the Garda and its leadership to respond effectively to the cascade of crises is bringing this matter to a critical mass. I am trying to use objective and dispassionate language. I do not want to apportion blame, let alone seek to blame all of this on one individual, namely, the Garda Commissioner. When the Commissioner was appointed, I hoped that she could bring about the fresh start the policing service required. I also want to use objective language because the law requires the Tánaiste, as Minister for Justice and Equality, to apply an objective test in this case. There has been much talk of whether the Tánaiste has confidence in the Garda Commissioner and barely a day goes by that she - or one of her colleagues - responds to that question. There has been a learned but unnecessary intervention from the other side of the House claiming it is for the Tánaiste rather than the House to decide whether she has lost confidence in the Garda Commissioner. That intervention was unnecessary because it misses the essential point. Section 11 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 does not refer to whether anyone has confidence in the Commissioner but sets out a different, much simpler test in objective terms, that is, whether the continued role of the Garda Commissioner is in the best interests of the force. My question is very simple and the Tánaiste should apply that test now. Does she believe the continuation in office of the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána is in the best interests of the force?

It is absolutely essential that we have increasing civilianisation in An Garda Síochána and it is essential that those civilians have a constructive, positive working relationship with members of An Garda Síochána. I am absolutely committed to ensuring there are more civilians in the Garda. Part of the modernisation, renewal and change that is needed is to ensure this happens. I am very aware of the issues that have emerged at the Committee of Public Accounts and in evidence before the Policing Authority regarding the differences between some civilian members. One of the issues the Deputy mentioned was addressed at the Policing Authority's most recent meeting in respect of one of the examples that he cited. Both of these issues are before the Policing Authority and Committee of Public Accounts because that is where the documentation Mr. Barrett supplied was given. This documentation has to be dealt with and I am sure it will be further explored. The committee will want to find out what other people have to say about it. I understand that it is not a minute of the meetings that were held but a personal note. It would be very helpful if there was a minute of the meeting that took place but I have no doubt the committee will examine that matter. In the context of the Garda Commissioner and the ongoing work she is doing, she is implementing the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate's report. A range of initiatives and changes have taken place already. It is in the interests of the force that this work continues and that we, in this House, do everything to ensure it continues with the oversight bodies we have set up. That is the way forward and the right thing to do in terms of the public interest, An Garda Síochána and morale. I would like to see less politicisation of these issues and the oversight bodies being allowed to get on with their work. I want to see the Committee of Public Accounts finishing its work on these issues. As I said, I will take very serious note of the findings of the committee when its report is published.

Every Member can clearly see that the best interests of An Garda Síochána are not served by the status quo. That the Tánaiste cannot see this is a matter of great concern. She and I have known each other for a long time and I believe her to be compassionate and a very capable politician. I ask sincerely that she does not make herself an obstacle to doing what the people and vast majority of Members believe is clearly the right and essential thing to do.

The decision of Bord na Móna's board of directors is having a major impact on the local community. We do not agree with the decision or the justification for it that has been put forward, but we have been told emphatically that the decision will not be changed and we must work with it. It is in this spirit that, last Friday, we met the unions representing the workers at Littleton. As one would expect, it was a highly charged and, at times, emotional meeting. The five Tipperary Deputies attended the meeting and agreed to take a unified approach to the strategy to be employed. We requested a meeting with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, which was held yesterday. I thank him for being accessible and open and for showing a genuine concern for the plight of the workforce and community at Littleton. During the meeting, we had a useful and constructive exchange of views on the actions required. We all came to the conclusion that there first needed to be a renegotiation of the redundancy package. Second, we requested an extension to the closure date of April 2018. Third, we asked that an alternative use for the remaining peat be examined. Fourth, we asked for a plan for the utilisation of the existing bog, plant and facilities. A number of issues arise, one of which is the need to commence negotiations. I call on the management of Bord na Móna and the unions to enter into negotiations without preconditions on the understanding that the Minister and the board are not averse to the idea of holding discussions on redundancy packages and a time extension. I ask that the Government take responsibility in the matter, given that a cost would be involved in any time extension. That cost should be considered in the context of Bord na Móna's payment of a €10 million dividend to the State every year. It should be possible for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to reduce that amount by the cost, or €3 million, which should be set aside to ease the burden on the workforce at Littleton.

I recognise the difficulty, stress and challenge posed by the recent decision for everyone involved. Having received the review conclusions, the company has begun a process of engagement with the group of unions and employees. It has also confirmed that no redundancies are being contemplated in the current year. That is an important point. I note the Deputy's comments about my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Naughten. The Deputy accepts that the Minister is monitoring the situation closely and is acutely conscious of the decision's impact on Bord na Móna's employees. The Minister has urged Bord na Móna to consider all opportunities for redeployment, a phased reduction in employment numbers and any other renewable technology opportunity that may arise in respect of Bord na Móna investments. As part of Bord na Móna's general strategy to move towards sustainable businesses based on renewable sources, pilot trials for the production of a biomass briquette have been conducted in the past 12 months. This is a significant investment by Bord na Móna, which has confirmed its plan to begin large-scale production of the briquette. It will soon seek planning and other approvals in that regard. This will be a critical step in future-proofing the fuels business, as it offers the potential of sustainable and quality regional employment. The Minister held a series of meetings with the Bord na Móna group of unions and staff representatives as well as Tipperary's Deputies. He will continue with those discussions. He has called for engagement and imagination by all sides on devising a range of solutions and different outcomes for employees. I do not doubt that he will take on board the particular points that Deputy Lowry has raised, but Bord na Móna is a major employer across the middle of the country and is exploring new opportunities for growth, particularly in renewable energy. I hope that this will help the company not just keep current levels of employment, but grow it in a part of the country where, although there have been some successes, attracting foreign direct investment has traditionally been challenging. The Minister will bring a memo to the Government soon on establishing a new semi-State entity, BioEnergy Ireland, which will focus on the development of the biomass sector and exploit those skills currently available to Bord na Móna and Coillte.

A ready argument for this relates to the 260,000 tonnes of peat that are piled up at various points around the bog. The factory uses approximately 7,000 tonnes per week, which means that enough peat is available to keep the plant running for another 37 weeks. That should be possible, as should a third harvest. The redundancy package for employees, especially those who are long serving and wish to exit the company, is not strong enough and needs to be renegotiated. One employee has 40 years of service and is 63 years of age. He would receive €31,200 in redundancy. This is a person who has given a lifetime of service, commitment and dedication to Bord na Móna. The package must be renegotiated. It includes a clause to the effect that, the longer one's service, the more one is penalised. The current agreement is not fair or just and needs to be re-examined. Will the Government play a part in ensuring that happens?

The Minister has stated that he is examining the recommendations of the unions, Deputy Lowry and other Deputies and is open to exploring a range of options. The suggestions that the Deputy is making today will be taken on board by the Minister. Regarding redundancy, I expect the Minister will discuss the matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to examining the precise circumstances of the individuals involved. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, will be familiar with the matter, but it is one for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

Yesterday, the Taoiseach indicated the Tánaiste would be more than happy, in fact delighted it seems, to come before the House and make a statement on the matters surrounding Templemore and some of the issues we touched on during Leaders' Questions. He also indicated the Tánaiste would be quite happy to take questions in that regard. I want to know when she proposes to do that. When she takes to her feet on that occasion, she also should shed some light on the case of Dara Quigley, a young woman who died by suicide on 12 April. She had been detained by gardaí some days previously under the Mental Health Act. She had been walking naked in a Dublin street when detained. Garda CCTV footage of this detention was posted on Facebook, a really deplorable and revolting turn of events, and something that has brought great hardship to her family and which clearly brought very great distress to Dara. We mark her passing. When we talk about Garda culture, reform and accountability, I suppose this is the rawest end, the sharpest end, of a deplorable culture of humiliation and disregard for human beings. I hope the Tánaiste will, as the Taoiseach promised, come before the House to make her statement and take questions. I hope also that she might shed some light on the accountability that will be held for the life of Dara Quigley.

When I was Minister and Tánaiste, I set up a group drawn from the Departments of Social Protection and Finance to look at the issue.

There are many people caught in the middle who cannot get on a local authority waiting list because they are over the €25,000 or €26,000 threshold and they cannot get a mortgage. These are low to middle-income workers who are caught in that bind. We know there is a huge housing crisis, that it is difficult to get private rented accommodation, that people have no security of tenure and that rents are sky-high, as demonstrated by the report this week by www.daft.ie.What I want to highlight for the Tánaiste is the fact that the Nevin Institute has put forward a proposal. There is money with the credit unions, namely, €8 billion in deposits. There is money in pension funds which is earning 0.5% interest. There is European Investment Bank, EIB, money. There is money available. I am not saying that there is a magic wand, but most Members agree with the cost-to-rent scheme contained in the programme for Government. There is significant political support for it. Such a scheme is badly needed. What progress has been made in bringing that scheme into being in order that we might have developments of cost-to-rent apartments and housing built?

Recent figures from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, show that, at the end of April, there were 2,281 people waiting for outpatient appointments at Mayo University Hospital. These are people who were referred for necessary care and treatment by their GPs. The length of the waiting list is leading to increased stress, anxiety, further medical complications and increased illness among those patients. Clearly, the Government is failing in its commitment to provide timely access to care. Another related issue is the fact that patients who choose to go north of the Border for treatment are having it paid for by the HSE. Patients in my constituency of Mayo are availing of treatment across the Border. When will the Government address the delays relating to the NTPF? When will we see full and proper roll-out of that fund? Is serious action being taken to address the delays being experienced by patients languishing on waiting lists?

In the meantime, as the Deputy will be aware, other initiatives are being taken by the Minister for Health. He has access to the largest budget ever in the history of the State. Of course, there is increasing demand on health services but it is important to note that almost 1.69 million patients received inpatient or day-case treatment in our hospitals in 2016, an increase of almost 40,000 on the previous year.

We have had six months of outstanding weather and I do not see diggers working on the rivers. I do not see the programme that was promised for the River Shannon being put in place. Members will know that rivers everywhere are choked up with peat and silt. I am aware that this is not the Tánaiste's area. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, is pushing for this.

Today, I want to ask the Tánaiste about the question of dual diagnosis. Dara suffered from and struggled with mental health problems and addiction. She received help from many agencies but what was available was not sufficient. A particular problem was the lack of dual diagnosis services where psychiatric and addiction problems are treated together in a professional and properly funded manner. My question to the Tánaiste is as follows. Does she see a legislative pathway to addressing this problem?

We have appointed a national clinical lead who will work to develop a programme whereby if somebody is suffering from either a drug or alcohol problem that is leading on to a mental health problem, there will be a clear clinical pathway for our doctors and nurses, both within the acute hospitals and in primary care settings. There is work well under way and we would be hoping to continue that during the year.

The Revenue Commissioners have an attachment order on their bank accounts. Recently, in order to survive and subsist, the person applied for and was granted family income supplement. Upon receiving the first payment of the family income supplement and the arrears due from the application date, the Revenue reached into their bank account and took the payment. As I understand it, the payment is an income supplement for the family to allow them to live day to day.

A copy of my speech together with a short information note is being circulated to Members present in the House, which will give them additional useful information to what I will outline in my speech. I am pleased to bring the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 before the Dáil today. This is a very short Bill, with just two sections, dealing with a very specific issue in the law on financial reporting by companies. The issue is the application of section 279 of the Companies Act 2014. That is the section that permits certain companies to prepare and file Companies Act financial statements using the American accounting standard, known as US generally accepted accounting principles or US GAAP. As things stand, that section will no longer apply after December 2020. As Deputies will be aware, the provisions of the Bill before the House today were originally proposed as part of the general scheme of the Companies (Statutory) Audits Bill 2017, which was published by the Government earlier this year, in February. While drafting of that Bill is well under way and publication is planned for the summer, it has become apparent to the Government that the issue dealt with in today's Bill may require more immediate attention. Indeed some Deputies have raised this issue and called for those provisions in the general scheme of the statutory audits Bill that relate specifically to section 279 to be taken out of that proposed Bill and brought forward as a matter of urgency. Accordingly, I am pleased to say today that the Government has responded to those calls for urgency and given the relevant provisions their own stand-alone Bill, which is before the House now. I hope Members will welcome it. The history of this issue dates back to the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, when the Oireachtas first enacted the possibility for some companies to use US GAAP. Under Irish company law, companies are generally required to prepare and file their financial statements using one of two sets of accounting standards, namely, international financial reporting standards, IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, or Irish generally accepted accounting practices, Irish GAAP, in accordance with EU law. With the 2009 Act, an exception to this rule was introduced allowing particular types of companies to prepare their financial statements using US GAAP. Those provisions were later amended in the Companies (Amendment) Act 2012 and then re-enacted as section 279 of the Companies Act 2014. In short, section 279 permits companies that are not listed on a regulated market in the EU and that meet certain other criteria to prepare and file their financial statements using US GAAP rather than using either IFRS or Irish GAAP. This provision was intended to facilitate companies that are registered in Ireland but are listed in the US. Once a company is listed in the US, it is subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is obliged to prepare and file financial statements in the US in accordance with US GAAP. Without section 279, that company would also have to prepare and file a separate set of financial statements using IFRS or Irish GAAP. It would have to prepare two very different sets of financial statements in respect of the same financial year. At the time the provision was introduced, the Oireachtas accepted that this would be an administrative burden on those companies that was not merited. The Oireachtas also framed the provision as a temporary measure, with an end point after which it could not be used. That was due to an expectation that the Securities and Exchange Commission would permit the use of IFRS for the relevant companies. There were also international efforts toward convergence between US GAAP and IFRS. The Securities and Exchange Commission still does not permit IFRS for companies known as US domestic issuers and it seems unlikely it will do so in the near future. Furthermore, the discussions on convergence have not come to a conclusion. Given that the considerations which gave rise to the provision are still relevant, it is appropriate to review the end date before it passes. In the event that this date is not extended beyond the current deadline of 31 December 2020, companies will have to prepare and file two different sets of accounts according to two different accounting standards for financial years ending after that date. Last September, the Department conducted a public consultation on the impending deadline in section 279. It received 23 responses from a range of stakeholders, and all are available on the Department's website. Virtually all the submissions were in favour of extending the deadline beyond 2020. While some respondents advocated an extension with no end date, most other respondents felt a ten-year extension would be appropriate. The Department also spoke to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. The views of the Minister for Finance were also sought. As a result, the Government has decided that it is appropriate to extend the deadline by a further ten years. The main reasons for this decision include, first, the fact the public consultation showed support for an extension among stakeholders such as members of the accounting profession and representative bodies of business. It is important to point out there were no objections. Second, the circumstances that gave rise to the deadline in section 279 have not improved. Third, the relevant companies have been using US GAAP for several years now, so it is easier to compare historical figures if the format remains the same in future. Moreover, neither the Department nor the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority is aware of any complaints with the use of US GAAP in Ireland. Therefore, section 1 of the Bill provides that section 279 will continue to apply to financial years ending no later than 31 December 2030. Apart from the deadline, one of the other conditions that is currently in section 279 is that the financial statements must comply with all the financial reporting requirements of Part 6 and its associated Schedules in the Companies Act. The financial statements must be in line with our national law. That important obligation will remain unchanged by today's Bill. As well as extending the deadline, the Bill has a second function, which is to address the fact that the use of section 279 is not entirely without concern. Some of the companies that qualify to use US GAAP are companies that came to Ireland from the US following a so-called inversion process.Many of these companies have brought or grown their investment in Ireland. In some cases, their businesses in Ireland are substantial. I have met representatives of some of those companies myself when I was doing trade missions to the United States. Nevertheless, inversions can be damaging to Ireland’s international reputation. As Deputies may be aware, they have received negative attention in the US. Ireland’s standing abroad must also be borne in mind. The availability of section 279 for companies has been suggested as a potential factor in attracting US companies that are inverting to Ireland. In that light, the proposal in the Bill to extend the deadline in section 279 could be seen as a measure to encourage more company inversions in future. Accordingly, the Government is proposing to close off section 279 at this time to any new companies. Therefore, section 1 of the Bill introduces a new criterion for qualification. That new criterion is the requirement that a company has been registered in Ireland before the commencement of this Bill. That point has to be made quite clear, particularly in an international context. In summary, section 1 of the Bill extends the deadline for companies using US GAAP for a further ten years, bringing that deadline to the end of 2030. Section 1 also provides that any company that forms after the Bill comes into operation will not be eligible. Section 2 of the Bill is technical and provides for the commencement of the Bill. It is intended to commence the Bill as soon as possible after enactment. I would like to mention the timing of the Bill and the reason for some urgency. The existing deadline of 2020 may be over three years away, but companies that rely on section 279 are requesting certainty on the issue well in advance of this date. They have made representations to the Government and Members of this House asking that the Oireachtas reconsider that deadline at this stage, rather than in a few months as originally intended. This is for two reasons. First, the companies would need to introduce new accounting systems to prepare financial statements in either IFRS or Irish GAAP. Second, both IFRS and Irish GAAP require comparative information in respect of the preceding financial year. This information must be restated in terms of IFRS or Irish GAAP, as the case may be, when IFRS or Irish GAAP is first used. In effect, this requires restatement of two earlier balance sheets. If the current deadline of 2020 stands, the companies are clear that they will need to start their preparations straight away. The Government accepts that companies need clarity now as to whether the deadline in section 279 is to be extended. For that reason it has agreed to introduce the provisions that are now in section 1 of this Bill earlier than was originally planned. For the same reason, the Government has also placed a priority on the enactment of this Bill. The Bill is pragmatic, timely legislation that addresses the needs of businesses while taking long-term reputational issues into consideration. It respects the importance of transparency for third parties. They will continue to have access to financial information in a format that is comparable with the information that is already available on these companies. Finally, it respects the policy of proportionate regulation. I commend the Bill to the House.

The Bill will extend the current expiry date of 31 December 2020 to enable qualifying companies, incorporated in Ireland, to prepare and file financial statements using US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, US GAAP, rather than International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS. The extension is for ten years to December 2030. In 2009, under a Fianna Fáil-led government, a temporary exemption was introduced that enabled companies to prepare their financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. This was subsequently referenced under section 279(2) of the Companies Act 2014. The Bill will give long overdue legal certainty and clarity to the companies concerned by strengthening the regulatory competitiveness of Ireland in this area and secure jobs into the medium term. This is more salient than ever with Brexit on the horizon and a more competitive business landscape likely in the US under the new administration. There was an impending requirement for SEC-listed and Irish incorporated companies to file accounts under both US GAAP and IFRS. However, a previous convergence project between both standards has stalled. Fianna Fáil has pressed for this expiry extension over the last 18 months and on Committee and Report Stages of the Companies (Accounting) Bill 2016 in the Dáil, in order to safeguard the 8,000 high skilled jobs regionally located by these companies in Ireland. Legal certainty was urgently needed by these companies who in the absence of any extension to the 2020 expiry date would have had to start making extensive preparations to meet the standards required by IFRS guidelines. The deadline for the 2020 expiry date would effectively have been 2018. It has been estimated that the cost of introducing and implementing this IFRS requirement would be a minimum of $20 million before the end of each company’s financial year in 2017, due to the reallocation and introduction of extra resources and staff training, while streamlining the systems required to meet these compliance obligations. It is therefore a damning indictment of successive Fine Gael-led governments in failing to do everything within their power to safeguard these high quality jobs, which number approximately 8,000 in this case. It was only after Fianna Fáil indicated on Report Stage of the Companies (Accounting) Bill 2016 in the Dáil that we were going to introduce an amendment in the Seanad to extend the current expiry date that the Minister - magically at the eleventh hour - was able to fast forward legislative proposals at Cabinet last week to show cause on this issue. This amendment flagged by Fianna Fáil has expedited the legislative process for this issue and has thankfully awoken the Government. Fine Gael has constantly kicked this issue to touch, showing tacit prioritisation and publishing the heads of another Bill, the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill, in February to address this issue. However, this would have kicked the can further down the road until the second half of 2017 at the earliest, as companies continue to incur costs due to inaction. This is all the more astounding considering that similar exemptions are currently in place in a number of European countries, including Switzerland, France, the UK, the Czech Republic and Germany. In conclusion, we are happy to support the Bill in its entirety.

The Bill is short, technical legislation which will have a positive impact on certain companies doing business in Ireland. This amending legislation will extend the current expiry date of 31 December 2020 to enable qualifying companies incorporated in Ireland to prepare and file financial statements using US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, commonly known as GAAP, rather than International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS. The extension provided for in the Bill is for ten years to December 2030. This continued exemption provides for an ease of doing business in Ireland and spares some companies the costs associated with switching systems. The Bill also contains a new requirement that only companies registered in Ireland before the commencement of the Bill will benefit from its provisions. Sinn Féin welcomes the insertion of that requirement in the Bill. This is being included to prevent future inversions which have a damaging effect on Ireland's international reputation. With this extra criteria, extending the deadline until 2030 cannot be seen as Ireland encouraging further inversions. Any measure that benefits Ireland's international reputation is welcome. I have met with the coalition for Irish international companies on a number of occasions, most recently last week, and they were anxious to get this Bill passed to avoid unnecessary financial expenditure if it were to be delayed. The companies concerned, as Deputy Niall Collins said, employ over 8,000 people in high quality skilled jobs across the State.Should the current deadline of 2020 stand, they will need to start preparations for an alternative strategy straight away. I understand the Bill passed through the Seanad quickly last month with cross-party support. I hope it can proceed as quickly as possible. The Minister of State has our full support in this.

They certainly understand the urgency of it. I thank the Deputies as well for their contributions to this afternoon's debate. The Bill, as I said, may be technical, but its impact will be practical. That is the important thing about it. I believe it is an appropriate and measured response to the needs of business at this point in time. We need to respond to those needs. It also represents a balanced approach, as it takes into account the needs of those who rely on financial statements for information. It is heartening to see that there is general support across the House for this Bill. Given that level of general support there is good reason to hope that we will be able to make progress on the Bill in an efficient manner. I look forward to further debate as we progress through the various Stages in this House.

#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	135	Tusla has informed me that in 2016, a total of 605 young persons left care that year - the reason for this being that they had reached 18 years of age. At the end of 2016, Tusla has indicated that 1,055 young persons in care were aged 16 or 17 years of age. Of these 432 - 41% - had been allocated an aftercare worker. Tusla has advised that it does not collate data on the waiting periods before an aftercare worker has been assigned. I have made the tabular data requested by the Deputy available for inclusion in the record of the House. Each year, between approximately 500 and 600 young persons will turn 18 years of age while in care. In recent times, I understand that about 75% of 17-year-olds in care were in foster placements while a further 20% approximately were reported to be placed in residential settings. The remaining 5% are in other settings, for example, a disability setting or supported lodgings.  I am conscious that the transition to independent adulthood can be challenging for many young people. This is particularly true for children and young people in care. Planning for leaving care needs to begin in the years prior to leaving care and continue as part of the care planning process. This preparatory work is facilitated by a social worker and is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies. It is specific to the individual young person's needs. During the preparation for leaving care an aftercare worker is introduced to the young person. They are involved in the preparation for the leaving care process. Tusla prioritises children in residential care and short-term foster care for the early allocation of an aftercare worker. Children in long-term foster care with an allocated social worker have their aftercare plan developed with the social worker.
 Additional information not given the floor of the House. 
If their plan is to remain living with their foster carers, on a case-by-case basis, it may be considered best practice that they would be allocated an aftercare worker when they are in their 17th year. I believe this is a pragmatic approach which matches needs to available resources.  Children 16 and 17 years with an allocated aftercare worker at end December 2016:

The goal of aftercare was to introduce a statutory duty on Tusla to prepare an aftercare plan for young people. I have been spokesperson for children and youth affairs for 12 months and in those 12 months, I cannot say that I have been convinced that it is being delivered. I have to hand last year's Empowering People in Care, EPIC, report, which spoke about how young people do not get access to aftercare. We do not even collate the data and do not have a proper system for understanding who is being identified as needing these social care workers. There are huge gaps and anomalies. While I appreciate that Tusla is doing its best to organise planning, there is no connectivity between social care workers. Some young people might only meet for the first time the social care worker who is writing their aftercare plan. This sort of engagement is leading to children ending up on council housing waiting lists straight after leaving residential care.

I intend that this provision will be commenced with effect from 1 September 2017. I have secured the funding needed to recruit additional aftercare workers to enable Tusla to deliver this new commitment in full. In some situations, the child's social worker may continue in the role of an aftercare worker when the child reaches 18 years. My Department working to implement the changes that are needed. There is no doubt that improvements are needed and I intend to ensure that they happen.

When I hear about Youth Advocate Programmes, YAP, Ireland Ltd, the wonderful work it does and how it is trying to source funding for advocates, I wonder why we are not investing in the groups that are already there. Why do we not give funding to EPIC and YAP? We know there is a shortage of social care workers and that we are struggling to recruit them but we know we have good agencies that can work with and empower young people. We do not need to reinvent the wheel. What these organisations are looking for is funding. Why do we not get behind these organisations and give them the support they need? They are on the ground and know this system and how it works. The fact that we do not have the personnel to fill the posts shows that it is one thing giving funding but, regrettably, when we cannot hire the personnel, we are still left with the same problem so we are not moving forward and I have a huge concern about this.

We are supporting them. In terms of our statutory and legal responsibilities relating to children in care and in aftercare, I have been informed by Tusla that 18 aftercare managers will be recruited. Each manager will manage one of the 18 teams across the country. The composition of each team will be based on Tusla's analysis of the requirements of the area. For example, it may be appropriate, particularly in rural areas, to retain the social worker allocated when the young person was in care on the aftercare team. I know Tusla has given aftercare a high priority in respect of its business plan, which I have requested. Among the plans to improve outcomes in the area are the implementation of the national aftercare policy through area-based dedicated aftercare teams, as well as the continued roll out of a inter-agency aftercare steering committee in all areas, which will be there to work with and in collaboration with the groups identified by the Deputy.

This question regards the report on Oberstown juvenile detention centre, a matter which has been raised by many Deputies in the House and at committee meetings. The report is now substantially overdue. It was due to be published on 20 December 2016. I ask the Minister to make a statement on the status of the report.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	141	I understand the Deputy's question relates to the report on the operational review that was commissioned by the Oberstown board of management. It is one of a series of reports commissioned by Oberstown with the aim of improving services and ensuring good practice for the children and young people.  Four independent reviews have been commissioned by the Oberstown board of management, including the operational review and reviews of security, behaviour management and health and safety. The security and health and safety reviews have issued reports to the Oberstown board of management, while the behaviour management review is expected to report in the near future.  The operational review was a snapshot study undertaken within a particularly short timeframe and designed to help the campus to constructively move forward. I want to ensure that the report's recommendations are implemented as appropriate as soon as possible. The chair of the board has indicated to me that many of the recommendations have already been implemented, that they mirror recommendations from the other reports and are very much in keeping with the approach advocated by the board of Oberstown, national policy and my own views. An action plan adopted in January 2017 continues to drive improvements on the Oberstown campus. In considering the operational review report, it is important to guard against any potential legal risks and unintended consequences of publication. The board commissioned independent legal advice which it is currently considering. A decision on publication will be made as soon as possible.  To ensure full consideration of recommendations made in all of the reviews I have established an implementation group chaired by Professor Kilkelly with representation from Oberstown staff and management, my Department, the IMPACT trade union and a child development expert. The group is tasked with analysing the recommendations of each of the reviews with a view to their implementation while taking account of resource and policy implications. The implementation group regularly reports on progress to the board of management and to my Department.

Last Tuesday there was due to be a conference in Smock Alley on the future of Oberstown to which many Members were invited. That event was cancelled. I had expected that in that context and close to that date, the Minister might publish the independent review or at least make a statement on the matter. The Minister is correct that I am referring to the operational review. It would also be of value to be updated on the other reports.  The operational review was first due to be published on 20 December 2016. Next week, there will have been a six-month delay in its publication. That is not good enough. I understand that there are legal consequences and things that need to be taken into account. However, this was a matter of considerable public debate, concern and interest. Oberstown staff and management also have a considerable interest in the report. While there has been some progress, the Minister has not even given a ballpark timeframe for publication. She has said publication will be after legal advice has been considered and all issues have been dealt with. We need a sense of when the report will be published. It is already six months overdue.

The report and its recommendations have been produced. The implementation group which I put together is considering them in the context of the recommendations made by the two other reports which have been completed and the fourth report, which is expected in the near future.  The event to which the Deputy referred has been rescheduled and will take place on 29 May. At that stage there will be an opportunity to hear about the progress made and the implementation of the key recommendations of the various reviews that are promoting improvement in Oberstown. I hope that there will then be an opportunity to see the recommendations of the operational review.

This process cannot go on indefinitely. I ask the Minister, if she can, to give a more specific indication of when it will be published. The cessation from 30 March onward of the practice of putting persons under the age of 18, whether on remand or on committal, in adult prisons was a welcome development. It is a very welcome step. In the context of issues in regard to facilities and buildings in Oberstown, we need to know that everything is in place to allow that cessation to happen. Mercifully, the current number of detainees in Oberstown is lower than it was several months ago. It has fallen from the mid-30s to the mid-20s. If that number were to change and were there to be a full cohort of 17 year olds in the facility, all units would have to be open to ensure that the facility could work to the best of its ability. Can the Minister ensure that all units will be open as soon as possible and all required resources will be available to Oberstown to ensure that this additional cohort and all children in such a situation are kept and educated in Oberstown and that the facility is capable of doing so?

It is not my place to step into that process but I hope and expect that the board will soon make decisions on the report. It is in everyone's interest to await legal advice before proceeding. As the Deputy has indicated, there has been much positive news in regard to youth justice and Oberstown, such as the ending of the practice of children being sent to adult prisons. There is also a new bail supervision scheme that is contributing to the reduction in the number of detainees in Oberstown. It is difficult to say that this indicates a trend. There have been improvements to the units in Oberstown and an increase in its perimeter security. Part of the work of the implementation review group has to do with ensuring the required units will be put back in place in Oberstown. The number of detainees there is considerably lower than previously.

#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	147	I do not anticipate widespread increases in child care fees as a result of increases in subsidies this September. There is no evidence of plans to increase fee levels. Fees charged to parents are at the discretion of child care providers, who operate independently of the State. There are many factors that influence the fees charged, including a range of cost pressures and market forces. There are many reasons why a child care provider may raise its fees, in particular if child care fees have changed very little in recent years. While I do not expect a widespread increase in fees, my Department will actively monitor the trends over time. The policy paper on the affordable childcare scheme, ACS, which the Government approved last October examined the option of imposing price caps on child care providers to prevent the erosion of subsidies through fee inflation. The policy paper noted that among the potential benefits of price caps would be preventing fee inflation and providing certainty for and equity between parents. However, it also noted problems that might arise. The introduction of price caps would represent economic regulation of the market. That would raise legal and economic questions as to what constitutes a fair price for child care. The policy paper recommended that there should be no initial price cap but the option of price caps should be considered following the independent review of costs and an examination of the initial market response to higher subsidies. The independent review to be commissioned later this year will include an examination of variation in costs and fees. It will be a key input into any future consideration of the potential benefits and risks of introducing price caps.Estimates of take-up of the September 2017 measures suggest that up to 70,000 children will benefit from the improvements I am making. The fact that so many children will benefit from subsidies this September is a very positive development and represents a significant precursor to the affordable child care scheme when even more families will benefit. I am hopeful that the Bill on the affordable child care scheme will be published before the summer recess. I cannot guarantee this but we are working very hard to make this a reality before mid-July.

The reason I asked the question, in light of the fact the scheme would be in before September 2017 and the fact that people were led to believe what their entitlements might have been, is that there will be a gap between the qualifications for certain families. There are approximately 9,000 families more or less who will not qualify but who will get the subsidy. Fees are not publicly displayed and are quite hard to get. There is no databases as to what the standard is throughout the country for fees. Given that there is so much talk about the sector around wages and the difficulties of recruitment and retention of staff in the sector, this might have been seen as an opportunity by some employers or crèches to pass it on directly to staff. My concern is around the numbers of people who will not be receiving anything other than the 50 cent per hour. If the subsidy is passed on directly to the staff then the parents would have the shortfall, leaving them worse off than they would have been in the previous year.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	149	The Deputy highlights the point that not all families will receive subsidies. This, in itself, will be a factor that child care providers must take into account when setting their fees and in deciding to raise or not raise the fees. The Deputy spoke of the numbers of families who may not benefit right away in September because we will not have the full affordable child care scheme that we had hoped and intended to have by then. We are estimating that it is possible that up to 9,000 children and their families may not be eligible for some subsidy this September, but these are families who are really closest to the threshold of the affordable child care scheme. It is, however, an estimate because it is impacted by fees and whether or not families choose to engage in the use of child care providers who are registered so they can access the subsidies. It must be stressed that the potential number of children and families in this regard is an estimate and we cannot be more precise in advance. We will monitor that, as I have indicated, for any possible chance of increase in fees.

Will those parents then be in a position to get payments backdated if there was a difference in the fees during the year? They have been disenfranchised in the 12 months from 2017 to 2018. I know they will receive the universal level of subsidy, but it was announced in Budget 2016. Will the Minister say if it will be backdated? If they thought they were going to be treated equally it would be a comfort for the parents. The 9,000 families I speak of, and the Minister has hinted at this, are in the gap between those who have the medical card and those who have the GP visit card. Is there going to be any retrospective payback for these families?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	151	Most of those 9,000 families that may not benefit, and who we had anticipated could benefit, would have incomes that are near the maximum income threshold for the affordable child care scheme. They would have received low levels of subsidy under the affordable child care scheme. It is not possible to specify the precise income levels that may be affected as the means test for the GP visit card takes into account not just the family's income but also the amount the family spends on housing costs and child care costs and other expenses. Based on the HSE data on the typical family incomes of GP visit card holders it is estimated that on average this group may have received in the region of €12 per week subsidy. That is on the basis that they have full-time child care so it is not necessarily the case that everybody is going to lose that amount. What we will do in September 2017 is a massive improvement and a very big first step. I am not going to say "Never say never" to taking a look at the possibilities of the retrospective issue, but it is really important to accept and acknowledge that this is a huge leap forward and we are moving towards it. It is not just about getting the IT right: obviously we must pass the legislation also.

These are obviously very vulnerable children and there seems to be a real difficulty in meeting targets for recruitment of social workers. Perhaps the Minister could give an update on that situation.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	153	This is an important issue. It is a continuing priority of mine to address the problem of children in care who do not have an allocated social worker. I am informed by Tusla that 99% of children in residential care and 100% of children in special care have an allocated social worker. However, I am concerned to note that 7% of children in foster care do not have an allocated social worker. When social workers are being allocated, children recently received into care and those with mental health issues, a disability or challenging behaviour, are prioritised. Tusla is also focusing on intervening at an early stage of a family difficulty through social care and family supports. When a child who has not been allocated a social worker is placed in foster care, the placement is closely monitored and supported by the duty social work team. In addition, I have been informed that the child's foster family will be visited by a link social worker. This link worker will have oversight of the child's welfare until a social worker can be allocated. I place a high priority on addressing the number of children in care who are without an allocated social worker. I secured additional funding for this purpose in 2017, and Tusla is now in the second year of a three-year plan to ensure the allocation of a social worker to all children and young people who need one. The recruitment environment for social workers is very challenging. My Department will continue to monitor progress closely in this regard. I will continue to engage directly with the Tusla board and senior management team over the course of the year to review the progress being made in reducing the numbers of children in care who do not have an allocated social worker.

I note that we have been invited to the launch of Tusla's new child protection and welfare strategy on Monday week. I do not know if measures will be announced then. I believe they need to redouble their efforts. I do not know what methods they use to recruit social workers but I have made the point before that there are many people in the State who are qualified social workers but who do not work in social work. Some of these would be relatively mature people. There is a very big turnover of people, some very young, working in this very challenging area. I hope Tusla will look at other ways of recruiting. There is an article in today's media about the report of the independent national review panel in respect of children who died while in State care or who were known to social services. The chair of the panel, Helen Buckley, said "Some of these reviews reveal the level of pressure being experienced by social work departments due to increased reporting and shortages of staff." Clearly it is a real concern and I know it is a concern also for the Minister, but we need to see a sense of urgency about ensuring we have enough social workers in the system. They are dealing with really vulnerable children. I ask that the Minister draws this question to the attention of Tusla.

Of course I am aware of the national review panel report. It adds to the motivation and the need to ensure a redoubling of efforts in recruitment and retention. I am indicating that I also do not find it acceptable and I agree with the Deputy in this. In addition I acknowledge, and may have previously pointed out, the aspects of the actions Tusla is taking to recruit and retain staff.I may refer to some of those actions later in response to another question. It is important to recognise that all children in care are risk assessed. Those at the highest risk are allocated a social worker. We also have duty social work teams carrying out monitoring, as well as link social workers. It is not as if the children are without social workers. It is part of the effort to ensure the children who are in care without a specifically allocated social worker are not at risk in respect of their care.

However, we are talking about extremely vulnerable children. The targets would not exist if there were not an understanding that they are required. When people who work in this particularly stressful and difficult job are contending with understaffing, their work becomes more stressful. It becomes a vicious cycle in respect of being able to retain staff when they are dealing with such pressurised work along with inadequate staffing. I urge the Minister to consider whether there may be other ways of recruiting. The recruitment efforts may need to be rejuvenated in some way. We have to ensure we have an adequate number of social workers.

Relatively recently, I met the Irish Association of Social Workers, a professional organisation. I examined many of these issues and the suggestions it put forward. In respect of the ability to recruit, Tusla is implementing a national transfer policy. To assist retention and the attractiveness of Tusla as an employer, it has put in place a transfer mechanism to facilitate social workers wishing to relocate to another part of the country. If a post is offered for an area other than the one in which the person lives, the possibilities at regional level are being considered in order for him or her to take a post where he or she lives. Tusla is also providing continuing professional development according to the 2017 business plan, which expects to deliver more than 650 courses by the end of the year. There are efforts being made by Tusla in respect of retention as well as recruitment to support the children in care.

#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	159	A historical or retrospective disclosure is where an adult discloses abuse experienced in childhood. I understand that the overwhelming majority of such disclosures are about sexual abuse. Tusla has advised me that there were 1,895 historical and retrospective cases on hand at the end of March 2017. Tusla has also indicated that, included in these cases and during the first three months of this year, it received 354 reports from adults about past abuse. Of the cases on hand, 1,141 were allocated to a social worker and 754 were awaiting allocation. All these referrals have been reviewed by a social worker and 120 have been categorised as high priority. While this is a very complex and worrying situation, the safety of children now is my top priority. It is very important to point out that all child protection referrals which allege current or past criminal activity are referred to An Garda Síochána. Tusla's focus is to screen historical and retrospective disclosures for any indication of current risk to children. In cases of urgent need, the disclosure is acted on immediately. Tusla has a limited role where there is no evidence of a current risk to children. In respect of the adult making the disclosure, Tusla may assist him or her in accessing HSE counselling services. Tusla's policy in assessing risk relating to an adult about whom an allegation of sexual abuse has been made is strictly guided by the principles set out in the Barr judgment. In such cases, the person must be informed of the nature of the allegation and the identity of the person who is making the complaint. Tusla must adhere to the practice of due process and fair procedure. Tusla has put in place a service improvement plan, with experienced social workers dealing with the high priority cases. Medium and lower priority cases will be dealt with by social workers drawn from other services and provided with training and supervision. I have asked Tusla to report to me monthly on the progress it is making.

I, too, acknowledge that it is a very complex issue. Although I have a script in my hand, I feel compelled to depart from it. People do not realise the gravity of this matter. It is about what happens when a person makes a disclosure in adulthood about an incident that happened during childhood. The person has found the courage to come forward, yet we are saying it is a matter for An Garda Síochána and that Tusla has dealt with it fully in recording the disclosure. Having made that first step, the person has to come forward again to ask An Garda Síochána to take up the mantle. Although the person about whom the disclosure has been made could still be actively involved in the community, childminding, working in the local GAA club or whatever, Tusla has done its job, dotted its i's and crossed its t's, and sent the discloser on to the Garda. The discloser has been kicked back again and may lose his or her courage. We need to tighten up on the roles and responsibilities between Tusla and An Garda Síochána. There should be a bridging period in terms of people's age, for example, if somebody aged 18 or 19 has gone to college and sought independent counselling and support outside the family for the first time. We should be encouraging such people.

It is important to have ongoing collaboration between Tusla, An Garda Síochána and, in terms of counselling services, the HSE. My response focuses on the legal responsibility of Tusla in this regard and on identifying where there are other responsibilities there too. In her follow-up question, the Deputy suggested that the ways in which these responsibilities are defined may leave those who have taken the decision to contact a statutory agency and make a disclosure feeling that they may not get the proper supports and services. My understanding is that there is a process that people go through when contacting Tusla. They are supported in that regard. From Tusla's perspective, the most important thing is to identify whether there are any children currently at risk. Tusla also provides referrals where HSE counselling supports are required, as well as support for the person to go to An Garda Síochána. That is not to say that the systems are perfect. I am trying to indicate clearly what Tusla's responsibilities are.

Adult disclosure referrals are being categorised as low priority. I asked the chief executive of Tusla when he was before an Oireachtas committee recently how adult disclosures are categorised, and they are low priority. That set off alarm bells for me. I still think about the children who are at risk. We need a strategy that seeks to educate, create awareness and encourage adults who have experienced abuse to come forward and thereby reduce child sexual abuse. We also need to use the information to protect further generations of children and young people from abuse. This is one of the dark parts of our history. The Minister and I and all Members of the Oireachtas will be defined by how we address these matters. We must bring all agencies together to clear the retrospective and historical cases as quickly as possible. I have requested that we have a section within Tusla that is singularly responsible for retrospective cases in order that we can clear the backlog.

What I am trying to indicate is how to identify risk or possible risk to children and to protect them. Adults who request or who would benefit from counselling or other supports are directed to the HSE or other counselling bodies that support victims of abuse. I am keen to emphasise a point I indicated in my answer. If someone comes to Tusla and goes through that process, in keeping with the Barr judgment, Tusla is obliged to write to the person against whom the allegations have been made where there is sufficient information to do so. This is going to result in a large number of letters issuing around the same time from the end of quarter 2 or the beginning of quarter 3 in 2017. It is likely to raise public awareness. It is important the public and the media understand the process Tusla is obliged to follow in respect of writing those letters. The aim of the process is to balance the safety of children and fair process for a person against whom an allegation is made. My Department and Tusla will work together closely on a communications strategy to provide assurances on these matters relating to public information.

The Minister responded to a question from Deputy Rabbitte earlier with some statistics. In 2015, there were 720 people between 18 and 22 years of age receiving aftercare services. A total of 78% of these were in the 18 to 20 years age bracket. The requirement for an aftercare plan to be in place prior to leaving residential care is important. Is the Minister concerned about the deficiencies in this regard? What follow-up is there for people who seem to disengage and slip through the net? Between 2014 and 2017, the number of homeless people in the 18 to 24 years age group rose from 436 to 783. A total of 549 of these young adults were based in Dublin. Obviously, these are vulnerable children and young people. What additional resources will the Minister put forward?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	165	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 12 together. Every year, between 450 and 500 young people leave the care of the State. Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person leaving statutory care at 18 years of age to assist that person to make the transition to independent living. There has been widespread uptake of aftercare services by those leaving care. In 2016, a total of 1,806 persons aged 18 to 22 years were in receipt of aftercare supports from Tusla at the end of the fourth quarter. In 2015, the figure was 1,763, and in 2014, a total of 1,685 young adults, including those aged 23 and over, were in receipt of aftercare supports. Of the 605 young adults discharged from care on reaching 18 years of age during 2016, 581 or 96% were eligible for aftercare supports. Of these, 521 or 90% availed of the supports. Engagement with Tusla on aftercare is purely voluntary. Tusla has no power to oblige a young person to avail of the support. Tusla does not operate a policy of discharging young adults into homeless services. Of those in receipt of aftercare supports at the end of 2016, 9% were identified as being in other accommodation, including accommodation such as psychiatric services, disability services, mother and baby centres or even prison. The number of young adults in these services declined significantly in the 2014 to 2015 period, with a small increase in 2016. Tusla is in the process of updating an aftercare national audit. This will provide a more detailed picture of the outcomes for those leaving care in Ireland, including those identified as having complex needs that leave them at a heightened risk of homelessness.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	166	I welcome the information the Minister has given about Tusla carrying out a national audit. Does she believe it is time that aftercare was placed on a firmer basis, perhaps a statutory basis? The Tusla report shows that since 2010 almost 150 vulnerable young adults known to the service have died. It makes for sobering reading to realise the disconnect between the HSE and Tusla and the fate of these individuals. A total of 11% of the 149 were in care and a further 11% under 21 years of age had been in care until 18 years of age or were receiving aftercare services. The statistic is shocking. Let us consider some of the facilities available. I looked at the case management guidebook relating to youth services aftercare, youth services emergency accommodation and youth services transitional houses. The number of places available in many units is small. Lefroy House, for example, has only seven places. Chéad Chéim, an excellent housing project for 18 to 21 year olds, has only 14 places. Crosscare aftercare service for males between 16 and 21 years of age has only seven places. In particular, the service is vital for young adults with babies and young children who are still in care. Are there any aftercare housing placements for them? Are they deemed to have priority with local authorities?

The Deputy may be aware that, in addition to the aftercare planning and supports provided by Tusla, under the Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness plan, Tusla commits to ensuring young people leaving State care who are at risk of homelessness are identified and catered for through appropriate housing and other supports. Funding is now in place under the capital assistance scheme to enable approved housing bodies to acquire residential units to accommodate young people exiting State care. This arrangement was recommended to me by Peter McVerry when we were preparing for this plan. Eventually, we got it into the plan and now we are working with the chief executive of the Peter McVerry Trust, Pat Doyle, and others to develop with Tusla principles and criteria relating to funding proposals for that kind of housing. Where accommodation is provided under the capital assistance scheme, Tusla will provide additional independent living supports, in particular for the most vulnerable care leavers, whom Deputy Broughan has referenced, in accordance with the pre-agreed aftercare plan of the individual.

I am referring to Question No. 1438 relating to children in foster care. The figures did not seem to add up. A total of 132 children were missing based on how we added up the figures. Will the Minister get her officials to check that? My final question relates to separated children seeking asylum in State care who have completed the leaving certificate but who are unable to apply for a Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant due to not having full legal status. To qualify for a SUSI grant, it is necessary to have legal status and to satisfy the requirements for habitual residency. Surely, as part of an aftercare plan, social workers and the Department of Justice and Equality should prioritise the securing of legal status for these young adults. The figures I have received show that nine young adults turned 18 years of age, sat the leaving certificate and were receiving aftercare support. Surely, this is something that we can address urgently.

My personal commitment is that it is so important to be able to deliver. I appreciate the point. I recognise Deputy Broughan has made his comments on aftercare within the context of that particular cohort of young people. In light of his comments, I will reflect on the matter and engage with other Ministers, including those with responsibility for education and justice and equality. I am keen for that group of young people to be able to avail of educational opportunities in the same way the Deputy or anyone else can.

The funding in recent years has diminished. I am not in any way blaming the Minister for that. However, it has resulted in new entrants not being able to gain access to a range of these programmes. What plans does the Minister have to expand the programme over the coming years?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	171	I am pleased to say that we are now funding a number of new projects as well as existing ones. This past year, since I became Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is the first in over a decade in which new projects are being funded. Funding for youth services had decreased, as the Deputy indicated, by €10.4 million between 2011 and 2015. In recent weeks, I approved €500,000 in funding for the establishment of new youth projects and €300,000 for the augmentation of a small number of existing youth services to meet new challenges arising from population increases. This additional investment will be provided in regions where there is a pressing need for services to meet the needs of young people. I hope to announce details of the new and augmented projects in the coming months. During 2016 and again in 2017, my Department provided funding for the commencement of five new youth projects in south east Cavan, west Wicklow, Drogheda, County Louth, Cahir and in the Fethard-Killenaule area of County Tipperary. In 2017, I secured funding of €57.4 million for various youth schemes, representing an increase of €5.5 million on the funding available in 2016. The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. As the Deputy is probably aware, a review in 2014 made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department. Consultations with youth services are ongoing in order that we can introduce the new youth funding programme over the next two to three years in line with the review. As part of this process, the 16 education and training boards assisted with the mapping of youth service provision across the State. This mapping exercise is helping us to build up a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels, with existing youth services mapped onto the data. It is really important that services match need.

While I welcome it, I also wish to voice a note of caution. My particular area of concern in this question - I am not diminishing the importance of other areas of youth affairs - relates, in particular, to preventative programmes. The Minister and I both represent areas of significant disadvantage. We know that young people in those areas are at greater risk of drug addiction and associated problems. The point I am making is that we need to channel significant resources into those areas in order to afford opportunities to those people. Perhaps there are not many votes in it - it is not a very popular matter and there is not a loud lobby in respect of it - but the Minister and I know that it is the right thing to do. My hope is that a disproportionate amount of the funding that becomes available will be used in a targeted way. I acknowledge the reports that were compiled in the context of value for money and assessing the value of the projects. I do not want to see projects just being funded; I want projects that are delivering results on the ground and benefiting communities and that can be stood over to be funded. However, I believe that we have a significant catch-up from the previous number of years, during which, unfortunately, there was no additional funding and no additional projects.

To emphasise a couple of matters, the mapping exercise is critical in terms of ensuring that we are able to meet the needs of young people throughout the country in an equitable way because there are gaps. The exercise has highlighted areas throughout Ireland - particularly rural areas - with little or no youth service provision. It is my intention that any additional funding received will be used, in part, to address those service shortfalls. I do not envisage funding being diverted from projects addressing children's needs that are currently in receipt of targeted funding for this purpose. On the second issue the Deputy raised, that is absolutely the case. When I speak about services needing to match need, that mapping exercise is taking account not only of the population in the areas in question but also of the socio-demographic issues that exist there.

The programme for Government contains a commitment to giving vulnerable young people a better chance in life. The Minister spoke about the preventative programmes and so forth. The other morning I asked the Taoiseach about drug task force funding, which has not been increased in four years. He made reference to the fact that not all programmes might be as good as each other. Again, I wish to make quite clear that I do not want to see programmes being funded for the sake of it but rather for the outcomes to which they give rise. There is a responsibility in terms of monitoring. That does not fall within the Minister's remit but she does sit at Cabinet. Whether it is the young people's facilities and services fund, other youth funding or drug task force funding that is used for preventative projects, they all aim to have the same outcomes. As the next round of the budgetary process is entered into, I urge the Minister to ensure that an overview of the various streams of funding which provide preventative funding, particularly, although not exclusively, for at-risk young people in disadvantaged areas will receive a level of priority.

As requested, I will bring them into my own deliberations and debate at Cabinet and across Departments. I am absolutely committed to funding only those services that have indicated and identified their effectiveness in the provision they offer and where there is an outcome focus. We look at various ways to determine and define outcomes. These concern not only the outcomes for the individual children and young people but also the way in which the services build the community and enable parents and families to engage. I accept and understand that, whether it is in the context of drugs task forces, preventative strategies in terms of early years or youth funding for disadvantaged youth, it all needs to be considered as a whole in order to ensure, with an outcome focus, that we get better results for our children and young people.

It is an issue that has been raised on a regular basis. It relates to the coverage of social workers. It is also particularly worth commenting on not only the levels of recruitment but also the issue of retention which I think is something of a difficulty for Tusla.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	177	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 32 together. The most recent recruitment and staff data from Tusla is for February and March 2017. At the end of February, Tusla had recruited 56 new social workers and this equates to a net increase of 28 whole-time equivalent social workers in March when attrition and flexible working arrangements are taken into account. To date, Tusla is on track to achieve its recruitment target of 62 additional social workers, which will require a gross recruitment of 180 social workers in 2017 to take account of normal attrition rates. In the context of retention, in the 12 months to February 2017, Tusla had a social work turnover rate of 8.4%. This compares favourably with other jurisdictions such as England where the 2016 turnover rate was approximately 15%. Tusla’s 2017 business plan identifies activities to improve retention and build on initiatives commenced in 2016 such as the introduction of Tusla’s national transfer policy, to which I have already referred, and the implementation of Tusla’s continuing professional development strategy. In addition, the introduction of senior social worker practitioner posts designated to social work teams around the country will further assist with retention by providing enhanced professional support to social work staff.Tusla Recruit will undertake a recruitment drive during 2017 to assist with the implementation of this initiative. Recruitment of social workers is challenging, with only 200 to 250 graduating per year in a very competitive labour market. I am therefore mindful of the need to link recruitment with decisions on Tusla's operational side to effect improvements. As part of my regular engagement with the board, I have requested that the agency provide an assessment of recruitment for the remainder of 2017 linked to specific targets to reduce the number of children awaiting allocation of a dedicated social worker.

The UK is starting from a much higher threshold in any event but it is also a place where the Tory Government is absolutely demolishing local authorities. Consequently, social services and social workers are among the first on the front line. To be performing favourably in comparison to Britain is, therefore, not a great claim. The inadequate number of social workers has been a matter for discussion for quite some time, and I do not believe that the retention figures are particularly favourable. My figures show that, on average, 150 social workers per year are being lost, which is quite a high rate of attrition, that the net increase for 2016 was a mere 56 and that the projected net gain for social workers for this year is 62. These are very high numbers. The national review panel has been in the news in recent days. A case where a young person died by suicide was one of the high-priority unallocated cases, and a number of other cases reported upon highlighted related gaps and weaknesses. We are clearly very far behind where we should be. There are three times as many social workers to support children in the North than in the South. If the current attrition rates continue, it will be very difficult to achieve the targets Tusla is aiming for.

In addition to what I have already said, I have provided Tusla with the necessary funding to recruit additional staff in 2017 - an increase of €37 million in 2017 alone - building on significant funding increases in previous years. In addition to what I have already said about my efforts to work with Tusla to ensure recruitment and retention, I formally meet the chair and the board of Tusla each quarter. After my most recent meeting with the chair in April, I took the opportunity to write to her to reiterate my concerns about the issues of unallocated cases and recruitment and the correlation between them. I am very mindful of the need for Tusla to closely link its recruitment programme with operational decisions and I have requested Tusla to provide me with a current assessment of planned recruitment to year end. In addition, I have requested that Tusla develop a robust workforce plan that addresses succession planning, retention, career pathways, training and development, future workforce needs, priority gaps and a strategy for tackling the priority gaps and reducing unallocated cases. In that context, I will meet with Tusla again on 18 May to discuss unallocated cases and recruitment plans.

It is becoming increasingly clear that it is not simply a question of funding, although funding is crucial. The difficulty in retention seems, in large part, to be due to the fact not only that the work is traumatic, difficult and challenging, but also that social workers are dealing with extraordinary caseloads and that the related stress is making it very difficult to retain social workers. Therefore, imaginative solutions will be required. However, perhaps there is an element of Tusla's own management and support for the social workers needing to be improved. My understanding is that the plans to introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse and neglect have been delayed until later this year, which is, I believe, a year later than initially planned. Is this simply due to the difficulty in retaining social workers and having adequate resources, or is there a change in policy? Is the Government still committed to implementing the policy?

The independent review panel also pointed to a gulf between health services and social work teams as being an issue. Obviously, many of these young people will have mental health issues and other issues, which is an important element as well. Will the Minister engage with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and others in the Department of Health in this regard?

We successfully negotiated a protocol of working together with the HSE and Tusla on disability services and this is what the group that gathered to do that is doing and focusing on now. To respond to Deputy Ó Laoghaire, it is clearly not just a matter of money - I acknowledge that. I am just pointing out, though, that I did get the money and the money is there. We do need imaginative solutions, as Deputy Ó Laoghaire said. For example, I referred already to the fact approximately 215 social workers graduate each year. That is the context in which we are working. I appreciate that it is challenging, and Tusla of course is competing with the rest of the pool, but I intend personally to consult with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, to explore options for increasing the supply of graduates. My officials are discussing with the Higher Education Authority and Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, how to increase the supply of social workers in a sustainable manner once Tusla's workforce plan and priority gaps are identified. Some of these solutions are not immediate but we are trying to put in place, looking forward to the medium term and even the long term, that educational element in particular so that we can begin to increase the number of social workers to the levels required and sustain that number.

This honours a key commitment in the programme for Government. I am putting in place measures to ensure that parents of up to 70,000 children due to benefit under the affordable child care scheme will be given the opportunity to avail of increased subsidies from September. This will be achieved by significantly increasing the subsidy rates for the community child care subvention and the training and employment child care schemes, in some instances by as much as 50%. There will also be a new universal, non-means-tested child care subsidy that will benefit parents with children between the ages of six months and 36 months. These measures mean that the families of up to 70,000 children can look forward to benefiting from increased child care subsidies starting from this September. There will be a public information campaign late in May for parents and providers and a new website outlining the measures being introduced in September will launch shortly. I remain strongly committed to introducing the promised affordable child care scheme. My Department has made good progress in this regard. The Government has approved the heads of Bill for the scheme, and officials are working intensively to plan for the successful implementation of the scheme. However, I am conscious that this is a complex project which we must get right from the beginning. We need to have the legislation, business processes and a new robust IT system in place. We will need to test the scheme rigorously to ensure it works properly so that families can quickly see their entitlements. I have already referred to the fact that I am hopeful that the Bill on the affordable child care scheme will be published before the summer recess. I cannot guarantee this but the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and my Department are working very hard to make it a reality before mid-July. My officials are working as quickly as possible but I believe it is prudent to take time to ensure we get the new systems right so that they operate smoothly for everyone.

I am concerned that the information technology system will cause a delay in payments under the scheme. While I have no doubt the Minister is making every effort to achieve her objective of commencing these necessary measures by September, it appears that a further malfunction in the IT system will mean the new scheme will not start operating in September. This scheme is important for community child care programmes. While I accept the Minister's point regarding the Bill and having certain measures in place by September, it is time to consider plan B. I welcome the decision to have an independent review but it appears that it will not commence until late in 2017. Why can the review not commence now? Figures show that the cost of child care is very high. Families in Ireland spend 34% of their income on child care, which is double the European average. It is very important that the scheme is up and running as quickly as possible.

From 2017, the majority of eligible families will benefit from significantly increased subsidisation of child care costs. From September, the promise of a subsidy for children under the age of 36 months will be kept. Families with one or more children under the age of three years who wish to use regulated child care services will be able to avail of a universal subsidy of up to €1,000 per annum. We are also introducing targeted measures of support which significantly increase the subsidy available towards the costs of child care. This subsidy will almost reach the level of the threshold of income that we identified originally in respect of the affordable child care scheme. However, the scheme will be accessed by parents and families a little differently from the way in which we had anticipated. The money is available, however, and parents will be able to avail of significantly increased State support for child care. The Department will roll out an information campaign on how to access the scheme.

As she is aware, community employment workers play a major role in running child care facilities in urban and rural areas. While I understand from where the Minister is coming, there should be a role in the system for community employment workers. Will the Department introduce a training scheme to enable these staff to continue to work in community child care facilities? This issue will create a major problem and must be addressed. Community employment workers fit into child care services very well and work well in them. Will the Minister consider ways of using these community employment workers?

The Department has put in place a number of actions and supports for particular services that are finding their sustainability challenged. I hope these supports, which will be available in 2017 and 2018, will effectively assist all the services as they engage with departmental officials and the county and city child care committees. I fully support community employment workers. They could continue to work in their current roles in child care services in the context of the supports we are providing. I am engaged in ongoing discussions with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, on community employment in child care.

The recent decision to preclude community employment workers from being considered part of the child-staff ratio has placed a major financial burden on community child care services. I tabled the question to give the Minister an opportunity to explain how the Department will alleviate the financial crisis being experienced by many community facilities.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	191	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 20 and 21 together. Community child care facilities are important partners in the delivery of affordable, accessible and high-quality child care. The majority of community child care services are operating well and have been able to manage issues they face within the structures available, including by availing of support from county and city child care committees, Pobal and my Department. Nevertheless, I have implemented a number of substantial measures in the past year to assist these services. Most recently, I announced a substantial increase and expansion of the community child care subvention programme from September 2017, which will provide significant additional funding to families and services. In addition, strand 2 of the 2017 early years capital programme, which closed for application on Friday, 5 May, made €500,000 available in grants of up to €20,000 to community services which are seeking to make building improvements or undertake maintenance or refurbishment. These applications are being assessed and I anticipate recommendations on funding in the coming weeks. I have also taken steps to provide payment to community services for non-contact time for the first time. This will be available during the summer. A total of €14.5 million is available across community and private services. The Deputies will be aware of the challenges faced by a small number of community services which have been facilitating the training of community employment participants. Deputy Eugene Murphy raised this issue in an earlier question. I made €1 million in funding available to services that identified as having difficulties in this regard. The funding will ensure regulatory changes do not hinder service delivery or the availability of child care places. I will also consider how this funding can best be deployed in 2018 to address the most urgent challenges facing child care services. In the longer term, the independent review of the cost of quality child care will also assist in addressing these issues. My priority is to ensure we provide access to high quality and affordable child care.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	192	All Deputies accept the need for quality child care and minimum qualifications - that is a given. The Minister must accept that most community employment workers who commence work in child care services are taking part in training programmes under which they attain a level 5 qualification after the first year and a level 6 qualification after the second year. Earlier today, I spoke to a lady who runs the community child care service in Ballymahon, County Longford. Two community employment workers will finish work in the service tomorrow because it does not have enough money to retain them. These staff, one of whom has a level 5 qualification and the other a level 6 qualification, have been an integral and crucial part of the service's ratio. The €1 million in additional funding provided by the Minister is simply not good enough. In 2016, child care facilities employed 1,816 community employment workers.Assuming that most of those were working on at least a half-time basis, they would need to be paid for 20 hours per week 52 weeks per year. That is €16 million, but the Minister is only making €1 million available to replace community employment workers. I welcome the capital investment, but that will not solve the staffing ratio problem.

The Department, Pobal and county and city child care committees are working intensely with these community services and engaging directly with any that are impacted negatively by the change in ratios. Moneys are being made available in 2017 to ensure the sustainability of services. We will consider how to continue doing so for 2018. In addition, it is anticipated that significant income streams for those services and others will increase thanks to the increase in money for the targeted child care scheme, which will begin this year. We have asked every service that believes it has to close because of the change in ratios as regards community employment workers to engage with us directly. We are hiring financial analysts to work with these services, examine their costs and business models and find individual ways to prevent them from having to close.

Many community crèches are held together on a shoestring and by sellotape and are living on the lifeline presented by the introduction of the affordable child care scheme. With the removal of community employment workers, who played an integral part in child care, many community crèches are facing closure. Giving them financial advice could be too late for some. They must address the question of whether they will be able to open their doors in September. The community child care sector is on its knees. What intervention can we make to resuscitate it?

In the audio-visual, AV, room yesterday afternoon, I chaired a meeting with some providers from Cork, Dublin Central and Ronanstown as well as a group that provided community care in a number of other areas in Dublin. They all said the same thing, namely, they were dealing with children with acute special needs who came from dysfunctional families, children from new communities who did not have English as their first language and children from families with addiction issues. No one disagrees with the need for high-quality training, but the issue with the community employment changes is that providers do not have the staff to continue some of their services. What is being cut the most are their baby hours. We know the importance of early intervention. Could there be a grandfather clause in respect of community employment workers until they have received training and can be kept on and is there a need to consider a DEIS-type status for community child care providers that work with the most vulnerable marginalised communities?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	197	I want to be perfectly clear. I understand what the Deputies are saying and I understand the concerns and realities facing community child care. I have been identifying a number of actions, which the Department and county and city child care committees have taken. They are engaging. These actions are not enough, though, and we are considering additional actions. I have identified some. I understand what the issues are and have engaged on them. Deputy Rabbitte stated that many services are about to close, but my understanding from my Department, which has been engaging with various services, is that many of them are doing okay. This is based on my evidence. If the Deputies know of services that they want the Department to start engaging with, they should please let me know. I have direct engagement with many groups in Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's constituency. Last week, they suggested the notion of a DEIS model for early years education and care. It is an innovative idea and we are discussing it, but it is more of a medium-term solution. I understand from where it is coming. From my Department's perspective, our money for child care is for child care. In disadvantaged communities, additional and special needs are being met by these community facilities without being given resources by the Department that gives money for child care. They are to be commended on that. This provides us with the data on which new models can be developed. If the Deputies are aware of crèches or community services that are not being engaged with regarding their sustainability issues, let me know.

Does the Minister accept that there must be a minimum ratio of adults to children in all services? Given the current number of children involved, community employment workers form part of that ratio. The Minister says that a service that takes in additional children in September because of the extension in free preschool years will get more resources, but those additional children will warrant the recruitment of extra staff, which means that the resources will not pay for current staff. The €2,000 that is being given to certain services is not adequate. The €1 million pot is not adequate. At one stage, nine community employment workers formed part of Ballymahon's ratio. That number has dwindled month by month and the service is struggling. The Minister needs to revisit this matter with a view towards putting additional resources in the pot.

One of the great services that community crèches provide is the baby room, but it is the largest cost in the community sector. The baby room ratio is 3:1. For every three babies, there is one worker. If six babies are in the room, perhaps a community employment worker could be brought in to facilitate the service. Could community employment workers in kitchens or receptions help out during tea breaks or lunch breaks? Working with Tusla and the Department, is there any capacity to be innovative in how we support these services? Even if there is no budget, there must be ways to handle the ratio. The 3:1 would have to stay, but we should use people during tea breaks and lunch breaks or when staff are out sick or on annual leave. There should be a tolerance level in the ratio of staff in respect of community employment workers.

Two of those who spoke at yesterday's meeting - one is from my constituency - discussed the anti-social behaviour and criminality that these young children see every day.In fact, there was a murder outside a particular crèche some months ago - that is the reality. The staff are working very hard. They made the point yesterday that there is so much research already, both domestic and international, that everybody knows what has to be done. However, with the funding issue, some stated they are being asked to come up with a sustainability plan but the only plan they can come up with is to cut services in order to be able to keep some part of their service going. It is important that four members of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs were present yesterday. It would be important that these people come before the committee and that something is prepared for the Minister as soon as possible.

While the €1 million was welcome, in many ways not much has changed. Many of the points have already been made, for example, on the issue of the crossover regarding those aged one to three years. I want to ask a very specific question. The services have drawn down a first tranche from the €1 million but that was only for advertisement and recruitment. To my knowledge, the vast majority of services have still not received money in order to be able to recruit people. The money in question is just for this year - just to keep the wolf from the door - but there is nothing in respect of the longer term issue. The services are borrowing and trying to find whatever way they can to keep their service going, and they are barely managing. They absolutely need to have that second tranche drawn down immediately. Otherwise, we will see, if not the closure of full services, then, at least in Cork, the closure of baby rooms and rooms for those aged from one to three years. The longer term issue is still outstanding but we need a commitment as to when that second tranche of funding from the €1 million will be paid.

That helps me in my job in regard to this issue, so I thank Deputies for that. Second, if I heard Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan correctly, she suggested that the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs may take this up as an issue and bring some suggestions or recommendations to me. I think that is a great suggestion and it would again provide some assistance. I have outlined the actions that are currently being taken. I hear from the Deputies' perspective that this is not sufficient, which I acknowledge. I would also like to see more done and I accept that it is difficult to wait for the money. My understanding is that they are working as quickly as possible in terms of getting that drawn down. I will give the Deputies a commitment to find out exactly when that is, just to be precise about that. That is all I will say for now. Some actions have been taken, although they are not sufficient from the Deputies' perspective. Perhaps some more analysis needs to be done and, clearly, more resources are needed, which I accept.

It is very disappointing that the Minister of State, Deputy English, who has direct responsibility, is not here to take the matter and to account for his handling of the issue to which it relates. The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, can update us as to why he is not here. I can only assume it is because he does not want to have to account for how this has been dealt with and delayed. To summarise, there has been an ongoing issue for a number of years in Donegal whereby houses have been affected by defective blocks containing high levels of mica. As a result, the walls of houses across Donegal have been deteriorating to varying degrees. In some cases, it has gone to the extent that houses are no longer habitable and will have to be demolished. In the vast majority of cases, it is the outer leaf of the two walls that is affected by cracking and it has not gone to the inside. Time is of the essence, however, because homes are deteriorating and the pressure and stress on families is immense, as one can imagine. Unfortunately, at every stage of this process, the Government has had to be pulled and dragged in order to get it involved to deal with the issue and to assist those families involved. Finally, after much lobbying, the Government announced in November 2015 that it was going to establish an expert panel to examine the issue and come back with recommendations as to what the remedies might be. The terms of reference for that panel, announced in November 2015, indicated that the conclusion of the report was to be finalised by 31 May 2016 - that is last year, not 31 May 2017, which is just two weeks away, so we are almost a year past the reporting date announced by the Government. Naturally, the Government announced this three months before the general election but, after that, it dragged its heels once more. It did not appoint a chairman of that expert panel until February. It then announced the report would not be published until the summer. The report was delayed until October and we were then told that it would not be available until Christmas. In February it was finally submitted to the Government. For the past two to three months we have been told it is with the Attorney General but there is no sign of it being published. Meanwhile, homeowners across County Donegal and in parts of Mayo are waiting to discover the results and recommendations of that expert panel. That panel comprised engineers and people from different disciplines. Those individuals met homeowners, examined houses and also took scientific advice as to what exactly was the dynamic which was causing these blocks to be defective, and what the possible solutions would be. Homeowners are waiting to see what that expert panel decides and what the remedies might be before they take action. Once this report is published and assessed, the next issue will be to move on to a redress scheme to assist homeowners to provide remedies. It is clear that families will not be able to afford the type of repairs which are required. Unfortunately, the Government has been found wanting at all stages and has delayed and dithered. It is time for the dithering to stop and for the report to be published. It is with the Government and the families are looking forward to seeing it. Can the Minister of State indicate that it will be published and give us a commitment that this will be done immediately?

I will read the reply, although I am sure Deputy McConalogue knows most of the details, and I will then take questions. I will take this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney. At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the very difficult and distressing situation that certain homeowners in Donegal and Mayo are facing on account of damage to the structural integrity of their homes. It is the Minister's firm belief that the parties responsible for poor workmanship, the supply of defective materials or both should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners. An expert panel on concrete blocks was established by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in April 2016 to investigate the problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in Donegal and Mayo. The membership of the expert panel on concrete blocks was formally announced on 6 April 2016, following the appointment of the chairperson, Mr. Denis McCarthy, on 1 February 2016.The panel has the following terms of reference: to identify, in so far as it is possible, the number of private dwellings which appear to be affected by defects in the block work in the counties of Donegal and Mayo; to carry out a desktop study, which would include a consultation process with affected home owners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, testing laboratories, industry stakeholders and other relevant parties, to establish the nature of the problem in the affected dwellings; to outline a range of technical options for remediation and the means by which those technical options could be applied; and to submit a report within six months. The expert panel on concrete blocks met on 12 occasions since it was first established and a similar number of meetings have taken place with key stakeholders, including affected home owners, the elected members of Donegal County Council and Mayo County Council, local authority officials, industry bodies, academics, public representatives and other interested parties. A substantial volume of information has been provided by affected home owners in both counties, as well as from Donegal County Council and Mayo County Council. Additional information was also provided through the consultation process. The panel has now concluded its meetings and is in the process of finalising its report which is undergoing legal proofing, which I anticipate will be completed shortly. In this regard, the Minister will await the outcome of the panel's report before considering what further actions may be required to assist the parties directly involved in reaching a satisfactory resolution to the problems that have emerged in the two counties. I am sure the Deputy will tell me he knows all that. I will refer to some of his statement when he concludes.

She is correct that I am going to come back and say I know all that. There is no new information there. I have asked parliamentary questions consistently, both on the floor of the Dáil and for written answer, to the Minister for the past number of years, but in particular in regard to the conclusion of this report in the past number of months. Recent replies I have got have been exactly the same with no change in the position. It is the same today. As I said, the Government has been ducking and diving on this issue. Unfortunately, the Minister seems to be ducking and diving in terms of accounting for it here today. The commitment, when this was announced in November 2015 some three months before the general election, was that the report would be finished by 31 May last year. It is almost 31 May one year later and there is still no report. This report is completed and it is on the Minister's desk. He does not need to obfuscate or indicate that somehow he does not have it and that it is undergoing legal proofing, because we have been told in oral responses here previously that he has it and that he has referred it to the Attorney General. It is more ducking and diving, instead of generating a sense of urgency on this and publishing the report. Families cannot wait on it. They have been expecting it for a long time. They cannot get their own expert advice, with each talking individually to scientists about the issue and to engineers about the solution. It is up to the expert panel to collate that. The panel has been charged with that work. Its final result is the report which everyone, including the families themselves and the Members of the Dáil, needs to consider. Subsequently, we must determine what supports, remedies and schemes need to be put in place to provide financial assistance to families, which will be a job of work. Much work will need to be done to address and remedy these family homes. Will the Minister of State go back to the Minister of State, Deputy English, and tell him to get a move on, stop ducking and diving on this, and publish this report?

All I can give the Deputy is the information I have been given. When speaking to the Department before I came in here, because I anticipated the Deputy's reaction to the reply, I was told that the report is still with the Attorney General, the Minister hopes to receive it in the next couple of weeks and then it will be outlined to Members, the local authorities and, in particular, to the homeowners. I will bring back to the Minister the Deputy's concerns and, above all, frustration. Being honest with the Deputy, if I was receiving this reply I would be as frustrated as he is. I can only relay to the Deputy what I have been told by the Department and in the reply. I will follow it up for the Deputy and I will make sure that gets his answer. However, my information from the Department is that the Minister has not received the final document. It is with the Attorney General because many issues were raised during the consultation process and in meeting owners of these houses. All I can give the Deputy is the information I have but I will come back to him or ask the Minister to come back to him regarding when the document will be finally published, if that is to the Deputy's liking.

It confirms that the Minister's rent pressure zones simply are not working. Average rents are up 13% across the State to approximately €1,131 per month. Rents in Louth are up an astonishing 18%. In Dublin city, Kilkenny and Laois, they are up 16%; in Longford, 15%; and in Donegal and Galway, 14%. In my own constituency, Dublin Mid-West, in Clondalkin and Lucan, new rents are now at €1,800 per month. That is a staggering €21,000 a year in rent. The situation outside the rent pressure zones is even worse. Thanks to the Minister's badly designed rental scheme, we now have a two-tier rental market. My view is this is the Minister's fault. He set his face against real rent certainty last year on four separate occasions. He opposed the Focus Ireland amendment to the Planning and Development Bill that would have kept renting families in their homes and rental properties in the market. He continues to push more and more families who should be in social housing into HAP, increasing demand on the private rental sector, and he continues to drag his heels on the urgent need to regulate Airbnb properties, despite Dublin having over 6,500 short-term lets but only 1,200 rental properties. Light-touch regulation does not work. The time has come for Government to urgently review its failing rental market strategy and to put in place measures that will give landlords and tenants the security and stability they so desperately need. While the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will not be able to answer those questions today, I urge her to bring those thoughts back to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, and impress on them the need for serious change to give struggling renters a real break.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	211	This week's daft.ie report highlights yet again the extreme problems in the private rental sector. It is a shark pool out there. County Laois experienced the second highest increase in rents in the past year. At 16.6% in the past 12 months, the average rent is now €769 per month. The housing assistance payment - this has been the centrepiece of the Government's social housing policy - limit for a family of four, two adults and two children, is €610 per month and rents are €159 over the limit for HAP. In the case of south Kildare, in particular, Monasterevin, rent increases are at 13.8% and rents are on average €1,131, although the HAP limit is €835 per month. If one is in need of housing assistance, one cannot get on HAP because the limit is €300 below the level of rents. In the case of Laois, rents are €769 per month, which means they are €159 over what one is allowed in housing assistance. That is putting people under huge pressure. It is making people homeless. People who are in need of HAP cannot get it in either Laois or Monasterevin. Workers on low pay who are not getting housing assistance are now finding themselves paying over half their wages in rent. I am coming across cases like that. Families are severely stressed. It is a situation similar to what is happening to those who are in mortgage distress. Their heads are fried with trying to meet high weekly rents. Over half their wages is going on rent alone. We have a huge problem here. The Government's sham rent controls are not working for tenants but they are working for landlords. Will the Government ensure that the Department introduces proper, fair and sensible rent controls?
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	212	I apologise to both Deputies on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I thank them for raising this important issue. There are acute pressures in the rental market. Those pressures are driven by a number of factors including rising demand as a result of the economic recovery, a lack of supply and the high costs that highly indebted landlords face in servicing their loans. Those pressures are borne out by the data published by daft.ie this week. Its report shows that rent asking prices rose nationwide by an average 13.4% in the year to March 2017. In Dublin rents increased by 13.9%, while rents outside Dublin increased by 12.7%. However, the report also shows that rent inflation has slowed over the last quarter. The rate of increase in Dublin rent prices between quarter 4 of 2016 and quarter 1 of 2017 was significantly slower than the rate of increase over the year. The annual inflation figure of 13.9% implies an average quarterly inflation of 3.5%. However, the quarterly inflation registered in quarter 1 of 2017 was less than half of that - with south county Dublin at 0.7%, west county at 1.4%, north county at 1.6%, north city at 1.5%, city centre at 2.1% and south city at 1.4%. However, the increases are placing huge pressures on tenants, particularly those who are seeking new accommodation. There is no doubt that the problems in the rental sector are part of the very significant challenges in the housing sector. The problems caused by high rents reflect, and are reflected in, the other issues facing the housing market, namely, not enough homes for first-time buyers, increased demand for social housing and unacceptable levels of homelessness. While many factors contribute to the problems, the one factor common to all of them is the chronic lack of supply of new houses. That is borne out by the daft.ie figures on supply which reports that there were fewer than 3,100 homes available to rent nationwide on 1 May, down from almost 4,000 just three months previously. With just over 1,000 of those in Dublin, this is the lowest figure recorded since the series began in 2006. The best way to reduce and stabilise rents in the long term, and benefit the entire sector, is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rented sectors. Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, aims to increase and accelerate housing delivery across all tenures to help individuals and families meet their housing needs. Together with the strategy for the rental sector it sets out more than 100 actions the Government is taking through new policy, new legislation and innovative measures to achieve that aim. Supply measures include the use of publicly owned sites and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is engaging actively with local authorities in rent pressure zones to use publicly owned sites to kick-start supply. By way of example in this regard, Dublin City Council has brought forward a land initiative project covering three sites, at O'Devaney Gardens, Oscar Traynor Road and St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore, with which I am familiar, and is seeking partners to deliver a mix of social, affordable and private housing. The Department is also supporting more build-to-rent development through pathfinder sites to help ensure a more supportive regulatory approach. In February, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, launched major infrastructure works on the Cherrywood site in Dublin costing €35 million, a first step towards the delivery of more than 1,300 new build-to-rent homes, which will start later this year. The repair and lease scheme, under which local authorities will refurbish vacant properties and lease them from their owners, was rolled out nationwide in February, to bring vacant properties back into use. That will deliver 3,500 properties by 2021 at a cost of €150 million. Funding this year will cover getting 800 dwellings back into use for families on the social housing list.

Homelessness for adults, children and families is up 20% and homelessness has increased every month since he has taken office. We have seen continual increases in rent and in terms of supply the snail's pace of social housing delivery and private home delivery is there for all to see, despite the fact the Minister continues to put inaccurate figures into the public domain. He is targeting just 3% of the 183,000 vacant homes, which is only approximately 1,000 homes a year for every year of the plan. It is no wonder the Minister is hiding this week. He has not been in the House for Questions on Promised Legislation. He is not here for the Topical Issue debate. I have great sympathy for the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who has been asked to stand here in his place. Clearly, she can only read out the statement she has been given. I am not surprised the Minister does not have the guts to come into this Chamber at any stage where he could be questioned by the Opposition this week because he knows his plan is failing and nothing in the note the Minister of State has given us today suggests otherwise.

Rents in Laois have increased by 16.6%, the second highest increase in the State. In a reply to a recent parliamentary question the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said the increase has to be more than 7% in four of the previous six quarters. That is a huge increase. The Government's rent controls are clearly not working. Families are under severe stress. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to ask the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State in the Department, Deputy English, to go back to the drawing board and introduce proper rent controls. Sinn Féin introduced a proposal to link rents with the level of general inflation. That happens in other countries so why can we not do it here? We also called for an acceleration of the local authority house building programme and a reintroduction of the affordable housing scheme, which the previous Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, abolished under the previous Government. There is a commitment on page 23 of the programme for Government to introduce a cost rental option. There is unanimous support in the House for that. The Government included the measure in the programme for Government. That is a measure Sinn Féin could support if it was done properly. That would bring immediate relief for people. I ask the Minister of State to ensure the Minister reports on progress with the scheme.

However, I am very much aware myself of the difficulties people face in my constituency but there have been significant changes. I can only speak for the area I represent in Dublin South-Central where a significant number of properties have been bought up by the council and a significant amount of properties and voids have been put back into the system. In the short term, the Government's rent predictability measures limit rent increases to a maximum of 4% per annum, less than one third of
the rate of rent inflation reported by daft.ie. Tenants can expect to see significantly smaller rent increases than those they have seen recently or would have faced if the measures had not been introduced. As has already been indicated, Dublin was designated as a rent pressure zone in December 2016. The daft.ie report data for Dublin indicate that the rate of rent price increases has dropped since then. However, it is still too early to say whether that is an effect of the rent predictability measure. The Minister will be better placed to make a judgment when the RTB publishes the rent index report for quarter 1 of 2017 next month. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has already committed to carrying out a review, in June this year, of the rent predictability provisions. At that point, the provisions will have been in place for six months and it will be possible to ascertain their effectiveness and whether any changes need to be made, for example, to the qualifying criteria or the designation process. In the meantime the Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation as rent pressure zones. Where, following the procedures set out in the legislation, it is found that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as rent pressure zones. I have listened closely to what both Deputies said and I have made notes which I will pass on the Ministers in question. I hope there will be further information to provide to them in the coming days.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	216	In 1960, a small group of wheelchair users came together to form the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, with the aim of trying to improve the lives of people with physical disabilities in Ireland. The Irish Wheelchair Association has now grown to a network of 20,000 members, with 2,300 staff and many more volunteers. Resource and outreach services are provided to over 2,000 people in 57 locations. Some 1.17 million hours of assisted caring services are provided to 1,863 people per annum. As its website states, all IWA staff, including the CEO and senior management, are paid in compliance with Department of Health, public service and HSE guidelines in relation to salary scales and rates of pay. No additional payments are made to any member of staff. Last Friday, I met the IWA's CEO, Ms Rosemary Keogh, and the advocacy officer, Ms Joan Carthy. In that briefing I was told that in recent weeks the HSE advised that 20% of the IWA's funding will be withheld until it signs a service level agreement. Some 20% of the funding has now been withheld for the March payments. This is significant as the CEO says that no service could sustain such a cut without an impact on services. Ultimately, it is the people with disabilities and their families who will suffer.  The Irish Wheelchair Association along with Rehab, Enable Ireland and many smaller bodies are so-called section 39 organisations. This means that under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 these voluntary providers signed up to service level agreements and receive funding to provide certain services. Those agencies, of which in 2014 there were more than 1,800, are part-funded under section 39 of the Health Act. Under section 38, the HSE may enter into an arrangement with a service provider on its behalf. Under section 39 the HSE may give assistance to a person or body to provide a service that is similar or ancillary to a service that the executive may provide. On 3 May, in reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, said that any individuals employed by these section 39 organisations are not HSE employees and, therefore, the HSE has no role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff. The Minister went on to say that section 39 staff are not subject to the provisions of public service agreements or the FEMPI legislation. It is regrettable that the Minister for Health is not here this evening, but I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is present. In his reply, the Minister for Health was clearly ignoring the earlier decisions of the HSE and his own predecessors, as the HSE imposed pay cuts on section 39 staff in 2009. The pay scales had been linked for many years. It seems the Minister wants to have one rule when cuts must be imposed and another rule when restoration is due. Irish Wheelchair Association salaries are clearly linked to HSE pay scales and section 39 staff were, in fact, treated like public servants. It is also clear that section 39 organisations' pay scales have been linked to HSE section 38 pay scales for over 15 years. The Irish Wheelchair Association informs me that the HSE cut funding to section 39 organisations in 2009 and instructed them to impose pay cuts in order to guarantee sustainable services. Under the Lansdowne Road agreement, however, public sector pay is finally beginning to be restored and yet the HSE has confirmed that no funding is available to section 39 organisations to meet the cost of the pay restoration measures required. The HSE's decision creates an intolerable situation for the Irish Wheelchair Association, Rehab, Enable Ireland and the other bodies concerned. The result is that home support workers and others in the large section 39 organisations are doing exactly the same work but receive different levels of pay depending on whether they are employed by a section 38 or 39 organisation. Equally urgent is the fact that the IWA has been unable to meet the cost of the €1.34 million needed for pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road agreement this year, nor was it able to meet the €290,000 increase last year. As such, it has said that this "impacts seriously and immediately on our ability to fulfil our responsibility under the service arrangements, as well as the standards required by statutory agencies such as HIQA". The IWA was unable to sign the service arrangement by the end of February.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, who unfortunately is not with us, told the IWA in February that he wanted a quiet and quick resolution of this matter, which is putting IWA, Rehab and Enable Ireland staff under intolerable pressure. I urge the Minister of State to ensure that the Minister gets a settlement very quickly.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	217	I wish to apologise for the fact the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, cannot be here. I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important issue and will outline the current position on the situation. The Irish Wheelchair Association is funded under section 39 of the Health Act 2004. The HSE has in place service level agreements with providers funded under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 that set out the level of service to be provided for the grant to the individual organisation and requirements in relation to standards of care. The HSE has established a governance framework to cover funding relationships with all non-statutory agencies. It is the policy of the HSE that all funding arrangements with section 39 agencies are formalised by complying with this governance framework, which has two different components. Part 1 is a service level arrangement that is signed every three years by both parties and sets out the legal requirements that the agency must comply with to receive funding for the provision of services. Part 2 is a set of schedules which must be completed and signed by the agency and the HSE, which sets out the detail of the service and the exact funding that the HSE is providing for the delivery of this service. This set of schedules also identifies the quality standards and best practice guidelines to be adhered to in the provision of all services, along with the process for managing complaints in relation to service provision. The HSE has implemented a measure whereby for agencies that have not completed the necessary governance arrangement process within the required deadline of 1 March 2017, a 20% withholding of funding is applied. Every effort was made by the HSE to encourage agencies to complete this process within the timeframe, including extending the timeframe to 1 April for some agencies. With regard to the Irish Wheelchair Association specifically, this organisation was unable to complete these governance arrangements, as I outlined. Consequently, 20% of its funding under its SLA has been withheld. To be clear, this is not a funding cut or a fine. The full funding will be returned to the agency on completion of the governance arrangement process. The HSE has advised that a refusal to complete its governance arrangements due to pay restoration issues is not acceptable to the executive. With regard to matters relating to pay of staff in the IWA, it should be noted that the individuals employed by section 39 organisations are not HSE employees. As such, the HSE has no role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff. The staff concerned are not subject to the control of the Department of Health and they are not classified as public servants. Staff in section 39 agencies were not subject to the provisions of public service agreements or the FEMPI legislation which imposed the associated pay reductions. Accordingly, any arrangements offered by each service provider in regard to its employees' terms and conditions, including rates of pay, may vary. The HSE acknowledges the significant savings in efficiencies service providers have made since 2008. The health service, as a whole, must operate within the parameters of funding available to it. Given the current economic environment this is a challenge for all stakeholders, including the HSE, voluntary service providers like the Irish Wheelchair Association, service users and their families.

It does not reflect how grossly unfair the situation is to the Irish Wheelchair Association, Rehab, Enable Ireland and the other bodies. I note that the IWA has entered a dispute resolution process with the HSE. The SIPTU trade union has rightly referred the matter to the Workplace Relations Commission. I understand that the chief executive of the IWA, Ms Rosemary Keogh, had her first meeting with the HSE today following a letter she sent to them on 4 May. That letter indicated that as per clause 33 of the service arrangement 2015-2018, the IWA was beginning the dispute resolution process.  The IWA is a member of the Not-for-Profit Association, NFPA, which has been attempting to find a resolution to this problem since last September. On 29 March, representatives of the NFPA met with representatives of the HSE, including Mr. Pat Healy, Mr. Cathal Morgan and Ms Marion Meaney. Clearly, over many years the HSE did instruct section 39 organisations to come in line with HSE pay scales.They did that, as per instruction. During the crash, the Irish Wheelchair Association and other bodies were told to make the FEMPI reductions, which they did. Now the staff of section 39 organisations have been excluded, most unfairly, from the Haddington Road and Landsdowne Road national pay agreements. The SIPTU trade union has rightly sought the restoration of pay scales for these staff and to have the matter referred to the Workplace Relations Commission. The Minister of State mentioned a three-year service agreement which the Irish Wheelchair Association has not felt able to sign. It feels that way because it simply does not have the funding, as it has to meet the additional salary costs. Approximately €5 million per annum over the duration of this service level agreement would settle and resolve this situation for the hard-working and valiant staff of the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Rehab Group and Enable Ireland. It is a small sum of money. The Minister should resolve this as soon as possible.

I am very familiar with the work of the Irish Wheelchair Association. All organisations, no matter what Department they deal with, are governed by certain arrangements. If there has been a problem with the governance arrangements of the Irish Wheelchair Association, it has been said in the reply that the HSE is willing to talk to it and to try to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. There are rules and regulations, however. When people were not adhering to certain governance measures in the past there were problems in services right across the board. It is important that any agency providing a service should meet the governance standards.

The background to this situation is that the Department made the decision to allow multiple companies to tender for tags. Obviously, a number of companies applied to be able to sell tags to Irish farmers. The voluntary levy which farmers paid, and which was the main source of funding for the ICBF, was highlighted on the order forms farmers received. Between 1 October and 31 March, 50,633 farmers and herdowners ordered 2.057 million tags. Some 25,069 of those herdowners opted not to pay the levy, resulting in 1,091,238 tag sets that did not contribute the levy to the ICBF. This resulted in a shortfall in funding of €414,670 for the ICBF for that six-month period. While the ICBF has had its critics, it has played a vital role in the development of both dairy and beef herds in this country. The advancement in the economic breeding index, EBI, of the dairy herd in particular is in no small way down to the ICBF, which was founded in 1998. In recent months it was in the spotlight with regard to EBI evaluations. Leaving that aside, it has played a huge role in the advancement of beef genetics and the genetic potential of both dairy and beef herds in this country. Unless the shortfall to which I refer is addressed by means of some mechanism brought forward by the Department, the ICBF cannot continue to operate. While there are other minor sources of funding for the ICBF, its major source is the voluntary levy from tags. As I have mentioned, the voluntary levy came into the spotlight as a result of the Department's decision to allow multiple companies to tender to supply tags. The ICBF's role is hugely important to the progression of both our dairy and beef herds. The issue of how the ICBF will be funded into the future needs to be addressed fairly rapidly as the vast majority of tags are ordered in the period from September to spring. If there is going to be another source of income for ICBF, the Minister needs to come forward with proposals fairly quickly, in order that the ICBF will be secure and know what funding will be available to it in the future. This shortfall in funding cannot be borne by the ICBF for any length of time. Its operations will cease very quickly. I know this has been a matter of discussion with the board of the ICBF and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but I would be greatly appreciative if the Minister of State could tell us what the Department's action will be and how this funding issue will be resolved. Hopefully it will be sooner rather than later.

We are grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, for being here. Before I call on him, I would like to say that if a Member tabling a Topical Issue debate is not happy that the appropriate Minister is unavailable, it is open to that Deputy to have the matter deferred until such a time as he or she can be present.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	224	I apologise that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is not here. I am taking this matter on his behalf. The ICBF was established in 1998 following a number of years of industry consultation among all stakeholders in the cattle breeding industry. ICBF is the only body approved under EU legislation, in particular Commission decision 2006/427/EC, to carry out testing, genetic evaluation and publication of breeding values for Irish dairy and beef cattle. The objective of the ICBF is to achieve the greatest possible genetic improvement in the national cattle herd for the benefit of Irish farmers and the national dairy and beef industries by collecting, collating and distributing available information of practical and scientific industry while promoting the exchange of all such information and data among breeders of cattle in Ireland. The organisation delivers a public good in the area of cattle breed improvement, which is the foundation of a profitable and sustainable dairy and beef herd. As an advanced livestock country, Ireland has been at the forefront of utilising the latest advances in cattle breeding from around the world to ensure Irish farmers can benefit from the best genetics for their farm businesses. The organisation of the breeding industry under the umbrella of the ICBF has helped Irish artificial insemination, AI, companies maintain a competitive business and be able to provide the highest quality AI bulls to Irish dairy farmers in particular. Cattle breeding worldwide is becoming a very competitive business and a small number of global players are determined to dominate the world market. The Irish breeding sector has helped withstand these competitive pressures by organising itself under the umbrella of the ICBF. Regarding funding since 2009, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has allocated a total of €6.238 million to the ICBF under an annual block grant and €8.08 million in infrastructural funds. Some €800,000 has been allocated towards operational costs for 2017 and €920,000 for infrastructural projects.  The ICBF is a farmer-led body which receives its funding from a number of sources including farmers, the breeding industry and the State. The funding model used by the ICBF for many years involved one third of income coming from farmers, one third from service organisations and one third from an annual grant from the Department. This model has served the ICBF well. The tag levy, which formerly raised approximately €900,000, has been a critical source of funding for the ICBF for many years, constituting approximately 20% of core funding. Recent policy changes and amendments to tag order forms resulted in a significant drop in levy collection and an absence of certainty for this funding stream, as has been referred to by the Deputy. It is broadly accepted by the various stakeholders in the ICBF that a contribution from all farmers is the fairest and most appropriate mechanism to support the work being done on the national breeding programme as it maintains farmer control of the benefits and generates benefit for all farmers. The Department has been working with the ICBF and tag providers with the objective of finding a solution that addresses the funding shortfalls but which maintains the pillar approach to funding. Discussions on this matter are ongoing and it is hoped they can be finalised in the near future.

I do not disagree with anything the Minister of State said in his statement but the nub of the issue is where the shortfall in funding is going to come from or what mechanism his Department will use to address it. He did not give any answers. We know the figures. There is a shortfall that will increase rather than diminish if action is not taken because roughly 50% of herd owners who ordered tags did not contribute. Human nature is such that if people see their neighbour is not contributing to a voluntary levy, more people will opt out of the scheme. We need a formula sooner rather than later to address adequately this shortfall. None of us is arguing about the hugely important work that the ICBF does. As a dairy and beef farmer, I can see that the evaluation on the economic breeding index side of things is the envy of many other countries. That is why the funding is so critical for an organisation like this, which has been a success since its foundation in 1998. It would be hugely detrimental to our agricultural industry if because of a shortfall in funding, the ICBF's activities were to be restricted. While I agree fully with the sentiments expressed by the Minister of State about the ICBF, its functions and its achievements, when I got to the nub of the question about how the shortfall will be addressed, the Minister of State did not address that issue. I respectfully suggest that he convey to the Minister our anxiety about this shortfall and our concern that measures to address it be expedited as quickly as possible. It needs to be addressed and the Minister should make it a priority that the ICBF will be secure in knowing that this important pillar of its finances is catered for.

The industry is very well represented on the board. It is a wide range of stakeholders in the beef and dairy sectors which demonstrates that it is an industry-led organisation. Michael Doran of the IFA is chairman while the vice chairman is Patrick Kelly of Progressive Genetics. The rest of the board consists of three IFA representatives, three from the Munster Cattle Breeding Group, two from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, with which Deputy Cahill has had a long connection, two from the Irish Holstein Friesian Association, one from Dovea Genetics, one from Progressive Genetics, one from Pedigree Cattle Breeders and Mr. Bill Callanan from the Department. A Department official acts as the ICBF's company secretary. As I stated in my answer, discussions are ongoing in an effort to come up with a solution to the funding shortfall. Department officials and ICBF personnel met with tag supply companies. A proposal was put to the tag supply companies - Mullinahone, Cormac Tagging and Datamars - that the tag price should be increased to incorporate the ICBF levy. I understand that further meetings are planned over the coming weeks. Obviously, if there is to be any increase in the tag prices, the Department would be required to explain why this is happening and the importance of it. I will certainly inform the Minister about Deputy Cahill's concerns and his belief that a resolution should be found very soon and the importance of the timeline for the majority of calf births from September to the following spring. I hope a resolution can be found very soon.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-11 00:00:00	Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann: Suí i gComhchoiste	227	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." The Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill 2017 aims to eliminate the persistent problem of ticket touting while at the same time protecting ordinary consumers and charities. In drafting this Bill, my three main concerns were to ensure that those who buy tickets with the intention of attending an event but who later find that they are unable to attend are protected and allowed to re-sell their tickets, to target those ticket touts who purchase tickets for events they never intend to attend and who have only the intention of reselling at huge prices and to ensure there are exemptions for charities. This last concern is dealt with in section 5. This provides for registered charities to be allowed to sell tickets at a price greater than the 10% limit. Ticket touting has escalated in recent years. With advances in technology, the practice has grown from traditional touts selling counterfeit, cancelled or extortionately priced tickets outside venues to online sites in the grey area of regulation. Each time tickets go on sale for a concert or sporting event, it is followed by a news report that outlines how the tickets sold out in minutes and are immediately re-selling online on secondary sites at extortionate prices. Despite people's best efforts in queuing at retailers or arranging to buy tickets online on the morning of a sale, most have no chance as a result of the misuse of the system by secondary re-sellers. This has caused huge concern and much debate in the media but there has been very little action to deal with the problem until tickets for the next popular event are sold out. Ticket touting and the secondary sales of tickets for events, be they music concerts, sporting or cultural events, have been the source of huge concern and anger for many years. People are perplexed as to why tickets that are supposedly "sold out" can then be offered for sale - in some cases by companies which are often owned by the primary seller for multiples of the initial cost of same. Peter Aiken of Aiken Promotions, one of the country's biggest music promoters, has recently spoken out against the use of secondary ticket-selling websites such as Seatwave and GetMeIn, both of which are owned by Ticketmaster. He said that many of those selling on these secondary sites do not need to prove they actually have tickets and so many people face being ripped off and left very disappointed. Many organisations have been particularly proactive in ensuring that tickets for their events are not sold on and that in the vast majority of cases, those who purchase tickets from them do attend save for exceptional reasons. In particular I commend Cumann Lúthchleas Gael and the Irish Rugby Football Union, which have robust procedures to ensure as best they can that tickets are not resold at exorbitant prices. However, the re-selling of tickets needs to be tackled. It is not benefitting the public, music artists or sports teams involved and is tarnishing the experience for many. This Bill aims to address these issues and give everyone a fair opportunity to buy tickets to these events. Over a number of years, there have been a number of attempts to regulate the re-sale of tickets. Deputies Denis Naughten and Alan Shatter brought forward the Prohibition of Ticket Touts Bill in 1998 while Deputy Jimmy Deenihan brought forward the Prohibition of Ticket Touts Bill in 2005 but these were unsuccessful and the problem remains. If enacted, this Bill will have the potential to make the re-sale of tickets unprofitable and thus it would have a huge impact on the existing problem and make most ticket touting pointless. Unless we take the profit out of re-selling and impose sanctions on those who persist, we will never adequately address this issue. I will go through the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the interpretation of the wording of the Bill. This includes the term "designated event", which is defined as a sporting or cultural event for which more than 300 tickets have been offered for sale. "Face value" is defined as the original price of the ticket, including the full cost of the ticket plus any administration or other fees incurred in its purchase from the primary retailer. Section 2 outlines the offences that would be introduced by this Bill. The Bill will make it an offence for a person to sell or offer for sale a ticket for a designated event at a price greater than 10% above the face value of the ticket. Section 2 also outlines that a person guilty of such an offence shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €5,000. Section 3 outlines the powers of An Garda Síochána if it has reasonable cause for believing a person is committing or has committed an offence under section 2. Section 4 details the procedure for a confiscation order, should the court determine that a person has benefitted from illegal ticket touting. Exemptions for charities are dealt with in section 5. This provides for registered charities to be allowed to sell tickets at a price greater than the 10% limit. Section 6 details the procedure for dealing with the sale and disposal of tickets on the Internet. This provides for a period of 24 hours where a person who provides services for electronic communication or for the shortage of electronic data is made aware that they are used in connection with the commission of an offence under this Act before such a person shall be guilty of an offence.Section 7 of the Bill seeks to allow for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to consult with venue operators, event organisers and ticket agents in order to establish a voluntary code regarding ticket refunds to consumers. Section 8 details that expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 9 is the final section of the Bill and deals with the Short Title and commencement. The Act may be known as the Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Act 2017 and come into effect one month from the date of its passing. The practice of ticket touting has gone on for too long. What should be an enjoyable experience for people is being made into a nightmare because of the difficulty of obtaining reasonably priced legitimate tickets due to secondary selling. Genuine music and sport fans are the biggest losers in this situation. Ireland will continue to suffer reputational damage while the practice of ticket touting continues here, which could affect decisions to host major sporting events here. Ireland is a candidate to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup, which would be the biggest sporting tournament ever held in Ireland. If chosen as hosts, it is estimated over 450,000 visitors would arrive in Ireland for the tournament and over 2 million tickets would be sold by the host rugby union. Organisers should be reassured that fans will be protected, not exploited should events such as the Rugby World Cup be held here. The passing of legislation such as this Bill would provide organisers with reassurance that the tournament would not be plagued by negative media coverage over ticketing issues and would allow genuine fans to benefit from the fixtures. International practice has shown that the issue is not confined to Ireland. The producers of a musical called Hamilton and Adele, a singer, tried and failed to curb ticket touting for their respective shows. They sought to introduce measures whereby ticket holders had to have a confirmation email, the bank card used to make the booking and photo ID. In spite of those measures, tickets for the shows were for sale on secondary websites at extortionate prices. Stronger measures such as those contained in this Bill are needed to combat this. The Government conducted a consultation for which I commend the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor. The consultation was launched in January and concluded last week. The report has not been completed but submissions to the consultation were published on the Department website. Contributions included that of Peter Aiken of Aiken Promotions, who said that he would like to see the resale of tickets by third parties criminalised. The Consumers’ Association of Ireland said that there should be a ban on the resale of all tickets for all publically advertised and promoted events above face value plus the addition of between a 5% and 10% resale charge. DoneDeal, a website on which a large number of tickets are resold, said it would be very keen to support any legislation to ensure that the resale of tickets is more regulated. The GAA said that touting in its various forms should be classified as a criminal activity with appropriate penalties in place, whether it takes place on the street or online or involves the private trading of tickets for above face value or fraudulent tickets. A number of contributions expressed concern about the potential damage to Ireland’s reputation. The FAI said that the introduction of such legislation forms part of commitments given by the Government as part of Ireland’s bid to UEFA to host matches in Euro 2020. The Irish American Football Association said the Government needs to be conscious that Ireland will cease to be an attractive destination for overseas sporting events if event organisers are more interested in once-off windfall profits rather than the sustainability of Ireland as an event destination. There were also contributions from reselling sites. Unsurprisingly, submissions received from such sites were not in favour of introducing legislation to regulate this area. However, this legislation will not have a detrimental effect on such sites as the Bill does not outlaw the reselling of tickets but rather places a cap on prices in order to prevent abuse. It will therefore remain possible for tickets to be resold on these sites but only at reasonable prices that are fair to consumers. The issues highlighted in the consultation will be addressed by this Bill. I hoped that the Bill would receive all-party support. I wrote to Deputies Rock and Donnelly who have previously put forward a Bill on this issue. I thought there would be support for the Bill but unfortunately the Government has tabled an amendment which I appeal to it to withdraw. The amendment would have the effect of kicking the can down the road for nine months. I am disappointed by it being tabled. Ordinary people who need to resell their ticket for genuine reasons will be facilitated by allowing the resale of tickets at a maximum profit margin of 10% of the original purchase price. The Bill will deter those who intend to resell tickets at exorbitant prices by eradicating their profits through the imposition of fines of up to €5,000. The Bill recognises that tickets for sporting and cultural events are often resold at charity fundraisers for charities and includes an exemption for regulated charities to account for this. The Bill will address the ticketing issues that have plagued music, cultural and sporting events in Ireland for years and I welcome any suggestions or amendments to make it work best for consumers.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Member's Bill and commend Deputy Quinlivan for bringing it forward. I also commend Deputies Rock and Donnelly for their Private Members’ Bill on the issue. As Deputy Quinlivan said, there is no doubting the public concern and anger over the resale of tickets at inflated prices. Music or sports fans who are unable to get tickets for a concert or match they want to attend feel understandably annoyed when they see tickets for sale on secondary websites at a multiple of the face value price. Their annoyance is even greater when tickets go on sale on secondary websites immediately after or even before the primary ticket sale has ended. Disappointed fans want to know how this can happen and what can be done to tackle it. The main solution proposed in the Deputy's Bill is to make it an offence to sell, or offer for sale, event tickets at a price more than 10% above the face value of the ticket. This would be backed up by a provision authorising the Garda Síochána to apply to a court for an order for the confiscation of gains made from illegal ticket sales. The Bill would also make it an offence for businesses which provide electronic communication services used in connection with illegal ticket sales to continue to provide such services on being notified of their use for this purpose. These businesses would also have to comply with a request from a garda or event organiser for information about the ticket seller or other information relevant to the investigation of an offence under the legislation. The Bill would further require the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to consult with venue operators, event organisers and ticketing agents with a view to establishing a voluntary code on ticket refunds or an official ticket exchange facility for consumers. The Bill introduced by Deputies Rock and Donnelly would make it an offence to sell, offer or advertise for sale an event ticket at a price in excess of that set by the event organiser. The Government shares the concern of the three Deputies and of the public on this issue. Before the publication of the Deputy's Bill or that of the earlier Bill from Deputies Rock and Donnelly, my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O’Connor, launched a public consultation on the subject, along with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. They took this step because it was clear to them that, despite the significant amount of commentary on the issue, there was a lack of reliable information on many aspects of ticket resale, including its extent, the sources of the tickets that end up for resale on the secondary market and the prices achieved, as opposed to advertised, for tickets sold on that market. The public consultation which ran from January to the end of March this year elicited over 20 responses, including submissions from sporting organisations, promoters and the main players in the primary and secondary ticket markets in Ireland. The responses were published earlier this week on the website of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I encourage all Deputies with an interest in the subject to take the time to read the submissions. In addition to providing valuable information on the workings of the primary and secondary ticket markets, they show clearly the different views that exist on the causes of the current problems in these markets and on the solutions to those problems. All Members would agree that good legislation is evidence-based and should be underpinned by a rigorous regulatory impact analysis. Such an impact analysis must assess the need for proposed legislation and whether it would have the desired impacts.It must also look at possible unforeseen and unintended impacts and identify likely costs. While there is no doubt that there is a problem with the resale of tickets, we should not overstate its scale. The number of events each year where demand exceeds supply at the level necessary for a sizeable volume of secondary ticket sales is almost certainly in low double figures and accounts for a very small proportion of the thousands of ticketed events that take place every year. Similarly, it would be easy to get the impression from media reports that very large numbers of tickets for high demand events are listed for sale in secondary ticket marketplaces. In most cases, however, the number of such listings, although too high, is a good deal smaller than is commonly assumed. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O’Connor, has advised me, for example, that an analysis by her Department of ticket listings on the main secondary market websites for the recent Ed Sheeran concerts in the week following their release found that they accounted for fewer than 1% of tickets for the concerts. Even if every single one of these tickets had been available for sale on the primary ticket market, it is clear that there would still have been a large number of disappointed fans unable to get tickets. This underlines that the main cause of the difficulties experienced by fans in sourcing tickets for some events is the mismatch between supply and demand. Where this mismatch occurs to any significant extent, measures restricting the resale of tickets such as those proposed in the Bill would not address the fundamental cause of the problem or ensure everybody who wanted a ticket for a high demand event would be able to get one. Another aspect of the issue on which it would be helpful to have full information is the make-up of those who offer tickets for sale on secondary market websites. The consultation paper suggests ticket resellers fall into three main categories: those who buy tickets with the intention of attending the event but who later find that they are unable to attend; ticket buyers who plan to attend an event but who buy extra tickets in order to subsidise the purchase of their own tickets and the other costs associated with attendance; and those who buy tickets for events that they have no intention of attending in order to resell the tickets at a profit. Some people who engage in this activity may do so occasionally, while others may do it on a more systematic basis. The consultation paper notes that this last category of ticket reseller, particularly those engaged in the activity on an organised, large-scale basis, is the one that gives rise to the greatest public concern and which is most likely to be characterised as engaged in ticket touting. Consumers may be more tolerant of resale by the other two groups. In bigger markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom there is clear evidence of large-scale involvement by organised, professional resellers in the secondary ticket market. The smaller scale of the Irish event market may mean that this category of reseller is less prominent here. In its response to the public consultation process one of the main secondary market ticket platforms has indicated that 90% of sellers on its Irish website in 2016 sold fewer than ten tickets. Assuming that this figure is broadly accurate and representative, it raises a question about the aims and scope of the proposed Bill. If somebody in Limerick or Galway buys four tickets for a concert in Dublin and wishes to sell two of them for 20%, 50% or 100% above the face value price in order to help to subsidise the travel and accommodation costs for their own attendance, should he or she be prohibited by law from doing so and subject to criminal proceedings if he or she resells the tickets for more than the permitted 10% mark-up above the original price?  This question raises a related issue about the legal status of event tickets that featured in a number of responses to the public consultation process. Is a ticket the personal property of the ticket buyer which he or she should be free to dispose of as and how they choose in the same way that they would be free to do with goods which they have bought, or should a ticket be seen instead as a licence which is issued subject to the terms and conditions laid down by the event organiser and revocable by the organiser if these terms and conditions, including restrictions on resale, are breached by the purchaser? To my knowledge, this point has not been the subject of a definitive court ruling, nor has the related question of whether bans or restrictions on resale in ticket contracts are fair or unfair under the regulations for unfair terms in consumer contracts. Any assessment of a legislative proposal must pay particular attention to its likely consequences, intended or unintended. One likely consequence of Deputy Maurice Quinlivan's Bill and in the Bill proposed by Deputies Noel Rock and Stephen S. Donnelly would be to render unviable the business model of the established secondary marketplaces. As these marketplaces typically charge buyers a fee of 10% of the ticket price and sellers a fee of 15%, it is difficult to see how they could continue to operate if, as stipulated in Deputy Maurice Quinlivan's Bill, the permitted resale price were fixed at a maximum of 10% above the face value of the ticket. Many people might not lament if the established secondary market ticket platforms were no longer able to operate in Ireland. We have to consider, however, what might follow from such an outcome. I understand why many people view the activities of these platforms with distaste, but it is important to keep in mind that they serve a pro-consumer purpose in offering ticket buyers a guarantee that they will receive either a ticket or their money back. While consumers who overpay for tickets on the secondary ticket market may be subject to some detriment, the greatest detriment is suffered by those who pay black market sellers for tickets that are never provided or that turn out to be fake. Before we enact legislation along the lines proposed, we need to consider carefully whether it is likely to drive ticket resales underground to sellers who will not offer purchasers any guarantee about the tickets they buy. Both event promoters and An Garda Síochána have stated ticket fraud and the sale of counterfeit tickets present a serious problem. It is an issue that we need to take fully into account in our deliberations. If the established secondary marketplaces were no longer in a position to sell tickets in Ireland, it is likely that some sellers would place tickets on websites in countries, including the United Kingdom and most other European Union member states, where resale was not subject to restrictions of the kind contained in the Bill. Some buyers keen to obtain tickets for major concerts or matches would no doubt also seek to buy them from sellers in other countries. According to information supplied to the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor's Department by the Belgian authorities, this appears to have been one of the main effects of a law prohibiting the resale of tickets above the face value price enacted in Belgium in 2013. The introduction of the legislation has not led to a reduction in the number of complaints about ticket resale from Belgian consumers. In its response to the public consultation process European Consumer Centre Ireland has stated there is a high likelihood that traders would seek to circumvent Irish legislation on ticket resale by operating outside the State.  These concerns and considerations should not necessarily lead us to reject the approach proposed in the two Private Members’ Bills. They do, however, show the need to examine fully and carefully all aspects of the issue and all possible consequences, intended and unintended, of applying a statutory price cap to ticket sales. This examination should also encompass options not dealt with in Deputy Maurice Quinlivan's Bill, in particular, additional information obligations for ticket sellers and provisions to regulate the use of software or bots for the purpose of circumventing restrictions on ticket purchases. Legislative provisions on bots have recently been introduced in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O’Connor, has advised me that she and her officials are willing to co-operate with Deputies Noel Rock, Stephen S. Donnelly and Maurice Quinlivan in such an examination and for this purpose draw on the outcome of the public consultation process, any subsequent engagement with stakeholders and consultations with public authorities in other countries. This is a complex question with a number of dimensions, on which there are conflicting, validly held views. While a number of countries permit the resale of tickets only at face value or a specified mark-up above face value, independent reviews in countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and the Netherlands have rejected this approach. In working to achieve fairer access to event tickets for consumers, we must recognise and take full account of the complexity of the issues and different interests involved.

It is a good Bill which needs to be worked on and we are happy to support it. I agree with the Government's proposal that it proceed to Committee Stage after a period. A period of nine months has been proposed, but it could be shorter. There is a need for proper scrutiny because the issue is hugely complex and technological advances are well ahead of legislation. We have no legislation in place in this country. It is, therefore, an issue of huge public concern.  I attended a Munster rugby match in Thomond Park over the Christmas period with a neighbour of mine. I had a ticket, but he did not. He bought a ticket outside the stadium and when he presented it, it was declined. It had been sold back into the system on the website. There are issues that need to be dealt with in considering how we should try to tackle the problem. We must also bear in mind how legislation might be enforced. The Minister of State made reference to the moving of tickets to websites offshore, as happens in the gaming and gambling industries. We do not want to have a situation where some of the more reputable ticket reselling organisations will relocate and take their business and jobs elsewhere. There are other complexities. Deputy Maurice Quinlivan and I both come from Limerick where there is a strong rugby tradition. Munster played Saracens in the European Rugby Champions Cup recently in the Aviva Stadium.Most of the rugby clubs in Limerick would have used some of their ticket allocation to hold fundraising events in Dublin, where they would have sold packages of a meal and a ticket. How do we separate out that type of thing? I am just offering it as an example. A person obviously would pay more than the face value of the ticket as the whole thing is designed to make money and to fundraise for the club. These are hugely important sources of income to clubs. I note that the Deputy has exempted charities. There is also a huge issue in terms of the funding of our sporting organisations. Rightly or wrongly, the use of tickets for big sporting events which are distributed to soccer, GAA and rugby clubs is now an integral part of funding the day-to-day activities of voluntary clubs. There is a rugby club in Limerick city which was founded well over 100 years ago. Up until recently, it owed the bank €1.1 million. It is an amateur club with hundreds of kids turning up at weekends to play on the firsts, seconds and thirds. They are playing in the all-Ireland rugby league and all the rest. This is the reality faced by GAA, soccer and rugby clubs and other sporting organisations of different codes every day of the week. Tickets for major events are used for funding their day-to-day activities. It is not right but it is how they have to survive at the moment. How do we address that? I am aware that the Department has carried out consultation. I really want to hear from the sporting organisations. Some of what Deputy Quinlivan has cited from their submissions to the Department is fine. They are running the events along with the concert and event promoters. They are getting the tickets out into the marketplace and are saying it should be criminalised after that, once they have the tickets sold at face value. My view is that those organisations, along with us as legislators and the State, have a responsibility to come up with reasonable, practical proposals to deal with the issue of ticket touting and reselling at inflated prices.  Nor is there any point in sticking our heads in the sand when it comes to the constitutional question in respect of property rights. If I hold a ticket and I have paid for it, can I not sell it at an inflated price? I own the ticket and it is my property. It is enshrined in our Constitution. We can all shrug our shoulders. I remember during a previous Administration how the Labour Party filled the galleries when the issue of upward-only rent reviews was under discussion. They insisted it was not unconstitutional and that we could deal with it by legislation. They marched people up and down the hill. When they got into government, even though they had the same legal adviser as when they were in opposition, it suddenly became a constitutional issue. The question really has to be addressed. If one owns a ticket, is it property or a licence? I think the Minister of State mentioned that matter and it must be teased out. Why exempt charities? I am not anti-charity, and we all want to support charities, but we have seen how some churches register as charities. They collect their dues and subscriptions from parishioners and people get a tax form in the door which they are asked to sign. The church is registered as a charity and is claiming the credit. It is not just the church that does it. Will we then have a proliferation of charities? Again, it is very complex. I am with Deputy Quinlivan all the way on the Bill. We really need to sort the problem out. I would love for our committee to spend a decent amount of time considering it. The Deputy has offered a Bill for the right reasons. The public, whom we are elected to serve, are the big losers. We should also have a debate about the primary cost of ticketing. If a family wants to go to Croke Park for an all-Ireland final, it is a very expensive day out. What is the cost of a ticket for an all-Ireland final or semi-final? A family of three, four or five might get a holiday in Spain for the same type of money. That is part of the engagement we need to have. As part of our consultation, I would also like us to engage with the ticket resellers in the secondary market, such as eBay, StubHub and viagogo. Deputy Quinlivan and I are both from Limerick, where viagogo is a serious employer and a very reputable company. We have to sit down, talk with them and learn from their experiences. The issue has been around for a very long time and I would rather get it right than get it wrong and have to revisit it. We know that others have tried to deal with the issue previously. We are happy to support the Bill but would like to have a degree of consultation. If Deputy Quinlivan wants to propose to shorten the nine months, I am happy to go along with that too.

Listening to Members on all sides of the House this evening, there is general consensus that everybody would like to solve this issue. The big question is how to do so. Looking back, I can think of a plethora of names - the Minister, Deputy Naughten, former Deputy Shatter, Deputies Donnelly, Rock and others - who have all brought forward proposals on this matter. They were good proposals; I have looked up some of them. It is an extremely complex issue. This evening's Bill is a good one. However, we should allow time for the process that is currently under way between the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. At some stage, we should bring all the interested groups around the table to discuss the matter. On the issue of charities, many of us attend charity events. I acknowledge that Deputy Quinlivan proposes to exempt charities. One of the ways in which they raise money is by auctioning tickets for major events such as all-Ireland finals, soccer matches or music concerts. I do many of these charity auctions myself, and sometimes they get €400 or €500 for a ticket. We want to make sure that this area was not affected. It may be covered in the Bill already. With the charity exemption, though, might we find a plethora of organisations looking for charitable status? That is another issue. I am just raising these questions so that all the issues will be addressed. We do not want a legal situation to arise whereby somebody can challenge part of the legislation. I thank the Deputy for bringing the Bill forward. It is clear that there is a common consensus that we want this issue addressed. By working together and allowing a short period for discussion on the matter, we could bring it forward.

I welcome the Bill and thank my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, for bringing it forward. There is an urgency in this matter. The legislation has two main objectives. It will protect the ordinary consumer who buys a ticket in good faith only to discover he or she cannot attend the event. It would also ensure that people will be able to dispose of their tickets within a suggested 10% profit margin. It will stop those who purchase event tickets with the sole intention of selling them on for a profit. The Bill is intended to disincentivise ticket touting by the introduction of substantial fines.It is timely that we tackle the ticket rip-off chancers who increasingly charge outrageous prices for tickets to entertainment and sport events in Ireland. Part of the difficulty is that, with the advances in technology, the practice has grown from the idea of traditional touts selling counterfeit, cancelled or other tickets outside venues to online sites. We have all come across those who appeal for anyone looking for a spare ticket; it is the usual thing. This takes place in a grey or non-existent area of regulation. This grey area with the associated technology and so on has spurred the concern of many people. Each time tickets go for sale for a concert or sporting event a news report usually follows outlining how the tickets have sold out. I listened to what the Minister of State said. He suggested this was only for some concerts and so on. It may be part of a selling ploy. I acknowledge the Minister of State referred to a mismatch and demand and supply. Furthermore, he said 20 submissions were made on the site. However, if he went online or took to social media, he would know far more than 20 people are discussing this issue and they all have their stories. The fact that people did not make a submission on the Department website or engage in that process does not mean we can dismiss this or that it is not a problem. Despite the best efforts of people in queuing or arranging to buy tickets online on the morning of sale, they have no chance of getting a result because of the misuse by secondary sellers. I am unsure whether the Minister of State has ever tried it, but I have tried it for various things I wanted to get. This is how it appears to me as a consumer. The ongoing problem was highlighted in recent months. After tickets for music festivals like Electric Picnic sold out within minutes, the same tickets appeared immediately afterwards on ticket re-selling sites for far higher prices. I listened to the Minister of State talk about pushing it down the road for a further nine or 12 months. The difficulty is that, as the Minister of State is aware, we are facing into a concert season. Again, I am conscious of young people being ripped off. Weekend camping tickets for Electric Picnic went on sale at a price of €246.10, including charges. Yet, on the same day, tickets were widely available on re-selling sites at inflated prices. I am informed that tickets were on sale on www.seatwave.ie, a Ticketmaster-owned company. I am uncomfortable about that connection. On the one hand, a company is selling tickets, but then another linked company is selling the same tickets for €474.98 only hours after the original tickets went on sale. Those were the prices for a weekend camping ticket. The same tickets were also selling on another site for a whopping €542.36. These opportunistic money-grabbing chancers are preventing genuine concert-goers and sporting enthusiasts from the opportunity to attend events. This needs to be tackled head-on. This Bill will, I hope, close the loopholes that allow this practice and will begin to address it. I use the term "I hope" because there is such potential for money to be made that those involved will probably come up with a different angle. As legislators, we need to examine this area and adapt the legislation as we go along. I welcome the recent comments of Peter Aiken of Aiken Promotions, one of the country's music promoters, on the need for regulation of ticket selling. This was mentioned earlier in the debate. He has been at this game for a lifetime. He is concerned and has spoken out against the use of secondary ticket selling sites such as www.seatwave.ie and www.getmein.com after tickets for U2 and Ed Sheeran were being touted for over €1,000 on the Internet. One could say that we should let the market decide and so on and I have heard of the possibility of a constitutional issue. What are people saying? Are we going to do something or kick it down the road? My view is that we need to do something. We have seen the demand for tickets. No one has mentioned it, but let us discuss the elephant in the room: Garth Brooks. Who remembers that? There was extraordinary demand. Even though there were many tickets over many nights, that was a phenomenon in itself. I imagine companies like Ticketmaster would not be happy with this legislation, but so what? We put in legislation all the time that companies are not happy with. I believe that concert-goers and young people who buy tickets for different events and so on would be over the moon if we gave a commitment to do something about it. Exorbitant profits are being made. Again, we should ask whether Revenue is aware of these sites and the profits and so on. I would like to think that Revenue is following up on some of these sites that are making major profits in the region of 20 or 30 times the initial price. It is wrong and that is where I am coming from. While I have the opportunity, I want to discuss the issue of gambling, which was mentioned already, and addiction in sport. There is urgent need for legislation to address the glamorisation of gambling and to help curb gambling addiction, which is negatively affecting so many families and individuals throughout the State. While many punters going to sporting events will enjoy the atmosphere and place modest bets on races, many others from all walks of life have a gambling problem or addiction that will affect their families and loved ones for their entire lives. Yet, a vast amount of these sporting events and concerts are sponsored by gambling companies. The easy accessibility and normalisation of online and offline betting is a curse for many families and individuals. In other EU countries health warnings follow gambling and the associated dangers. These warnings alert the viewers to the dangers of gambling. Ireland needs to follow suit. Legislation is coming down the tracks. However, it would be wrong for us to leave this aspect out of the debate. Gambling and online betting can bring short joy to some but unfortunately many lives have been destroyed by this addiction. It is time that we finally legislate and tackle the gambling addition that we are facing in our society. I welcome this legislation. There is considerable expectation that we will do something on this question. The concern I have is that if we push it down the line too far, we may not have a government and we will be into the next phase and so on. Another point arises if we do not act. It is important that we engage in dotting the i's and crossing the t's but people are getting ripped off. That is the major concern. That is where I am coming from. We are not talking about a few euro here or there; the money is considerable. This is a phenomenon that has to be tackled. What is unfolding is wrong. Let us examine what is done in other jurisdictions. If they can get it right in this area, then we can too. We need to start acting and doing something. We can move forward with this Bill to Committee Stage, where it can be teased out and so on. We need to do this. There is considerable expectation that will happen sooner rather than later.

This area has been in the minds of many young people. If a computer is on in my house late at night, it means someone is trying to buy tickets for something. Broadband comes to mind as an issue because the people in rural Ireland can never seem to get the tickets and we often blame broadband. There is also a tendency to believe in many cases that the tickets are gone because they have been swooped up by people who will then resell them at a major profit. One thing that strikes me from the debate is that there is a great deal of agreement. Everyone agrees that there is a major problem here, that this problem needs to be addressed and that the proposals brought forward by Deputy Quinlivan go a long way to addressing them.The issue which jumps to mind immediately is that, as Deputy Seán Crowe stated, so many people are being ripped off. We had a slogan not so long ago about rip-off Ireland. This is the rip-off Ireland that we need to deal with. If we kick this too far down the road and let it go, I firmly believe that the people who are engaged in this sort of thing will have time to come up with other ways of getting around it and working it out. While I fully appreciate the need to ensure that there are no unintended consequences of any kind, at the same time we need to act. I appreciate what Deputy Niall Collins said, which is that Fianna Fáil supports the Bill but feels that time needs to be allowed for it at the committee. My understanding is that the committee takes plenty of time as it is, without ever putting any limits on matters. That is one of the issues that is raised here regularly. However, the big profiteering that goes on is really the problem. We need to deal with the prices that are being charged at all levels for these tickets. The only way to do that is to put a limit on it. If a person gets a ticket and is going to resell it, he or she should not be able to resell it above a particular limit. I think most people would consider the 10% limit reasonable. Charities, charity exemptions, raffling tickets, selling tickets in bundles along with a meal and all those sorts of things were mentioned. All of those possibilities can be dealt with on Committee Stage. As we know, the committee will invite various groups to come before it, including, I assume, charity organisations. Deputy Eugene Murphy asked if people would be registering for charitable status. I know of a number of organisations trying to do that with Revenue at the moment. It is such an immense task, given all the legal hurdles they have to jump, that I do not think there will be too many trying to go down that road. I would not be overly concerned in that regard. I firmly believe that all the issues that have been raised, including those to which the Minister of State referred, can be dealt with on Committee Stage. There is no reason not to move to Committee Stage as quickly as possible. While we have some degree of progress, the truth is that putting a time limit on it - I presume it is a nine-month limit - sets it too far out. If we could find some agreement or arrangement to bring it closer, that would be a way forward. Deputy Crowe also raised the issue of gambling. I have come across people who have an addiction to gambling and who are also associated with sports. It is all the same world. Many of those people are involved in ticket touting. These are issues that we need to grapple with as quickly as possible. We should not overstate the scale of the problem. The Minister of State indicated that already. However, while we do not want to overstate the scale of the problem - it may be quite small in one sense - we have to consider the scale of it for the people who run into it. What of the teenager whose heart is set on going to a concert for three or four years because a star is coming to town but discovers that he or she cannot get a ticket because the price is five times face value? A relative, godmother or someone else goes off and pays an exorbitant price for the ticket. It is simply not fair. We need to insert some level of fairness into this because the scale of the problem is huge for those who are caught up in it. A point was made earlier about the companies that are engaged in this and the loss of jobs. There are two kinds of industries. There is the kind that provides a genuine product or service at a reasonable price that reflects the cost and the effort that goes into the product or service. Then there is the kind of service which is just a rip-off. I do not think we should be promoting or trying to sustain any industry which is setting out to rip people off. We need to be careful that we do not do that in this case. I commend the Bill as it stands. I understand the amendment is about kicking this down the road a little bit but I think we can come to an arrangement in that regard. I think that is the way forward. I commend Deputy Maurice Quinlivan and other Members who came forward with similar Bills that have not yet reached the floor of this House. A level of agreement is something that we need. When we have it, let us use it and not let it slip through our fingers.

It is clear that there is a great deal of support and agreement on the need for legislation, the tightening of the rules and fair play. This has been acknowledged in all interventions. At its base, the Bill has the desire to address the issue of so-called ticket touting which has received, as I stated, widespread media and social media commentary in recent months. The responses in the public consultation process, which closed at the end of March, contain a considerable amount of useful information about the operation of the primary and secondary ticket markets, the scale of ticket resale, the sources of tickets put up for resale and the price levels achieved on the secondary ticket market. They also reveal sharp differences of view on possible future measures. I note that my colleague, Deputy Rock, who also produced a Bill on this issue, is planning a dialogue with all parties that made submissions as part of the Minister's public consultation. He is inviting them to come together and discuss their views on implementation ahead of the Bill moving to Second Stage. I commend Deputy Quinlivan on the Bill. The Government has made a commitment to deal with the ticket touting issue for UEFA 2020 and the Rugby World Cup 2023. I hope it is dealt with well in advance of that. This will not be delayed by the current exercise. Deputy Niall Collins acknowledged the constitutional issue of property rights and whether one can go down the route of licensing. It is clearly a complex matter when constitutional issues are at stake. Deputy Eugene Murphy acknowledged the importance of the matter and reaching agreement on a resolution. Deputy Martin Kenny commented that everyone agrees. I accept that. Deputy Crowe commented on the role of Revenue and whether these ticket sites are making money and paying their taxes. Revenue could be asked to make a submission to the committee during its hearings about any sites that are involved in ticket sales. I also understand that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission-----

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which is an independent body, is currently investigating the ticket resale market from a competition law angle. It will publish a report soon. I agree with Deputy Crowe that gambling, which is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality, is a scourge that impacts on people and can destroy lives and the lives of families. As indicated earlier, the responses have been put up on the website of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to encourage further consideration of all the issues involved and to encourage all interested parties to examine them. In addressing the issue of ticket resale, I believe that this House will agree that there is an overarching need to be sure that any legislation, if proposed as part of any plan to address the issues, is carefully examined and that any such legislation would be effective and targeted and would not give rise to unwelcome and unintended consequences such as the driving of ticket reselling underground or diverting it to other countries with no real benefit to consumers. The Bill will go to committee. I am no longer a member of the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Like all committees, it is extremely busy. It has set out a work programme. A considerable amount of time will need to be spent on this important work. Nine months was given to allow for that as well as the fact that we have a break from July to mid-September. The nine months does not mean that it cannot be dealt with in two months, if that is what the committee decides. The committee ultimately, however, has to decide how it can fit it in. If it can come back before the summer recess with recommendations, that would be great and it can be moved from there. Again, I thank all Deputies for their comments on the Bill.

The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Doyle, in his submission as part of the Government's consultation process basically stated that legislation needs to be urgently implemented in order to prevent the secondary sale of tickets at inflated prices online and outside of venues.Kicking it down the road by nine months does not show any urgency. This is a huge problem. I mentioned the Rugby World Cup earlier, which is another big problem coming up. World Rugby will make a decision as to what country will hold the 2023 Rugby World Cup this November. By kicking this down the road by nine months, no progress on legislation on ticket touting will have been made by then. This could affect the overall decision. I am not saying it will, but that is the concern I have. France, which is another candidate for the Rugby World Cup, has strong ticket touting legislation already in place. If the Minister of State kicks the can down the road for nine months, it will be a regrettable decision. We will all regret it. Everything in the Minister of State's amendment can be dealt with on Committee Stage so, again, I do not know why he proposes in the amendment that the Bill be deemed to be read a Second Time in nine months' time. Fianna Fáil indicated it might favour a shorter time but did not say what that would be. We are open to a shorter time but we will press this if the Minister of State holds out for nine months because that is far too long. I commend everyone who spoke in this debate, including Deputy Eugene Murphy, Deputy Niall Collins, Deputy Crowe, Deputy Martin Kenny and the Minister of State. We have outlined our position. We put the Bill forward in good faith. We believe all the issues in the Government amendment can be discussed in committee but nine months is far too long.
