          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_14">The purpose of this meeting is to consider the Road Traffic Bill 2006 which was referred to the Select Committee by the Dáil on 21 June 2006. I welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and his officials to the committee. Before we proceed with the main business, I propose that the sitting should continue until consideration of the Bill has concluded. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Members should note that amendments Nos. 79 and 84 tabled by Deputies Shortall and Olivia Mitchell, have been disallowed. Amendments Nos. 81 and 94 have also been disallowed as they involve a charge. Amendment No. 83, tabled by Deputy Olivia Mitchell, has also been disallowed on this ground. Amendment No. 89, also in Deputy Olivia Mitchell's name, has been disallowed as the provisions it seeks to enact on the consolidation of the Road Traffic Acts are a matter for the Dáil.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_16">I object to the Chair's ruling on amendment No. 79 to the effect that it is outside the scope of the Bill. The Bill contains miscellaneous provisions on a disparate number of items. Parking is an important and pressing traffic management issue on which I have received representations from parliamentary colleagues across the country. There are questions to be answered on how to deal with parking locally. Different arrangements are required in different areas depending on conditions. Currently, local authorities do not have the scope to introduce different types of parking schemes. I ask that we amend the Bill to allow local authorities to introduce parking schemes by statutory instrument.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_17">My more specific amendment No. 84 on the same issue has also been disallowed. Parking is a practical problem for local authorities with which they cannot deal. Local authorities and the Department have accepted that it will require specific legislation to resolve the matter. If one cannot include provisions on the management of parking in a Road Traffic Bill, where in the name of God is one to put them instead? It seems sensible and timely to introduce these amendments. No charge is involved and it seems unreasonable to refuse to allow discussion at least. I would be quite happy for the Minister to introduce his own amendment on Report Stage to accomplish the same end. It is from a purely practical perspective that I wish to deal with the matter. It would be great if the Minister could deal with it.</p>

On the principle of the issue, Deputies may be aware that this impacts on places such as Croke Park, etc. I have met the groups concerned and have accepted that there are issues to be resolved.

I am aware that similar issues arise in regard to Thurles, etc. We must be careful when seeking to address this problem that we do so on a national basis. I am not sure how this will be framed or what it will contain. In that regard, we must engage in a process. I am proposing that we try to deal with this issue between now and the end of the year, at which time I intend to introduce another road traffic Bill. We must try to put in place a formula to deal with this issue. It is not easy——</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I stated on Second Stage that other issues, some of which were raised by members of the Opposition, remain to be tied down further and that this would require the introduction of a further road traffic Bill. It is not possible to resolve some of them now and in light of the pressure to deal with the three main issues in this legislation, I do not wish to delay it. We can deal with the other issues later in the year by way of another road traffic Bill. I agree with Deputies on many of the issues they raised. However, dealing with some of the other issues would have required putting in place a drafting process and this would have delayed the passage of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I have not tabled any amendments to this section but I have received a number of queries in respect of it. They arise out of the Supreme Court judgment in 2003 in Browne <i>v.</i> the Attorney General and the Minister and the 2005 judgment in Kennedy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, which held that ministerial regulations transposing EU directives must be made under provision of Irish primary legislation. I am not certain but I think this is potentially serious. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position. In my opinion, questions arise regarding the implications of penalties derived from EU legislation and imposed under the Road Traffic Acts before now. I refer here to penalties imposed on people for failure to comply with NCT requirements. Are these valid now?</p>
          <p eId="para_41">I do not know if the Minister has obtained legal advice on the matter but perhaps he will reply to some questions. Does our failure to introduce the provisions of this section before now have implications for regulations already in force? I have the details of the two judgments concerned and they appear to indicate that there are implications in that regard. Will the provisions of this section apply retrospectively in light of the two Supreme Court judgments?</p>

          <p eId="para_44">I understand that judgments passed and fines applied will stand. There will be no interference with what happened heretofore. I will read the ruling for the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The section seeks to address the issues that arose, as the Deputy correctly points out, from the Supreme Court judgments in the Browne and Kennedy cases last year, which held that a provision of domestic legislation cannot be used to transpose EU directives or EU policy unless it is clear that such delegated legislation is authorised by the principles and policies of the primary legislation. In the absence of this new provision, all regulations of domestic law to give effect to EU policies must be made under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972. The section will enable EU directives and other EU instruments to be implemented by means of regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts. Use of the latter, as opposed to the European Communities Act, as a basis for making regulations to transpose EU directives into national law will provide greater flexibility in respect of the scope of implementing regulations and the application of sanctions for non-compliance with such regulations. This provision will apply from now on rather than retrospectively. I am informed that fines, etc., applied prior to the introduction of this section will stand.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">Some of the amendments under consideration were tabled by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">My amendments relate to definitions. Amendment No. 2 seeks to insert the phrase "or attempting to drive" after the word "driving". This may relate to when one is stopped at traffic lights with the engine running and one is neither parked nor driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Similarly, in terms of the use of mobile telephones, the intention is to clarify matters and ensure that there are no potential loopholes in the legislation. Amendment No. 3 seeks to replace the phrase "hold a mobile phone" with "hold, use or attempt to hold or use a mobile phone".</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Amendment No. 4 deals with parking. The Minister stated earlier that what I am seeking is covered in the original Act. However, I think it is reasonable to include in the Bill, as set out in the amendment, what is meant by "driving".</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Amendment No. 18 is dependent on acceptance of amendment No. 12 and it provides a definition of the word "parked".</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_34" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_60">This arises out of the Second Stage debate and is an attempt to bring even more clarity to what is envisaged in this section. That is the reason I tabled amendments Nos. 11, 13 and 17. It has long been signalled that the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving would be prohibited but that hands-free mobile phones would not come within the scope of the ban. The purpose of section 3(1) is to put an end to the practice of holding a phone to one's ear by hand, by cradling it between the neck and shoulder or by some contrived method of supporting the phone using the body.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">To avoid any possible doubt concerning the extent of the prohibition provided for in section 3(1) in respect of the ban on holding a mobile phone while driving a motor vehicle, I have brought forward a number of amendments. Amendment No. 17 clarifies the definition of a mobile phone for the purpose of the prohibition of the holding of a mobile phone under section 3(1) so as to definitively remove hands-free mobile phones from the prohibition. A hands-free device is defined in amendment No. 11 as a device designed so that when in use in conjunction with a mobile phone there is no need for the user to hold the phone by hand. These amendments put technologies and devices which obviate the need to hold a mobile phone by hand, such as bluetooth, firmly outside the scope of the prohibition under the section. Amendment No. 13, relating to the definition of the word "hold", is designed to strengthen the prohibition concerning supporting a mobile phone between the neck and the shoulder.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">Amendments Nos. 2, 12 and 18 were presumably tabled on the erroneous assumption that driving is not defined for the purpose of the road traffic law. I appreciate the motivation behind these amendments but they are unnecessary if the word "driving" is already defined. Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 provides that driving includes managing and controlling a vehicle. This definition will apply in regard to this section. Section 23 provides that the Bill, if enacted, will be construed with other Road Traffic Acts and read together. This long-standing definition has passed the test of time in terms of the implementation and enforcement of road traffic law and I have no reason to believe that it will be found wanting in this Bill. This definition has stood up and I do not want to tinker with it in any way and open up another avenue in the courts, particularly as it has firmly held its position since 1961. I appreciate what the Deputy is trying to do but I received strong legal advice that it would be foolish to open up an avenue by changing the definition. That definition is very much set in stone and covers everything in the Deputy's amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">I did not realise that this amendment was included in the group. It is slightly different because it does not involve a definition. In the legislation, passengers are allowed the use a hand-held mobile phones. I wanted to extend the prohibition to people who are supervising learner drivers. It is reasonable that the person who may be obliged to take control of the car should also be prohibited from using a hand-held mobile phone.

          <p eId="para_72">In regard to amendment No. 6, technology is moving at such a fast rate that one does not know what type of equipment may be designed to overcome the ban. The Minister should, therefore, be allowed more flexibility to outlaw new equipment that may become available.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_73">The need to have a flexible legislative framework to regulate in-vehicle communications technology that poses particular road safety risks in a speedy manner and without being obliged to resort to primary legislation on each occasion was recognised by the House on Second Stage. Given the pace and scale of innovation in respect of in-vehicle technologies, many Deputies referred to the challenge of devising legislation that is sufficiently broad and flexible to enable appropriate regulatory responses to be made as we move forward in regard to driver distraction risks associated with these technologies.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">In light of the Second Stage debate, I reviewed section 3(4) and 3(5), which provide the means to regulate these technologies, and section 3(9), which defines the technologies that may be regulated, with a view to ensuring that these provisions are sufficiently robust and comprehensive to cater for future regulatory needs. I am satisfied that section 3(4), as drafted, provides a sufficiently broad base so as to capture the ever increasing array of in-vehicle technologies and equipment such as mobile phones, other communications systems, navigational aids and entertainment equipment that are daily coming onto the market. As the stated purpose of any regulations to be made under section 3(4) must be to avoid impairment or interference with the driving capacity of the driver of the vehicle, I do not consider it appropriate to provide for the promotion of driving with due care and attention as an additional purpose for the making of regulations as proposed in amendment No. 5.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">In regard to amendment No. 6, irrespective of the use of any equipment or any activity undertaken in a motor vehicle, a person is obliged to drive with due care and attention and failing to do so would leave that person open to prosecution for careless or dangerous driving depending on the seriousness of the circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_76">I welcome these provisions, particularly that which relates to entertainment equipment. Young drivers, in particular, often drive around to the accompaniment of what sounds like a mobile disco. If we can hear the music outside, what must it be like inside the vehicle. We all like to listen to the radio but I do not how they can concentrate on driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Regarding the making of regulations, has consideration been given to making a regulation that motor manufacturers should build in systems for mobile phone use, just as we have had regulations that all new cars must be fitted with air bags and so on? I accept that there might be practical difficulties in light of the variety of mobile phones. However, people would be obliged to take that into consideration when buying mobile phones.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">There are myriad systems. Much of what is required as standard in a vehicle is set down in EU regulations. There is no compulsion to have a mobile phone system in a car. Given that there are so many different systems, I could not specify one over another. Some vehicle manufacturers include a hands-free systems in their vehicles. If that is to be seen as a technical feature of a car which has to be delivered, it will be decided at European level where a standard can be established. The same is true of a range of other matters, as we will see as we progress.</p>

It would be sufficient to provide that those involved should be acting in response to a genuine emergency. I could ring the Garda about having my passport application signed or to make a casual inquiry and it would certainly not be an emergency. The provision could, however, be used as a way of avoiding penalty points or a conviction. If one has a pay-as-you-go mobile phone, one’s telephone calls will not be recorded. A definition of “call” would be useful as some may assert that they were trying to ring the Garda, suggesting they had seen something which was an emergency. My aim is to tighten the legislation. If the Minister was to remove section 3(7)(<i>a</i>), the provisions would be tighter but still cover those circumstances in which people face genuine emergencies.</p>

I thank Deputy Mitchell for prompting the ban with her own proposals earlier in the year. However, it occurred to me some time ago that where people drove cars with tinted windows, the ban would be unworkable. While many are enthusiastic about their cars and like to make modifications, what argument is there for allowing tinted windows? It will certainly be the case that they will make the law on mobile phones unenforceable, on which ground they should not be permitted. It is also the case that tinted windows make it impossible to tell who is driving a car. It might be a 12 year old minor but where the windows are tinted, it will not be possible to tell if the law is being broken. It seems fundamental that where a person drives a mechanically propelled vehicle, gardaí should be able to see who it is. I do not know if other jurisdictions allow their use, but the legislation before us brings the matter to a head. I hope the Minister will take a positive approach to my amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">I can see the point the Deputy makes and do not disagree with her. Clearly, we do not have a standard and should develop one. EU specifications on vehicles set out gradings for windows. On an ordinary day I find it very difficult to see through any windscreen owing to the reflection of the sun. People tell me they wave at me but I ignore them. However, I do not know who is in the car. Based on the Deputy's submission, it is clear that we must develop a standard. While she has a valid point, I cannot legislate for it in this Bill as to do so would cause problems in the absence of a specific standard. We will have to obtain approval and agreement at EU level if a standard is to be established. The principle the Deputy sets out is correct and we will have to consider how we should deal with the matter. It is not open to me to address it immediately, as there are EU-wide general specifications in place which I cannot unilaterally dismiss. Standards for cars are agreed at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">The Deputy's point is that we must lead a debate or consultative process and secure agreement to do so. We can do it alone if our EU partners do not object, but it would be better, owing to the EU-wide specifications set down, that we should do it together. The Deputy's point is valid.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">As previously stated, a chief inspector can authorise a roadblock outside Mooney's public house at 6 p.m. every day for the next week. However, there must be a limit. The time must be finite, so one cannot say that it will continue for a month or a year. There must be some limit to the authorisation. Otherwise it will not be a protection, which is what we said would be needed if one introduced what we regard as fairly draconian legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">Section 4 outlines the scheme for roadside alcohol testing known as mandatory alcohol testing and the legal basis for the establishment and operation of Garda checkpoints. Mandatory alcohol tests can be pursued only on the specific authorisation of an officer of the Garda not below the rank of inspector. That authorisation must be in writing and must clearly establish the place, date and any times between which it may be operated. An authorisation may straddle two separate dates. However, the hours during which the checkpoint may be established must be clearly set out in the authorisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The amendment proposed seems to envisage that an authorisation may extend for a period of up to eight days. That could not be the case, based on the provisions presented in the text of the section. Authorisations will have to be very specific and I stated in the introduction to the Second Stage debate that it is envisaged that the Garda Commissioner will prepare detailed guidelines for the operation of the checkpoints that will address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">When setting up a checkpoint, there is a need for absolute transparency in procedures. The wording in this section was carefully drafted with that in mind following a significant consultation process with the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General in order to achieve the correct balance and proportionality, an issue we discussed at length.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">The matter is not as the Deputy interpreted it. I know that she tabled the amendment because she feels that we are approaching the issue in a different way, but it will be date-specific. That is very important, based on the advice received and what has been agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I asked the Minister on Second Stage to explain how he overcame the constitutional difficulties that he experienced last year. When he briefed us, he spoke of proportionality and the right to bodily integrity. I cannot understand how a senior garda's authorisation can override those two constitutional considerations, if they existed in the first instance. Perhaps the Minister might explain the thinking in the Department of Transport or the Office of the Attorney General regarding the position last year, the kinds of problems foreseen and how they have been overcome.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_140">The answer is clear. A range of different models involving countries with random breath-testing were considered. Examining the legal basis in those countries was also important because there were similarities to our legal system. We then tried to frame an approach to mandatory alcohol testing based on the best legal advice available, not only from the Attorney General's perspective but drawing on external expertise. We attempted to design a system.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">When I saw earlier discussions and drafts in this regard, it seemed that one could include and prescribe everything, even the kitchen sink. That is one approach. However, one would get oneself tied up in legal difficulties and procedures. We tried to overcome this issue, which was quite genuine. My officials can confirm that they were frustrated in some respects trying to meet the best criteria. There was an enormous focus on this in both external and internal legal advice, including that offered by the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I take Deputy Olivia Mitchell's point that when considering legislation, one will always find some legal person to stress a different perspective. We produced this scheme, thinking that coupling the authorisation of a senior Garda officer not below the rank of inspector with guidelines to be approved by the Garda Commissioner to ensure that everyone did the same thing would show a clear attempt at proportionality. It would recognise individual rights as opposed to the greater needs of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Many views were expressed regarding what approach one might take because procedures vary between countries. Eventually, we reached the point where, on all the issues, the best advice and belief was that we had the most robust system for which we could legislate. We believe that it will stand up in the courts on foot of the way in which it was framed by the legal people to give effect to a policy that we all wish to see implemented. I accept the Deputy's contention that other legal people may hold different views.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">I am sorry to dwell on this, but it is probably the Bill's most important aspect. There was a view that if the Government had moved to deal with this issue sooner, many accidents could have been avoided. When we pursued this last year, comments were made about perceived stumbling blocks. I cannot understand how a Garda inspector signing an authorisation can circumvent those perceived constitutional difficulties. We are owed an explanation, particularly as it suddenly seems that there is no problem. I just cannot figure out what happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">I will try to be helpful. The original view was that the existing law and the way in which it was implemented was extremely robust. That view was confirmed when clarity was brought by the Attorney General. We have mandatory breath tests, so some wondered what was the issue. The view was that the law, if implemented in a specific way, would be robust enough and as good as exists in many other countries. The other view was that the position was not strong. Lawyers argued this and people were trying to put together the different views and methodologies to arrive at a solution that advanced what we desired. I took the view that we needed to advance the law beyond where it was and that the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing — without forming an opinion or without there being an accident — was a step that we needed to take. There was a view that we could never do that under the Constitution. Some people still hold that view.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">The Attorney General never said that a constitutional problem existed. It is true that there are constitutional issues involved. It came down to issues such as proportionality. An example would be how to manage a situation where one garda in a particular area was being vindictive. One must be able to go before the courts and clearly demonstrate that proportionality was used when the checkpoints were established. An argument was put forward that it would not be acceptable to merely set this down in legislation, without putting in place a provision to the effect that a garda from the rank of inspector up would be obliged to stand over a decision to set up a random breath test checkpoint on the side of a road. These arguments are continually churned around and we will never reach the point where everybody is in agreement. The Attorney General devoted an enormous amount of time to get the framework in place to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">We had a discussion on the practical application of these issues. We wanted to ensure that breath testing could be carried out at the side of the road. The Garda Síochána was involved in that discussion and we wanted to be sure that gardaí were happy with the framing of the legislation. We do not want them back in the courts. We wanted to keep the legislation as robust and as straightforward as possible. Eventually, we obtained a framework that we believe is robust. The Garda Commissioner will be obliged to set out the guidelines so that a uniform approach will be achieved.</p>

There cannot be any disparity between checkpoints in different areas. There was some discussion on whether this should be set out in legislation. My view is that it is not the right approach.

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_179">"(1) Whenever a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of alcohol, or a drug or drugs, to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle, he may require—</p>

          <p eId="para_182">This amendment is intended to ease implementation of the Bill. This issue, which I also raised on Second Stage, relates to mandatory roadside breath testing. It envisages a successful roadblock at which one might detect five, six, or 16 people with heightened alcohol levels. Although I imagine that the Garda presence at such roadblocks will be substantial, it will not amount to 16 gardaí. While the use of a van to carry out the evidential testing will be all well and good, such a measure will not be available throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">As the Minister is aware, it will, therefore, be necessary to bring the offenders to a station within three hours. In the context of organising the system to transfer such offenders, the amendment proposes that a garda would not be obliged to bring them to a station. This is a function that could be outsourced, for want of a better term. Perhaps, after its establishment, members of the new Garda reserve could be responsible for so doing, possibly under the supervision of full-time gardaí. Certainly however, gardaí should not be obliged to escort each individual because this would mean that roadblocks would have to be abandoned. If the operation of such roadblocks will be limited to a number of hours, Garda time should not be wasted by the need for officers to accompany individuals to Garda stations in respect of evidential breath tests. The amendment is designed to allow the Minister to get someone else to so do, if necessary.</p>

          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_210">"(4A) Subsections (2) to (4) shall apply to a person who is the holder of a learner permit as if the references therein to 50, 67 and 22 were references to 20, 27 and 9 respectively.".".</p>
          <p eId="para_211">This amendment relates to setting lower blood alcohol limits. It is beyond dispute that Ireland has a serious problem in respect of drink driving. Moreover, in recent years various reports have demonstrated the existence of a general cultural problem with drinking. It seems, therefore, to make no sense for Irish drink driving laws to be more liberal than those of most other EU countries. Only two other EU 15 states also allow blood alcohol limits of 80 millilitres.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I presume it is the intention of the Minister and all members that this long-promised legislation will send out a clear message and that the driving public should view it as the establishment of a new regime. The alignment of Irish drink driving laws and limits with the EU standard would send out a clear and unambiguous message. Hence, I suggest the limit should be reduced from 80 millilitres to 50 millilitres.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Last year, a number of Deputies, including Deputy Olivia Mitchell, raised an issue to which the Minister also referred on a number of occasions, namely, the requirement to send a stronger message to those learning to drive to the effect that inexperienced drivers cannot afford to drink at all. This would bring Ireland into line with practices in most of the rest of Europe, whereby the consumption of any alcohol by learner drivers is not allowed. It should also be noted that other countries, as well as not permitting them to drink, do not allow them to drive unaccompanied either.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I suggest that the limit should be reduced to a minimal level. Such a limit would be required to allow for prescribed medication and so on. However, it is time for the House to take a stand in this regard. A strong message should be sent to the public to the effect that the old ways must end, that a new regime is in place and that the stricter laws in respect of drink driving will be enforced. While one can have as many weekend Garda campaigns as one pleases, the incidence of a significant number of fatalities at weekends will continue in the absence of a serious effort to tackle this problem. Although passing legislation is one matter, the Minister must take a clear stand and members should be unambiguous in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">There is no reason for Ireland to be out of kilter with the rest of Europe. As Ireland has a bigger problem with alcohol than most other countries, it should at least have a similar legal and enforcement regime as those which obtain in the rest of Europe. The case against lowering the limit is, therefore, inarguable.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">I have some sympathy with the Deputy's point. This issue, and others to which I have already referred in respect of young drivers, must be examined. Undoubtedly, international practice has begun to demonstrate that such measures have an effect. I note that there is good public acceptance of the forthcoming newer, tougher and stronger legislation and changes. In general, there is a strong consensus on many of the issues we are attempting to resolve and it is important that this should be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">As the Deputy is aware, the current road strategy will end at the close of this year. Although the Deputy's proposed measure was not part of it, that is not to say that it is not a good thing to do. The road safety authority and its board are examining a range of issues, including that under discussion. I have asked it to come forward with its preferred strategy for the next few years. However, public awareness must be built up in order to achieve consensus in this regard. As all members are aware, this is a difficult issue. It is my view that if one has any drink taken, one should not drive. Everyone should operate on a zero-alcohol basis. I do not——</p>

If we opt, as we undoubtedly will, for a graduated learner driver permit system, I want to know what we will do. It would be pre-emptive to jump in and adopt this measure without being familiar with the policy framework and intended objectives. While I am aware that the principles are known, further detail is required. I must, therefore, marry the legislative base to the detail as to what will be done. This issue had been articulated by Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Shortall and me. However, given the Bill's importance, I deliberately decided — correctly or otherwise — not to try to incorporate this matter into the legislation for the reasons I expressed earlier. However, further legislation will be required to so do.</p>

          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_224">That is not good enough. The Minister has been talking about road safety for the past two years. Moreover, his predecessor did so for several years before that. There is no denying that the outcome of the road safety strategy has been abysmal. We must make a dramatic change in the culture of road use. Last year and early this year, issues highlighted by Deputies were placed on the long finger and were intended to dealt with in the Road Traffic Bill 2006. However, when Deputies highlighted the gaps in the Bill, they were told that the issues must be discussed further and will be dealt with in a later road traffic Bill. There is always a reason for procrastinating. Surely road safety should be the priority of the Minister for Transport. Clearly, it is not being given priority because many areas remain to be considered fully. It does not require much thought to decrease the blood alcohol limit to zero in respect of learner drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Deputy Olivia Mitchell referred to graduated licences — I tabled an amendment on this matter — and the need for a 12-month period of restricted driving for those who pass the driving test. However, my point is that there is no defence for allowing those with provisional licences to drive under the influence of alcohol. During the course of the year, the Minister has made this point publicly and his comments have been welcomed. However, he has fallen at the first fence in terms of taking action on it in legislation. One cannot continue to place on the long finger road safety measures that are urgently required. Deputies have tabled constructive amendments to tighten up the position. We accept that votes will be lost but the Minister must act in the greater public interest. I cannot understand why he is not prepared to bite the bullet.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">I move amendment No. 29:<entity refersTo="#bill.2006.28.dail.3.amd_29" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_241">In page 6, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_242">"5.—Where a person applies to renew a learner permit but has not taken the driving test since the previous occasion on which the person was granted a permit, the licensing authority shall refuse the application if it is satisfied that the person has failed to take reasonable steps to obtain and fulfil an appointment to take the driving test.".</p>
          <p eId="para_243">This amendment relates to learner drivers. Currently, a person who wishes to renew his or her provisional licence must apply for and produce evidence that he or she has applied for a driving test before the licence can be renewed. It is clear this system is being abused by learner drivers. The result is that people can continue to drive for ten, 15 or 20 years without ever undergoing a driving test. That is completely unacceptable. People are availing of this loophole. We know that last year 23,000 driving tests were cancelled. Given that less than 150,000 tests are being undertaken in a year, 23,000 is a small number. However, this is very costly to the taxpayer and a complete and utter waste of resources and time. The unused slots could be better used by those who are serious about learning to drive.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The amendment seeks to bring to an end the practice whereby people can continue to renew their provisional driving licence <i>ad infinitum</i>. Members will be aware from replies to parliamentary questions that thousands of people continue to drive on provisional licences for in excess of five or ten years. This should not be allowed. If we are serious about dealing with the issue of learner drivers and getting value for money from the outsourcing proposals and productivity bonus schemes for the number of testers available, we should ensure slots are used wisely. We must bring to an end this practice as the system is being abused by many. Acceptance of the amendment would close the loophole and ensure people would be obliged to undergo a driving test.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Were the Minister to seek to immediately stop the practice whereby people can drive unaccompanied which is unprecedented in the rest of Europe, there would be general support for such a move. He should not be overly concerned about losing votes on this issue, given that there is widespread support for tighter road safety measures, including for learner drivers. Were he to bite the bullet, it would at least ensure that those driving on the road would be obliged to undergo a driving test within a two year period. That is the very least we should expect.</p>

The Minister is now saying he will close off the loophole as soon as waiting lists are brought under control. It is a chicken and egg situation. When will the lists be brought under control? The additional 45,000 tests are only a drop in the ocean and will not impact on the lists to a great degree.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">The different elements of the combined effort, namely, increased productivity, the bonus scheme, late evening and weekend working, extra contract staff, as well as staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food, will deliver approximately 120,000 tests. This will have an enormous impact on waiting lists. The Deputy is correct in saying this issue has been discussed at length. However, we now have in place a process to tackle the backlog. She might at least give me credit for trying to address this fundamental problem.</p>

In that regard I have raised it with the road safety authority which was only recently established but which has already held more than five board meetings. It is heavily engaged on a range of issues, including this one. I have asked people to give of their time to serve on the board which is functioning very well and to come back to me with suggestions on the way forward on these policy issues.

          <p eId="para_260">This amendment also relates to the status of drivers. It deals with an issue about which the Minister has spoken on a number of occasions and on which he has obtained much publicity. He has also received much support from the Opposition and would have the support of the public were he to provide that, where drivers commit serious driving offences, they, as part of the penalty imposed, should be required to retake the driving test. He has already promoted this idea, on which we have supported him. I am now seeking to ensure we enshrine it in legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_261">The amendment appears to relate to the holder of a driving licence who has been disqualified for committing certain offences and proposes that such a person, having served a period of disqualification, should automatically forfeit his or her driving licence; that when he or she applies for a provisional licence, he or she would be entitled to drive unaccompanied for a period of one year only, unless by the end of that year he or she passes a driving test. Section 26 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 provides the court with the power to require a person who has been disqualified under a consequential order to obtain a certificate of competency by successfully undergoing the driving test as a prerequisite to having his or her driving licence restored. As regards driving unaccompanied on a provisional licence, the road traffic (licensing of drivers) regulations 1999 to 2004 provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the circumstances in which a provisional licence holder has to be accompanied by and under the supervision of a qualified driver. The power to make regulations concerning when a learner permit has effect is being restated at section 10 (2) (<i>k</i>) of the Bill which amends section 42 of the Act. In view of this, I ask that Deputy Shortall withdraw the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">Yes. I agree with the Deputy that this needs to be more definitively in place. If a person is disqualified for drink driving he or she should have to resit the test. It is something I am very keen to see implemented. I expect to see it in a package of upcoming proposals. We will do it at a time when there is public belief in it. It must have credibility. A proposal that could result in one's livelihood or family being damaged because one cannot get a test for a year is not sustainable and would not stand up in any court. There must be a regime in place in which one can have reasonably quick access to a driving test.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">This goes back to the failure to take adequate and appropriate action in this area. The Minister has been saying this for the past two years.

Will the Minister be still saying the same thing in ten years' time?</p>

          <p eId="para_267">I will not. The Deputy knows as well as I that not long after taking office I dealt with the issue and put in place a proposal. It was not I who delayed this. It was delayed for more than a year by people who, legitimately, brought issues to the Labour Relations Commission, to arbitration and so on, when it was eventually found that my proposal was the best way forward. There are procedures in place that I must observe. It took two years and that was a source of severe frustration from my point of view. I could see no other alternative. Eventually I was found to be correct.</p>

          <p eId="para_268">That is not the full story. That was on the net point of outsourcing. The staff complement within the driver testing section is not adequate to deal with the demand, given the increase in population, the increase in car driving and so on. It is a completely outdated service. It does not have a proper IT system. It has no way of dealing with cancellations. More than 40% of its income is derived from travel and subsistence allowances. It is easy to bash the driver testers and say we need changes in work practices. However, the Minister is responsible for the system that allows people to be paid for driving around the country instead of for carrying out driving tests. There are many issues which are presented in the Farrell Grant Sparks report, which contains the wider view of the action the Minister needs to take as opposed to the ideological battles he takes on.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">We have previously discussed "alcolocks". They are being mentioned more and more in the media. An alcolock is a device which prevents the driver from starting the engine until he or she blows into the device which registers the concentration of blood alcohol. It is the in early stages of use in other countries. It is an option in some Australian states. Members of the committee who visited Australia might be aware of the device. The offender is required to use this device in lieu of a recorded penalty. Sweden and Finland are seeking permission from the European Commission to introduce the device in respect of certain categories of driver. The UK includes a provision for its use in its latest road traffic legislation. It is hoped the technology will become widely available. This amendment is an enabling amendment to allow the Minister to include the use of this device as part of the overall armoury in tackling road traffic offences. It would be a good idea to have included in this legislation in the event of the success of the technology in other countries when we could implement its use by commencing the section.</p>

It clearly would be premature to legislate before we know what it is we are legislating for and what needs to be in place. I have no issue with the principle of this. However, if motor manufacturers are to be required to install such equipment in cars, it will be an EU-wide issue that will have to be dealt with under the EU type-approval system for motor vehicles. We are closely monitoring the testing being carried on at present and discussing the regimes that are in place. There is a range of issues including the relationship with the courts, the Garda Síochána, who will monitor, who will maintain, who will provide the information, who will police the system. All of this will have to be thought through. It is another issue that is being articulated in the mix of a range of issues that have been discussed recently. I will await the outcome of those discussions and developments. There would be no point in introducing legislation because it is likely I would have to amend it. I do not know what I would be legislating on at the moment given the range of interaction systems that would be required to make it work.</p>

I have set up the road safety authority. I have given it a mandate to look into this. I spoke to its members individually before they took on their role. I explained to them what I wanted them to do. They are geared up to do it. There is no point in asking these people to do that on a very short timeframe because there will have to be a replacement for the road safety strategy that ends this year. All these issues are being considered in the context of a new road safety strategy. That is how I propose to deal with a range of these issues.

          <p eId="para_303">The purpose of this amendment is to require people involved in traffic accidents to undergo breath tests. The provision is not a threat to those involved in traffic accidents but rather an attempt to establish a clear picture regarding the causes of crashes. On our trip to Australia, we discovered that every action on road safety in the jurisdiction was informed by rigorous research based on well-documented road-use experience. To provide an example of how we are failing, I recently tabled a parliamentary question on the information sought by the Garda on the form people involved in accidents must complete. On discovering that one of the items of information sought is whether a driver possesses a provisional licence, I submitted a question asking how many of those involved in accidents were provisional licenceholders. No one could provide an answer. While the information is collected, it is not collated or made accessible. Perhaps provisional licenceholders do not have more accidents than their fully licensed counterparts but the information in question is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">We should allow people to be tested for alcohol if they are involved in traffic accidents, even where there is no roadblock in place or reason to suspect they have been drinking. Testing should simply be one of the methods of collecting information at the scene of an accident. I seek also to create an offence of failing to agree to undergo testing, although subsection (6) excludes circumstances in which a person has been seriously injured and is not in a fit state to agree or disagree. Subsection (7) does not remove the obligation to comply with the regulation as soon as possible or medically practicable. It is a reasonable provision to make. While it might be subject to the same difficulties as random breath testing, I am interested to hear the Minister's view.</p>

If a person is unconscious or faints and a garda believes alcohol or drugs have been consumed, a blood or urine sample can be obtained under medical supervision when the person has been transferred to hospital.

If a mandatory provision were made, in circumstances where two people were involved in an accident and one was unconscious, a sample would be taken only from one. A challenge would be mounted in court on the basis of differing treatment and the provisions would not stand.</p>

This is a problematic area with which I attempted to deal in the proceedings on the Road Safety Authority Act 2004. If one does not surrender one's licence, or even if one does so and subsequently drives after disqualification, that must be a fairly serious offence that should attract a fine and a further disqualification. This would ensure that one does not receive one's licence back for a further period.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">My response to this proposal is to refer to the fact that when a person drives a vehicle while disqualified, he or she commits an offence under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. The penalty for that offence is being increased under section 12 to a maximum €5,000 fine or six months in prison. In addition, section 6(2) provides that a conviction for that offence will also attract a consequential disqualification of at least one year. The offence under section 5(13) relates to the failure of the person being disqualified to surrender his or her licence to the licensing authority. Accepting the amendment as proposed would not be proportionate. The penalty provided in the Bill in respect of this offence is adequate. It is a serious offence and the punishment is severe.</p>

In these circumstances, I do not propose to restrict applications for removal being made to the court. Including in the Bill definitions of extraordinary and exceptional circumstances to justify such an application could be cumbersome. It is a matter for the courts to decide. We have toughened the process involved in getting one's licence back and the period of disqualification that must be served. However, it is a matter for the courts to decide what is exceptional.</p>

This amendment seeks to ensure that when an application is made to the courts to have a licence returned, the people so affected would be informed and entitled to make a submission. The third part of the amendment proposes that they would be so informed, regardless of whether they had made a submission. In the case of drivers who, for whatever reason, were involved in a traffic accident which resulted in a fatality, it seems to be extremely hurtful to the loved ones of the deceased to see such drivers back on the road. Frequently, this appears to happen very quickly thereafter, or so it seems to those affected. They should at least be informed that this will happen.</p>

In those cases in which a person who has served one half of the period of disqualification may apply to the court to have the disqualification removed, the amendment seeks to have notifications made by the court to third parties. Moreover, it proposes that third parties may make a submission to the court on the application for removal. Section 7(3) provides that the court, without prejudice to its power to have regard to all of the matters that appear to it to be relevant, may, in particular, have regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the nature of the offence.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">This amendment relates to the default speed limit. It is an issue which arose at the time of the changeover to metric measurements. The default speed limit on non-national roads is 80 km/h. Members are aware that such a limit is completely inappropriate for particular stretches of road which have been photographed by the media. They also know, given accident history, that a non-national road is the most likely place for people to have a serious accident. I, therefore, propose that the default speed limit be reduced to 60 km/h. While stretches of non-national road deemed by a local authority to be safe for faster speeds could be so designated, the default speed limit would be 60 km/h.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">As the Deputy is aware, the Road Traffic Act 2004 which was introduced only 18 months ago provides for a default speed limit of 80 km/h. She may recall that beforehand the national limit had been 60 mph. On moving to metric measurements, this was reduced to 80 km/h which constituted a reduction of 10 mph in the speed limit. The Deputy proposes to reduce the limit to 60 km/h or approximately 37 mph. I am unsure whether this is practicable. However, I took some measures in the Act to take account of this. Many regional roads are now of high quality, particularly given the roll-out of construction programmes. Even some dual carriageways are classed——</p>

          <p eId="para_428">It is very frustrating to see some of the roads on which local authorities have placed limits of 80 km/h or even 100 km/h. I cannot understand it. However, it would be wrong for the central authority to try to manage all regional and local roads. Hence, I permitted local authorities to reduce or increase speed limits on all such roads. Consequently, there is no indication that the limit of 80 km/h, particularly after 18 months, is fundamentally flawed. Although I do not single out anyone for blame, there are issues in respect of a number of regional or non-national roads on which the relevant local authorities should exercise their power. This is not peculiar to any region and is a feature of the locality in which I live. There is huge frustration regarding a recently opened non-national road that is effectively a motorway. The applicable speed limit of 80 km/h could be raised significantly. In fact, the speed limit is 60 km/h and there is uproar over it. However, this is a matter for the local authority to decide.</p>

          <p eId="para_429">Deputy Shortall has raised a significant issue which requires attention. Regardless of the frustration experienced in being obliged to drive more slowly than one would wish, the dangers in driving faster than one should are extreme. One frequently comes across examples where one leaves a national route on entering a town on which the speed limit is 50 km/h. However, one then turns into a laneway, on which the speed limit is 80 km/h.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Admittedly, the speed limit was reduced when metric measurements were adopted. However, the old default signs did not suggest drivers should travel at a particular speed as they simply informed them that they had left restricted areas. As the old signs did not display a number, drivers felt they should drive in a manner appropriate to the condition of the road. However, the erection of an 80 km/h speed limit sign encourages people to drive at that speed. I am unsure whether this amendment would be an appropriate way to deal with the issue. However, a review of speed limits should be mandatory by now. How long has it been since metric measurements were adopted?</p>

          <p eId="para_434">This is a new and important power for local authorities which has a fundamental impact on the entire community. I have told all councillors, including those in my party — this is not a party political issue — that they need to resolve this issue. I recently contacted county managers again to try to raise the matter as a major issue and have it resolved in each local authority area. It is not right for Members of the Oireachtas to try to define the speed limit for every road in the country. However, there is a gap between the power which has been granted and its utilisation by local authorities. Perhaps recent court issues have shaken the tree somewhat in this respect. They may have induced local authorities to consider their actions.</p>

The Act provided that where existing by-laws were in place, there was an automatic transmission, provided that they had been properly passed in the first instance. However, all new limits were obliged to be placed before the relevant council. I agree this is unsatisfactory and a source of frustration for Deputies and Senators on all sides of the Houses but I have done my best to articulate this matter publically and communicate it to local authorities. I did so again recently for the second or third time.</p>

There is a significant problem pertaining to inappropriate speed limits, many of which are too low for the stretches of road concerned. However, the amendment relates to the other side of the coin, where speed limits are too high. We have an extensive network of county roads and it is impossible to erect appropriate speed limit signs everywhere. However, as matters stand, narrow country lanes that do not have a speed limit sign have a default speed limit of 80 km/h, which is ridiculous. The Minister's points relate to a different issue. My point is that, overall, the assumed speed limit for non-national roads should be 60 km/h. Only a minority of roads are of a higher standard. We are talking about the majority of roads, country lanes, boreens in every county. The default speed limit on those roads is 80 km/h, which is completely inapppropriate.</p>

Much of the evidence is anecdotal and I am not sure the majority of roads are poor. No matter what way I strike this, there will always be a different view which is subjective. One of the factors of success in other countries is that there is public buy-in to the road traffic law. People accept that the system is operating fairly and everybody understands the regime. I would not add to public buy-in if I were to instruct every local authority to change the signs. We need a bedding-in period. We need an analysis on the number of roads deemed to be good, by modern standards, and to identify poor roads. At the same time we have to get the local authorities exercised in identifying the roads where specific speed limits need to be imposed. We need some time for that. I thought it would have happened, but it has not.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">This is an issue of which I have become aware over the past couple of years as a result of particular accidents which have taken place — the Minister will be familiar with some of them — where the road surface was undoubtedly a contributory factor. The committee has had correspondence about one such case. When looking into it in more detail, I discovered that when it comes to standards in respect of road surfaces and signs for roadworks and so on, guidelines are set down by the National Roads Authority, failure to comply with which attracts penalties where a contract is in place. If a contractor has to resurface a stretch of road, that is covered, but where a local authority is carrying out the work there are not such guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">There was an accident in Mayo and there are also questions about the bus crash in Meath. In both those situations, the same kind of temporary road surface was in place, with no indication for drivers. In the Mayo case, the cones and signs had all been removed and it was left as if it were a proper road surface on which drivers could travel at 80 km/h. Serious difficulties arise when drivers see what appears to be a normal road. Private contractors are obliged to put up signs indicating a reduction in the speed limit and various markings indicating a temporary surface. This is an issue throughout the country when so many roadworks are going on. It is a very serious gap in the regulations that a local authority is not obliged to ensure proper safety standards. I am proposing that there should be a legal obligation on local authorities to adhere to the guidelines set down and that failure to do so should result in penalties.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">I referred to this earlier. It relates to a matter about which the Minister has been talking for some time and which other people have raised on an ongoing basis. It is the need for a graduated approach to learning to drive, so that it is not just a matter of passing the test and then doing whatever one likes. Most other countries have a graduated system. Statistical evidence indicates that the 12-month period immediately after passing the test is the high risk period. Most countries apply additional restrictions during that period. My understanding is that this would need legislation, but I am open to correction. This amendment would facilitate this without being prescriptive.</p>

I have asked the road safety authority to come back with an entire framework in this area. We need to be fair and to identify the full framework needed. It is seriously engaged on that.

It is not good enough that we have to go through another nine or 12 months without action being taken. If the road safety authority comes up with proposals, let us at least be ready from a legislative standpoint so that we do not have to waste another nine or 12 months saying we have to provide for this in the next road traffic Bill. This two-line amendment would allow the Minister to impose restrictions during that critical period in a person's driving career. The detail can be worked out.</p>

I might be advised that the restriction should be applied for six months but equally it could be for 18 months. In some countries there are restrictions for six months but in others the period is longer. There is no point in defining the period because I do not know what I would be defining. I am not knocking the spirit or principle behind the amendment but it would not, as the Deputy suggests, clear the way for me to act. Until we agree on what should be set out, I will have to come back to Deputies. Let us wait until we have such a framework.

          <p eId="para_548">This amendment may look familiar as I tabled a similar one to the Road Safety Authority Bill 2004. It would set out a clear procedure in respect of penalty points. Up until relatively recently there was no clear process. As the Minister acknowledged, there was a genuine problem about what happened when a person committed an offence for which penalty points were imposed. This gave rise to a number of issues, including who was responsible for ensuring penalty points were recorded, who had to be told and what happened when a person accumulated 12 points. In the amendment I am setting out a clear procedure. Subsections (3) and (4) would close a gap in the law, whereby the Garda Síochána would have jurisdiction to seek the surrender of a licence and would not need a court order to do so. If one pays the relevant fine, the Garda does not have a legal basis for seizing a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Amendment No. 59 deals with penalty points applied for speeding offences in areas where speed limits had been incorrectly applied. When one has penalty points applied by the courts, there is no mechanism for having them removed without having to return to court. It does not seem appropriate that people should be forced to go to court again with all the expense and stress that go with it when it was a mistake that caused them to be there in the first place. The onus should be on the authorities rather than the victim. Can the Minister tell me I am wrong?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_550">Penalty points are endorsed on the entry in the licence record of the person concerned — this is the official record. Penalty points are not recorded on the actual driving licence. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, on receipt of notification from the Garda or the Courts Service that a fixed charge has been paid or the person has been convicted of a penalty point offence, endorses the licence record in the national driver file with the appropriate number of penalty points and issues a notification to the person concerned. They also forward a copy to the Garda Síochána. Requiring the Garda to make further records on the driving licence would lead to excessive administration. For example, penalty points expiring after three years would have to be removed from the driving licence. This could happen at intervals if the licence was endorsed with points on a number of different dates. I would not be inclined to have an additional recording of penalty points as proposed and I therefore ask the Deputy to withdraw her amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Failure by persons to hand up their licences is an issue and we have introduced penalties. We are trying to find a method of pursuing such people and to be seen to be doing it. We need to alert the public to the responsibility on them to hand up their licences.</p>

However, it would be foolish to proceed on these lines until the entire framework covering all these matters is agreed. That is my responsibility.

I am anxious to move on it and my sense is that the board of the Road Safety Authority wants to see action on them. If we are all of the same view, I expect to be coming back to put all these things on a new legislative base. I do not want to pre-empt that process because there will be different definitions.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_600">In page 16, to delete lines 10 to 22 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_601">""(<i>a</i>) a person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction where at the time of the commission of the offence—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_602">(i) he or she had been the holder of a driving licence (other than a learner permit) which had expired beyond its period of validity for a period of not more than 12 months before the commission of the offence, to a fine not exceeding €1,000, or</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_603">(ii) he or she had been the holder of a driving licence (other than a learner permit) which had expired beyond its period of validity for a period in excess of 12 months before the commission of the offence, to a fine not exceeding €2,000,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_604">provided that he or she has received adequate warning from the licensing authority that the driving licence (other than a learner permit) has expired beyond its period of validity.";".</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I feel strongly about this. The Minister is increasing quite significantly the fine for driving for up to two years on an out-of-date licence and somewhat less significantly for a person doing so for up to 12 months. I am requesting, not unreasonably, that people should be informed when their licence is out of date, as we are when the road tax is payable. This is all the more necessary because a much bigger fine is being introduced, and also because people might have to re-sit the driving test — which is the last thing we want. People get a licence for ten years and may not be aware when it is due to be renewed. Since the national driver file is now computerised, it should be very simple to notify people that their licence is about to expire. They could not then go to court with the defence that they were not told.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_606">That is part of the problem. I appreciate what the Deputy is trying to achieve. Arrangements are being made with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to hold and administer the national driver file and to have renewal notices issued to licence holders. It should be noted that a significant number of licence holders will have changed address in a ten-year period and will not receive the notice. If an amendment on the lines proposed were inserted, any person who let their licence lapse could plead that they had not received a renewal notice. This would weaken the provision very considerably. It is the responsibility of the individual to ensure that they have a current licence and to weaken that provision would be foolish. We are putting in place the most modern system to notify everybody when their licence is about to expire, but a huge number of people will have changed address.</p>

          <p eId="para_637">This was in the news last week in respect of speeding fines and penalty points. I am proposing a stiffer penalty for people who knowingly give false information about who was actually driving the car when the offence was committed. There is a loophole and I do not know if it is possible to close it. The threat of a severe fine or a prison sentence might prevent a person claiming that he was not driving that car, that it was being driven by a friend from London or an uncle from America, or even a colleague from Lithuania. The fact that nothing can be done has been publicised recently and obviously there will be an increase in the number of people who try to pull that stunt.</p>

I have not submitted this as an amendment but possibly it could be graduated in order that if people persisted in their refusal to have the NCT carried out the matter could be brought before the courts and higher penalty points applied. This is not proportionate in terms of the fines and penalty points attracted by other offences.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_692">The purpose of the inclusion of Part 8 in the First Schedule to the Road Traffic Acts is to make the offence of not having a valid certificate of roadworthiness for a commercial vehicle a penalty point offence. Part 8 will remove the anomaly. The equivalent offence in respect of a car has been listed since 2002. The penalty point regime to apply under Part 8 is identical to that already in place for the NCT certificate offence. Failure to have an NCT certificate or a certificate of roadworthiness as the case may be for a liable vehicle is a serious offence. A person convicted for not having an NCT certificate on two occasions within a period of three years, in addition to the normal penalty, a fine up to €1,500 increasing to €2,000 under this legislation or a prison term of up to three months or both, will be disqualified from driving for a period of six months, increasing to 12 months under this legislation. Given that a disqualification from driving could arise as a direct consequence of being convicted for a failure to have an NCT certificate, the fixed charge payment arrangement does not apply in regard to this offence. As the penalty points regime is a consequential driving disqualification measure that applies to cars which do not display an NCT certificate, it is being extended under the Bill to goods vehicles and buses. It would not be appropriate for the reasons mentioned to apply the fixed charge payment arrangement to this new category of penalty points offence as proposed in the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Amendment No. 77, which proposes that the number of penalty points on conviction for not having a valid certificate of roadworthiness for a vehicle should be four rather than five, as provided for in the Bill, would introduce an inconsistency between cars and other vehicles for penalty points purposes for what are essentially identical offences.</p>

A failure to have one's domestic vehicle undergo a national car test for, say, six months and a failure to have a bus which carries passengers or a heavy goods vehicle which has the potential to cause enormous damage to undergo a test are not similar offences. Is there any period of grace before such an offence attracts five penalty points?</p>

It may not receive the same airing as other offences but it is not a problem to which we have suddenly been alerted. It was deemed, during consideration of the penalty points system, that the imposition of five points was proportionate to the offence in terms of where it was ranked on the list of road traffic offences. There was no objection at the time; everybody accepted this. I agree with the Deputy on the fundamental point that a failure to have a bus or lorry tested is a far more serious offence but I do not know whether it should attract higher penalty points.

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_707">"(<i>d</i>) At all material times, evidence gathered under this section shall be subject to scrutiny and supervision by a member of the Garda Síochána.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">I raised this matter during the Second Stage debate. I am seeking to make the legislation less liable to challenge in the outsourcing the operation of speed cameras. I am not against outsourcing; it is a good idea which will release gardaí to deal with other issues. The operation is technical and others may be better qualified than members of the Garda Síochána to operate speed cameras. Nevertheless, given that their operation is part of the criminal justice system, it should be subject at all times to scrutiny and supervision by a member of the Garda Síochána. We all know clever lawyers are already looking at ways to challenge the law in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">Amendment No. 83 has been ruled out of order. One only has to make a calculation of the likely number of photographs taken to estimate the likely number of cases that will come before the courts. It is possible 500,000 or more cases a year will be brought before the District Court. This will completely clog up the courts system, unless a special court is established to deal with these cases. I am aware the Minister does not wish to discuss this matter today but it is one he will have to discuss with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">I am interested to know if he has given any consideration to it. However, if cases which are brought before the courts are to stand up, the operation of speed cameras must be subject to overall supervision by the Garda Síochána. This is not to suggest the Garda must be involved in all operational matters but it must be empowered to supervise operations should it so wish.</p>

          <p eId="para_711">The operational parameters and organisational structures for the operation of speed cameras, the performance of any functions relating to the establishment of <i>prima facie</i> proof of an offence and the functions referred to in section 21(7) of the Bill are all factors that shall be provided for in the contractual agreement between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the private sector operator. Interestingly — this is purely a coincidence — I heard a presentation yesterday by a company which is the main operator of speed cameras in Australia and I had my eyes opened. What one believes might make this work may be very far from the reality of how the system works. Much depends on the structures built around the system in terms of the perception of what is being done. The company concerned has vast experience in this area and has operations worldwide. It has honed many of the systems operated and fed into public policy with the police and even the courts system in the various countries concerned. This is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to decide but I was happy to meet the representatives of the company in question to hear what they had to say. The company also had interesting views on the issue of fixed and mobile cameras.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">I do not want to move away from the principal point the Deputy is making but the Garda Síochána must set the parameters. I got the impression yesterday that there was a robust role for the private sector to play in this area subject to proper rules, regulations and agreement with the Garda Síochána. We in Ireland are great at reinventing the wheel — we want to do it our way. I will not blame the Civil Service structure. Where there are very good systems, I hope we will buy into that to make it work. As systems have developed, the private sector is able to do an enormous amount on the administative side because they have the technology and the back-up. I was fascinated by it. It became a different issue from my simplistic view of just getting the speed cameras.</p>

          <p eId="para_729">I agree that it is a huge problem. Whether I was right or wrong to pronounce on it, I think it was a reasonable thing for me to say publicly. I appreciate that the Deputy would agree. It is quite clear that the approach of the courts in other countries has little to do with process and judges will not tolerate that debate. I think that contributes to the fact that the UK is in the top rank in terms of law enforcement on road safety. People know they will not be able to go to court to argue the niceties of technical points and get off. They do not get off. A person who was over the limit will be found guilty. I have said to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform — and I think he agrees — that this is the way we must get the courts thinking and operating. It is an extraordinarily powerful message to send into the public domain and people will begin to understand that there is no longer the prospect of long cases being fought through the courts on technical issues and people getting off.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">There is a philosophical issue in terms of how the courts operate. We could get a lot sharper. Interesting research is being carried out which indicates that there is a public buy into this in very high numbers. I hope the courts are listening to that message.</p>

          <p eId="para_762">The amendment arises from the Department of Finance's advice on the matter and the fact that the original wording is unsatisfactory as it obliges the commission to set up a fund administered by trustees, which would be expensive, time consuming and unnecessary in a body like the commission, which does not have a large number of employees. The Department of Finance has indicated that it would be unlikely that the level of contribution from the small commission staff complement, currently ten staff and one commissioner, would be sufficient to meet the costs of running the fund. It is also unlikely that the fund would be able to meet the requirements laid down by the Pensions Board. In addition, they advise that the presence of a fund would require that the accounts of the commission should meet the requirements of accounting standards FRS 17, which are onerous and very costly.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_769">In page 28, before section 22, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_770">"22.—The following are repealed:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_771">(a) subsection (6) of the Principal Act,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_772">(b) section 16 of the Road Transport Act 1999, and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_773">(c) section 56 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.".</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Section 22 provides for the repeal of three provisions, the first of which is subsection (6) of section 69 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. Section 69 of the 1961 Act gives power to a garda to demand the production of an insurance certificate in respect of the use of a vehicle, but the application of powers under section 69 is exempted from subsection (6) in respect of a vehicle that is not normally based in the State. The amendment proposed in section 19 of this Bill would allow the Garda to query the insurance status in relation to the driving of vehicles registered outside the State and to impound any vehicles which do not have insurance in place. The repeal of subsection (6) arises as a consequence.</p>

Given the scale of the legislation I and other Ministers are trying to get through the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the chances of producing a consolidation Bill are very marginal. That is not to say it should not be done. When I was the  Minister of State at the Department of Finance, I was involved in the effort to consolidate the Tax Acts and I know the amount of time involved.</p>
