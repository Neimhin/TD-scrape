#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Earlier this week, John Trethowan, the head of the Credit Review Office, signalled that the pillar banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, are in danger of missing their lending targets in 2012.  He also said the banks' lending policies need to be reassessed and that they should be prepared to take on more risk.  In other words, he confirmed what thousands of small business owners have been saying for some time, which is banks are not fulfilling their lending obligations.  The credit squeeze is choking any prospect of an economic recovery in this country.The latest Central Bank figures show that the mortgage arrears crisis is getting worse by the day.  The arrears rate has increased by a staggering 60% over the past 12 months.  The Government's record in dealing with this issue has been feeble and ineffective.  Both the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach have been honest enough to acknowledge that not enough work has been done.  Well they might when one looks at the follow through on the recommendations of the Keane report last September.  Only one mortgage to rent transaction has been completed, not one of the 100 promised independent mortgage advisers has been appointed, no split mortgage arrangements have been put in place by the banks and the Government has delayed on a number of occasions the publication of the personal insolvency Bill.  Even the Central Bank Governor has expressed frustration at the way in which the banks are dealing with this crisis.It is the job of the Opposition to hold the Government to account for its handling of lending and mortgage arrears but it is the Government's duty to hold the banks to account for their failure to meet their responsibilities to society and to the economy.

The economic management council last met representatives of the banks in February.  On foot of the report by the Credit Review Office earlier this week and the deepening mortgage crisis as evidenced by the latest Central Bank figures, will the Tánaiste call the banks before the economic management council again, ask them the hard questions such as why they are not fulfilling their responsibilities to this country and get some answers and action to deal with these two critical issues facing the country?

We plan in any event on meeting them in the near future.I welcome the Credit Review Office report.  Since the office's establishment in April 2010, 197 appeals have been received, 60% of which have been completed, and 69 of these refusals have been overturned, resulting in the banks subsequently supplying €6.9 million of credit and supporting 683 jobs in the SME sector.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	21	In respect of mortgages, the Government intends to publish the personal insolvency legislation this month.  Unlike the previous Government, the Government has brought forward a range of measures through the Keane report to address the issue of mortgage distress, which is very real and which is a priority.  The legislation will contain for the first time in Irish law non-judicial debt settlement arrangements, which will be put in place and which will be of assistance to people in mortgage distress who need to negotiate new arrangements with their banks.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I would like to reiterate the Government's record in respect of the Keane report.  Only one mortgage-to-rent transaction has been completed, not one of the promised 100 independent mortgage advisers has been appointed, no split mortgage arrangements have been put in place for customers and the personal insolvency Bill has been delayed time and again.  That is the Government's record in respect of mortgage arrears since taking office.  The reality is there has been a 60% increase in the rate of mortgage arrears in that time.  These are the facts and the response to date has been wholly inadequate.On the question of credit availability, the head of the Credit Review Office, Mr. John Trethowan, put the Government on notice earlier this week that the banks were not fulfilling their responsibilities.  When one strips away the language used, Mr. Trethowan is essentially saying there is a real risk they will not meet their lending targets in 2012, that they are risk averse and not supporting indigenous business owners who have new ideas for expanding their existing operations.  In other words, the banks are not fit for purpose and not meeting the needs of the economy.  I welcome the Tánaiste's indication that he will meet representatives of the banks at the Economic Management Council.  When will that meeting take place?  What will the Government ask them to do and how does it propose to hold them to account?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	23	That meeting will happen in the next couple of weeks.  It is a meeting the Economic Management Council had planned to have with the banks.

It is not correct to say the Government has not acted on the mortgage crisis.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Deputy Michael McGrath is wrong about that.  First, we are producing personal insolvency legislation which is expected to be published this month.  We have increased mortgage interest relief for those who bought their first home at the height of the boom and are, therefore, the most vulnerable to mortgage debt distress.  We have increased the budget for mortgage interest supplement to assist those who have lost their jobs with their mortgage repayments.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	27	That is nonsense.  Mortgage interest supplement has been reduced.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	28	In addition, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Housing Agency have been working with the banks on the roll-out of the mortgage-to-rent initiative.  It is not the case, therefore, that action has not been taken on the mortgage issue.  We are acting on this problem which was neglected by the Deputy's party when it was in government.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The position is getting steadily worse.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Last Friday the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach said they sensed a new mood across the European Union following the "Yes" vote in the referendum in this state.  The Taoiseach made it clear that this new mood would make a deal on our unsustainable banking debt burden a reality.  No sooner were those words from his mouth than the German Finance Minister, Mr. Schäuble, said his interpretation of the "Yes" vote was that it was an endorsement of current European Union policy.  There was no evidence of a new mood, rather cold water was publicly thrown on the Taoiseach's claim that a deal could be done on our banking debt.Will the Tánaiste clarify what he meant when he spoke about this new mood?  Today's newspaper headlines are dominated by the strong demands by the Spanish Government.  The Government in Madrid is not behind the door in saying publicly that if its banking debt burden is not shared or some assistance provided in that respect, it may herald serious difficulties for the euro.  The Taoiseach stunned this Chamber yesterday with his blank refusal to set out exactly what he was seeking from our European counterparts with this new mood.  Will the Tánaiste shed some light on this?  I assume the Taoiseach has at least told him what he said to Angela and what she said back to him.  We would appreciate it if the Tánaiste shared that information with the House.

It is useful to reflect on what we are attempting to do.  The House made a decision in September 2008, proposed by Fianna Fáil and supported by Sinn Féin-----

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The taxpayer is burdened with a huge level of bank debt.  The Government is seeking to alleviate that burden - to get a deal on bank debt which is in the best interests of the taxpayer - and we have made some progress in that regard.  We have secured a reduction in the interest rate and an agreement on the promissory note for 2012 which is replaced by a long-term bond.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Thanks to Greece.

These discussions have taken place, first, between the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, Deputies Brendan Howlin and Michael Noonan, and the troika and, second, at an official level where officials from the Irish side have been working with the European Commission and the European Central Bank on ways in which the Irish bank debt can be alleviated.What is happening is that the Taoiseach and I have been engaged in discussions with European leaders to secure political support for a deal on Irish bank debt.  There are a number of ways in which this can be done.  First, there is the possibility of a Europe-wide solution to banking debt generally, which would be of benefit to Ireland.  Should there be such a solution, we will obviously have to take care that it is one which suits the Irish situation.  There are several variables, one of which is the situation in the Spanish banking system.  It may be that a solution will be found which is translatable to Ireland.  However, we must be careful not to hang our hat entirely on the Spanish situation because what may be done in Spain or what may be applicable to that country may not be directly applicable to Ireland.  Therefore, we must make sure we have an arrangement that is suitable to the Irish situation.  On the other hand, it is possible that a particular arrangement will be arrived at in respect of Ireland along the lines of what we have been discussing both with the troika and at a technical level with the institutions.We are continuing our work in this regard.  I intend to be in London later today for talks with the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. William Hague, which will include a discussion of this issue.  I plan to travel to Paris very soon.  We are continuing to have discussions at European leadership level with a view to securing the best possible outcome for the taxpayer.  What is important is the result we achieve.  What we are hoping to do which everybody in the House should and, I am sure, does support is to get the best possible outcome for taxpayers in order to alleviate the huge burden placed on them by the tying of bank debt to the State.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	39	As the Tánaiste is well aware, the Labour Party in government has on two occasions extended the very bank guarantee against which he rails so strongly.  It is time to change the record in this regard.  The Tánaiste says he recognises, as we all do, the unsustainability of our bank debt and lauds the Government's achievement in securing a reduction in the interest rate, for which it has Greece to thank.  The Government certainly pulled a sly one in respect of this year's promissory note payment.  That did not represent a solution, or even a partial solution, to our problem.  The Tánaiste now says he is hedging his bets as to whether the Spanish might pave a way for some resolution for our debt burden.  That is a very unsatisfactory statement of facts from him.  After the referendum, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste engaged in a kind of telethon with their European partners.  I have a suggestion as to how the conversation might have gone between the Taoiseach and the Chancellor.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Sorry, Deputy, you are over time.

Auf wiedersehen, Enda pet.  Given the gravity of the situation, which the Tánaiste acknowledged, it is completely unacceptable that he cannot give a clearcut answer to the Dáil.  The Tánaiste should understand the problem.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly told us he is not seeking any write-down of debt.  He said that very clearly.  Why can the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste not set out precisely what they are seeking in the same clearcut language?  It strikes me that they are fudging the issue and that they sold the people a pig in a poke.  They promised a lot in the course of their "Yes" campaign.

No matter what it is, Sinn Féin will come into the House and play it for cheap party political advantage and cheap party political point scoring.  This issue is far too serious for that.  The Irish people and the Irish taxpayers have been saddled with a huge bank debt.  It was a mistake to tie the bank debt to the State.  What we have to do now is negotiate our way out of that.  We have a clear objective which is to minimise that burden on the Irish taxpayer.We are engaged in those negotiations.  This is not something new.  We have been working on this for quite some time.  We are very clear that our objective is to minimise the burden on the Irish taxpayer and we are going to continue with that.  We are determined to get a result on that.The wise decision the Irish people made last Thursday against Sinn Féin's unwise advice to them-----

Sinn Féin's sneering about what is a very real problem for the Irish people will not help the situation.  We must resolve it and the Government is determined to do that.

On the day we do that, Sinn Féin will come into the House and sneer about something else.

It looks more like the Government is afraid that once that Pandora's box is opened, joining the dots may be an easy exercise and the protected list of vested interests could prove a riveting read.The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is supposed to be working on this legislation but can the Tánaiste be more specific?  He should not put it on the long finger because like Pinocchio's nose, it will soon fall off if it gets any longer.  On 13 March the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform promised a White Paper within weeks with legislation to follow.  Will the Tánaiste give us a date as to when we can expect to see a mandatory list of lobbyists?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	52	This Government has committed itself to the introduction of legislation to provide for the registration of lobbyists.  We saw from the reports of the Mahon and the Moriarty tribunals what happens when we have an unregulated lobbying regime, as we have had.  The public is entitled to know who is lobbying on behalf of vested interests of whatever kind and who is talking to Government and Government agencies.It is with that in mind that the Government has committed itself to the introduction of legislation on the registration of lobbyists.  That legislation is being brought forward by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I will check for the Deputy as to when it is expected to be published.

It seems the long finger is certainly out in regard to this issue and that the Labour Party has gone over to the dark side on it.  We need this mandatory register of lobbyists.  It is not complex legislation and it should not be difficult to compile.  It is more than 16 months since the Government committed to ensuring a list would be provided and yet we have seen the reports of the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals and the damage lobbyists for vested interests have done to this State in the past.  The Government needs to put it on the record that it is a matter of urgency and ensure a mandatory register of lobbyists is brought forward without any further delay.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	57	We object to the guillotining of this debate.  It is a matter of the utmost importance that we get right a permanent bailout mechanism for the European Union.  Given its importance and centrality, it is astonishing that the Government is attempting to guillotine the debate on the Bill.  We object on these grounds.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	58	It is reckless in the extreme that the Government is proposing, in a single day and with barely 4.5 hours allowed for debate, to ram through Dáil Éireann the European Stability Mechanism Bill, a Bill that exposes taxpayers to a potential liability of €11 billion and taxpayers throughout the European Union to a potential liability of €700 billion.  This is not to serve as a solidarity fund for the peoples of Europe; rather, as we have seen this morning in the Spanish case, it is to bail out the same reckless speculators whose gambling debts are already crushing the people, the economy and living standards.It is particularly ironic that the Tánaiste is proposing the use of a guillotine on this issue today.  It would be an understatement to say he would have been apoplectic if the arrangements being made today were made to debate a proposal of this import by the former Government when he was in opposition.  He would have raged as only he could have when in opposition.  I have no doubt that many Deputies, from all parties in the Dáil, would want time to consider and speak to the Bill.  Given that the Spanish banks are being awarded a bailout, we should wait until at least after the weekend such that our knowledge of what happens in Spain will inform the debate.  Continuing the debate next week is essential.  Therefore, I ask the Tánaiste to remove the guillotine and allow the debate to continue into next week, at least.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	59	It beggars belief that the Tánaiste is trying to push through the legislation on the ESM in a single day.  He cannot say with hand on his heart that he believes the people, or most Deputies, have fully debated and understand the content of the European Stability Mechanism Bill and the severe consequences it may have for them, given that, even by the Government's admission in the past week or two, it is highly likely that on exiting the EU-IMF programme we will be forced into an ESM programme that will be equally as austere and have equally as strict conditions.  It will affect in a serious way the citizens of Ireland and could cost them €11 billion or more.  The body will not be subject to scrutiny, be it legal, public, political or otherwise.  It is difficult to imagine legislation that is more important than this Bill, given that it could dictate the fate of citizens for quite a few years to come.  Despite this, the Tánaiste is proposing to ram it through in a single day which is absolutely unacceptable.  I appeal to him, in the interests of democracy and ensuring the public has full knowledge of the fate that awaits it if we are forced into the ESM, to lift the guillotine and allow a full airing of all the issues surrounding the mechanism.

The European Stability Mechanism is due to take effect from 1 July.  This means the Bill must be enacted by that date.  For it to be enacted by that date, it must be debated in this House on Second Stage.  On Committee Stage the Deputy will have ample opportunity to examine the legislation in detail and propose amendments, if he wishes.  The Bill will be returned to the Chamber for Report Stage, on which the Deputy may again propose amendments.  Following this, the Bill will proceed to the Seanad where the same process will take place.  If the Seanad makes amendments, the Bill will be returned to this House.  Therefore, there will be plenty of debate on the European Stability Mechanism.If the Deputies had read the Order Paper and noted the Order of Business for today, they would have noted it was intended-----

If necessary, they may do so again on Report Stage.  Today's debate on Second Stage is on the general principles of the Bill.  It is proposed that, following the conclusion of Private Members' business, the rest of the day will be devoted to the legislation, up to 6.30 p.m.  We have moved Question Time, including priority questions, beyond 6.30 p.m. in order that there will be a clear run at the legislation and a full debate on Second Stage.  Deputies will have plenty of time to debate the matter up to 29 June, the last working day before the ESM is due to take effect.  There will be full Committee Stage and Report Stage debates.  We are only taking Second Stage today in order that Deputies will have time and the opportunity to table amendments, attend the committee and make their case for whatever changes they desire.  We will see what they do on Committee Stage.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I thank the Technical Group and the group of Independent Members for bringing forward this important motion.  It is important to highlight this significant issue.  If ever there was a bad example of self-regulation and self-regulation being no regulation it was the building industry in the past ten or 15 years and there have been many victims.  Many families have suffered because of the building boom.  No proper legislation was put in place to protect homeowners, purchasers or tenants.  Much of the legislation has been in place since the 1990s and it was put in place at the time to undermine and weaken the regulations and the position of homeowners and tenants.  That legislation led to self-regulation, self-certification and the running down of the building control inspectorate.  All of this has left householders living in fire traps and buildings with structural damage.Residents seeking justice have doors slammed shut in their faces at every turn.  I had the opportunity to meet some of them last night.  In recent times the situation at Priory Hall has brought this issue into stark focus.  I salute the resolute campaign being waged by Priory Hall residents and acknowledge their presence in the Visitors Gallery in the past two days.  I have met many of them and commend them for the work they have put in.  They have continued to ensure their plight and that of others is not far from our minds and the minds of those who have a responsibility to introduce change.Despite many months of campaigning, the Minister has yet to meet the residents.  Priory Hall is in the headlines, but it is only one of many such complexes in which decades of irresponsible governance have left a disastrous legacy of defective buildings, fire hazards and abandoned residences.  There is a housing estate in Portarlington in my constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, built by the same developer, Na Cluainte, in which considerable problems have surfaced.  I acknowledge the work of its residents.  There have been many other issues in the constituency.  There is a situation in Rathbrennan on the north side of Portlaoise where, I believe, one housing complex will have to be knocked down.  It has been left half finished for three or four years.  Offaly County Council has washed its hands of Riverside estate in Portarlington where people are living in apartments which have been left in an appalling condition and which were built using substandard materials.  The people affected have been left high and dry.  HomeBond, the developer, the county council and the regulatory process have all left them down.  I have witnessed at first hand the appalling conditions in which they have been living, including dampness, porous walls, leaks and a range of other problems.  There is a serious lack of standards.  No proper fire prevention measures have been taken.These problems are especially acute in the case of apartments where there is no proper privacy for residents.  In apartment blocks there are only plaster slabs separating some apartments, which is totally unacceptable.  Noise travels across two or three apartments and there are fire hazards also.  Strangely, having plaster slabs separating apartments is considered acceptable by the relevant Department.  I spoke to officials at senior level in the Department about this issue as a county councillor before I became a Member of this House and was informed that the use of plaster slabs was acceptable.  In one case in an apartment block in Portlaoise a person did not like his neighbour.  From the common area in the corridor he put his boot through the wall of the neighbour's apartment.  Is this acceptable?  Only two layers of plaster slabs separated them.  I have heard long explanations from officials in the Department and people involved in the industry about why the use of plaster slabs is acceptable in the separation of apartments, but I simply do not buy them.  We are informed that apartment complexes are common on the Continent.  The difference, however, is that there is concrete underneath, above and between apartments and the common areas separating people from their neighbours. The use of plaster slabs is not acceptable.  I, therefore, call on the Minister and officials to reconsider this issue.  What level of privacy is possible?  I recall while canvassing in an apartment block knocking on the door of apartment No. 6 and hearing the radio playing in apartment No. 12.  As I got closer to apartment No. 12 it was not much louder when the occupier opened the door.  That is unacceptable and I call on the Minister to take up the matter.There must be accountability and the motion is a start.  The Government should, in all honesty, support it and I hope it will.  In particular, there is a role for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  The motion sets out where responsibility lies, that is, at the door of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Minister should outline what he and his Department will do to reform the building regulations.  The existing legislation was useless in the 1990s and it is worse than useless now, given the changes that have been made.  It must be radically reformed.  The maximum penalty for non-compliance with the Building Control Act 1990 remains the equivalent of £10,000.Local authorities should be adequately funded to carry out inspections.  Financial constraints should not be allowed to continue to undermine the security of homeowners.  Unfortunately, in some counties only 5% of new buildings are inspected and some are drive-by inspections.  Bonds for developments should be improved.  Bonds have been allowed to roll over from one phase of a development to the next.  A developer who pays €100,000 is allowed to roll it over to phase two of a development without phase one being properly completed.  This must stop.The Minister should examine the issue of insurance and bank bonds.  Insurance companies are prepared to go to court and face down local authorities.  Quinn Insurance, or whoever has taken over the company, is prepared go the whole way and push the issue with local authorities, as it has the resources to do so.  The Government has an opportunity to break from the legacy of the past.  It should, therefore, support the motion and take responsibility for the necessary remedial works to make buildings safe.  To ignore the problem while residents are highlighting and seeking movement on it is not an option for the Minister.  We do not want another Stardust tragedy to occur before serious action is taken.I share the concerns expressed about pyrite in the motion.  As a public representative, I believed in my innocence that everyone who purchased a home and had HomeBond cover was hunky-dory, so to speak.  It transpired later that HomeBond cover was useless.  Changes must be made to provide homeowners with some form of guarantee.We should fear the impact of global warming on the construction industry.  If temperatures ever reach the point at which silicone melts, we will experience serious problems with our housing stock as the material has been widely used to hold together fittings in housing and apartment developments.  I am not being flippant in highlighting this issue.  There were no clerk of works on sites, people were doing work who were not qualified tradespeople and they were using silicone where they should have been using fixings and there is a potentially serious problem.Some of the approximately 700 houses - the figure was supposed to be higher - being leased from the National Asset Management Agency are of poor quality.  I ask that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government ensure all housing leased from the agency is of good quality before allowing it to transfer to the housing stock.I welcome this motion, which should be supported by all Deputies.  An emergency programme of works should be introduced to carry out necessary remedial works and building regulations should be reformed to ensure we do not find it necessary to revisit this issue.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion.  It goes without saying that one of the major issues confronting the Government and local authorities is the poor developments left by unscrupulous developers.  Decisions taken by the planning authorities were not followed up and construction was characterised by a lack of enforcement and inspection, leaving families to pick up the pieces.  One of the lessons we must learn from the Celtic tiger period is that we cannot return to those times.  This is of little comfort to many people who are in a difficult position.  It is these individuals and families with whom the Government must work.The Government and local authorities, working together on a regional basis, must address this issue to ensure we do not have a repeat of the past.  They must introduce plans that can be rolled out locally to remediate the problems arising in construction.  In two consecutive winters, during which air temperatures fell to 0° or -1° Celsius, half the pipes supplying water into new housing estates in my area froze.  The problem was not that temperatures fell lower than expected but that water pipes were located practically above ground.  The only protection against freezing temperatures was a thin layer of concrete.  This practice took place because enforcement and monitoring were not anticipated.  We must reintroduce the clerk of works model under which developments are regularly visited while under construction.  Notwithstanding the financial constraints they face, local authorities have an opportunity on a regional basis - in my area, Limerick city and county councils, north and south Tipperary county councils and Clare County Council could work together - to establish an inspection and building control regime within which they would share resources and expertise as they could not operate such a scheme on their own.The Government has inherited a number of serious problems caused by construction in the Celtic tiger era, including partial bonds and developers leaving the Revenue Commissioners high and dry by failing to pay taxes and VAT.  Those who engaged in unscrupulous activity in the building industry, for example, by making fraudulent statements, failing to complete estates or knowingly selling houses which did not meet building standards, should be behind bars.  The Government must ensure this is the case.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	78	As my speaking time is limited, I will be unable to go into the level of detail this matter requires at this stage.  While the motion has merit and raises very serious issues for debate, it is slightly premature because it cuts across two processes which are already under way, including consultation on the Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012 and the work of the pyrite panel, which is specifically addressing the pyrite issue.  Established last autumn to explore options for an agreed resolution to the issue of pyrite contamination in private housing stock, the panel was initially expected to report earlier this year.  Its failure thus far to do so is a cause of much frustration to the affected homeowners and Members of the Oireachtas, including me.I met members of the pyrite panel on three occasions, most recently less than two weeks ago.  Each time, I impressed upon them the concerns of people from my constituency and elsewhere who are suffering daily as a result of the effects of pyritic heave in their homes.  The panel's report is complete and I await its content with much anticipation.  I hope for speedy Government action on foot of its recommendations.  It is essential that the developers responsible for building pyrite affected homes take responsibility for the problems they have caused.  Some of them, including a number who remain active, will not engage with homeowners until the pyrite panel publishes its report.  This approach is unacceptable and especially frustrating for homeowners.  Others are responding to homeowners by having remedial works done where a problem exists.  Unfortunately for the homeowners in question, many developers have gone bust, which creates a special problem and challenge.The affected homeowners are concerned about the Statute of Limitations.  In such cases, it is incumbent on the Government to work out a formula or establish a mechanism which resolves the problem.  The individuals concerned do not have anywhere else to go.  HomeBond has been a disaster and for this reason a levy on the construction industry to raise a fund for remediation works would be a progressive and fair approach.  I note such a proposal would be supported by the Pyrite Action Group.The Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012 are in public consultation and many people, some of whom were in the Gallery last night and are present again today, have made submissions on them.  Last night, the Minister indicated that 500 such submissions had been received.  Given the importance of this issue and the merits of the case put forward today and last night, I call on the Minister to have a full debate on the draft regulations once the consultation process has been completed and before he signs the statutory instrument into law.  In January last, my party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, took statements in the House on a statutory instrument which amended section 40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, thus setting a precedent for debating statutory instruments in the House.  With due respect to the issue discussed by the Minister of State, it pales in comparison with the seriousness of the issue before us.  For this reason, I call on the Minister to agree today to hold such a debate.  Given the number of problems in construction in the past, we must get building regulations right this time around.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I concur with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Brendan Ryan.  I am appalled by the problems facing a large number of people as a result of faulty construction.  Regrettably, the Priory Hall and Belmayne developments are not the only estates affected by these problems.  We must do everything in our power to ensure faulty and inadequate housing is not built in the future.  I refer specifically to apartments because where multiple dwellings are stacked together, as it were, a problem affecting one apartment will inevitably affect a series of other homes.Having listened carefully to the Minister's contribution to last night's debate, I was heartened by his stated determination to ensure the practice of shoddy building will end.  Whether it is caused by inadequate materials, shoddy workmanship, unsafe electrics or other factors, I will not rest easy until such practices cease.  When all the consultations are carried out, it is really important that we come up with a system of rigorous building controls.  For example, a clerk of works type system, operated by local authorities, ought to be established to ensure that each building is inspected at various stages of construction.  If inadequacies are found, building construction must stop until the problems are rectified and only then should it be permitted to continue.  Rogue builders should be blacklisted, struck off and unable to operate.  I realise that not all builders behave like this.  In my constituency, the developers of Adamstown have done an excellent job to put up decent housing and to provide services including schools and a railway station.Some of the aspects of unsatisfactory construction relate to fire hazards, and therefore the Dublin city fire safety inspection service has been brought in.  In one particular development, I am aware that the management committee was advised to be very careful with the questions they asked of the fire inspectors.  That raises serious questions for me, and I ask the Minister to check out the operation of the Dublin city fire safety inspection service.  It is really important that every building is safe from fire.
#ColmKeaveney	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-party	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-dob	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The issue of substandard buildings, the lack of enforcement of standards by local authorities and the resulting tragedies like Priory Hall are now being blamed on poor regulation or poor enforcement, but I believe the real blame for this issue lies with the endemic and rampant corruption which infested the politics of the past among certain political parties.  That corruption was not simply the corruption involving brown envelopes, but a more subtle corruption where wealth could influence access to politics, following significant donations to political parties.  This could be justified in some form of obscene thatcherite fairytale where some people believed that wealth would trickle down to the community.  Therefore, they believed in their folly that the interests of the wealthy few had to be served at the expense of ordinary people, who now suffer the consequences of that philosophy.Why are we 22 years late with the enactment of this legislation?  It would have made mandatory submissions to the building control authority for certificates of compliance with building regulations.  It is important for us to believe that developers who were involved in this in the past had done a very good job in preventing the enactment of this Bill.  I recently said that we have to impose a philosophy in this House of justice and fairness in the context of the rules of engagement of government.  It should be intolerable for any Minister to have any dealings with those named in tribunal reports or involved in corrupt practices.Any developer or builder who has been found to have failed to meet standards laid out in the Building Control Act 2007, or those who fail to meet the welcome amendments proposed by the Minister, should be blacklisted.  No company associated with them should ever be awarded a public contract.  Our citizens need to see justice in this respect.  They need to be reassured that the mistakes of the past will not be repeated, and they need to see that there is a layer within society that will no longer live with the consequences of the lack of accountability, and that nothing less than best practice should apply to enforcement in this area.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I have sympathy with those who have suffered as a result of poor and shoddy construction, the existence of pyrite in their houses, poor developments and unfinished estates.  Such people bought their houses in good faith and believed that what they were buying from a developer or auctioneer was what was on the brochure.  They believed they were buying into their future, and not the problems they are experiencing now.Deputy Wallace spoke last night about a lack of inspections that led to a deterioration in work standards.  A recommendation was made that 10% of building sites be inspected, but in fact 23% of sites were inspected.  When it comes to the deterioration in work standards, one has to look at the quality in craftsmanship involved in the construction of these houses.  One day a fella can hammer a nail in straight, the second day he is a carpenter, the third day he is a builder and the fourth day he is a developer.  Anyone in the business at all would know that is not the way to create good workmanship.  In the past, people had to spend a number of years in apprenticeships learning the trade and how to deal with plumbing, electrics and carpentry.  That skill was lost because developers and builders wanted to get something up as quickly as possible so they could maximise their profit.  That is what it was all about.  Unfortunately, those who suffered as a result were the ordinary people who came along and bought their house in good faith.  We ended up making Mr. O'Reilly from "Faulty Towers" look like a genuine builder.Who is responsible for this?  The problem is that we have lost trust in developers and builders.  Members criticise developers and builders every day in the House, yet there are genuine guys out there who are still building houses and developing land.  These guys have been around for many years.  We should praise them and put them up as examples of how to develop estates and build houses.This Bill does not penalise poor and shoddy development enough.  There are only small fines involved when compared to the price of housing.  People will have problems in their own houses and estates, whether due to pyrite, faulty fire certificates, poor plumbing or poor electrics.  However, the penalties to be inflicted on these fellas who can just about hammer a nail in straight will be minimal.  We have to look at that to make sure the penalties deter this kind of shoddy work in future.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	82	At the outset I would like to show some empathy to the people who have not only found themselves in the negative equity generation, but who are also part of a generation which bought property that in some cases was built in a negligent manner.  I am a firm believer in the idea that there should be consequences to negligence.  I agree with the points made by Deputies Lawlor and Keaveney in that respect.  The man with a hammer, a map and a chequebook became a developer without any track record or history.  He focused on the bottom dollar and that approach has left people in substandard housing needing a great deal of work to remediate what has gone wrong.Who is culpable for this?  The first line of the Private Members' motion stated that all builders were responsible for this mess.  I would like to say they are not all responsible.  There are men of character and good will who knew what was right and wrong, and who understood that there was a standard of living to be achieved through living in a house, which is the essence of social democracy.  The 1990 regulations set out in the Act are objective but are also aspirational.  I disagree with the lack of consequences.  Deputy Keaveney is correct to say that anybody who is found to have acted in a negligent manner should be blacklisted and prevented from tendering for State projects thereafter.I would also like to mention the HomeBond experience for those who built houses where pyrite has become a problem.  I worked in finance, and I am aware that a generation of people, who were neither engineers, architects or economists, took security from the fact that if they bought a house that was covered by HomeBond and something went wrong, the professions and the State would do right by them and the HomeBond experience would safeguard them.  In conversation with fellow Deputies in Fine Gael and the Labour Party, we have come to the conclusion that the HomeBond experience has let people down.  It would be unacceptable for the company to be allowed to continue to trade in a rogue fashion.  It should do the moral thing rather than simply fulfil its legal obligation.When a builder builds a house, he cannot claim the stone used was the cause of any fault in the construction.  If one buys a bar of chocolate, a car or anything else, the rule ofcaveat emptor, buyer beware, applies.  In this case, the builder is the purchaser of the material and the culpability must lie there.  To ring-fence a small amount of money per house, and to cap the amount for each development, is inexcusable.  I am led to believe the HomeBond company has a substantial amount of money on deposit.  This money was gathered through the goodwill of people.  The company should give this goodwill back to the people and try to develop things from there.I welcome what the Minister is trying to achieve.  I acknowledge what the Opposition are saying about this matter.  However, we must have standards in professions and culpability for negligence thereafter.

My own constituency has been badly affected by poor construction by builders and developers in the past ten years, as have other constituencies.  Poor regulation and builders' greed have caused many of these problems, while home owners, through no fault of their own, have been left to pick up the pieces.  There have been a number of high profile cases, one of which involved the use of pyrite.  The owners of Menolly Homes, which is a reputable building company, put their hands up and admitted that they had a difficulty and a problem.  They set up a timetable of works to remedy the faults in the homes that were affected.  Menolly Homes then, of course, took a court case against the quarry that provided the building material.  That action is to be commended, particularly as we know of other cases where home owners are not so fortunate, where builders have disappeared, developers have gone to ground and do not want to know anything about faulty materials, and home owners are left carrying the can.Previous speakers referred to HomeBond and its functions.  HomeBond was established as a warranty scheme rather than an insurance scheme and there was inadequate back-up to provide help and insurance for home owners when pyrite was found in their homes.  Premier Guarantee has been honouring many claims, but HomeBond has not co-operated and has refused to attend the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I hope the pyrite panel, established by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, will produce a list of solutions.Home owners in Priory Hall, which has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons, find themselves homeless and in temporary accommodation, through no fault of their own.  The development was constructed by a rogue builder who did not want to know about the fire safety issues when they came to light.  I hope something good will come from the temporary resolution process that has been established and that all interested parties will resolve the issue together.Lack of fire safety is also an issue in the Belmayne development.  In that case the developer is dealing with the problem, although some outstanding cases need further attention.The Government inherited much of the mess in the construction industry.  The Minister has gone about trying to change things and ensuring mandatory certification and lodgment of drawings prior to and after construction, to ensure developments are adequately constructed in future.

I did the same in this case, notwithstanding some of the content of this motion, with which I totally agree.  I take this view of all Private Members' motions, whether they refer to bankers, developers or others.One of the worst acts ever performed in this House was done on a September night in 2008, when some people rushed in here with sweat on their necks to bail out Anglo Irish Bank, the developers' bank.  It is one of the ironies of Irish politics that some of the people who have the gall and hard neck to sign a motion relating to the behaviour of developers are the same people who came here to bail out Anglo Irish Bank.One of the signatories of today's motion is a tax evader.  I am referring to Deputy Mick Wallace.  Whatever about going on morning radio programmes, to which I make it a discipline of not listening, tax compliant members of the State require some explanation of this.  I have always been a PAYE taxpayer.  Everyone in the State should pay tax according to their income and wealth.  This is one of the reasons I support a wealth tax.  When I see motions such as the one being discussed, where there is no explanation from someone who engages in tax evasion, I am appalled.There are things in the Private Members' motion with which I agree.  However, a number of speakers, yesterday and today, mentioned the need for the State to step in.  The State is, of course, you and me, the taxpayers and the hard-pressed PAYE sector outside these Houses.  In every situation we hear a call for them to bail out these characters who engaged in all sorts of corruption. I do not mean every developer and builder.  There are good builders and developers just as there are bad politicians and decent ones.  That is the way of the world.I will be voting against the motion and with the Government amendment.  We must stop the practice of expecting the PAYE sector to rush in and compensate people who did bad work and defrauded people.  These people should not be bailed out by the PAYE sector.  The State should take action and put them in jail rather than helping them out.
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Like tens of thousands of other young couples, I bought a home in Drynam Hall, between Swords and Kinsealy in Dublin, in October 2005.  I paid just under €400,000 for it, I planned a family, I had a reasonable job as a self-employed person and was also a public representative.  My wife was studying for a third level qualification and the future was bright.  In July 2007, I was informed that my home, with 700 other homes, had pyrite.  We later learned that far more than 700 homes were affected.  The figure was somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000, not to mention the tens of thousands of other families who are in homes that are sub-standard as a result of shoddy developments, shoddy developers, shoddy work practices and a complete failure on the part of the building control function of the State to ensure those properties were of a reasonable quality standard.As Deputy O'Donovan indicated, we are now left with the legacy of the Celtic tiger.  Knowing that the supposed insurance policy they took out when they bought their property does not cover them because it relates to the builder who built the house does not make it any easier to sleep at night, in particular for some of my constituents whose builders are gone or who are close to disappearing.  Such people do not have any recourse.  The agreement was not with them, it was with the developer.  Families who believed they were protected have been left high and dry without any recourse because the developer has gone or refuses to deal with them, as there is no obligation to do so and because no law exists currently under which they can be prosecuted.I shadowed the case that was mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Lawlor, concerning Menolly Homes in the Commercial Court for 150 odd days.  Like thousands of other families I expended a great deal of personal finance for the purpose of ensuring that my family home – my castle – was protected.  Tens of thousands of people have no recourse.I welcome some of the points and proposals made in the debate on the motion.  Some in society have failed in their obligation to sell a reasonable product.  It is apparent that despite all the legislation in place and the legislative proposals set out for this Dáil that some will be left with no recourse.  The State along with the industry should make a contribution to assist families who have no recourse.  I do not just refer to cases such as Priory Hall or developments that are unsafe for human habitation but also estates like my own in north County Dublin and many others across Leinster.I support the Government's amended motion.  I thank the Opposition for tabling its proposal.  Opposition Members are safe in the knowledge that several of the proposals they suggested are already coming through.  I expect the counter-motion to be passed this afternoon but that does not mean the aspirations of the many families who have gone to the trouble of coming to Leinster House both yesterday and today are thwarted.  It means that we will redouble our efforts in order to deliver what we promised last February.

#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I fully support the Private Members' motion tabled by the United Left Alliance, ULA, and supported by the Independent Members of the Technical Group.Last night in the House the Minister outlined what is already contained in the Building Control Act 1990 and listed how he has no responsibility for the enforcement of the Act.  Unsurprisingly, he outlined that the responsibility falls to local authorities, which have not been fulfilling their obligations in terms of enforcement.  We have good regulation and legislation in this country but we have a complete lack of enforcement.  The Government's role should be to ensure that local authorities are held accountable for enforcement and also to ensure that the resources are available to those who must enforce regulation so that they can do their job and ensure compliance.  The Government cannot abdicate its responsibility in that regard.The Government must introduce legislation to ensure that HomeBond and other insurance policies can live up to the obligations of developers and builders, that developers and builders themselves can live up to those obligations and the local authorities that are responsible for enforcing the legislation are able to do that and that they do so.  That is where the Government's responsibility lies.  It is wrong for the Minister to outline that he does not have such responsibility.The Minister indicated he is to bring forward proposals to change the situation.  He referred to shared services within local authorities and how local authorities will come together on a regional basis.  In my local authority in Donegal one person has been working in building control.  Donegal is the fourth largest county in the country and a significant amount of development has taken place there.  If the person responsible for building control in Donegal is shared between Sligo and Leitrim, where one person in each of those counties is also responsible, there will still not be any enforcement or control.  As the Minister outlined in his contribution last night we need enforcement and control to ensure the quality of the built environment.  People engaged architects and others to design houses, and builders to build them, and relied on insurance such as HomeBond to ensure that if problems arose in the future they would have some come-back.  They need all of that and they need to be able to fall back on the State to ensure that regulations and compliance is enforced and that the standards are enforced across the board.  It is not right to expect home owners who have no expertise or ability to ensure that is done, and to expect them to deal with the situation and say they must paddle their own canoe and deal with whatever problems arise with their house by means of civil remedies.  The system of self-certification is not working.  There was intense lobbying prior to the introduction of the Building Control Act to ensure that self-certification would be introduced and that local authorities were removed from the process of overseeing construction projects.  That has led to the current situation.  The Minister must ensure the situation is not allowed to continue.In all cases the last input local authorities have is when a planning application is granted because they do not have the resources or ability to enforce proper building control.  We must ensure such a system is in place, that inspection rates are increased and that continuous inspections are made throughout the construction phase to ensure that standards are maintained.  Only by doing that can we ensure that people are required to live up to the building standards required by the self-certification system to which they have signed up.  I call on the Minister to ensure that the system in future guarantees that people can have confidence that they will get a product that stands up to wear and tear.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak to this important and comprehensive motion on building control and regulations.  I thank and commend my colleagues in the ULA and my other Independent colleagues for supporting this Private Members' motion, but importantly also for putting forward proposals and solutions that are sensible for householders and families.  The manner in which many families have been treated is an absolute disgrace, in particular those in Priory Hall and also those families affected by pyrite problems in their homes.  We all know people directly affected.  After today I hope we will see action from the Government on the issue but we must also see action on the part of relevant stakeholders such as banks, developers and builders.The motion deals comprehensively with the problems that have occurred in the construction industry as a result of the lack of adequate regulation and inspection and calls for a proper system of inspection in the future with the independent clerk of works function restored on building sites and improved regulation.The motion also calls on the State to take responsibility for a programme of remedial works in all areas where homes have been damaged such as Priory Hall, pyrite-ridden dwellings and developments with fire safety issues as a result of lack of inspection and regulation.  This is the core of the debate and these are the principles involved.The motion is an important one for home owners, including some of our constituents, who are experiencing the nightmare of living in structurally defective and potentially dangerous homes.  Most are paying large mortgages for the privilege of living in such conditions.  While I welcome the proposed new regulations in this regard, there is no proposal on dealing with existing damage, which would be essential.Home owners have waited a long time for these serious issues to be addressed and time is running out, as a number of Ministers mentioned last night.  The Government has been in office for nearly a year and a half.  It should get on with the job and look after the people in question.  The longer the issues are left unchecked, the worse the deterioration becomes and the greater the likelihood of an accident occurring.  I urge all representatives in the House to support this motion.A block of flats in Coolock in my constituency is experiencing significant fire safety issues.  We all know of the Priory Hall case - every Deputy supports its residents - as well as pyrite cases, but other areas deserve our total support.The motion contains three key demands.  First, building control should be a wholly public function.  It should be adequately staffed by competent building inspectors and involve inspections of all buildings that require commencement notices.  Approval should be required at all key stages of construction and costs should be incorporated into planning contributions.  The Government should not claim that it is not receiving ideas from the Opposition.Second, there should be a systematic and thorough inspection regime across the State to detect fire hazards as a result of inadequate regulation or non-compliance with such regulations as exist.  Third, the Government, having failed to implement building controls and allowed substandard and defective building practices throughout the State, must accept responsibility for remedial works to make buildings safe and fit for purpose as part of an emergency programme of necessary public works and, where possible, pursue the responsible developers and builders to recoup the cost to the State.  These are sensible proposals.We must face the reality that much of this is down to people not doing their jobs adequately.  Where pyrite is concerned, people were misled and some of those working on sites could not have known.  However, the question of human error must be addressed.  Certain standards must be maintained.  I have friends who are electricians, builders and plumbers.  When they heard these stories, they were flabbergasted that anyone would let through work of that standard regardless of inspections.  Even where a person is getting a small job done in his or her house, for example, in a utility room, certain standards must be met.  The majority of plumbers, electricians and bricklayers agree that poor work is unacceptable.Cowboy operators must be challenged.  I urge every Deputy to read this motion, which sets out a number of ideas.  For God's sake, the Government should do something for the families of Priory Hall and for those affected by pyrite problems.

I thank the United Left Alliance, ULA, and the Technical Group for tabling this motion and for giving such serious consideration to the many flagrant violations as well as for making positive suggestions.There are many good plasterers, plumbers and ground work contractors, sole traders and decent people who do and have always done their jobs right.  That was theirraison d’être.  If a family member of any Deputy does a job, he or she depends on his or her good name and reputation, which usually sees that person through.  However, the situation was hijacked.  That the Government, having been in office for 16 months, is blaming the last one without even considering this matter is a cop out, just as we saw with the legislation on lobbyists, which has been long-fingered.  I see no sign of it.  We are promised everything, but the problem lies with the lobbying system.  It got us into the madness of the Celtic tiger.  Ordinary decent families set up their homes.  Many took out huge mortgages, employed architects and engineers to design their houses, submitted the work for planning permission, received the permission, paid planning fees and development charges and wound up with a bad product because of cowboy builders and a lack of regulations, standards and inspections.  People were bullied off sites.  The situation was outrageous.  There was legislation to stop it, but we still face a mess.  Priory Hall and the pyrite cases have been mentioned, but there are Priory Halls up and down the country on a smaller scale.  People have been abandoned.  They are trying to repay mortgages.  As we saw this morning, not one of the 100 independent assessors for people in mortgage distress had been appointed.  We are bailing out the banks and the big developers, many of whom are working for NAMA.  The entire situation is a disgrace.  The banks are not giving a shilling to anyone and nothing is being done about this.  People are just rubbing their hands.  What did the Taoiseach do?  As with the Jim Reeves song, it is a case of “Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone” when the Taoiseach dials A for Angela.  She dials NB - Nice Boy - for him and gives him a pat on the back for passing the referendum and doing what he is told.  The situation is a mess and people are aghast that the House is letting it continue.I compliment two planning officers in south County Tipperary, Mr. Simon Howe and Mr. Alan Walsh.  They are doing their best and are often nearly threatened with being kicked and thrown into the river when they visit some sites.  Cowboys besmirched the good name of decent trades people and left us in an undignified mess.  The big builders got greedy and went to the tents.  They are still going to Punchestown and Leopardstown.  There might not be any tent, but the Fine Gael Party is happy to sup with them.  Lobbying is still happening there and I see no sign of it changing.  This is not a personal attack on the Ministers of State, but it is happening and members of that party know it.

Cowboys in south County Tipperary have built massive buildings and got away from Teagasc by claiming their buildings were for farming purposes when they were actually for storing ordinary people's misery and repossessed machinery.  The cowboys are looking for retention now.  I have made an objection.  The planner claims that hearsay and innuendo cannot be accepted.  I have been in the building and I have seen what goes on inside it.  I have a small bit of experience.  One could see an industrial printer the size of this floor in a building that is meant for cows.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, knows it.  Rubbing his hands, shaking his head and telling me to be careful is not an answer.The people are aghast.  They were promised much by Messrs Gilmore and Kenny.  The Taoiseach has given up.

#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	100	The hardships experienced by the residents of Priory Hall and following the litany of flooded estates, collapsed foundations, polluted drinking water supplies and defective septic tank systems are clear evidence of the failure to have consumer protection issues addressed in the building regulations.  The regulations' primary purpose is to protect the health, safety and welfare of people in and around buildings.  An objective reading of the regulations leads to the conclusion that they are anti-consumer and written by or for the benefit of the construction industry, not for the protection of the consumer.The drafting of the regulations has been farmed out to a quango.  The Building Regulations Advisory Board, BRAB, comprises members of the construction industry and is not for the protection of consumers.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's policy facilitates a system in which building products are officially certified as being fit for purpose based purely on manufacturers' claims, not independent testing.  This official certification, whether intended or not, deceives consumers into believing that it provides a guarantee of performance and some level of protection if a product subsequently fails.  The policy of directing local authorities to impose seriously flawed codes of practice, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency's 2009 code on specifiers and installers of wastewater treatment systems, not only exposes the consumer to defective systems but also places the local authority in the chain of liability when failed systems cause pollution or a risk to public health.  Unfortunately, homeowners are at the receiving end of this policy.  The Department's policy of facilitating what are essentially meaningless certifications is a fraud on consumers.  It has allowed those in the construction chain of responsibility to walk away when a problem arises, thereby making homeowners liable for non-compliance issues or costs associated with remediation.Any policy that places unnecessary hardship on homeowners and exposes the State to claims for damages must be corrected as a matter of the utmost urgency.  For consumer protection, it is necessary to take urgent action.  All building materials and products should be covered by supplier product liability insurance cover.  The building professionals engaged in design and certification of development have the appropriate professional indemnity insurance cover for the work they undertake.  This should also apply to all construction contractors and subcontractors whose work must be insured and certified as fit for its intended purpose.  Such insurance cover must continue to be effective, even where the insured party ceases trading.  All products and services provided should comply with the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, the General Product Safety Regulations 2005 and the Consumer Protection Act.  There is an urgent need for the Oireachtas and departmental officials to resist the construction industry's and other corporate influences and instead place the emphasis on the protection of the consumer.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Like other Members, I received a magazine from the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, this week.  I could not but be struck by its front page headline, "Building a Better Ireland".  I found this rather ironic when we consider what the CIF's members have built which is central to this debate.  We have homeowners in mortgage debt arrears, negative equity and living in ghost estates with no facilities and then the appalling conditions in certain homes with fire hazards and pyrite.  This is all due to a lack of regulation, inspection and the elimination of the functions of the Clerk of Works.Flicking through the CIF's magazine, my attention was caught by another article entitled, "Safety First".  I support its call for ensuring the safety of workers on building sites, as we know there have been far too many fatalities.  The CIF claimed in the article that it was playing its part to maintain high standards of on-site safety, which I support.  However, where is it in maintaining high standards among builders and developers?I have been involved with constituents in Ballybough dealing with pyrite problems in their homes.  They were so thrilled to move into their new homes only to discover, gradually, the structural damage caused to their homes by pyrite.  It included cracks in the brickwork, fractures in houses, tiles coming up, floors moving and doors starting to move out of alignment.  Some of the builders involved are still working, some are not.  I cannot understand why they are not pursued.  Neither can I understand why pyrite was not covered by builders' insurance.  This problem is now with Dublin City Council and the residents are waiting for the promises made to be fulfilled.  These include the undertaking of a comprehensive independent survey to ascertain the full extent of the problem.  There is a specific role for Dublin City Council and other local authorities.  However, there is also a role for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which must commit to funding to ensure these homes are restored to the standard the residents deserve.It is scandalous to learn of a fire safety certificate being issued prior to building commencing with no follow-up during construction.  I must acknowledge that my contact with fire officers in Dublin City Council has been positive.  They acted quickly in a particular apartment block that had come to my attention.  Self-regulation should not be on the agenda because inspection should be rigid, strict and independent of vested interests.  The great line inHamlet about something rotten in the state of Denmark applies to the construction industry, the planning sector and the development culture, with its unhealthy relationship between certain politicians, political parties and developers.  Crony capitalism is really corruption and we saw what it led to.All planning decisions should be made in a comprehensible and transparent way.  That is the start of solving the problems in this sector.  Central to these problems is land speculation.  In 1974 the Kenny report called for an effective end to land speculation.  If only this recommendation had been implemented, proper standards would have been set, starting with planning procedures and moving to actual building.  Before he left office, the then environment Minister, Mr. John Gormley, had been working on a review of planning practices in several local authorities.  He had received reports from county managers to start that process.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question this week which stated the Minister was proceeding on the basis of the work already done in this area and would examine cases.  I wonder about it being done internally.I support An Taisce's call for an independent planning regulator.  The rottenness at the core of the sector must be rooted out because it is unfair to those builders who follow ethical standards and proper procedures.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The debate which I have listened to intently has shown the Building Control Act is robust, probably the most robust in Europe.  The problem, however, lies with regulation, enforcement and the provision of resources to ensure the regulations are followed.  This has been linked with the relationship between government and developers, light touch regulation and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government taking the Clerk of Works out of the equation in the 1990s.  This seeped into the merry-go-round which developed around the bubble of the building industry in the past 20 years.  For Fianna Fáil to claim it is not part and parcel of it is cynical.When I became a councillor in 2004, I recall seeing a plaque in Dublin City Hall, "Property has rights as well as responsibilities".  Dublin City Council played a role in facilitating the property and building madness.  A week after the 2007 general election a public meeting was called in Crumlin to highlight a new design for Crumlin village.  The architect was present to show designs with six storey buildings throughout the village.  This rang alarm bells in my mind.  It was a green light for developers that the local authority was accepting this level of development in the area.A campaign was subsequently instigated, the Dublin 12 Action Group, in which locals got together to protect their area.  Planning applications were submitted for developments in Pearse Park, on church sites, the Davitt Road bank and on the Naas Road.  These sites are now derelict and communities are left to deal with them.  It was left to the campaigns of ordinary people who were trying to get to grips with the development plan and stop the madness in their communities.  When I called for a moratorium on the proposed Bluebell local area plan, Fine Gael local authority members told me we could not touch these developers as they had all the rights.  One had to pay €20 to submit observations on the plan.  We proposed that developers send planning applications to every household in an area rather than hiding them in doorways.  The whole system, from top to bottom, had been designed to facilitate the developers who subsequently brought the country to its knees.  The issue of enforcement must be addressed and the Bill must bring forward a Clerk of Works process from beginning to end that is independent of developers.  That is the key, as many engineers, etc. have been put under significant pressure by major developers to sign off on projects.  The State must provide for such persons to be independent of developers while working in local authorities; they can take responsibility for these matters, which is an important issue in terms of insurance if there are problems subsequently.I will discuss how this issue has affected local authority housing.  As a result of the madness, a significant number of tenants in Dolphin House in the north inner city, Ballybough flats and St. Teresa's Gardens have been left in terrible conditions.  Tenants from Dolphin House have gone to the European Court of Human Rights because they are living in atrocious Third World conditions.  It is shameful that even now the country is not addressing the problem.  We have local authorities with inspectors to check private accommodation in following health and safety regulations, but the authorities are not accepting responsibility for their own tenants and buildings which do not meet health and safety regulations.  Young children in these buildings are catching diseases and local authorities must take responsibility.  The State should also intervene.Could pyrite still find its way into the system under the new regulations?  We should have building regulations providing for standards in respect of in-fill stone, etc.  There should also be regulation of banks and local authority actions.  There is much to be done and it is not acceptable to argue that what has been done to date by the Minister is enough.  A point that has struck me is that substantial compliance measures do not form part of the building regulations but were developed by the legal profession.  The Minister also mentioned certificates of compliance and administration procedures governing their use.  If these measures are not recognised in the building regulations, why are they still being adhered to?  We should take them out and put proper regulations in place.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	103	In the past two days we have had a full and frank exchange of views on the role and functioning of the building control system.  The legitimate questions and concerns raised naturally arise in the wake of high profile failures in the housing and construction sector in recent years which have been mentioned in detail again in this debate.Many throughout the country are faced, through no fault of their own, with the stressful and distressing consequences of living in unfinished and underpopulated estates, in a building susceptible to the effects of pyritic in-fill materials, or in homes and developments subject to serious fire and safety risks arising from the failure of particular developers and professionals to abide by the requirements of the building, fire safety and planning codes.  It may be convenient and even consolatory for some commentators to paint a picture of a light touch regulatory system in which the State has abdicated all responsibility and left housing and construction to the whims of unscrupulous developers who allow no meaningful input by construction professionals or the legal profession.  That is not the case, however, and this debate has at least given the Government and the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, an opportunity to set out the factual position and balance the discussion on this critical matter.  Importantly, the Minister opened the debate by setting out clearly the building control arrangements in place and explaining the roles and responsibilities of various parties.  The State has a clear statutory framework for building controls based on clear legal standards set out in the building regulations, with detailed technical guidance documents outlining how these standards can be achieved in practice, with the responsibility for compliance resting primarily with developers or builders who engage professionals, as required, to ensure statutory requirements are met.  Responsibility for enforcement rests with local authorities.The Minister has indicated that he is committed to strengthening the building control system and has made substantial progress in this regard.  In July last year he announced a number of measures to be advanced by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities, with a view to improving compliance with and oversight of the requirements of the building regulations.  In broad terms, the measures involved the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the building regulations had been met.  The lodgement of drawings at both commencement and on completion of construction demonstrates how a building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the building regulations.We will also have more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective oversight of building activity.  Standardised approaches and common protocols will ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions, with better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.  The proposed building control amendment regulations will provide for mandatory certification and the lodgement of drawings.  These have already been the subject of public consultation which closed in recent weeks and some 500 submissions have been received, which indicates the degree of interest in and depth of feeling about this matter.  The submissions are being reviewed by the Department with a view to having the proposed building control amendment regulations finalised and signed into law later this year.  The other measures, to which I have referred, are relevant to more meaningful oversight of building activity by building control authorities and the improved functioning of these authorities; they are being advanced separately by local authorities in consultation with the Department in the context of a wider programme in achieving greater efficiencies in the local government system.The Minister and the Department have a responsibility to guide and regulate development.  However, there is a point at which it is up to the construction industry and its professions to take over and ensure planning, design and construction of the built environment are of the very highest quality.  The proposed regulatory reforms, in the form of mandatory certificates and submission of drawings, will be finalised and signed into law in the coming months.  They will provide a new context for the construction sector and construction professionals.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I received an e-mail from a constituent, a young woman living in Applewood in Swords.  She was told her apartment did not comply with fire safety standards.  With her neighbours, she was told she would have to pay €3,200 to make the building safe unless she wanted to find herself in the same position as the Priority Hall residents.  When she contacted the management company and indicated she did not have the money, her debt was passed to a debt collector.  The e-mail states:I just do not know what to do.  I have no savings.  I owe the bank and the credit union so much money that I would never qualify for a loan, and even if I did, I could not afford the repayments.  I pay my mortgage every month, no matter how much of a struggle it is, and all the things I have to do without to pay it and my credit union loan.  I do not know what to do.  I thought you might be able to help.The Visitors Gallery is full of people who find themselves in a similar position.  They have been evacuated from their homes in Priory Hall and given up their holidays to come and listen to the debate.  They are doing so because their homes are without value.  They are not here for the good of their health but because they want help.Labour Party Deputies have claimed the State has no responsibility and talk as if this would be some kind of bailout for the construction industry.  They should be ashamed of themselves; they have long left the tradition of the likes of James Connolly.  These victims bought their homes in the belief they were buying a product fit for purpose.  The regulations have failed them.Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, indicated that there was a robust system of building controls in place and that local authorities were successfully using their powers against non-compliant operators.  That is simply not true; it is utter rubbish.  If it was the case, those present in the Visitors Gallery would not be here and there would not be the problems being described.  Unless the Government understands the problem, it will not be able to formulate a solution.  This is not a personal attack, as the problem is systemic.The Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee, was being nice yesterday when he spoke about others speaking up before the last general election.  He was the sole voice on these issues.  The Government cannot keep blaming Fianna Fáil for these problems.  Unless the Government changes its approach and deals with this, the problem will not be addressed.  The approach outlined just now by the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and by the Minister last night is predicated on the basis of avoiding responsibility for the State and minimising any expense to it at the expense of quality workmanship and fit for purpose products for householders.  Unless we change that attitude, there can be no resolution.The current regulations are not bad but they are not policed or enforced and that is where the problem arises.  The Government's own policy ensures that will continue.  It brags about a situation where it inspects 23% of sites when only 15% inspection is required.  That is nothing about which to brag because much of that inspection is superficial.  There cannot be any shortcuts here.  There is a proposal for a State inspection process involving foundations, wall plates and presumably roofs upon completion but that is not enough.  Self-certification is good, all of those involved in the construction should sign off on their work, but it must be checked.  In buildings where fire is an issue there must be 100% checking.  That is the system in other states and our citizens deserve no less.The Government is not proposing that.  Unless it deals with this and the restoration of the building inspector function, these problems will remain.  That is the fundamental basis of this motion: for a publicly independent inspectorate to regulate work from now on with adequate resources.  The Government has some neck to suggest local authorities have the wherewithal to do this with a recruitment embargo in place and a lack of resources.  It will not happen.The idea that the responsibility will be placed on architects is all the Government has come up with.  It is ludicrous.  In effect, architects are being criminalised because they must sign off on everything.  They are not on-site and do not have the expertise to judge all this.  It is like asking a hairdresser to fix a pair of shoes.  They do not have the competence; this is simply another game of buck passing.  That must be addressed or we cannot move forward.A Labour Party Deputy said we were slagging off all builders but that is not the case; he obviously cannot read the initial part of the text.  There are many good builders, architects and engineers.  The motion speaks about the inordinate influence of major developers and big business and that is the case.  This was not just during the property bubble, there was a Labour Party Minister for the Environment a year after the Stardust tragedy and the party remained in power for years afterwards and did nothing because the industry resisted changes.  That resistance still exists.We must acknowledge the pyrite issue.  Pyrite could have been avoided.  The knowledge existed that it was a problem and it should have been tested but was not.  There is recognition from the State that standards were not good enough.  How do we know?  Because the Government has changed the standards.  The problem is, however, that the changes are not good enough either.  I do not say that lightly.  The new standard the Government brought in was based on advice from the aggregates panel, particularly the concrete industry.  Who are these people?  There are seven of them on the panel and five come from the concrete industry, from Roadstone, Kilsaran, Irish Cement and the Irish Concrete Federation.  Two of those organisations are known to have quarries with heave inducing pyrite and these were the people who decided what the new standard would be.  On foot of their deliberations the new Irish standard is unacceptable to Premier Insurance, which would not insure property built on infill based on that standard because it is not deemed to be good enough because standards are less stringent than those in Britain for sulphur content likely to lead to pyrite-induced heave.Despite all that has happened, the Minister is leaving it to the quarries to decide what is fit for purpose.  The only recourse people have now from that is under the Sale of Goods Act after the fact.  When the house has fallen down and someone's life is in tatters, he can consider litigation to go after the quarry owner to try and get the money back.  It is absolute and utter nonsense.  The regulations must be changed to protect homeowners.  There must be mandatory testing.There is a similar situation with fire safety which, in many ways, is of even greater concern.  Deputy Higgins made the point last night about the potential serious loss of life that would have existed in the development in Holywell in Swords had the fire taken place while people were in bed.  Luckily it did not.  Fingal County Council has a major report that documents a litany of problems jeopardising fire safety in this area.  Mr. Noel Manning, the independent fire inspector, shows in graphic detail photographs of failed cavity barriers that had been tested and certified that were lying on the ground, failed party wall at eaves' level and that had been certified as compliant when they were not in reality.  It goes on and on.We will have a scenario where fatalities will occur unless the Government does what is called for in the second part of this motion and carries out a systemic and thorough inspection regime across the State to detect fire hazards as a result of inadequate regulation and non-compliance.  The Government must undertake this.  Why should people like the young woman who emailed me three weeks ago bear the cost of that?  Why should the victims pay the costs?  Unless these works are done there will be a serious social problem and the Government must address that point and carry out those works.The key point remaining relates to the State's responsibility.  No one is saying the Government built these houses or is responsible, no more than society took an active interest in the scandalous abuse cases involving the Catholic Church, when the State stepped in and admitted partial responsibility because it stood idly by.  It set up a trust fund in that case because the starting point was the victims had to be assisted.  Deputy Mathews made the point last night that the safety of residents and remedial work being carried out had to be the starting point in these deliberations.  Then it is time to chase the money, to go after the developers, quarry owners, banks and insurance companies.We know from questions asked by Deputy Catherine Murphy that there is almost €1 billion in development levies in local authority bank accounts, money they are not allowed to use or invest.  That money, particularly where those levies relate to estates that have heave-inducing pyrite and other problems should have that money invested in a remedial programme of public works to make good those houses.  We have the €2 billion promised by NAMA to invest in capital projects.  What better work to be done than to fix these houses?  Unless the State takes the lead in this, it will not happen and these people will not get justice.There is a precedent and the interests of the homeowner must come first.  Some Deputies have a neck to talk about this motion being premature, when people have been grappling with this issue for years.  It is an insult to talk like that.  The Minister's proposals are completely inadequate to deal with this situation.  The State is responsible and must take a lead and would provide a beneficial stimulus.  For every €1 billion invested in construction,10,000 jobs would be generated.  Many people would benefit from that and the work would be carried out.I note the points of concern about constituents - some of them more convincing than others - expressed by Government Deputies.  They are in power now, however, and it is up to them.  It is the case that blame lies with Fianna Fáil and the Galway tent when demonstrating the inordinate influence of major developers and big builders on policy in this State but this Government is now holding the reins and will be judged on how it deals with this systemic crisis.  That must start not with words or the waffle in the new building regulations, which will not address the issue, but with the restoration of an independent building inspectorate that carries out 100% checks on works and with the Government taking responsibility for the victims of this crisis and immediately engaging in a State-led programme of remedial works and inspection to undo the damage that has been done.  Nothing else will do.  These people will not go away until these issues are resolved.  Sadly, this will not be the last time we will discuss this issue but I am glad it has been raised.  We will return to it in the months ahead.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I thank the House for agreeing to discuss the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012.  As Deputies will be aware, the Government published this Bill at the beginning of last month in line with our explicit commitment to make available well in advance of the referendum all legislative proposals which were in any way related to the stability treaty.  I look forward to a constructive debate on the ESM treaty and the ESM Bill.  The Bill is required to allow Ireland to ratify the ESM treaty, in accordance with the agreement by the euro area Heads of State or Government on 9 December 2011 on the acceleration of the ESM into force by July 2012.Before I return to the specifics of the ESM treaty and the ESM Bill 2012, I would like to say a few words on recent developments.  Ireland has made significant progress in the implementation of its EU-IMF programme of financial support.  Our programme is on track, we have met all of our commitments and exceeded many - completing more than 100 actions to date - and we are on track to reduce our deficit to below 3% in 2015.  We have also negotiated a number of improvements to the programme since taking office, including the reduction in the interest rate, reversal of the minimum wage cut, the jobs initiative, the deferral of the promissory note payment and most recently the agreement to reinvest at least 50% of the proceeds from the sale of State assets into viable projects.  We also negotiated an additional year for the programme, so it is 2015 rather than 2014 as originally intended.However, significant external challenges remain.  Last week, the people voted in favour of the stability treaty - another step on the road towards economic recovery.  I welcome that and thank everyone who came out to vote, especially those who voted "Yes".  The people have recognised the importance of restoring confidence in a stable euro, ensuring Ireland has the assurance of access to EU funds under the ESM treaty, should they be required, and the importance of good housekeeping for our economy.Put simply, we cannot continue to spend more than we raise in taxes, increasing our debt levels and draining the resources intended for stimulating economic growth, job creation and public services in order to service our spiralling debt.  The "Yes" vote last week recognises that we have to manage our debt and budgets.  Ratifying the stability treaty will demonstrate our commitment to do just that.  The Government will now begin the process of ratification of the stability treaty.  As we have already said, we will also participate proactively in the discussions on a growth strategy agenda for Europe which will be the foremost item for discussion when the European Council meets later this month.Turning to the ESM, this Government believes the availability to Ireland of a credible funding backup as provided by the ESM treaty will be very important in terms of market re-entry and leaving the EU-IMF programme of support.  There is no clear answer to the question as to where else financial assistance could be found were a situation to evolve in which we required further assistance.  Enacting the ESM Bill 2012 and ratifying the ESM treaty will ensure that Ireland has access to this funding safety net if our efforts to re-access the market are delayed in any way and we need to resort to further assistance.The effective lending capacity of the ESM will be €500 billion.  Following the euro group meeting held on 30 March 2012, it was decided that the EFSF would remain active until July 2013.  The ESM will be the main instrument to finance new programmes as from July 2012.The EFSF will, as a rule, remain active only in financing programmes that have started before that date.  For a transitional period until 2013, the EFSF may engage in new programmes in order to ensure full fresh lending capacity of €500 billion for the ESM.  After 2013, the EFSF will continue in an administrative capacity until all outstanding bonds have been repaid.  In this context, there is provision that the ESM may assume the rights and responsibilities of the EFSF.  Such an event would not, however, affect the existing terms and conditions of our EFSF loans.Turning to the ESM treaty and its provisions, the treaty set out in the Schedule to this Bill was signed by euro area member states on 2 February 2012.  The original version of the treaty was signed on 11 July 2011 but was subsequently modified to incorporate decisions taken by the euro area Heads of State or Government on 21 July and 9 December 2011 aimed at improving the effectiveness of the mechanism.The ESM will perform the same activities as the European financial stability framework, which it is to replace, namely, issue bonds or other debt instruments on the market to raise the funds needed to provide loans to countries in financial difficulties, intervene in the primary and secondary debt markets, act on the basis of a precautionary programme and finance recapitalisations of financial institutions through loans to governments, including in non-programme countries.  All financial assistance to member states will be provided under appropriate conditions, appropriate to the financial instrument chosen.  The ESM will use an appropriate funding strategy to ensure access to broad funding sources and enable it to extend financial assistance packages to member states under all market conditions.As Deputies will be aware, there has been considerable attention paid to the challenges facing the banking sector in Europe in recent weeks.  There are increasing numbers of calls for the ESM's tools to be extended to allow the ESM to recapitalise systemically important financial institutions directly rather than recapitalise through loans to ESM members for the specific purpose of recapitalising its financial institutions, thereby not adding to national debt by separating sovereign and banking debt.As the Taoiseach said last week, the developing circumstances in Europe's banking sector require a comprehensive solution and Ireland's banking debt must form part of that solution.  We will continue to monitor closely developments in Spain and elsewhere and we will seek a solution that works for Ireland - through assisting our economic and financial recovery - to ensure that Ireland's bank debt is made more sustainable.The ESM treaty will enter into force as of the date when instruments of ratification, approval or acceptance have been deposited by signatories whose initial subscriptions represent no less than 90% of the total subscriptions set out in the treaty.  To date, France, Greece and Slovenia have ratified the ESM treaty and the remaining euro area member states are on track for ratification and the coming into force of the ESM in July.As Deputies will be well aware by now, the ESM treaty provides that the granting of financial assistance in the framework of new programmes under the ESM will be conditional, as of 1 March 2013, on the ratification of the stability treaty by the ESM member concerned and on the implementation of the balanced budget rule as specified in the stability treaty within the agreed timeline, that is, one year after the entry into force of the latter.  The stability treaty contains a mirroring provision.As Deputies will also be aware, the linkage of both the ESM and the stability treaty refers to new applications for assistance under the ESM and will not affect the transfer to the ESM of undisbursed amounts under the EFSF to Ireland and other programme countries.  Thus, while the ESM will replace the EFSF and may assume the rights and obligations of the EFSF, this will not affect the terms and conditions of any amounts consequently transferred to the ESM and subsequently disbursed to Ireland.To obtain the highest possible credit rating, the capital structure of the ESM will have total subscribed capital of €700 billion.  Of this, €80 billion will be in the form of paid-in capital by the euro area member states, paid in five equal instalments from July 2012.  The balance, €620 billion, will be callable capital.  The contribution key for each member state is set out in Annex 1 of the treaty and is based on the ECB capital contribution key.  For Ireland, the key is 1.592% of the total paid and committed capital.Ireland's share of the €80 billion in paid-in capital, based on the contribution key, will be just above €1.27 billion.  We will pay this into the ESM in five equal instalments of €254 million.  Unlike the EFSF, there is no stepping-out facility in the ESM when members enter a programme of support.  Every member must, therefore, contribute its paid-in capital.The ESM is being established as an intergovernmental organisation under public international law.  Ireland's contribution will be treated as a financial transaction.  This means that while it will impact on Ireland's Exchequer borrowing requirement, it will not impact on its general Government deficit.  Ireland's share of the €620 billion callable capital is based on the same key, that is, 1.592% of €620 billion, making the callable capital €9.87 billion, which will be accounted for as a contingent liability on the State.Following the decision of the euro group on 30 March 2012, the paid-in capital will be made available more quickly than initially foreseen in the original ESM treaty.  Two tranches of capital will be paid in 2012, the first in July and the second by October.  Another two tranches will be paid in 2013 and a final tranche in the first half of 2014.  In line with the ESM treaty, the payment of the capital will be further accelerated if needed to maintain a 15% ratio between the paid-in capital and the outstanding amount of ESM issuances.Any decision to change the authorised capital stock of the ESM will require a unanimous decision of the ESM's board of governors.  I will be governor for Ireland at the board and serve to ensure Ireland's interests are represented and protected.Before I turn to the Bill itself, I will address specific issues that have arisen in recent weeks.  This Government has no intention of trying to the veto the ESM, nor can Ireland prevent the establishment of the ESM.  As I have already mentioned the ESM will come into force once the ESM treaty has been ratified by euro area member states representing 90% of the ESM capital commitments.  Ireland represents 1.592%.In addition to the 17 euro countries ratifying the treaty establishing the ESM, all 27 member states are in the process of ratifying an amendment to Article 136 of the EU treaties, which deals with arrangements for the euro, to include a reference to the possibility of a stability mechanism, such as the ESM.The second issue I want to address concerns calls for a referendum on the ESM treaty.  The reason we are not holding a referendum on the ESM is very simple.  The ESM is a funding agreement which is fully compatible with the Irish Constitution.  Ireland's participation in the ESM does not in any way serve to limit the sovereignty of the State in the exercise of its economic affairs.  It merely indicates the State's willingness to participate as an equal sovereign nation in the permanent stability mechanism.The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate further, in the public interest, the financial stability of the European Union by establishing a permanent stability mechanism to assume the tasks of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing, where needed, financial assistance to euro area member states.Section 1 provides the definitions to the legislation.Section 2 provides to the Minister for Finance the authority to make payments to the ESM to cover Ireland's contribution to our share of the authorised capital stock of the ESM in accordance with the treaty.Section 3 provides for payments to the ESM in respect of Ireland's contribution to the ESM's authorised capital stock to be paid out of the Central Fund.  This provision caps payment at €11,145,400,400 being Ireland's share of the authorised capital stock as set out in Annex II of the ESM treaty.  That covers both paid-in capital and callable capital.  As I have already outlined, paid-in capital will amount to €1.27 billion, with the remainder callable should the need arise.Section 4 provides that any monies received from the ESM be it in the form of dividends or otherwise be paid into the Exchequer.Section 5 provides that the ESM be immune from legal proceedings and enjoy inviolability in respect of official papers and documents.  Section 6 provides that the ESM shall be exempt from the requirement to be authorised or regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Section 7 provides that the ESM be exempt from taxation, income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax and any other taxation provided for by Article 36 of the ESM treaty.Section 8 provides that the Minister for Finance shall arrange for six-monthly reports on payments made to the ESM by Ireland and any moneys received by Ireland from the ESM to be laid before Dáil Éireann.  Section 9 provides that expenses incurred by the Minister for Finance in the administration of this legislation shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.Section 10 is a standard section defining the Short Title of the Act.Schedule 1 contains the text of the ESM treaty in the Irish language.  Schedule 2 contains the text of the ESM treaty in the English language.As Deputies will be aware the ESM treaty itself includes provisions on membership and purpose of the ESM, governance, authorised capital stock, operations and financial management, general provisions and transitional arrangements to apply on the move from the EFSF to the ESM.I look forward to a constructive debate on this Bill.  Now is a time for unity among euro area countries to ensure financial stability within the euro area.  The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the stability of the European Union and the safeguarding of the euro area as a whole.  Ireland must play its part and stand in solidarity with our fellow euro area member states.  It is in the interests of this country and the euro area.  Therefore, I urge Deputies to support the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012.I commend the Bill to the House.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I thank the Minister for his Second Stage speech in respect of the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012.At the outset, I want to state on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party that we will be supporting this Bill.  We believe that the establishment of the ESM is important for Europe and Ireland.  While we were not voting in the ESM, issues pertaining to the establishment and the operation of the ESM and its relevance were very well ventilated over the past number of weeks during the fiscal stability referendum campaign.Three years into the crisis, Europe still does not have a common agreed framework for winding down insolvent banks and avoiding all costs falling on taxpayers.  The permanent bailout mechanism envisaged by the ESM will be a help towards stabilising the eurozone in general but it is only one element of what is needed and its current mandate is quite limited.  We, in Ireland, simply cannot go through another round of expensive bank recapitalisations.  Indeed, we also need mitigation of the costs incurred to date.As the Minister stated at the outset, this Bill is required to allow Ireland ratify the ESM treaty.  Given where we are in terms of the current EU-IMF programme, which we all hope that Ireland will be in a position to exit towards the end of next year, we are living through extraordinarily turbulent times, in particular throughout Europe.  Who knows what the prospects are for Ireland to exit the programme successfully?  It is essential that we have the backdrop of access to ESM funding in the event that we need it.  When one considers the data today from the CSO in the Quarterly National Household Survey, where unemployment has gone up to 14.8% and where the number at work in Ireland is at its lowest levels since 2003, we face enormous economic challenges as a country in our interaction, not only with Europe but with the domestic economy as well.  It is fundamental for this country that we would have access to the ESM in the event that we need it.There are aspects of the ESM treaty that I do not particularly like.  For example, the provision in the legislation which is provided for in the treaty which makes the ESM immune from legal proceedings is one that I do not understand.  No individual or institution should be immune from legal proceedings.  Every person has a right to initiate proceedings against any other person or against an institution.  Having said that, overall, my party believes it is correct to ratify the ESM treaty and to ensure that Ireland is an active member of the ESM.As part of a comprehensive solution, I suggest we need to do much more.  Specifically, we need to expand the mandate of the ESM so it can inject funds directly into failing banks.  The Minister referred to this in his opening remarks.  He did not state whether the Government is supportive of that but I understand, from recent comments by the Taoiseach and others, that the Government supports a change to the mandate of the ESM in order to allow it directly to recapitalise banks.  This would allow collective support for regional banking crises.  If we are to operate as a true currency union, this is something that is urgently needed.  It would also have the advantage that the recapitalisation aid would not add to any individual country's debt levels.  This could increase the Government's chances to continue raising money on financial markets to fund normal day-to-day operations.Spain is only now going through the painstaking process of conducting an in-depth analysis of its banking sector which we did through the establishment of NAMA and the various PCAR exercises that we went through in this country.  From reading various media reports of the estimated cost of bailing out Spanish banks, I have seen figures of between €40 billion and €80 billion, and even suggestions that it could be as high as €200 billion.  I only hope that they can get to the bottom of the losses in their banking system as quickly as possible.  It took Ireland quite some time to get to the bottom of the losses in the banking system, given the dishonesty and the failure to recognise the reality within the institutions themselves.  It is essential for Spain and for the wider eurozone that some certainty is brought to the full extend of their banking crisis as quickly as possible.  If our experience in Ireland is anything to go by, as they delve ever deeper into the details of the bad loans associated with their property collapse, they may find the position much worse than originally feared.  I note that they have engaged the services of some of the largest accountancy firms to assist them in this regard and the IMF is due to table a report in the coming days as well.  Spain has indicated that within the next two weeks it will make a decision regarding the recapitalisation of its banks.  I wish them well in their endeavours.  It will be a mammoth task to get a handle on the scale of the problem but it is in everyone's interest that this would be done as quickly as possible.Spain is the fourth largest economy in the eurozone.  While I am sure the Minister did not intend to be flippant in his comments about feta cheese in Greece, he fully appreciates the importance of the Spanish economy in the eurozone and in terms of its relationship with Ireland, and the potential impact that any further destabilisation in Spain could have on our prospects for economic recovery.  It is in all of our interests that some certainty is brought to their situation as quickly as possible.The speculation seems to be drifting ever closer to some kind of a bailout for Spain, even if it is ring-fenced for dealing with their banks as opposed to sovereign funding.  I understand that Spain as a country is funded for the remainder of this year for its day-to-day operations but that their banks will need access to funding as soon as they face up to the bad loans they are carrying on their books.Increasingly, it looks like Spain will get some kind of a bailout from Europe and this brings us to the debate as to whether the recapitalisation of its banks will be channelled through the Spanish Government by way of the ESM lending to the Spanish Government and then the Government recapitalising the banks or whether the European countries will agree to change the terms of the treaty to allow the ESM to recapitalise the banks directly.  This opens a window of opportunity for us which I will address presently.  The expansion of the ESM should go hand-in-hand with pan-European regulation of the banking system such that countries in Europe could collectively take responsibility for banking failures.  The Central Bank Governor, Patrick Honohan, has endorsed this approach in recent statements and I agree with him in this regard.  His contention is that a centralised regulatory system would not be affected by national blind spots, such as the Irish property bubble, and could, therefore, do a more effective job of supervising banks.  This is an interesting idea.  He noted that there would be still a role for individual countries in supervision since, as he put it, often they pick up the vibes and the market talk.  Clearly such a system should combine local knowledge and expertise with the more critical eye that a pan-European structure would bring.To date the European Central Bank has repeatedly insisted that it has no role in banking supervision.  This may be because national authorities closely guard their right to regulate their banks under the current system but it may also reflect a narrow view on the part of the ECB in respect of its true role.  This issue highlights one of the fundamental flaws in the design of monetary union in the first place.  The discussion about the possible emergence of a banking union and proper pan-European regulation of banks is timely and we should move in this direction.We need to establish a Europe-wide deposit protection scheme.  At the moment Greek and Spanish savers are moving money out of local banks for fear that their countries will leave the euro and their savings will be re-denominated into new drachma or pesetas.  If there were a common deposit insurance scheme, funded appropriately, then this risk would be eliminated.  We should put in place a mechanism by which senior bondholders in bust banks take some of the pain in their rescue.I welcome the draft proposals published in recent days by the European Commission.  They open up an important debate in respect of senior bondholders.  The European Union should adopt a policy that sees senior bondholders incur losses if equity and subordinated bonds have been wiped out, if the bank has been nationalised and if the State has incurred losses of a certain percentage of GDP to bring the bank back to solvency.  The nature of that percentage could be a matter for policy discussion and it could evolve over time.  Given the state of euro area public finances, however, there is simply no room for another round of expensive bank bailouts.  Therefore, an approach of this sort may help to reduce the perceived riskiness of much of Europe's sovereign debt.This policy could subject some of the remaining IBRC senior bondholders in Ireland to severe haircuts without any contagion effect for other institutions, apart from those the markets suspect of being severely insolvent and to which states probably should be reluctant to offer blanket liability guarantees.  Given the timing involved for these new proposals to become operational, however, I imagine virtually all of the bondholders would be repaid in these circumstances.  If we are to make savings in respect of the bank bailout it should focus on some of the other aspects such as the promissory note, an issue to which I will return.Irish banks lent approximately €200 billion between 2002 and 2007.  It is reasonable to suggest that approximately €100 billion of that sum will never be repaid.  We have discussed the distribution of losses in the Irish banking system among junior bondholders and the taxpayer, and the fact that senior bondholders are immune as well as the fact that shareholders lost absolutely everything.It is interesting that every time the issue of reducing the cost of the bank bailout is raised by the Tánaiste in the House, he traces full culpability for the extent of the bailout in Ireland back to the bank guarantee.  I contest this assertion.  Certainly, it was not a foolproof policy response.  It was taken at the time with incomplete and undoubtedly false information supplied by the banks concerned.  However, I would welcome an inquiry into the banking guarantee because the more light shed on decisions of that nature, the better.  I believe the role of the European Central Bank since the beginning of this crisis should be considered as well.  I also hope we do not have to wait for the 30 year rule before some of the correspondence at the time of the bailout in November and December 2010 between the Government and the European Central Bank is released.  It is a matter of public interest that such information should be put into the public domain so that we can establish the demands the bank placed on Ireland at the time.I remind the Tánaiste and his colleagues in the Labour Party of some comments made by the Minister for Finance at the finance committee last September.  The Minister was challenged by Deputy Broughan about supporting the bank guarantee, the position taken by the Minister and his party in September 2008.  The Minister correctly pointed out that the proposal put forward by the Labour Party at the time would have been worse because the Labour Party sought to nationalise the entire banking system.  This would have taken on all the liabilities in full under the remit of the Sovereign on a permanent basis.  The Minister correctly pointed out to the Labour Party at the time that its proposal would have been worse.Ireland has a strong case for seeking a reduction in the burden of its bank-related debt.  The situation has changed completely since the promissory note was first signed.  That was before the EU-IMF programme, the Greek write-down, the establishment of the ESM and the decision in July last year of the euro area Heads of State and Governments to empower the EFSF to provide lending to countries for the recapitalisation of banks.  The draft European Commission paper has proposed that senior bondholders take losses.  Clearly, the sands are shifting in the debate in Europe about where banking losses should fall.  Ireland has faced up to its losses through the establishment of NAMA.  This crystallised the entirety of the banking losses immediately.  I have always taken the view that if there are losses, one is better off facing up to them and dealing with them.  Ireland may well be punished for going down that road because this course of action forced us to recapitalise the banks and to produce the funding to do so at a time when the European architecture simply was not in place to deal with bank bailouts.  Europe is now beginning to put such an architecture in place and the Minister and his colleagues have the job of trying to retrofit it for Ireland.  That is not an easy job and I wish them well, but we need to have clarity about where the negotiations on the promissory note are going.  Perhaps they simply became caught up in the crisis, which has intensified in recent weeks and which has stalled progress.I need not remind the Minister of his comments, one year ago this month in the United States, about seeking to impose losses on the remaining Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society bondholders, subject to European Central Bank approval.  The ECB approval was not forthcoming and the agenda moved on last September to the issue of the promissory note.  Negotiations on that issue began last November.  In October or November it emerged that there were discussions of a technical paper and technical negotiations.  It is now June 2012 but there is no sign of such a paper and we do not know what stage the negotiations have reached.  Perhaps it is all taking place in the background or perhaps it has been delayed because of the Spanish situation and the need for certainty on the question of from where Spain will get the money to recapitalise it banks.My interest in all of this is the outcome.  I hope Ireland will get the right outcome and that the burden will be relieved.  There is still €28 billion at play in respect of the promissory note.  The first €3.06 billion was paid in one of the Government's first acts on coming to office in March last year.  The bond replaced the €3.06 billion due last March and the matter has been kicked into touch for 12 months, subject to the Bank of Ireland shareholder approval.  There is still €28 billion at play and the promissory note represents the best prospect of getting a deal on bank debt.  Nevertheless, I hope the promissory note is not the limit of the Minister's ambition in seeking to get some fairness and equity for Ireland.  The promissory notes amount to more than €30 billion but a further €30 billion, approximately, has been invested in the other banks from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, cash reserves and borrowings.  I am sure the Minister is placing these issues on the table as it would make a significant difference to the sustainability of the national debt if they were addressed.  Our debt sustainability appears increasingly fragile and our prospects of successfully emerging from the current programme and raising money again on the bond markets at competitive interest rates are very much open to question.  While I hope we can achieve this objective, a game-changing initiative such as a comprehensive deal on the banking debt would help in no small way to ensure we exit the programme and return to the bond markets.The Fianna Fáil Party welcomes the Bill and supports the ratification of the European Stability Mechanism treaty.  I hope Ireland will not need to avail of ESM funding.  The fund which is expected to be established next month will provide an important firewall across Europe and its lending capacity will have to be increased over time.  Having made a start, however, it is important to make funding available without further delay.Certainty is required regarding Spain and Ireland needs to secure an outcome to its ongoing negotiations on the banking debt.  It is in the national interest to secure a deal to reduce the burden on Irish taxpayers.  This country took a major hit for the European team and it is time to bring some fair play and equity to the issue.  I wish the Minister well in his ongoing efforts in that regard.

Is mór an trua, mar a bhí pléite níos luaithe inniu, nach bhfuilimid ag fáil deise scrúdú iomlán a dhéanamh ar an pháirt seo den Bhille nuair atáimíd ag déileáil leis an Dara Chéim di.  Is mór an trua go bhfuil bac á chur ar an díospóireacht.  Sin ráite, ba mhaith liom cupla thuairim Pháirtí Shinn Féin a chur os comhair na Dála, ó thaobh bhunú an ESM, na lochtanna atá leis agus an gá go mbeadh institiúid ansin i lár na hEorpa atá ábalta airgead práinneach a thabhairt do thíortha atá taobh amuigh des na margaidh idirnáisiúnta.The crisis in the eurozone is deepening every day.  Nobel Prize winning economists inform us that the euro has only a 50-50 chance of survival.  Since 2010, the populations of Greece, Ireland and Portugal have been paying the price for an economic crisis we did not create.  We are being forced to pay the bills of the bankers, speculators, developers and politicians who ran our economies into the ground.  While some of these individuals were home-grown, many were from the stronger economies of the European Union, including France and Germany.All these national actors were encouraged in their reckless endeavours by a European Commission which was part of the failed policy consensus.  The policies of light touch banking regulation, unsustainable tax regimes, cheap money and aggressive lending combined to create an unsustainable boom and a catastrophic crash.  It should come as no surprise that the very same politicians and bankers who got us into the crisis have proved themselves unable to get us out of it.  How could it be different?  For two years political leaders across Europe have been dithering and procrastinating.  They have held 18 European Council crisis summits, most of which have been marked by indecision and disagreement.  When decisions have been made, they have either been insufficient or counterproductive.Throughout the entire eurozone crisis our political leaders have been misdiagnosing its causes and, in turn, prescribing the wrong medicine.  As a result, they have made the patient sicker by the month.  If they are allowed to continue on their current course, they will kill off the patient entirely, with devastating consequences for the economies and societies of the member states of the eurozone.The crisis in the eurozone is not a fiscal crisis; excessive deficits are a symptom of much more fundamental problems.  The crisis was not caused by the profligacy of the periphery.  The unsustainable debts of some member states are a symptom of much more systemic problems.  The initial crisis in banking led to a debt crisis which, in turn, led to an investment and employment crisis.  Focusing on deficit reduction alone, important as it may be, is a mistake.  The two most urgent questions facing the eurozone are how to reduce unsustainable levels of debt and how to increase investment in job creation to stimulate economic growth and social regeneration.  Unfortunately, our political leaders do not understand this.The European Council, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government continue to misunderstand the problem and, as a result, are applying the wrong solutions.  This is the reason the eurozone crisis is getting worse, Greece is approaching a state of social, economic and political collapse, Spain is in the process of negotiating access to emergency funding, and the Irish and Portuguese Governments will more than likely seek additional emergency funding when the current programmes end.For two years political leaders across Europe argued that the eurozone crisis was a fiscal crisis confined to the periphery of the eurozone.  By this logic, the solution was to impose harsh fiscal discipline on the people of the periphery, while protecting the European banking system with unlimited bailouts.  Crippling austerity and unlimited bank bailouts have been the sole focus of Government policy at home and in Brussels.  When Fianna Fáil and the Green Party led the State into the troika programme in 2010, Sinn Féin argued the their approach would not work and we were right.  When Fine Gael and the Labour Party committed to continuing the failed policies of their predecessors, Sinn Féin argued their approach would not work and we were also right.  The policies of crippling austerity and unlimited bank bailouts are not assisting our return to the sovereign bond markets.  The consequences of these policies are rising unemployment, declining growth, mortgage distress, emigration, inequality and poverty, in other words, a downward spiral of social, economic and political instability.  The policies pursued by European political leaders, including the Government, have failed dramatically.  Increasingly, even bodies such as the OECD, the IMF and, most recently, the European Commission are waking up to this failure.The eurozone's problem is not a lack of fiscal discipline but a famine of investment which is forcing millions of people onto the dole; a decline in living standards that is relentlessly depressing the domestic economy; a crippling banking debt that is being loaded onto the shoulders of taxpayers and freezing country after country out of the sovereign bond markets; and the futile policies of austerity which not only fail to resolve the crisis but make it worse.  For two years Sinn Féin has been arguing for a better way.  We have put forward solutions aimed at reducing the debt, growing the economy and getting the public finances in order in a way that is fair and assists economic and social recovery.  We have argued for a write-down of the portion of the public debt that originated with the banks, of which the promissory note is the most important element, to make our debt more sustainable and assist our return to the markets.  We have argued for an EU-wide approach to the banking crisis, demanding a new and rigorous round of stress tests of all European banks to expose the full extent of their toxic assets, to be followed by a write-down of these toxic assets before recapitalisation takes place.  We have argued for the European Central Bank to become a lender of last resort, either directly or indirectly, both to banks in need of recapitalisation and states locked out of sovereign bond markets.  Crucially, we have argued for massive investment in job creation through national and European Investment Bank funds to get people off the dole and back into meaningful employment.One cannot balance the books with an unemployment rate of 14%, nor can one cut and tax one's way out of the crisis.  Only with real and sustainable investment in job creation can one return to growth and, in so doing, reduce the deficit to the sustainable levels we desire.  In the context of this alternative strategy for job creation and growth, Sinn Féin supports the creation of a eurozone emergency fund to provide funds for member states frozen out of the bond markets.  Our preference would be for the ECB to fulfil this role, as only it has the firepower required to shore up the euro.  It is also the only body capable of providing such funding without exposing ordinary taxpayers and individual member states to the kind of liabilities foisted on the people of this state in recent years.  Given the rapidly deteriorating situation in Spain and Greece, a vehicle for providing such emergency funding is urgently required.The question we must ask during this debate is not whether the eurozone needs an emergency fund because clearly it does, nor is it whether Ireland should have access to such a fund because clearly it should; rather the key question is whether the European Stability Mechanism, as presented, will provide Ireland and the eurozone with the necessary tools to assist in stabilising the currency and allow governments to regain access to the sovereign bond markets.  With many others, Sinn Féin rightly criticised the design of the EFSF when it was established.  We argued that imposing austerity which was anti-job creation and anti-growth as a condition to receive emergency loans would be counterproductive.  We argued that mounting toxic private banking debt onto the shoulders of the State and taxpayers would make our debt burden unsustainable.  We argued that such conditions would block a return to growth and reduce the ability of the State to return to the sovereign bond markets.  The fact that Ministers are starting to accept that the State is unlikely to re-enter the bond markets in 2014 is evidence that Sinn Féin's analysis has been proved correct.  We also argued that the EFSF would not be big enough to cope with the growing debt and investment crisis across the eurozone.  The fact that the European Council has come forward with a new permanent emergency funding vehicle in the form of the European Stability Mechanism demonstrates once again that Sinn Féin's analysis was correct.  Unfortunately, neither the European Council nor the Government appears to have learned from the mistakes of the very recent past.The ESM is based on the same flawed policy agenda as its EFSF predecessor.  It has many of the same limitations and weaknesses of the EFSF.  Sinn Féin has a genuine concern that the fund as proposed will not help to stabilise the Irish or eurozone economies.  Just like the EFSF, we fear that it will make matters worse.  At the core of the fund are the failed policies of unlimited bank bailouts and crippling austerity.  These are the strict conditions referred to in the ESM treaty.  The treaty is very clear when it states the conditions attached to future loans will be negotiated by the European Commission and the European Central Bank.  What will these conditions be?  There will be more austerity in the form of cuts to spending on front-line services in health and education; more tax hikes for low and middle income families; more sales of profitable and strategically valuable State assets; more damage to the fabric of our society; and more damage to the domestic economy.  This approach has failed both Ireland and the eurozone.For an emergency fund to work, it must be part of a strategy aimed at investing in job creation and economic growth.  In Sinn Féin's view, the articles of the ESM treaty must be amended to include an explicit commitment to emergency funding being used to stimulate social and economic recovery, primarily in the form of investment in job creation.  If the Government is serious about developing a Europe-wide growth agenda and the European Council is serious about developing the same agenda, amending the ESM treaty to transform it into a tool for job creation and growth is essential.Sinn Féin is also concerned that, once again, taxpayers will be forced to bail out banks to an unlimited extent.  The current total fund for the ESM is €700 billion, to which Ireland's contribution is a staggering €11 billion.  While the initial call-up figure is just under €1.3 billion, once established the ESM can call on the remainder of the total.  The treaty also gives the ESM board the power to increase the total fund at its disposal.  This morning the newspapers were reporting that Spanish banks might require funds in the region of €100 billion which might come from ESM funds.  Theoretically, such funds would be provided in the form of loans, either to the Spanish Government or directly to the Spanish banks.  Does anyone in the House really believe a loan to toxic Spanish banks of around €100 billion would be repaid in full?  Just as the Government will never recoup the vast majority of the €64 billion pumped into the Irish banks, the ESM will never fully recoup funds injected into the Spanish banks on the basis of the current ESM funding model.The articles of the ESM treaty must be changed to reduce the risk of exposure to the taxpayer and the State.  This could be achieved by providing an option for direct funding of the ESM by the ECB, either through the issuing of bonds or quantitative easing, depending on which option was more appropriate at a given time.  This would also address another weakness of the ESM in its current form - its limited size.  Giving an emergency funding vehicle the unlimited firepower of the ECB would send a signal to the aggressive speculative forces in the markets that the European Union would do whatever it took to protect its currency.Sinn Féin also believes a eurozone emergency fund should be able to lend directly to banks and that such a facility should be retrospectively available to Ireland.  However, let us be clear that such a facility should only be made available following rigorous stress tests of the banks in question and a write-down of toxic assets held by them.  Only then should they be recapitalised.  European political leaders must learn from the mistakes of the mishandling of the Irish banking system.  Bondholders and banks must be forced to pay their fair share.  This means allowing some banks to fail.  It also means forcing heavy losses on bondholders.  Only then should recapitalisation occur, ensuring the injected funds benefit the real economy and real people.  Failure to do this will mean taxpayer's money will be handed over to European banks which, in turn, will pay bondholders in full.We are also very concerned that under the current proposals, member states in receipt of funds from the ESM would be contributing to the fund.  This raises the prospect of states contributing significant resources to the ESM and then borrowing them back at a cost.  This simply makes no sense.  If the ESM is to be based in whole or in part on contributions from member states, programme countries must be exempt from making contributions.  That was the case for the EFSF; therefore, it should be the case for the ESM also.The scale of the liabilities for the State and the taxpayer under the current proposals is a source of serious concern.  The treaty indicates a potential liability of €11 billion, which figure could be much higher.  Given the scale of the eurozone banking crisis, this is tantamount to writing a blank cheque on a scale never seen before.  There are also problems with the lack of accountability once the fund is established, as well as with the immunity given to the fund and its board members.  An emergency fund of this size must function in an open, transparent and democratically accountable way.  Amendments to the treaty must be secured to ensure adequate scrutiny and accountability at the level of the European Parliament and the parliaments of member states.  The immunity given to the ESM and its board members must be removed.  Nobody should be above the law, especially political leaders making decisions on a fund worth €700 billion.I repeat Sinn Fein's firm view that Ireland and the eurozone as a whole need an emergency funding mechanism, not only because the Government will need to access it in 2014 but also because such a fund is vital to stabilise the euro.  There is no point, however, in agreeing to a fund that is not fit for purpose, will not achieve its stated objectives and will, in all likelihood, make matters worse.  The ESM treaty the Government is seeking to ratify through the ESM Bill was negotiated and concluded in 2011.  We have to ask ourselves what the Government was doing during these negotiations.  Why did it agree to such a poorly designed fund and why in the 12 months that followed did it not seek to make constructive amendments?  Fortunately for Ireland and the eurozone, there is still a window of opportunity to amend the ESM treaty and improve the fund.  Other member states are actively seeking changes which could well be made at the forthcoming European Council summit at the end of June.  The Governments of Spain and France are standing up for their citizens and working to get a better deal.  They are arguing, as are Sinn Féin, that further changes to the treaty are required for it to be of assistance in the current crisis.Next week, when the Bill is debated on Committee Stage, I will, on behalf of Sinn Féin, table a number of amendments to the Bill.  They will call on the Government not to lodge the instruments of ratification for either the ESM treaty or the amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union until a number of specific changes to the ESM treaty are secured.  Sinn Fein believes five key changes are required for the ESM to do what it is being set up to do.  First, there should be an explicit option to use ESM funds to invest in job creation and growth measures as part of a credible deficit reduction strategy, rather than maintaining the current focus on austerity.  Second, there should be an option for direct ECB funding of the ESM to provide the necessary firewall to stabilise the euro, while limiting the liability to taxpayers and individual member states.  Third, there must be a clause ensuring programme countries are not required to contribute to the fund, as is the case with the EFSF.  Fourth, there needs to be a requirement to carry out strict stress tests and provide for a write-down of toxic debt as a precondition for ESM funds being used to recapitalise banks, whether directly or indirectly via loans to governments.  Fifth, there is a need for greater accountability at EU and member state level and the removal of the immunity granted to the fund and its board members.In the coming weeks the Government will have a real opportunity to work with our European partners to design an emergency funding mechanism that will help countries to regain access to the sovereign bond markets.  This fund will play a meaningful role in defending vulnerable member states from speculative attacks by the markets and assist in creating jobs and promoting economic growth and social regeneration.  Such a fund is urgently needed.  However, Sinn Fein do not believe the ESM, as it stands, can achieve these objectives.  Unless the ESM treaty is amended, Sinn Féin will not be in a position to support the Bill.  More important, unless the dtreaty is amended, it will simply not work.There is still time to improve the fund proposed.  The question is whether Fine Gael and the Labour Party have the political courage and the political will to seek the necessary changes, as well as the political ability and skill to secure them.  During the last 15 months the Government has demonstrated a remarkable inability to stand up for the interests of Irish citizens at the European Council.  Its strategy appears to be one of sitting quietly and passively and waiting to reap the benefits of the hard work done by other governments.  It is time for this approach to end.  We will never know what can be achieved unless the Government starts making demands that are in the interests of citizens.  It is time it became an active participant in European Council negotiations.  It is time for Fine Gael and the Labour Party to make demands on behalf of the people, actively participate in the negotiations and come back to the Dáil with something better for Ireland and Europe as whole.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	110	With the agreement of the House, I will share time with Deputies Joan Collins and Joe Higgins.It is an absolute disgrace that the Government has imposed a guillotine on the debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012.  It is particularly disgraceful when the Government has, effectively, admitted that we are heading towards a second so-called bailout when we emerge from the current EU-IMF programme.  The reason for the use of the guillotine is that the Government knows that a serious public discussion on the ESM would reveal that it is not, as it claims, some sort of insurance policy, a line of credit or bailout for ordinary citizens but a sinister Trojan horse being driven into the heart of Europe to impose more poisonous austerity on ordinary citizens and further dismantle democracy within the European Union.  It is a permanent austerity mechanism, not a stability mechanism.  The treaty makes this very clear.  Assistance is strictly conditional on the ESM dictating further austerity measures to be imposed on ordinary citizens taking responsibility for the gambling debts of bankers and speculators.  Angela Merkel made this absolutely clear in recent days.  Calls for direct recapitalisation of casino banks in Spain are being dismissed out of hand by Chancellor Merkel who is making it clear that recapitalisation must occur through the sovereign.  In other words, she is demanding that ordinary citizens, working people, the least well-off and the vulnerable, in Ireland and across Europe take responsibility for the gambling debts of bankers and agree to sign up to crippling austerity measures to pay off these gambling debts.  An economiccoup d’état has been achieved by the European authorities, taking advantage of the atmosphere of crisis in order to permanently unload the massive gambling debts incurred, the scale of which we still do not know or understand, onto the backs of ordinary working people across Europe and tie them into a straitjacket of austerity to pay off these debts.  It is truly extraordinary.The provisions of the Bill are alarming.  First, the Government consistently fails to acknowledge that this so-called insurance policy which is, in fact, a straitjacket of austerity to be imposed on ordinary people could cost us up to €11 billion, a figure which could be even higher.  The board of governors of the ESM will have the right to raise the limit to unknown levels in order to bail out European banks.  Is it not bad enough that the people of Ireland have been crippled with austerity to bail out the Irish casino banks?  We are now signing up to contribute, possibly, €11 billion or more to bail out the casino banks in the rest of Europe.  If that is not bad enough, there will be no legal or political accountability for this Trojan horse in the centre of Europe.  One could not make this up.  It is like something from a James Bond movie.  The board of governors, staff and the institution of the ESM will be immune from prosecution.  When one considers that what we will set up is one of the most powerful institutions in Europe, which will have major power over governments and the citizens of countries across Europe, the notion that it would be immune from any kind of legal prosecution is simply extraordinary.  It is intended that the documents and archives of the ESM will be inviolable so that if this monster which is being created to impose austerity and protect the European banks should ever require investigation that is ruled out in advance.  We will never know how decisions are arrived at, what decisions are being made and what is going on inside this enormously powerful institution.  Legal protections are being set up and we are being asked to sign up to make the ESM immune from any oversight, investigation or legal prosecution.  It is absolutely disgusting.  It is part of the ongoing dismantling of democracy across Europe that we have seen in the course of this economic crisis where democratically elected leaders are deposed to put in technocrats and bankers to run countries.  Now, having done that in a couple of countries we want to set up an institution that is above the law but will have enormous economic power to dictate the fate of millions of people across Europe.  That is shocking in the extreme.What makes this all the more pathetic is that the Government is trying to push the Bill through this week without proper discussion, to ensure the public does not know what the ESM really is and what its real consequences will be, after it has been yet again humiliated by Angela Merkel.  No matter how much the Government pulls the best boy in the class routine to do anything Angela Merkel and the ECB demands, she slaps the Government in the face every time, making it absolutely clear that there will be no deal on banking debt for this country, no write-down of the banking debt - if the Government has even asked for that - but in any event she has pre-empted the Government's possible request for such a write-down because she has made it clear that we are not getting it.  No matter how much the Government cuddles up to Angela Merkel, no matter how much it is the swot of the austerity class in Europe she humiliates the Government and slaps it in the face every time yet still it pursues this policy of submitting slavishly to her agenda.  It is incredible.In doing so, the Government is also stabbing in the back the movement that is developing in Europe to challenge Merkel's agenda.  Other countries and governments in Europe are beginning to show some backbone and to stand up to Merkel.  For example the Spanish Government has said it is not willing to submit slavishly to Merkel's agenda.  I hope a Greek Government may emerge soon that is unwilling to swallow any more of the austerity poison and will stand up to her.  The people in France elected a government in the hope at least that it will stand up to Merkel and demand an end to the austerity madness and focus on prioritising the need for employment and economic growth.  Against that background, instead of joining with the movement, delaying the ratification of the treaty and demanding the write-down of the gambling debt of banks being imposed on ordinary people the Government is rushing the legislation through as fast as it possibly can to prove what good boys and girls they are to Angela Merkel.  That is undermining the movement that is challenging her in Europe.  It is no accident that Merkel and many of the more conservative German newspapers were jumping for joy at the passing of the fiscal treaty but no reward was given to Ireland for that in terms of a write-down of debt.  In spite of that the Government still carries on with this ridiculous, pathetic, humiliating stance it is taking of doing anything that Angela Merkel asks it no matter what the consequences are for Europe or the citizens of this country.  It is pathetic in the extreme.We will most certainly oppose the ESM.  I appeal to the Government to wake up and recognise that no matter how much it sucks up to Angela Merkel, the ECB and the merchants of austerity, they are not listening, they are not willing to give a break to ordinary people and what must be done is to resist that agenda and resist a piece of legislation that is about permanently institutionalising the same austerity and the same dictatorial control of financial institutions and technocrats in Europe over the people of this country and the citizens of Europe.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	111	If the Government believes it got a resounding endorsement of its policies and approach of austerity to the crisis in the recent referendum, it did not.  I represent one of the five constituencies which had a majority "No" vote, Dublin South-Central.  It is no coincidence that five of the poorest and most working class constituencies voted "No".  The reality is that those sections of the population who have felt the effects of austerity most voted "No".  In some areas in my constituency the "No" vote was between 70% and 80%.  The "Yes" vote will change nothing in the terms of the deal and the bank debt and re-entry to bond market funding.  It is just another pat on the head for the Taoiseach and a brutal "Nein" from Germany in terms of any deal on the bank debt.The Government is now in a trap of its own making.  It claims that austerity and four years of a bailout programme are working but it is now being used by the IMF, the ECB and others to say that we must continue with the programme.  If the Government were to change now it would be seen as an admission of the failure of its policies.  We cannot put our future into an unaccountable, bureaucratic, unknown ESM entity.  We are told that we are not like Greece yet we saw last night the dreadful scene of 1,400 people who queue daily for food parcels at the Capuchin centre in Dublin.  That is the level many people have been forced down to at the moment, to queue publicly in the streets to try to get some food for their households on a daily basis.Despite high levels of mass emigration, 30% of people are jobless.  I wish to read into the record the figures that emerged today.  The latest unemployment figures reveal that unemployment in this country now stands at 14.8% with 309,000 out of work.  The Central Statistics Office found that employment fell by 1% or 18,100 since the same time last year while there has been an increase of 0.3% in the number out of work since the last quarter of 2011.  Employment fell by 7,300 between January and March of this year after an increase of 11,100 in the last three months of last year.  The number of long-term unemployed, which is even more startling, has risen from 7.8% to 8.9% in the past year.  Among the 309,000 out of work the number of men unemployed increased over the year by 1.8% and, startlingly, female unemployment rose by 10.4% to 103,600.  That is despite the paltry efforts of the Government to introduce JobBridge and create one job here and eight jobs there that were announced with great triumph in the media in the past few weeks of the campaign on the ESM treaty.This is a reality check.  The economy is not growing.  We are still facing a massive mortgage debt crisis with more than 78,000 mortgage holders in arrears for more than 90 days.  We have had talk but no action from the Government on the matter.  In the debate on Private Members' business we made the point that property is sacrosanct in the Constitution.That any challenge to property must be constitutionally tested represents a quagmire for the Government.  This is not what people facing the pyrite situation, negative equity, job losses or wage cuts want to hear.A reality check in the eurozone is necessary.  It has been four years since the beginning of the crisis and we are nowhere near even a hint of a solution.  It looks like another fund is being concocted for the Spanish crisis.  With light conditions attaching, Spain will be allowed to access the EU's bailout funds to recapitalise Bankia.  The can is being kicked down the road yet again.  There is no prospect of the deal benefiting Ireland's bank debt.I hope the Greek people bring matters to a head in their 17 June elections and that they vote in an anti-austerity majority.  The austerity policy, the lack of action in respect of banks and the refusal to mutualise sovereign debt are sustaining the threat of a European depression pulling the world economy down.  This is the serious situation we will face.It is clear that no solution is forthcoming from the European business and political elites.  People must take matters into their own hands.  Revolt is spreading.  There is revolt in Greece, where people are standing up and telling politicians they will not break the social contract made to the public following the Second World War.  There is revolt in Spain, where lands are being occupied in response to mortgage debts and evictions.  There is revolt in France, where there has been a rejection of Sarkozy's liberal policies.  Revolt is developing in Holland.  Only two weeks ago in the financial centre and on the streets of Frankfurt, 20,000 Germans came out against austerity.As a European nation, we must begin deciding on what type of Europe we want.  Given the rise of fascism throughout Europe in the 1930s as well as the depression, Leon Trotsky proposed the idea of a socialist united states of Europe, one that was based on solidarity and co-operation between its people and that used its wealth and resources for the benefit of all, not just the financial industrial elite who are today disgracefully bleeding Europeans dry to maintain their profits and elitism.  This idea expresses the hopes and aspirations of millions of Europeans and is the only basis for a solution to the crisis.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 is entitled a Bill to facilitate in the public interest the establishment of a so-called stability mechanism.  This is a false claim.  The European Stability Mechanism, ESM, is not being set up in the public interest, that is, the interest of the majority of ordinary citizens in the EU's member states.  Rather, it is being set up primarily in the interests of the sharks who dominate the financial markets throughout the EU, the major investment banks, the hedge fund operators and the assorted speculators who operate within the financial markets.  This fund is to underwrite their speculative loans on the backs of European taxpayers.  The players in the financial markets - the speculators - gain from the fund's establishment in every way.  Their loans, many of which they provided speculatively, are to be guaranteed by taxpayers, yet the funds that may be used to bail them out in the event of difficulties will be borrowed from the same markets, with governments guaranteeing those funds on the backs of taxpayers who will be bled to meet repayments.In reflecting on this situation, all I could think of was the great song made well-known by Christy Moore, entitled "Ordinary Man".  In the words of a worker referring to the boss who let him go, "the captains of industry won't let him lose ... he'll never lose" and "Well it seems to me to be such a cruel irony, he's richer now than he ever was before".  This is exactly the case in that the hedge fund operators and major banks whose speculation and wild gambling in property markets and other ventures around the globe brought the world to the financial ruin that emerged three or four years ago are all now back at the same activity - speculating, profiteering and paying massive bonuses to their top echelons.In no sense is the ESM a solidarity fund.  It is a fund to underwrite the casino capitalist activities of the banks and bondholders, the same casino capitalism that created the economic and financial crisis from which many ordinary people across Europe are grievously suffering.  It is the same system, driven by lust for super profits, that drove speculation in the US and Europe, was facilitated by the rating agencies, which set themselves up as arbiters of best practice in the financial affairs of nation states, and was legislated for by governments across the world.  The ESM is designed by the markets for themselves and their interests.The largest party in the European Parliament is the European People's Party, EPP, of which Fine Gael is a component and of which Chancellor Merkel of Germany is a prominent member.  Europe's major political parties act as agents for the big players in the financial markets.  This has been clear for the past four years.  The troika, which represents the combined forces of the EU, the European Central Bank, ECB, and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, also acts as an agent.  When the troika arrived in this country in November 2010, it did not do so with the interests of the Irish people at heart.  Rather, it did so to salvage the EU's financial institutions and to save them from the consequences of the reckless gambling and speculation in which they indulged during the Irish property boom.  Despite all of that, a Fine Gael-Labour Government, supported by Fianna Fáil, is backing the setting up of a fund that will only play the role of a bailout mechanism for the major players in the financial markets.Ireland and Europe need a solidarity fund for the benefit of the ordinary people, the working class people and the poor.  Across the EU, a shameful number of people, some 25 million, are unemployed.  In the eurozone itself, approximately 17 million people are unemployed.  Youth unemployment in countries like Spain is at crisis level of more than 50%.  At the same time, across Europe and the eurozone, big business and the major banks refuse to invest, to bring together and make available the productive forces that could have the unemployed back to work, creating wealth, goods and services and generating taxes to protect and develop public services.In March,The Wall Street Journal carried an article that makes illuminating reading.  It pointed out that the ratio of investment to gross domestic product in Europe is now at a 60 year low while, at the same time, major corporations in the eurozone are hoarding but not investing record amounts of profits to the tune of €2 trillion.  In the United Kingdom, they are sitting on £750 billion.  Last autumn the European Central Bank, ECB, made €1 trillion available to European banks at miniscule interest rates.  Did the banks lend these funds to society, small enterprises, the self-employed, etc, to underwrite the creation of millions of jobs?  No, they either lodged it back with the ECB or bought up sovereign bonds.  In other words, they put it into the safest option possible to make a profit with no downstream benefit for the majority in society.Austerity is killing the domestic economics across Europe while at the same time big business-----

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I am being short-changed here.Austerity is killing the domestic economies across Europe while, at the same time, big business is on an investment strike.  We need a solidarity fund and we need it urgently.  I propose an emergency tax of 50% on that mass of uninvested profits which were created by the labour of working people by hand and by brain.  That would make trillions of euro available for a major job creation fund.  Such funds should be put into major infrastructural projects in EU member states and public works projects creating necessary and useful infrastructure and services that would create millions of jobs.  This would, in turn, regenerate and remake the broke economies of the so-called peripheral states but also generally across the European Union.The European Stability Mechanism, ESM, will not be used in any sense for this purpose or to resolve the acute economic problems of Europe.  It will be used simply to preserve the same rotten system that created the crisis while potentially demanding €11 billion from the Irish people and €700 billion from taxpayers across Europe.  In a recent headline, the BritishThe Independent stated, “Capitalism at a crossroads” referring to the major global economic crisis.  We see the suffering it has brought about in many countries to millions of workers.  These millions of workers and ordinary people are rising up against the fruits of that system and the austerity it is imposing.  Workers and ordinary people in Ireland should join this to reject this austerity and the ESM bailout of financial markets.  Instead, financial institutions should be in public ownership and under democratic control.  There should be a socialist economy where resources are used for the benefit of society not for the greed of the same suspects who landed us in this incredible fiasco that society faces.

We know its passing is a positive step forward for Ireland, ensuring the country can get back on track and remains at the heart of Europe.  Despite some deceptive campaigning by the "No" side during the campaign, I am glad the treaty was voted through.  In Dublin North-East, there was a positive response of 58% of the electorate who voted in favour of the treaty.The European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 is interlinked with the stability treaty.  During the referendum campaign, constituents highlighted to me how the ESM is crucial to Ireland and is important to getting on the path to recovery.  How else will we get funding in the case of an emergency bailout?  The ESM will promote confidence in the eurozone.  The positive referendum result last week is good for Ireland's debt ratings and return to the bond markets.  It removes any uncertainty about Ireland's capacity to access funding, if the need arises, from the ESM.Following the debt crisis that resulted in the bailout of some EU member states, there have been efforts to bring about reforms to prevent such crises happening again in the eurozone.  Ireland has experienced a bad crisis in the past three years.  However, we are now steadily emerging from it and the safety net of the ESM is crucial to ensure we do not find ourselves in a vulnerable position again in the future.  Greece, Spain and Portugal are experiencing significant problems too and action is needed to deal with them.There have been many job announcements in Ireland in recent weeks.  I was delighted to join the Taoiseach last month for the announcement of almost 300 jobs at Mylan, a multinational based in my constituency.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, on the good work he is doing in this area.  Every week, international companies continue to invest in Ireland because they believe it has a future.  Amazon, Apple, home companies such as Dawn Meats and Rehab are putting money back into the economy which shows confidence in the country.  Last week's "Yes" vote will improve this.The ESM will safeguard the stability of the eurozone, provide an opportunity for non-eurozone countries to contribute to it and provide for funding to be made available to them if the necessity arises.  The fund is expected to come into operation next month and will have a lending capacity of €500 billion.  Ireland's contribution to the fund will be an upfront sum of €1.27 billion over the next three years.  This is a small price to pay to ensure certainty and stability in our economy.  The people do not want any more setbacks in trying to get the economy back on track.Concerns have been expressed about the level of capital, €9.9 billion, that Ireland must guarantee.  However, that would arise if countries were in massive default, and we hope that will not happen.I am delighted the stability treaty referendum was passed last week, as it provides certainty and confidence that Ireland is willing and able to continue funding itself.  The European Stability Mechanism, ESM, fund is available to us as a plan B, which could be very important for Ireland in the coming years.  We all want to see the country emerging from crisis as soon as possible in order to provide hope and opportunity for our young people in particular.  The ESM will certainly help us along that path.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	119	In the early stages of the economic crisis that is affecting almost every nation in Europe and across the world, the EU was criticised for not acting fast enough, and when it did, it was criticised for not tackling the problems effectively.  It is now strange to see Europe being criticised by some for putting forward proposals to help tackle the instability afflicting our economies; it seems that no matter what the EU does, it will never be good enough or acceptable to some.Last week the Irish people accepted the stability treaty, and by doing so they guaranteed Irish access to the European Stability Mechanism if and when it is required.  The legislation before the House today gives effect to this democratic decision.  Even now, there are Deputies and others who did not support the stability treaty and who are complaining that the treaty has not solved our problems or made a difference.  As with all problems, there is no quick fix or a cure-all solution.  The stability treaty was never presented as such, and instead it was presented by the Government - honestly and openly - as part of a long-term solution.As a result of the speed and nature of the financial crisis, the EU and its member states created a short-term solution in the European financial stability facility, EFSF, which was backed by the eurozone countries, as well as Poland and Sweden.  It has become clear, however, that a more permanent approach is needed.  The ESM, along with the six pack of directives and regulations, forms part of this approach.Of all the member states in the EU, the establishment of the ESM is of particular importance to us in Ireland, as well as Greece and Portugal.  We must recognise that the current gap between national income and spending is filled in no small part by the current EFSF arrangements.  We must also recognise that the finance for the EFSF is being provided by other EU nations, including Germany.  This support is enabling us to address our deficit, which is only partially due to the banking sector, over a large timeframe, thus affording us time and space that we would not otherwise have.The importance of growth must also be emphasised, as it has been rightly earmarked as an essential component of any approach to tackling the problems before us.  Growth goes hand in hand with stability, and if there is no stability, there can be no growth.  A clear result of stability, which this Government has promoted with its policies, is investment.  Without stability, the investment which has resulted in over 1,200 jobs in my constituency of Galway West alone over the past year would not have been made.  I have listened to other public representatives, economists, academics and journalists, and it is clear that a cohort of people exists that would like nothing more than the euro - if the not the EU itself - to collapse.  It saddens and concerns me that people would actively welcome the trauma and strife that a currency collapse would bring.The euro is our currency and that of the Germans, French, Italians and many others.  We have a duty to effect measures to protect and safeguard that collective currency.  The ownership we take of our currency must also be matched in our ownership of the solutions required to safeguard it.  The effectiveness of the European Stability Mechanism will depend on the support it receives from member states.  It is entirely appropriate that Ireland, along with other eurozone countries, makes its contribution to ensure a functioning and feasible safety net.  We will contribute 1.6% of the total €700 billion fund, and for that we will be able to rely on a permanent stability mechanism.I hope the ESM funds will not be needed by any EU member state but its existence will help provide the assurance and confidence required for investment, and in turn, for job creation.  By introducing and passing this European Stability Mechanism Bill today, Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil will not only be respecting the democratic wishes of the Irish people but acting responsibly and practically for the good of our country, currency and the European Union.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 outlines the legislation that underpins the ratification of the ESM, which will replace the European financial stability mechanism.  This will mean there will be a permanent rescue fund for the euro area to replace temporary support mechanisms.  The principal stated provision of the ESM is to provide stability and support, which is what this country and the eurozone so badly needs.The ESM will be initially equipped with €80 billion in cash, and it will also have the provision to call upon another €620 billion in an emergency.  This will enable it to lend €500 billion and still maintain a buffer to garner the AAA credit rating it needs when it is set up next month.  The ESM is the centrepiece of Europe's firewall to stave off financial contagion from the debt crisis that has wreaked havoc on the markets and pushed Greece, Portugal and our country into a bailout position.  When the Bill was published in May, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated that having the ability to access the ESM is essential to Ireland's return to the markets and serves as a backstop, or in the worst case scenario, ESM funds will be available to provide essential public service finances.  This will result in monetary certainty while keeping the other instruments of economic policies in national hands.  The effect of a division of authority was to create a heightened level of fragility in national member states.  Investor concerns about national member states' abilities to repay debts can quickly transform into a liquidity crisis and ultimately degenerate into a fully blown insolvency crisis.  The ESM will break this cycle.The official strategy for resolving the eurozone's debt crisis originally developed in the wake of the Greek crisis in May 2010, and it comprises four key elements.  There is the creation of new fiscal oversight and supervisory mechanisms, the formulation of new mechanisms to fund loan facilities, or the ESM, the extension of loan facilities to member states experiencing difficulties accessing the bond markets and the conditionality of policies on those member states in return for receipt of that loan funding.  The ESM comes with strict conditions and requirements attached to the assistance.  Much of the requisite framework of oversight and supervisory mechanisms have been installed during the past year.  The criteria used are intended to limit moral hazard and to ensure the existence of the ESM do not weaken incentives for sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies in member states.  Together with best practices in government procedures and a cap set for Ireland at €11.1 billion for capital, all such measures go towards protecting Ireland's maximum exposure to the ESM.There have been critics of the conditions, such as extending the ESM's extensive powers; some have said it will be completely above the law.  Currently, the IMF, which the ESM will largely mirror in many aspects of operation, has similar privileges and immunities.  In recent days Mr. Draghi of the European Central Bank has indicated that the outcome of the Irish referendum showed that the Irish people believe that fiscal stability is a basic pillar for growth.  Last week's referendum result will certainly go towards speeding up Ireland's return to the financial markets and give us the same benefits as other signatories to the treaty.  However, in the current absence of market-based financing, our ability to access the ESM is essential.  It is in all our interests that the European Stability Mechanism is established as soon as possible to enable the eurozone sovereign debt crisis to be dealt with through the creation of a permanent mechanism.  Today's Bill is a crucial step towards stabilising the crisis.In recent weeks Sinn Féin has decried the ESM, arguing that it brings about a loss of Irish sovereignty, but the party has missed the point.  Regaining financial stability will mean that when we move closer to the day to day concerns of reeling in our nation, there is no silver bullet solution to the crisis.  This financial backstop will nonetheless bolster growth and competitiveness.  It supports the Government and members of the Opposition in their drive to press ahead with economic reform and recovery for our country and people.
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I am delighted to welcome this legislation, which will put the European Stability Mechanism in place.  It is extremely progressive and I salute our Minister for Finance for introducing it.  He also avoided having to pay the €3.1 billion promissory note that would have had extraordinary implications for the country which would have involved the removal of real services for people.  Those two achievements are the backdrop to today.Last week, in passing the treaty, the people acted wisely and prudently and should be congratulated for that.  The passing of that treaty was a prerequisite to accessing the ESM.  The European Stability Mechanism will establish a fund of initially €80 billion but potentially €700 billion that will be available to member states as a backstop when funding is needed in an emergency, albeit with conditions.  It will also provide a safety net for us as we go into the bond markets to borrow.  Those are the practical implications for the country but the greater practical implications for Europe are that it is part of the process of recovery and stabilisation of the euro and European finances, restoring confidence internationally in the euro and stability in the market place.  That is a crucial element.This is another stage in the rectification of the difficulties within the euro.  Obviously this will involve introducing prudent financial management, as the terms of the treaty dictate, at national level.  That will assist in gaining international credibility and involves conditionality for any available funding.  Naturally that will encompass achieving proper regulation in the financial area.  This is an extra dimension that is equally important.  No one disputes the contention by those opposing this today that we need regulation and control of the financial market and banking sector.  That is implicit.This creates the conditions that will allow us to move on to the next stage that is parallel with prudent financial management, namely,  investment and stimulus.  There must be a job stimulus package within Europe, within the eurozone and, specifically, in Ireland.  There is no doubt we must tackle the issue of youth unemployment, which is a problem throughout Europe.  I will say to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy Perry, who is doing extraordinary work in this area, that it is vital that we put in place a jobs stimulus package to address youth unemployment and that we get investment in necessary infrastructure, thereby creating jobs.  Implicit in the prudent vote of the Irish people is a belief this should happen now.That must be done in parallel with the addressing of the personal debt crisis.  If we can bring that to manageable proportions and create structures that will create confidence, it will increase consumer demand and get the economy to move in a more normal way again.The European Stability Mechanism is a critical tool in stabilising the euro internationally, the eurozone countries and in providing a backstop.  It creates the conditions whereby the jobs stimulus package can be put in place across Europe.  The two are in no way mutually exclusive, the contrary is the case, the two work together.  The question of personal debt can be also tackled now.This is another stage in dealing with the crisis.  It is by no means the end of the road but it is a critical stageen route to a solution.  It must be done in parallel with spending policies that will result in job creation and consumer demand.  It is unquestionably the case that austerity cannot work on its own and that the two must be done in tandem.  It is also unquestionably the case that those from the Technical Group who oppose this Bill have not posited an alternative to the ESM.  What they say is beautiful rhetoric with a great populist quality but the truth is that they have not come up with any alternative.It is good that we are progressing this legislation quickly and I am glad to support it.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill.  It is the second part of a two part process and we had the opportunity yesterday to deal with some of the technical aspects of the underpinning and enactment of the legislation as part of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Today is an opportunity to concentrate on the provisions in the legislation that establishes the ESM and how we might examine the impact of its development and capacity to play a major role in dealing with the economic crisis that has bedevilled Europe for the past three and a half years.There is little doubt the establishment and creation of the ESM was a fundamental reason for the people to give such a resounding positive vote for the fiscal treaty.  It was right and appropriate that the treaty that set out the necessity for the delivery of discipline in the way we manage our budgetary process was juxtaposed against the question that if we were prepared to take the pain to recalibrate the Irish economy from a debt and deficit perspective, at the same time we will receive the support of our partners in Europe to assist in the event of our not attaining the growth levels that will be such a fundamental part of our economic recovery.  It was right the two were put together.  As others have pointed out, the "No" side wanted to separate the two; they wanted the ESM to be set up without being prepared to take the necessary medicine in the recalibration of our economy to meet the needs of a much changed world economy.It is an important insurance policy and a vital tool to deal with the crisis but we must be careful.  The current model seeks to address the crisis that has evolved to date but I am not sure the ESM as it is currently proposed looks far enough ahead to the potential pitfalls and crises that still lie ahead.  That is one of my criticisms generally of the way Europe has responded to the economic crisis.  We tend to arrive late with the solution to the problem as we envisage it at any particular time, not realising that in many cases, by the time we put in place a solution, the problem has shifted and expanded to a greater extent.That applies to an Irish perspective.  At the time, the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, would say, as he said in an interview with the BBC, that he was bounced into a bailout to protect the euro, recognising that Ireland was well funded for the foreseeable future and did not have an immediate requirement to go to the markets.  Notwithstanding that, in an effort to show solidarity with our European partners, he put in place a programme to prevent the contagion that was rapidly emerging.  Regardless of what Ireland did at the time, the contagion has continued to this day.  Spain is in a similar position, although it presents a greater problem to the eurozone and Europe generally.  Notwithstanding that, the solution, which was to put Ireland into a programme for a number of years, did not manage to contain the crisis and not everything is being done now to address where the problem will emerge next.  We are fighting a rearguard action rather than being progressive, taking a leap of faith and putting in place the necessary solutions and mechanism to deal with the scale of the problem.I refer to whether the ESM facility will have adequate capacity to deal with the needs that have the potential to be placed on it.  How often have we heard the phrase, "The euro is back from the brink", only to find ourselves back at the same crisis point?  That happens almost on a daily basis.  This highlights that the Union and eurozone are operating with a flawed infrastructure.  In designing the ESM as a permanent rescue mechanism, there is an opportunity once and for all to deal with the design flaws in the euro that have become evident during the crisis.  Yesterday's comments by Mario Draghi where he set out his views to investors not to underestimate the resolve of EU authorities to defend the single currency were welcome.  The currency has increased in value since his statements and markets have stabilised.  My concern is this will be short-lived.  Market sentiment is based on the latest rumour circulating.  These fine words and strong commitments are not enough in themselves to address the crisis adequately.To stabilise Spain and Italy, the eurozone should make it clear it will do whatever it takes to quell the self-fulfilling debt crisis and, therefore, consideration needs to be given to whether the proposed availability of €500 billion in lending capacity to the eurozone will be sufficient.  I am not sure it will be adequate to take on the additional responsibilities the ESM might be tasked with if the situation in Spain or Italy becomes serious.  The intention is that the fund will be able to raise €700 billion on the basis of initial seed capital of €80 billion while retaining €200 billion to secure its triple A rating.  That is welcome but if pressure is applied I wonder if the ESM will have the capacity to deal with it.  What eventualities could the ESM be called on to fund?  Will it only be in place to aid Greece, Ireland and Portugal or should consideration be given to it undertaking the massive bond purchases that would be required to stabilise the market should Spain or Italy need funds for their banks, which is the focus of consideration in Spain currently or to meet their day to day requirements?  These issues need to be addressed.The ESM should be granted a banking licence and the right to borrow directly from the ECB.  This could supplement its normal bond purchasing activities.  Suggestions have been elsewhere that if the size of the fund was increased to €2 trillion, it would have the firepower it needs to deal with what might be considered to be a worst case scenario of Spain and Italy being shut out of the sovereign bond markets.  I recall the US Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, referring to this last year.  Europe listened to him in the past when the then Government sought to address the banking crisis here by issuing haircuts to senior bondholders.  He expressed a view at the time, which became the prevailing view across Europe.  I would welcome it if some of our Union partners were as quick to accept his views when they might have a positive impact on the Union generally.If the ESM can be strengthened to meet most eventualities, it will only be required as a backstop or insurance policy.  That would provide the security the markets need.  In the event of a crisis, they will not be left without, which is the current position, and that is why bond spreads are where they are.  If Mr. Draghi believes that the Union will do whatever it takes to defend the currency, then the ESM, as the centrepiece of the strategy in that regard, needs to be fit for purpose.  I recall him saying over the past number of days that this is an issue for eurozone leaders and politicians to take charge and control of and not one for him, the ECB or its governors.  Reference is often made during these debates to the democratic deficit.  Much noise was made during the recent referendum campaign about the Government ceding responsibility to unelected bureaucrats.  This represents an opportunity to take back the mantle of governance.  It is an opportunity for political leaders across Europe to clearly give direction to the mandarins.  Mr. Draghi is crying out for that.I call on the Minister of State to have a direct conversation with the Taoiseach.  Over the past few days, we found it difficult to extract from him what position he has put to Chancellor Merkel and what her response has been.  I accept that in a negotiation, one does not need or want to make public what one is looking for.  However, in this instance, the people deserve to know what the Government is seeking in negotiations.  By doing so, it would show respect to them on the basis that the Government sought their support to allow it and the Parliament, by extension, to negotiate on their behalf with our European leaders.  It is a fair trade off to have a more open and frank conversation with the people to let them know what the Government is trading.  This is not a game of poker.  The other 26 member states clearly know Ireland's position.  Why not let the people know what the Government is seeking?

I may sound repetitive because I expressed some of my views on the ESM last night during the debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill.  However, while those comments were worth making last night, they are equally worth repeating in this debate.  I welcome without equivocation the result of the referendum last week when the people put their faith in the institutions of Europe to deal with a serious crisis domestically and in Europe and to deal with the challenges in the global economy.  There is a great deal of confusion about the messages emanating from the Government.  Prior to the referendum campaign, it was stated clearly that the treaty was separate from the resolution of the bank debt issue but they became inextricably linked during the campaign.  I am a little confused and if that is the case, I am sure many others are equally unsure of the Government message about what it is trying to do about the issue of private bank debt being saddled on the people.Reference has been made many times to the decision on the bank guarantee and how the previous Government dealt with the banks.  Clearly, at the time there was huge pressure on because Ireland stood alone in that no mechanism was available to assist a state with difficulties not only with its budget deficit but also with its banking system.  The Union, together with the ECB and the political leaders of the major member states, have accepted there is a need to establish a fund, the ESM, to deal with the difficulties in Europe's banks and the pressures on the currency.  However, Ireland stood alone and made huge efforts to ensure there would not be contagion.  The previous Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, told me that they were brow beaten and intimidated by the ECB to accept a bailout.  This remains the case.  There has been no major change in policy by the ECB or the European Commission.  As I stated during last night's debate, the Commission has reneged on and failed in its fundamental duty, which is to uphold the treaties that established the Union.  It has failed on a continual basis to protect smaller member states.  It has been castrated as an organisation and it is ineffectual.  It is left to the leaders of the larger member states to set the agenda, which is unacceptable.  We have reached a situation where the European Commission is essentially a passive observer, with the Germans now running the show in terms of policy.  The European Union institutions were established to protect small nations, with the Commission acting as guarantor of the treaties.  However, it seems to have absolved itself wholly of responsibility in this regard.  The Minister should not be alone in making the case for Ireland; that is also the role of the Commission on behalf of all weaker member states.Spain is facing enormous difficulties, with an ongoing trawl of its banks and an assessment of the difficulties in that regard.  Nobody knows the full extent of the problems that may emerge in the Spanish banks.  However, we cannot operate on the basis that Spain's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity - that cannot be the basis of our appeals to our European colleagues.  Ireland's case stands alone, regardless of the outcome of the Spanish banking review and the assessment of its broader economy.  The bottom line is that Irish people are saddled with too much private banking debt, with €62 billion of taxpayers' money having already been put into the banking system.  The exorbitant interest rates imposed on the State were only belatedly and even reluctantly reduced.  The Government will take credit for that reduction, but we all know the impetus in that instance was the situation in Portugal at the time.  Whatever the reason for the change, it did alleviate certain budgetary difficulties, but the reality remains that the exorbitant debt that has been imposed on the people is immoral, unfair and unsustainable.  The Minister knows this as well as I do.  Nor is there any point in us continually applauding the European Union and the European Central Bank for establishing the European Stability Mechanism.  The fund should have been set up much sooner.  The ECB has been charged with ensuring there is stability in the eurozone and addressing the issue of inflation, but it has never seemed to take on board what should be its broader remit of protecting the euro, rather than always being concerned solely with inflation in the German economy.There are several issues that must be included in the political agenda for this month's Council summit and beyond.  First and foremost, Ireland must make a case, regardless of the outcome of the review of the Spanish banking system, that there is simply too much private debt saddled on the people and that there is an obligation and a duty on others to take their fair share of the burden.  Action in this regard was promised by the Government parties prior to the general election.  The Minister did not make such promises, but many of his colleagues did with wild abandon throughout the State.  There was talk of not one cent more being paid over and, from the Tánaiste, an invitation to choose Labour's way or Frankfurt's way.  The reality is that the Government did not need a referendum on the establishment of the ESM in order to secure a mandate to seek a resolution of the bank debt burden.  It received that mandate from the people last year, but progress has been slow and reluctant and there has been a notable lack of diplomatic activity in advocating on the issue.As I said, we obtained a small interest rate reduction when the crisis arose in Portugal which, irrespective of the reasons it was granted, was a positive development which alleviated, in a very small measure, the burden on the people.  We then had the crisis in Greece, followed by the crisis in Italy, with the ensuing few weeks of stability succeeded by the crisis in Spain.  This shows there is a fundamental flaw in the machinery and apparatus of the eurozone, the ECB and the Commission.  We will have to revisit the question of how to ensure there is a regulated banking system across the eurozone that will prevent a situation where, within one currency area, we have capital flight from one country to another.  Pressure on the Irish banking system, for example, has led to large transfers of deposits to other parts of the eurozone.  This simply does not make sense and, if it is allowed to continue, will consistently undermine the peripheral countries.  In a situation where the sovereign is the guarantor, while the ECB washes its hands of any such guarantee, it is inevitable that the weaker states will always be under pressure in seeking to retain deposits and attract capital.  This is a fundamental flaw that must be addressed.The issue of private debt must be put at the top of the agenda, but we have not had a good start in this regard.  The Taoiseach told us last week from the steps of Government Buildings that he had enjoyed a great chat with the German Chancellor, Ms Angela Merkel.  He has yet to tell us, however, what type of chat it was and what issues were discussed.  Despite what some would claim, it is fundamentally important that we know what he has requested of the Chancellor.  After all, it is she who is running the show in respect of the ECB and the Commission.  What is discussed between the Taoiseach and the Chancellor is critical in determining whether we have success in dealing with the legacy issues.  I will accept, on behalf of my party, all of the political responsibility for where we are, but the Government has been in office for 14 months.  Its mandate was clear, based on its promise to secure a renegotiation of the bank debt.  Action must be taken to ensure we can return to the markets and, more importantly, that we can provide jobs, attract investment and stand on our own two feet as a country in the years ahead.  It is incumbent on the Minister to operate according to the mandate he and his colleagues sought last year.  The endorsement of the fiscal stability treaty in the referendum last week, which we endorsed, is fundamentally separate from the issue of banking debt.

One of the most frequently debated aspects of the treaty was the question of Ireland having access to the European Stability Mechanism.  I congratulate the people, including those in my constituency, on their endorsement of the treaty.  Their resounding endorsement shows that voters took heed of the arguments in favour of a "Yes" vote.The ESM will act as a permanent rescue fund for the euro area and soon replace the temporary fund, the European financial stability facility.  Establishing a permanent rescue fund for eurozone members is seen as key to safeguarding the future of the currency, with the ESM designed to act as a lender of last resort should members find themselves cut off from market-based financing.  The ability to access this fund which is essentially an insurance policy could prove crucial to many countries and will allow them to fund public services such as pensions, social welfare payments, and health and education services, even in times of financial distress.  It will also protect participating countries against interest rate hikes in the private markets, as investors become more confident in the financial stability of the eurozone.This initiative is an example of eurozone members working together to secure and protect the future of the European project.  However, of itself it will be insufficient for that purpose.  We must have more examples of such co-operation from and proactive rather than reactive efforts by our colleagues in Europe.  In this regard, I welcome the increased focus on the growth agenda, particularly in the wake of the French presidential election and the Irish referendum.  For too long Brussels has been trying to catch up with this crisis instead of taking the lead, but there is now an opportunity to change this.  Member states cannot and should not be forced to carry the burden of crippling bank debts - that approach is no longer sustainable.  Ireland knows only too well that the current method of recapitalising financial institutions through state lending is not the way forward.Instead bank debts should be dealt with directly at a European level, and I support the Government in this approach.  Allowing the ESM to recapitalise banks directly would help break the link between sovereign debt and banking debt.  The current agreement on Ireland's banking debt must be revisited.  Our colleagues in Berlin, Paris, Brussels and elsewhere cannot continue to turn a blind eye to this issue simply because Ireland is not on the brink of collapse.  Again, we need to take a proactive approach rather than a reactive one.There is also a strong case to be made for a Europe-wide stimulus package to be implemented.  This is not a new idea but one Europe has failed to consider properly in reaction to this crisis.  One of the strongest cases that can be made for the benefits of a growth orientated approach rather than simply spending cuts is the United States.  Since the initial stimulus package was introduced in the United States at the end of 2008-beginning of 2009, the American economy has returned to positive growth.  Since the end of 2009, the American economy has remained in positive growth with the latest figures showing a 1.9% growth rate in the first quarter of 2012.  Contrast that to Europe where the eurozone area is expected to fall back into negative growth this year.Obviously, the Government has been talking about the need for a stimulus package for some time and has been successful in renegotiating with the troika to allow us to use funds from the sale of State assets for this very purpose.  However, the sale of these assets cannot be rushed and as such our hands are tied in the short term.Ultimately, we need a European response to what is a European problem.  I wish the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Government the best of luck in pursuing these issues with their European partners.  The importance of fostering a more proactive approach to this European crisis cannot be overstated.  Establishing the ESM fund is only a small step on that road to recovery and I can only hope that other European leaders will see sense in some of the proposals mentioned today.

He said there was a flaw in the machinery of the Government in negotiating a better deal for Ireland.  The only flaw I see is his credibility.  He talks about the immoral, unfair and unsustainable debt that has been placed on the shoulders of the people by the banking institutions.  It is a pity he did not wail about the immoral, unfair and unsustainable banking debt placed on the shoulders of the people when I am sure it came up for discussion at a meeting of his parliamentary party in the recent past but, to borrow a phrase from one of his colleagues, we are where we are.I agree with the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker.  Contrary to what some of the commentators might like to believe, the result of the referendum proved that the electorate went out of its way to be informed and to make a decision in the best interest of the State, itself and future generations.  It was not taken down a blind alley by a side show of erroneous and other issues which had absolutely nothing to do with the referendum.  It distilled it down into a very simple question.  Where would Ireland or any country requiring assistance in the future access the money?  Not only did the "No" side not have any credibility, it had no solution or answer.  One of its main spokespersons went on "Prime Time" one night and when she was asked where Ireland would access the money in future, she said what Sinn Féin normally says and trumpeted out that we would borrow a bit out of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Given the number of times the National Pensions Reserve Fund has been mentioned in this House as a source of funding, there would want to be a couple of trillion euro in it.  She wound up being short a few billion in the course of her remarks.  I wondered as I watched the television if should would root around in her handbag to try to see if it was in it.  The people who watched that said to themselves these people are just not credible.  They did not have a solution and they were cynical in their exploitation of a referendum in the national interest to advance their own warped political ideology.  The people in general saw through that and voted "Yes" in large numbers.By doing that, the Irish people have given the Government a mandate to get a much better deal for the country in respect of what was saddled on it by the previous Government.  This Government, unlike those in every other EU member state, has the moral authority and the backing of the people to go to Europe to say that this unsustainable debt must be managed in a different way.  As Deputy Tom Hayes said, the ESM may very well prove to be a mechanism in which that can be looked at if, for arguments sake, banks can access it directly rather than having to go through the sovereign.  The debt would then be taken off the shoulders of the people.  In that type of situation, the stability of the currency not only relates to how the State performs, but to how the banking institutions in the European Union perform.  This is not only an Irish issue but one which threatens contagion throughout the EU and it needs to be contained.  The fact that there is a €500 billion fund available without a ceiling being placed on it for individual member states gives an element of security which, to be honest, one would want rocks in one's head not to support.Those in the Opposition who say we should go to Brussels and renegotiate it are the same people who up to last week said we could access funding through the EFSF knowing the EFSF will run out in three years time.  When one asks them from where we will borrow when it runs out, they scratch their heads and talk about something one might find on the back of a Weetabix box.  They have no solution as to where this country will find the resources needed to fund the public finances.I wish the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Tánaiste well in this regard.  There is no doubt the biggest issue which will confront this State probably in a generation is finding a mechanism which will allow growth and recovery.  This is one part of a jigsaw.  As the Taoiseach and everybody else said last week, by voting "Yes", things would not get better overnight but by voting "No", they would get an awful lot worse.  We have taken one gigantic step forward on the road to recovery.  I wish the Minister well and know he is committed to getting a better deal for Ireland and pursuing a growth agenda which is in everybody's interest.  I support the Bill.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is important to acknowledge the vote of the people in the recent referendum which was an indirect endorsement of the ESM.  To boil it down into a very simple formula, the people decided that should we need money, it would be in our national interest to have access to that money.  People were aware that the EFSF would run out in 2013, so a €500 billion fire wall makes sense.I wish to digress from the national trend to that in my own county.  I had a conversation with the Minister for Finance about this last night and mentioned that the "No" vote did not have it all its own way in County Donegal.  In the Fanad peninsula, 50% voted "Yes" and 50% voted "No".  On the evening of the vote, I met a couple of farmers along the road in Fanad who were certainly not supporters of mine or my party.  One of the farmers said that rather than vote against the interests of the country and vote "No", they decided to stay at home instead.  There was an element of that, especially in light of the 42% turnout.  The general reaction of the people in Donegal, which must be recorded in this national Parliament, was that they were glad it was passed nationally.  That is important to note.In regard to the €500 billion fire wall, there is a danger countries will lapse back into bad habits in the expectation that if they get into bother again, money will be available.  We must sound a note of caution in regard to the availability of such funding.  We need a system for obtaining access to funding.  We do not have powers to replicate what occurs in the United States or the United Kingdom in regard to quantitative easing; we must have something that works in the interest of the eurozone members.  We must and will aspire to having the good housekeeping rules of countries such as Austria, Finland and the Netherlands, which have small deficits and low unemployment rates.  It is part of the process of learning by doing.  What we are doing has not been done before.  We are learning by doing but we must work in co-operation to ensure our economy recovers.When canvassing on the doorsteps throughout my constituency and among representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises, the concept of the domestic economy continued to arise.  Members on each side of the House have stated we need a parallel growth strategy at EU level.  That is a given and it must continue to be so.  With deficit reductions and cutbacks in expenditure, be it current or capital, we need to invest money in the real economy.  There is unbelievable resilience among the business community, including small and medium-sized enterprises.  In Donegal, 90% of all businesses are small to medium in size.  The resilience is second to none.The overall aspiration and philosophy in business at present is to survive.  There is an altruistic element whereby employers want to hold onto as many staff as possible.  They want to work in partnership with their staff to ensure they stay in business.  The business philosophy or model is one of survival; it is certainly not a question of profit or reinvesting money in various schemes.  With that in mind, I endorse the Taoiseach's commitment, which is also that of the European Union, including the eurozone, to have a parallel growth strategy.  Without it, everything else does not make sense.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak this afternoon on the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012.  Last night, I spoke on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill.  I acknowledge the turnout in my constituency for the successful referendum on the stability treaty.  The turnout was the sixth highest in the country.This morning, I attended an investment conference in Croke Park with a number of other Deputies.  It was organised by the US embassy.  I listened to two very prominent speakers, namely, the Taoiseach and Mr. Bill Johnson, president of the H. J. Heinz Company, one of the top ten companies in the world.  One began to wonder about the whereabouts of all the "No" voters who were so prominent during the referendum campaign.  The empty benches across from me show the real interest they have in the future of the country.At the conference this morning, the Taoiseach said a "Yes" vote created stability and certainty for foreign companies that want to invest in Ireland.  Mr. Bill Johnson said Ireland continues to be a very attractive place in which to do business.  The vote last week was an endorsement by the Irish people of the important role that foreign direct investment plays in job creation.  The people wanted to ensure no damage would be inflicted on Ireland's international credibility now that international confidence is at an all-time high.  I chair the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and note that anywhere I travel, particularly the United States, people approach me and credit Ireland for what it has done in the past 12 months.  Much of this is because of the work of the Government, and this is extremely important, particularly for foreign direct investment.  Last week's vote gave a clear indication of that confidence.  People do not want it to diminish.  If we had voted "No" last week, it would have damaged Ireland's credibility abroad and foreign direct investment would decrease.There are more than 600 US companies operating in Ireland and they have invested more than €190 billion and employ more than 100,000 people here.  Last year, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland created more than 13,000 jobs through foreign direct investment.  Approximately 60 companies came here.  Recent announcements by PayPal, Microsoft, Apple, Coca-Cola and Facebook, to name but a few multinationals, signal the importance of Ireland as a base for future development and as a hub for Europe.  Ireland has nine of the top ten pharmaceutical companies which, in itself, speaks volumes.  More than 50% of the world's financial services companies are based here.  The top ten born-on-the-Internet companies are here also.  They are here because Ireland is a favourable place in which to invest and because we have a favourable corporation tax rate.  This morning, at the conference, the Taoiseach stated the corporation tax rate will remain the same.  This is extremely important to ensure the continuation of foreign direct investment.I welcome the comments made yesterday by Mr. Mario Draghi, chairman of the European Central Bank.  He stated that if Ireland continues with its efforts, the return to the markets will not be a very distant prospect, and could be much sooner than expected.  This expresses confidence in what we have been doing in the past 12 months.  The Government is certainly working hard to achieve this.  However, external factors, such as the ongoing problems in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece, could have an influence on our objective of returning to the markets.Having access to the ESM will assist Ireland in returning to the markets.  It would boost confidence among the international financial markets.  I am sorry I do not have more time because I could speak all day on this subject.  I am delighted to have had an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is a safety net to provide an insurance policy for the future if we need funding.

We also believe emergency funding is necessary to assist in stabilising the eurozone and protecting vulnerable member states from speculative market attack.  However, it is important when establishing a permanent emergency funding mechanism that we learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure the new fund is fit for purpose and that it will do what it says on the tin, assist member states in regaining access to the sovereign bond markets and stabilise the euro.Unfortunately, the Government and its partners in the European Council have not learned the very simple lesson of the past two years of the crisis, namely, that the policy they have been pursuing is failing.  It is worth mentioning that, after 450 days of Fine Gael and Labour in government, the unemployment rate is still increasing in the State.    Clearly, they have not learned the lesson that the EFSF, as a tool for assisting states to regain access to the sovereign bond markets, has also failed.  When former Deputy Arthur Morgan was Sinn Féin's spokesperson on finance, he rightly predicted that the EFSF would be a failure and opposed the original Euro Area Loan Facility Bill in May 2010.  He stated then that the EU facility and the loans it would provide to Greece were not an act of solidarity to assist a beleaguered fellow member state.  He told this House that it would be a massive bailout for toxic banks, the cost of which would be paid by taxpayers across Europe.Events over the past 12 months in Greece, Portugal and Ireland confirm beyond doubt that former Deputy Morgan was right.  Greece is now in a second program and Portugal is on course for a second programme.  What greater admission of failure could there be than the recent pronouncements by Ministers that Ireland, in all probability, will need a second round of emergency funding in 2014?In September last, when the EFSF returned to the Dáil as part of the agreement of a second programme for Greece, my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, warned the Government again that it was pursuing the wrong policies.  Sinn Féin opposed the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill because it did not present any comprehensive solution to the crises gripping the eurozone.  It also introduced, in the most underhand way, the European Stability Mechanism, which, as Deputy Pearse Doherty outlined earlier, contains many problems for Ireland and the eurozone.Almost a year on, the Government is repeating the same mistakes.  It still believes an emergency fund based on policies of crippling austerity and unlimited bank bailouts will be good for Ireland and for the eurozone as a whole.  Sinn Féin's firm view is that Ireland and the eurozone need an emergency funding mechanism, not only because Ireland will have to access it by 2014 but also because it is vital to stabilise the euro.  This is why we supported the proposed amendment to Article 136 of the European treaty.However, there is no point in agreeing to a fund that is not fit for purpose, that will not achieve its stated objectives and that in all likelihood will make matters worse.  The ESM, in its current form, will not solve the problem.  It is based, like the EFSF, on the failed policies of crippling austerity and unlimited bank bailouts.  Unless the ESM treaty is amended, Sinn Féin will not be in a position to support this Bill.Fortunately for Ireland and for the eurozone, a window of opportunity exists to amend the ESM treaty and improve the funds that are available.  Other EU member states are actively seeking changes to the treaty as well.  These changes could be made well before the upcoming European Council summit at the end of June.  The Government should do likewise.Next week, on Committee Stage, Sinn Féin will table amendments to the European Stability Mechanism Bill.  The amendments will be based on five key changes that we believe are required for the ESM to do what it is being set up to do.  They are: an explicit option of ESM funds being used to invest in jobs and growth as part of a credible deficit reduction strategy rather than the current focus on austerity; an option for direct ECB funding of the ESM to provide the necessary firewall to stabilise the euro while limiting the liability to taxpayers and individual member states; a clause ensuring that countries already in a programme are not required to contribute to the fund; a requirement for strict stress tests and write-down of toxic debt as a precondition for any ESM funds being used to recapitalise the banks, whether directly or indirectly via loans to government; and greater accountability at EU and member state levels and the removal of the immunity granted to the fund and its board members.It is time for the Government to stand up for the interests of Irish citizens, just as the Government of Spain has been doing for its citizens.  Ensuring Ireland has access to an emergency fund that works for Ireland is the best way of doing this.  Ní réitóidh an ESM mar atá sé na fadhbanna sa eurozone nó sa Stát seo. Táim ag impí ar an Rialtas dúiseacht as a chodladh, bheith cróga agus seasamh suas ar son mhuintir na hÉireann.

#JohnLyonsLab	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-party	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-dob	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I believe I am sharing time with Deputy White.  I note matters seem to be running a little faster and I assume he will pop in at some stage.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak.I want to speak about this ESM Bill in the context of three matters: the "Yes" vote that was received last week; a better deal on our bank debt, which a number of Members have mentioned; and moving on from crisis management to taking more proactive steps to tackle the unemployment crisis in Europe, particularly in Ireland.First, I am pleased we voted "Yes" on Thursday last for the fiscal compact treaty.  It was an important vote for the country and one that gives us a platform on which to build our recovery.  Financial stability is very important and the rules that have been laid down on debts and deficits will enhance confidence in the country, and I am pleased that voters endorsed these proposals.In saying that, I spent a great deal of time on the doorsteps over the past five weeks or thereabouts and we must take on the views we heard.  Among those who voted "Yes" and those who voted "No", there are genuine concerns and we, as a Government, need to see what we can do about some of those concerns.  They are real and there is an obligation on us to do something about that.Much has been said in recent weeks about the European Stability Mechanism and the limitations of the eurozone, but what we need to remember is that nothing like the ESM existed before for the eurozone.  Up to now, the euro did not have a permanent bailout fund to back up the currency.  We now will have such a fund.  The European Central Bank has also evolved over recent years to take up a role far broader that was ever imagined in the first place.  These are important developments.We use a shared currency but it is also a global reserve currency and the crisis of recent years has exposed some of its limitations.  These limitations have created uncertainty about how certain eurozone countries could continue to finance themselves independently.  This uncertainty persists in this country and in other countries, and countries may need this fund.  The fund also is a backstop for countries.  It will be there if we need it and if others need it.It was a huge mistake to suggest, as some on the "No" side did over recent weeks, that vetoing or attempting to veto this fund would in any way advance the interests of the Irish people.  What was never explained by the "No" side was how, if we did vote "No", we would ever finance ourselves or get rid of our deficit.On the doorsteps, Sinn Féin members were exceptionally disingenuous in what they said to people and on the reasons to vote "No".  They encouraged people in my area, an area which relies heavily on State supports and where people rely heavily on family income supports to meet their daily needs, to vote "No".  They went and knocked on those doors and encouraged people to vote "No".  One story I heard was they went to the house of a person was a carer and stated that if the carer voted "Yes", the carer's allowance would be cut even further.  That is being disingenuous with people and I believe that is morally wrong.Sinn Féin needs to stop being involved in political opportunism.  I am disappointed Deputy Tóibín has left the Chamber.  The party's members need to stop putting the political advancement of their party ahead of the people who have elected them here.  It was morally wrong to do what they did during the referendum campaign and they need to stop doing so.  This was not the first time.  They have been doing it endlessly and they need to stop it if they want to be taken seriously.I, for one, do not take Sinn Féin seriously.  I hope anybody who is watching this, or watches it repeated on Facebook, etc., understands the need to question whether he or she should take them seriously.  If Sinn Féin wants to be in real democratic politics down here, it must start playing ball fairly and the way to start is by being honest and genuine with those who elected its members.I stood on those doorsteps and because I was on the "Yes" side, I was limited in what I could say because I could only speak the truth.  When one is on the "No" side, it is easy to say what one likes.  The "No" side were unlimited in what they could say because they did not have to speak the truth alone.  One need only look to the North.  I am compelled to refer to this because we have referred to it endlessly but people simply do not appear to be listening.  Those in Sinn Féin say certain things and give out about certain things down here.  They called on people to vote "No" down here.  I cannot understand why people take them seriously.  I refer to one quote in particular.  An advertisement appeared in theBelfast Telegraph.  Pat Kenny referred to it during his one-to-one interview with Deputy Pearse Doherty.  He asked why Deputy Doherty was talking about pay caps down here and rural schools being encouraged to amalgamate while they were doing the same in the North.  There is one frightening piece of evidence which shows that they do not mean what they say.  Sinn Féin issued an advertisement in the Belfast Telegraph seeking an adviser to the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, with a salary of up to £205,000, approximately €250,000.If those in Sinn Féin are serious about politics here they need to start playing ball.  They could start by being honest.  If honesty means loosing one seat, I would rather that than maintain my seat and use it for political advancement.  I offer one word of advice to those in Sinn Féin before I proceed: they should stop leading people up the garden path, stop being disingenuous and stop their auction politics.We should bear in mind that we have a common cause in this area.  We have shared responsibilities as part of a common currency area.  We depend on our currency.  It is the money in our pocket and the money that pays our bills and mortgages.  Speculation about its future directly impacts on our economy and the lives of the people.  Attempting to veto a fund designed to help countries in distress, as suggested by the "No" side, would have served no one's interests.  I believe we voted for the stability of a shared currency last week and we have played our part in this regard.  We are in uncertain times and the situation in Spain and other countries and the unknown losses in their banks has considerable potential consequences for us.The lesson of how the banking crisis was handled here is that we must separate the banking losses from the State.  In this regard, we now need a deal on our debt to reduce the burden we have taken on.  This point was raised many times on the doorsteps.  If this can be done through the ESM or by some means of sharing the liabilities we took on, it would help the State.I welcome the comments of the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, this week to the effect that the "Yes" vote strengthened our hand in negotiations on the bank debt and also on the growth agenda in Europe.  We are not privy to what form these negotiations on the bank debt are taking.  However, I appreciate that in negotiations one does not disclose one's strategy or broadcast one's every move.  Anyway, I sincerely hope we see progress on this issue for the people.  Whatever the outcome, the solution to Europe's banking debt will be a political solution and, therefore, we need to be at the heart of policy responses to the crisis.  I believe the "Yes" vote has put us in that position.It is also important to recognise the importance of the "Yes" vote in terms of our influence in Europe and on the future growth agenda, in which Fine Gael and the Labour Party believe.  Political developments in Europe recently, including the French election results, have given added impetus to the growth agenda.  There have been welcome soundings at European level about country specific jobs plans, better use of Structural Funds for job creation and, in particular, youth unemployment, an area of considerable interest to me.  The political dialogue is changing to address these situations.  There has been no sign to date of additional funds at European level to tackle the problems in individual countries, including the problem of youth unemployment in Ireland.The unemployment problem in Europe, in particular the problem of youth unemployment, is critical.  A recent OECD report stated that the proportion of European youths not in employment, education or training ranges from between 5% and 6% in countries such as Sweden and Austria up to between 16% and 17% in Ireland and Italy.  This emerging divide in Europe should not be allowed to continue.  A Europe with such a clear opportunities divide would shatter the idea of common cause or solidarity.  New policies based on solidarity between European countries should be adopted to take these considerable challenges on board.  This is why influence matters and why our "Yes" vote last week mattered.  The result provides for Irish involvement in Europe to operate at full capacity, fighting for our recovery, jobs and growth.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The normal parliamentary niceties do not usually extend to colleagues commenting on the progress of the debate and how long people have spoken for.  Nevertheless, it is somewhat striking, if not nauseating, to recall that on the Order of Business this morning there were several war dances on the other side of the Chamber because of the amount of time afforded to the debate, because it was not long enough, because it was to be wrapped up today and that it was being rammed through and so on.  Many of those due to speak on the other side of the Chamber this afternoon fell short of the time allocated to them.  They are entitled to do so and I am unsure whether I will get through ten minutes.  I may do so or I may wish I had longer to speak.  However, it is somewhat hard to take.Deputy Lyons referred to the requirement of honesty and basic straightforwardness.  Perhaps it is too much to ask for when people come to the House on the Order of Business and call for extended time for debate but when that opportunity is not taken up subsequently.  Deputy Doherty make a substantial contribution earlier.  Deputy Tóibín spoke some minutes ago and said more or less what Deputy Doherty said earlier and then went off about his business.  It is simply not credible for Deputy McDonald to engage in a song and dance about it.  It is not honest.  People may take the view that the public will not notice but people notice such things.  Deputy Lyons suggested there must be a requirement of honesty and fair play but that is not happening in this debate.This dishonesty is precisely what occurred and what was at the heart of the "No" campaign throughout the four weeks.  The campaign was littered with misrepresentations.  There is always a margin of appreciation in political debate.  A given set of events can be interpreted in various ways by people with different political perspectives.  This is understood since we live in a democracy.  I can maintain that a certain course of events will ensue and another could say that is not the case and that something else will occur.  However, certain facts arise in most debates, for example, what treaties actually state on the face of them.Time and again during the past four weeks Sinn Féin made claims about the stability treaty and what it contained or otherwise in the teeth of what it actually reads.  This was the case, for example, in respect of issues such as conditionality.  The "No" side told the people that the fiscal rules were being placed in the Constitution at one stage.  They are not.  Over and over, Sinn Féin told the people that the Court of Justice of the European Union could fine countries for failing to keep to the rules.  That is not true.  The court has a role in respect of supervising the transposition of the rules but not in respect of compliance.  These may sound like technical issues that may not be of interest to most people but they were misrepresentations of the truth by Sinn Féin.I understand and accept that we may have different perspectives but I do not accept and I will never accept a misrepresentation or straightforward lying to the people in respect of what was put before them.  It calls into question the credibility of any political party if that is the trade they engage in.  On the first day of the campaign Sinn Féin cheerfully and willfully misquoted three professional economists.  I never heard a word of apology about it.  The party lifted half of what these people stated and put it forward as an argument to vote "No".  There is a margin of appreciation in our arguments and I have often argued with Deputy Doherty on these matters.  To misrepresent people, however, is fundamentally intellectual dishonesty and amounts to crossing the line for any political party to seek to do so, to do so and to try to get away with it.  Thankfully, Sinn Féin did not get away with it.  These actions have reduced the party's credibility, at least in my eyes and as a Member who perhaps was more willing to listen to and engage with Sinn Féin representatives than others.  Perhaps that is understandable given other people's experiences with Sinn Féin in the past.  I am open to Sinn Féin and all political parties and Members and I am happy to engage in free and honest debate.  However, what they did during the past four weeks was anything but honest.  It was profoundly dishonest and has changed my perspective and view on that party's willingness, ability and preparedness to engage honestly in the debate.  It colours my view of them and ultimately, in time, I believe it will colour the views of the people in respect of that organisation and party.  Of that there is no question in my mind.What is the role of any parliamentarian, whether he is in government or opposition, when presented with a Bill introduced by the Government?  It is to examine the Bill, read it, assess it and determine whether it is in the interests of the people who elected us to the House.I have not heard any argument in this debate to suggest that making available a back-up fund in the eurozone, one which I hope will not be required by Ireland although that may be the case at some point, could run counter to the interests of Irish people.  I accept that one could quibble with aspects of the European Stability Mechanism.  I agree with the Government's decision to support the position articulated by the new French Finance Minister and others in recent days that the fund should be able to provide direct funding support to banks in circumstances which would, I presume, be circumscribed.The Sinn Féin position is that it agrees to the amendment to Article 136 of the treaties and accepts in principle the idea of an emergency fund but wants five different things to be done to change the fund.  It is foraging around to try to find a reason to oppose the ESM in what is another example of dishonesty.  This is a case of Sinn Féin deciding first how it wants to vote and asking how it will reach a position where it can half credibly state to people that there is a reason to vote against the European Stability Mechanism.  Its position is devoid of credibility, realism and honesty.I will focus on a few issues.  Sinn Féin believes an emergency fund should be established provided five conditions are met.  When it makes proposals, such as one to provide direct funding for banks, it does so as if it thought them up.  When one listens to speeches made by its spokespersons, one always hears the party has argued for this position or proposed that measure as if it had suddenly thought up these proposals or as if the Minister and Government had not been arguing and pressing for concessions during every waking hour.

I do not mind being interrupted if it is done to raise an issue to which I could respond.  What is the alternative to making funding available under the European Stability Mechanism?  Deputy Boyd Barrett is clear that his approach would be to default, refuse to pay and walk away.  We know what credibility that proposal contains.  Why does Sinn Féin not state that its position is also that we should default because that is what it amounts to?  Deputies should note the language it uses.  It states it argues for a write-down but never states what will happen if we do not secure a write-down.  Would it simply continue arguing in favour of a write-down?  What would it do if one is not provided?  It throws in the phrase that it will burn one or two bondholders.  Its position, in truth, is to call for a default.  At least Deputies from the MLA have the honesty to say that.

It is odd that Second Stage of such important legislation is being forced through the House by means of a guillotine.  This reckless decision is unfair to Deputies and members of the public.  If the Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, were on the Opposition benches, the decision to use the guillotine would have given rise to an almighty row in the House.  The Tánaiste, while in opposition, specialised in dealing in a very forceful manner with matters such as the use of the guillotine.  However, he had a completely different tale to tell on the Order of Business.  If I had listened to him with my eyes closed this morning, I could easily have mistaken him for a Fianna Fáil or Green Party Minister in the previous Government.  Additional time should be provided to discuss this important Bill.  This is a further example of the Government breaking a promise and reneging on a commitment.It is important to set the Bill in context and one could not find a better or, more accurately, worse context than the figures provided in today's report by the Central Statistics Office on the 12 months to the end of the first quarter of 2012.  Unfortunately, the report shows that this is a Government engaged in jobs destruction.  In the past year, there has been a net elimination of 18,100 jobs in the economy.  Government austerity is destroying jobs and despite the so-called jobs budget, jobs initiative and tourism initiative, it has managed to reduce the number of people employed in the economy by 18,100 in the past 12 months.The CSO report also shows that the long-term unemployment rate increased from 7.8% to 8.9% in the year to the end of the first quarter of 2012 and the long-term unemployed accounted for 60.6% of total unemployment in the first quarter.  Further, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has increased from 14.5% to 14.8%.  Emigration is also significant and one third of young people are unemployed.  Austerity has destroyed employment and will continue to do so because this Government and the preceding Administration extracted huge amounts of money from the economy, thereby ensuring that places of employment, including small businesses and high street shops, continue to close down.  Austerity is not working and we now find the Government proposing more austerity measures with this Bill.  It is not a bailout for the public in general or for lower and middle income families.  This is another austerity measure whereby moneys can be accessed to pay bondholders, investment banks and the like.  It is not a stability or a solidarity measure, but an austerity measure.  Low income and middle income families will have to bail out the bondholders and the speculators, while very wealthy people will freeload on the backs of those families.The ESM will have a board in place that will not be answerable to anybody.  It will not be answerable to legal redress, to the public or to any political scrutiny.  There is a possibility that it may cost us anything up to €11 billion.  This measure is a method of ensuring the bondholders and the bankers are paid.  The suggestion that ordinary people are being bailed out and will now have a facility to be bailed out is untenable.  It is clear that when the EU and this Government refer to bailouts in general and under the ESM, we are bailing out bondholders and speculators.  These bailouts involve a good Samaritan helping out a neighbour in trouble.  Low and middle income families are being forced to pay the gambling debts of bankers and speculators.  The very rich are freeloading on their backs.There are alternatives and we put them forward in our budget submission last year.  The super rich in this country have assets worth €239 billion.  They pay no wealth tax and no asset tax of any kind.  As the Christy Moore song goes, they are now richer than they ever were before. The Central Statistics Office has shown us that.  In 2009 and 2010, the wealthiest 5% in this country earned additional wealth worth €46 billion.  They have done well, but they are on an investment strike across Europe.  There is €2 trillion uninvested in the EU and £750 billion uninvested in Britain, as well as significant figures in Ireland.  Many of these people and their accountants and solicitors are now being thanked by effectively being employed and paid by NAMA.I will finish on those few words.  I will certainly not support the Bill.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I am delighted to be able to speak on this Bill today.  I am disappointed that it is being guillotined as I do not believe the guillotine is a proper implement to use on so much legislation.  I was on the other side of the House for four years and I heard objections every day from the then Opposition to the use of the guillotine.  I thought they were so disgusted with it that when they entered government, they would dispose of it or use it in very limited circumstances, but unfortunately almost every Bill has been guillotined.While I do not have a problem with Deputy White's challenges to Sinn Féin policies, he claimed the Deputies of the Technical Group were hypocrites for opposing the guillotine this morning while not taking up their full time slots during the debate.  I was not watching the debate so I do not know, but anybody can come in and speak for as long as he or she wants.  I always try to fill my time slot and I often do not have enough time, but the Deputy was being high handed.  He may not have been here during the last Dáil, but he was in the other House and he should know.  A Member cannot just be black one day and be white the next.  He is not in a position to lecture anybody, because the Government parties have broken every promise they made.  The fire burning from the bondholders was going to be hotter than hell according to the Tánaiste, yet we now see the bondholders being protected and encouraged to engage in all kinds of practices and rewarded for it.I came out for a reluctant "Yes" in the latter days of the debate on the treaty.  Deputy White attacked people on the "No" side, but there were many disingenuous comments and bully boy tactics on the "No" side too.  Somebody said to me that the ballot paper should have contained a "Yes", "No" or "Maybe".  The Minister for Finance, who I am glad to see sitting here, said the budget would be much harder to frame if we did not pass it.  He later said that we would have an easier budget if it were passed, so we look forward to that.  There was innuendo and political spin right throughout the campaign and it was very hard for me to make up my mind.  I have never voted "No" to a treaty so far, but I have learned to my cost that when the ink is dry on the treaties, they have not been much good to Ireland.  As one who supported the Lisbon treaty the first and second time, I feel our fingers were burned.  The Irish people are embittered by this Government because its parties promised so much.  They did not need to make one promise during the lifetime of the last Government, of which I was a member for a long time, because people were sick of that Government as it had become arrogant in its third term.  Unfortunately, the feeling out there is that this Government is as arrogant after only 15 months.I asked the Taoiseach to keep Ministers like Deputies Hogan and Shatter away from the debate so that we would not lose it.  I note that he did, but the Minister - big Phil as I call him - could not resist coming out on "RTE News" on Thursday night to show he had not gone away.  He did this even though he still has not published the guidelines for the wastewater treatment systems, and even though he announced a consultation period of three months, yet people could not engage with him.  The website was wrong and when my daughter had a problem with it, she called a number and was told she should not have called that number and was asked who gave it to her.  The whole thing was a mess and the website had to be taken down.   We now find the Minister is offering registration from April Fools' Day to June for €5.I am now getting calls to my office from constituents, because big Phil is back and roaming the land like a Celtic tiger.  People are being told they cannot register.  The site for registration has been abandoned and is not functioning.  People are being codded all the way to the bank.Once again, I will vote, reluctantly, for the Bill.  Throughout the referendum campaign, the Tánaiste, the Ministers for Finance and Transport, Tourism and Sport and many others said the treaty had nothing to do with banking.  Deputy Alex White corrected Deputies and accused them of speaking about things that were not in the treaty.  We were told repeatedly that the treaty had nothing to do with banking.  When the campaign was over the line, and I commend the Government members on their hard work and on achieving a "Yes" vote, those members of the Government were full of glee and excitement.  They got carried away and did a phone around.  They did a telephone blitz of their friends to tell them what good Europeans we are and that we wanted a better banking deal.  When they phoned around, however, they found they had very few friends, if any.What happened in the Dáil yesterday morning was an outrage.  The Taoiseach stonewalled all requests to divulge the substance of his phone call to Chancellor Merkel.  Did Angela sing the Jim Reeve's song and say "Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone, Enda", or whatever she calls him?  Is that what he did?  The Taoiseach once told us he and Chancellor Merkel had each other on speed-dial.  Does he have her on M for Merkel and does she have him on NG for nice guy, because he is the best boy in the class?  Did she pat him on the head and thank him for winning the referendum vote? Does she know about our referendum or is she even interested in what we are doing in Ireland?There have been several mentions of the previous bank bailout.  I spoke to the former Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, twice on the day the deal was signed.  Tomorrow will be the first anniversary of his death, God rest him.  I asked him to come home and leave it to them, because what he was signing was not a bailout but a clean out.  We were forced to clean out our pension fund to the tune of €23 billion before we got a shilling, and our European friends charged us interest at nearly 3% more than the IMF.I am worried about the lack of accountability of the ESM.  It cannot be brought before any parliament or independent body.  It will be another out-of-control quango.  Ordinary people, small businesses, small farmers and working people are being crucified with banking debt while speculators and bondholders are getting away.  The people are hurting and are very cross over this.  It is not fair, just or proper.Spain seems to be edging ever closer to getting ESM funding, and I hope it does.  We should also get what we are entitled to because we voted for the bank guarantee and took the so-called bailout, although we should not have done so.  I voted for the bank guarantee and I have regretted it every day since, because we were told lies by the banks.  We are still being told lies by them.I was glad to hear Mr. John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office say yesterday the banks are not lending.  We had a discussion with him a couple of months ago when he said they were lending.  They are not doing so.  They are codding us all the way to the bank.I was delighted to hear the Minister for Finance say last night that we would be back in the bond markets in three weeks time.  I certainly hope we will, in whatever limited capacity, and I look forward to that.  I compliment the Minister on his efforts.  He has a difficult job.  However, we cannot have austerity followed by more austerity.  Our people are weary from it.  Our businesses have flown from the land and the spirit of enterprise has been buried or kicked around.  Law-abiding people who pay their taxes, pay their VAT on time and pay PRSI, insurance and pension contributions cannot get a shilling of credit.  Their overdrafts are being withdrawn or they are being forced to convert them to term loans.  Banks call this lending and report as much to the Minister and his officials.There is a problem in the Department of Finance.  Too many officials in the Department do not understand business or the real world.  This is equally true of the current and previous Governments, because these officials are the permanent government.  When I asked the late Minister who was with him on the fateful day of the so-called bailout, he named the three senior officials.  I told him none of them had ever stood behind a counter or had ever had to set up and run a business.  They were all career civil servants.  I am not knocking all career civil servants, but we need business people in the Civil Service and in the Department of Finance to show us how to get out of this quagmire and to stand up to Chancellor Merkelet al.  They know the value of a pound and of a euro, unlike those who can write cheques but have no accountability and can make an accounting error of €3 billion with no fear of reprimand.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	153	With the agreement of the House, I will share my time with Deputy Paschal Donohoe.I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Unlike other Deputies, whom I have listened to for the past two days, I believe the country has achieved a great deal in a very short space of time.  We have achieved credibility, internationally and nationally.  Our people have achieved a sense of resilience and have stood up and made decisions in recent times in very difficult circumstances.  They made those decisions on the basis that they were the right as opposed to the convenient decisions, and that they were in the interests of themselves and their country.  We have also stood up internationally and shown the way to many others.For those reasons, the people expect certain things to follow.  I do not agree with the analysis from those on the other side of the House that austerity, misery and continuous depression are the order of the day.  The word "austerity" occurs in their every conversation.  If it does not occur, it is invented.At this stage, it does not matter how we got to where we are, but we are here.  Given the position we are in, we must do certain things.  The previous speaker referred to the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan.  He was in an appallingly difficult situation.  He might have spoken to anyone, but the eventual decision was his.  We must not forget that.  He took a courageous and difficult decision at the time.  He accepted responsibility for private, public and all kinds of debts.  He gave sovereign approval to debts that had not been incurred on behalf of the State.In everything that happened during the boom time, borrowing and lending criteria were laid down and they carried theimprimatur of the institutions of the State.  They carried the guaranteed Irish symbol and an implied approval.  I do not want to go into who did or did not do what and when.  Things happened.  Some Deputies on the other side of the House spend their time telling us these things were not done on their behalf.  Unfortunately, they were.  The people also gave approval.  They did so three times in three general elections, the last one in 2007.However we look at things, we were in a difficult situation and we had to work our way out of it.  I knew the Minister well, as did other Members of the House at the time.  He was in a difficult situation and he took a decision.  That is what he had to do.  Whichever decision he took, whether it was right or wrong, there would have been consequences.  If we had defaulted, there would have been consequences downstream for our national and international credibility.  If we did not, as was the case, there are consequences.  We must accept responsibility, as we are doing, and move on from there.What worries me most at this stage is that I listen every morning to a tirade of misery, negativity, ullagone and more of it.  I hear that we are broke, that we are going nowhere, we have austerity and that there is an international conspiracy to do us down.  I worry about the impact that is having on society.  The voting public took a decision last week.  Its decision was not based on fear.  It was based on a value judgment.  The public did not like to do the job it did.  It does not like it, and we do not like having to do the job that is now thrust upon us, but the public did it and did it in the knowledge that we are not in an easy or risk-free situation.  We are at a crossroads.  We have a great opportunity to influence what happens in the European arena.  As a country we have a great opportunity to focus on the issue that should be focused on throughout the European Union, both within the eurozone and without.  The whole European project is weakened without the renewal of that focus.I recall the meetings I had back in the early 1980s when I visited Brussels and met what remained of the then founding fathers of the European project and the degree to which and the passion with which they acclaimed their vision of Europe.  That has changed.  As my colleague, Deputy Donohoe, is aware, we spoke earlier today in the Joint Committee on European Affairs about how that focus has gone and things have changed.  Renationalisation has emerged.  I predict without any doubt that if the various European countries both in the eurozone area and without revert to individualisation and each one fends for itself we will end up in a serious position.  By the same token, if we pretend we are not Europeans, that we can demand from Europe at will and expect a response on the basis that we are a small, poor country – we were the richest country in the world a couple of years ago – and we pretend to go down that road, our bluff will be called because every other European country will do the likewise.  Never more so than at times of economic stress is it important for people to recognise the global position, the bigger picture and to cease to focus on their own small backyard patch.  This is not the time for parochialism.In the two minutes remaining, you will be pleased to know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will not go into all the debate which we discussed in the past three months because I do not think it is necessary.  The issue has been debatedad nauseam.  What we need to do now is to work with what we have, continue to put our shoulders to the wheel, stop whingeing and moaning about it and acknowledge that our people are carrying a heavy burden.  It is important to them that we do that.  We cannot, however, be portrayed nationally and internationally in the manner in which some Members - who will remain nameless but who are essentially on the opposite side of the House - have done so, whereby we are deemed to be incapable of recognising business reality and putting in place the measures necessary to ensure our recovery.  Far from that, we should set out the grounds on which we can assist and motivate other countries throughout the European Union towards the kind of recovery that is needed.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I will focus on three themes in my contribution, the first being the stance taken by some Members of the Opposition on legislation due to be passed by the Oireachtas, whereby if they are not happy with the view of the people or of the Oireachtas, they believe the appropriate course of action is to challenge it in the courts.  A dangerous precedent is being set in that if Members of the Oireachtas, who are deeply privileged in the first instance to be among of a small number who influence the development of law and vote on it, are not happy with the outcome of the process or where they perceive the will of the people to be, they take it upon themselves to march to the High Court and beyond to challenge the process of which they are a member, funded by the taxpayer.  We have seen this in regard to the Bill before the House and in the recent action taken by Sinn Féin on the role of the Referendum Commission.  If these Members are not happy with the outcome of a decision taken by a democratic institution of which they are Members, they then challenge it in the courts.  It is a privilege to be a Member of this Chamber or of the Seanad.  Everyone who is in the Houses has worked hard to attain membership but if one is not happy with the outcome or with where the debate is going we are elected to put forward our views. It is not a healthy precedent or correct to march into the courts to legally challenge decisions taken by the Houses of the Oireachtas because one fails to win the argument in the Chamber.My second point relates to views I regularly hear from some Members of the Opposition on the element of conditionality laid down in the ESM.  I refer to the idea that it is wrong that conditions would be laid down for accessing the European Stability Mechanism in the future.  I say to those speakers, as I did during the campaign, that some of the money going into the ESM is from Irish taxpayers raised through taxes in the country, some of which we will have borrowed.  The idea, therefore, that we would be happy to have our money spent elsewhere without conditions is not something we could reasonably expect the Irish taxpayer to accept or tolerate.  If it is not acceptable to the Irish taxpayer why would it be acceptable to taxpayers in any other country?  It is in our interest, as a country that is paying into this fund, to ensure there are terms and conditions on how the money is spent.The final point I wish to emphasise relates to the use of the ESM fund in the future.  Colleagues have referred to the fact that we are at a crossroads within the eurozone and the European Union.  We are at a point I hoped we would never reach, where one country may well find itself with a banking system that is too big to be allowed to fail but is also too big to save by itself.  We are also at a point where some European leaders who should know better by now are openly talking about the prospect of another country leaving the eurozone.  All of that has got us to a point where the certainties of the past in terms of what could happen are out the window and, equally, the certainty of what the policy response should be has to be revised.  If we do not do so the cost of the uncertainty and of being unwilling to examine new ideas in response to a radically new situation would be great not only for the European economy but for the huge political solidarity that still exists within the European Union.  The ESM on which we are voting offers a vehicle for that new thinking to be embraced.During the summer, allowing the ESM to lend directly to banking systems across Europe, including Ireland, will be essential.  If we do not break the links between sovereign and national banking systems, we will break the links that bind the euro together.  The euro breaking apart is a real prospect.  Even with the full amount the ESM could have, it might not be large enough to save some of the sovereign economies affected by the crisis.  However, it will have the capacity to support their banking systems.  It will also have the capacity to ensure the mistake made in Ireland is not made elsewhere and allow the Irish situation to be fixed.Other actions need to be taken in terms of the fund.  It should have a banking licence in order that it might have the ability to act quickly in the banking crisis brewing in other countries.I will conclude by emphasising some of the points I made during the debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 yesterday.  Certain ideas were unthinkable 12 months ago because they were unnecessary.  However, we have reached the point at which they are thinkable and necessary.  For example, how might a banking union be put in place?  The ESM will form a corner piece of that union and the time has arrived to consider such ideas.  We must discuss and evaluate new ideas.  For example, what might a fiscal union mean for this country and would we want to be inside it?  This discussion will raise uncomfortable prospects for us.  It will raise the need to examine the treaties to determine whether they provide the ideas and architecture to complete the euro project.  There is one certainty - if we do not complete it and finally put in place the ideas and systems it requires, it will not weather the storm in its current form, given the challenges that lie ahead.  We must face this certainty and act.  I hope the ESM offers the lever that will allow European politics to move ahead of European and global economics.  This will occur soon.  If it does not, the cost will be too great for any of us to contemplate.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  I agree with much of Deputy Paschal Donohoe said.  That the ideas under discussion were unthinkable one year ago is the reason we are in this crisis.  Had the nettle been grasped long before now, we might not be at the precipice.  In the past few hours Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Cameron held a joint conference.  According to Reuters, Chancellor Merkel stated she was ready to act.  The crisis has been ongoing since 2008 and one gets the sense from her remarks and the response to same that it is "Groundhog Day", in that people are always ready to act, yet there is a lack of decisiveness.  I hope the establishment of the fund and all that goes with it, including the rules, is a start, but events will overtake it.  Consider the evolving situation in Spain, in particular.  The theme of the debate has been whether the fund will be large enough.  This matter should be considered.I welcome the "Yes" vote in last week's referendum and congratulate everyone involved in the campaign.  Despite people's differences, some of which have been restated in this debate, the campaign was civilised and mature.  We cannot escape the fact, however, that there was a low turnout.  Regardless of the topic, as the country's Parliament, we cannot run away from the fact that just over 50% of the electorate believed voting on the issue to be worthwhile.  This matter needs further consideration.  In the aftermath of the Lisbon treaty referendum, there was a great deal of research into why people had voted or acted in a certain way.  Will the Government conduct similar research on this occasion?  In fairness, the referendum commission did a good job and provided accessible and understandable information.  However, in the last few days of campaigning it was clear that many still believed they did not have a sufficiently proper understanding of the issues to enable them to vote.  As representatives of democracy and regardless of the topic or the sides taken during the campaign, it would be worth the Government's while to conduct further research in people's lack of engagement in the campaign.On a side issue, it is time to give up on voting on a Thursday.  It belongs to a different era.  We are now mature enough to vote at the weekend, be it on a Saturday or a Sunday.  This would enable people to engage in the democratic process more easily than is the case.The aftermath of the referendum has left a strange taste in my mouth.  I campaigned on the basis that it was a fiscal treaty, separate from anything to do with our banking debt issues.  This was the mantra of the Government and my party.  Even though we were laughed and jeered at, we knew the mantra was that there was no link.  However, within minutes of the "Yes" vote becoming apparent last Friday, the Government line as expressed by its most senior members - I am not referring to a Minister of State or a Government backbencher - was that it would help us to get a deal on the banking debt.  They were like greyhounds out of the traps.  The Ministers directly involved in the matter, Deputies Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin, did not take that line, but a number of Ministers and others who should have known better did.  Clearly, they lost the run of themselves following what was a positive result.Like a contestant on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire", the Taoiseach telephoned all of his friends on Friday.  From his inability to tell us what Chancellor Merkel said to him, it is clear she was not impressed.  This point has since been stated by the German authorities.  As of now, they do not believe there will be any movement on our banking debt.  Regardless of on which side of the House Members are, everyone agrees it is the issue that is hanging over our heads the most.Linking the two issues was disingenuous of those members of the Government.  Unfortunately, this has been typical of some members of the Government, in that they constantly oversell their ability to deliver a deal and keep building expectations of a deal.  On Friday there were soundings to the effect that a deal could be indicated as early as the next summit, but that suggestion crashed immediately.  We were told there would be a deal when the promissory note was paid at the end of last October.  We are still waiting for the troika's paper on our bank debt which was promised months ago.  Whenever one tries to make a deal, one does not show one's cards.  In managing people's expectations and building confidence the Government needs to apply the reins and be careful in its public pronouncements on a deal on our banking debt.  Official pronouncements should be left to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, as the Ministers dealing with the issue.  They should be allowed to do the talking in public.  It seems that whenever a Minister not involved in the process discusses it, he or she undermines our ability to get a deal, the context of which is changing.The serious problem in Spain eased somewhat this morning, given that country's ability to sell bonds.  However, there will be developments.  If Spain does reach a deal, regardless of the type, we must be entitled to the same terms.  If not, we are not in a European Union.That has been the difficulty in this entire process since it erupted in 2008.  The European Central Bank is running one process, while the political side of the European Union is running a completely separate one.  The ECB is calling all the shots for those in the eurozone.  Are we in a European Union or not?  The ECB does not perceive the Union in the same way.  This must change.  If action is to be taken for one euro member state, the same entitlements should be available to another member state.  One presumes that in a fiscal union the same rules apply to all members.  Bluntly, if Spain gets a deal that is more lenient than the process we are going through, we are entitled to the same deal.  If not, this is not a fiscal union, never mind a political one.It seems there will be a date with destiny in two weeks when the health check of the Spanish banking system will be completed.  There have been so many health checks of European banks that it is very hard to believe them at this stage.  Bank stress tests in the European Union are like the boy who cried wolf.  Fortunately, the BlackRock stress test of Irish banks finally came good.  If this is a proper co-ordinated response, as we are led to believe, why are waiting for the Spanish banks to be stress-tested?The mandate of the European Stability Mechanism must be expanded.  We need to be ambitious and realistic from the start.  We cannot set it on the seas, only to pull it back into harbour shortly afterwards to change it.  We have to allow it to inject funds directly into failing banks instead of putting that cost on the back of the taxpayer, as we have done here.  This would allow collective European-wide support in dealing with regional banking crises.  If this is a currency and fiscal union, a proper functioning banking system is an essential part of it.  The fact that we had to recapitalise our own banks and fund their losses for the sake of the euro means the State is paying down the debt.  This is wrong.  A proper currency union should ensure its member states share the burden.We have to examine regulation on a pan-European basis.  The European Union needs to take collective responsibility to ensure this does not happen again.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, recently contended that a centralised European banking regulatory system would not be affected by national blind spots such as property bubbles, as we have had here and in Spain, and would do a more effective job of supervising banks.  However, he also said there was still a role for national monitoring and supervision to take account of national circumstances.  National bank regulators will pick up the vibes and be in touch with what is happening in the local market.  We need to have that local knowledge and presence, with a dispassionate European eye.  An amalgam of these two elements, with sufficient regulation, should prevent a recurrence of recent banking crises.  The ECB claims it has nothing to do with a regulatory role in bank supervision because the national central bodies fulfil this role.  However, the ECB also told us we could not recapitalise our banks or burn the bondholders.  It will not take responsibility for how we got to a certain point, but it will tell us how we should deal with it.  If we are to learn properly from this, we need to enhance the regulatory system on a European-wide basis.We need to revisit the need for a deposit protection policy across the eurozone.  With bank runs occurring in Greece and, to a lesser extent, in Spain, deposits need to be protected by a European-wide guarantee in the same way borrowings are.  The risk of contagion from a bank run would be sufficiently eliminated by such a move.We must ensure senior bondholders in banks which go down take some of the hit.  This obsession with ensuring they do not take a hit, instead putting the burden on the shareholders and the taxpayer as happened here, is morally and commercially wrong.  It is like someone putting money on a horse and the ECB insisting he or she get his or her money back, even if the horse is still running one week later.  One takes a bet; one hopes the odds go with-----

If she wants to continue in that way, so be it, but that is my view three years down the road.  This was the first country to enter a bailout programme, but we did not have the experience we are now having.  The Labour Party parades itself and claims the last Fianna Fáil Government did not do anything.  This is the party which told us during the general election that it would be Frankfurt's way or Labour's way.  In the 15 months it has been in government it has been very much Frankfurt's way.  We need to see it being Labour's way a little more and to see it putting on the green jersey that it tells us to put on.  Is that what the Labour Party really believes or was it just a cheap election slogan to get into power at any cost?

Will it be large enough?  We will not know until it is established.  We are much better off having the fund and access to it.  Whether we will need access to it in 2014 is probably beyond our control, given events elsewhere.  It can be in our control only if the ECB and the European Union stand up to the markets and take some of the decisive actions needed.  On the pain the people are enduring, there may be an end in sight if we can return to the markets in 2014.  Otherwise, issues outside Ireland's control in other countries may affect our ability to return to the markets independently.  Some of the suggestions we have shared with the Government could help us to achieve this and normality would return to the State finances as soon as was possible.

There have been several legal challenges to the ESM.  Deputy Thomas Pringle in Ireland has challenged its legality on constitutional grounds, arguing that it should be subject to a referendum.In Germany, the challenge was brought by a former justice Minister on the grounds that it violates the budget control rights of the German Parliament.  The Estonian challenge is based on the case of qualified majority voting in the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, decision-making processes, as it is argued that it violates the rights of smaller member states.  There are three areas of challenge from three different countries, all dealing with the quasi-constitutional aspects of passing this.The ESM is a fund that is behind the reality of what has occurred.  Politicians will naturally tend to discuss and debate the areas where they have inputs on expenditures and revenue collection.  For the past number of years, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in America and the consequences through the financial system, they did not understand the imperative of considering all the various banks in the eurozone and the European Union, as well as the interconnection with America.  As long as 15 months ago there was a credit freeze between the payments systems in the dollar currency and the euro.  The United States Federal Reserve made arrangements with the ECB to provide hundreds of billions of dollars liquidity to enable payment flows between European and American banks, as well as European and American suppliers and exporters across the globe.  This was a symptom of the total credit contraction that began as a result of the super credit expansion through the banking system, starting in the 1990s.The size of the banking liabilities in the eurozone is massive; recent estimates are that there is over €60 trillion of liabilities in eurozone banks, which is about the size of world GDP.  Those liabilities are matched by assets and the collectability and recoverability of those assets is now becoming increasingly doubtful.  That is the problem.  Investment banks, advisers in the creation of all this credit and inventors of derivatives in a world that became increasingly deregulated, had a free hand in a financial jungle.  The impairment and collapse of certain banks has caused the problems for the sovereigns.The scale of the problem emerging is huge.  There are well informed and articulate commentators who have analysed the construction of the financial world over the past 20 years or more who are increasingly alarmed at the issue going out of control.  As recently as yesterday, Mr. Martin Wolf was quoted as stating:Before now, I had never really understood how the 1930s could happen.  Now I do.  All one needs are fragile economies, a rigid monetary regime, intense debate over what must be done, widespread belief that suffering is good, myopic politicians, an inability to co-operate and failure to stay ahead of events.  Perhaps the panic will vanish but investors who are buying bonds at current rates are indicating a deep aversion to the downside risks.  Policy makers must eliminate this panic, not stoke it.The politicians coming from the larger countries in the eurozone have been far too timid and ineffective while wringing their hands.  That applies to their thoughts and actions.  I have already noted how Mr. Helmut Kohl five months ago spoke about how the dark spirits of the past were not entirely dead.  That is the individualisation that was mentioned by Deputy Durkan, with the attitude of competitive nationalism within the so-called community.  Mr. Kohl argued that the ineffective behaviour of politicians in Europe could fail the 500 million European people, which is suffering varying degrees of youth unemployment across different countries.If a small country like us has the ability to diagnose the disease, describe it, give a prognosis and bring about a method of financial management, we should stand up and not wait for reactions to bilateral conversations.  Where there are fora, we should do what Khrushchev did many years ago and take off a shoe to bang the table and make the points.  Otherwise, it will be like Korean Air, which had a higher than average rate of accidents because the culture demanded that pilots in training should defer to their seniors.  When mistakes were being made in the cockpit, an assistant pilot would have been too scared - because of a deferential culture - to say that a senior pilot had made a mistake.  The airline changed the culture so that assistant pilots could stand up with courage when a mistake was made by a superior, and the accident rate declined.  We need politicians in the smaller countries not to be afraid and deferential to so-called senior people.  We must step up to the microphone and make the points.We had four visitors from the Bundestag recently before the finance committee.  They were members of the German Parliament, and one was a former Minister responsible for the economy and technology.  They made a presentation and took questions but I found it predictable and boring.  They congratulated us on the result of last Thursday and indicated that we have shown a good example to the remaining countries which must ratify the treaty.  They argued that there was a firm platform for moving forward and that Ireland was making great progress.  They did not see much of our hardship, such as the increasing mortgage distress from the mortgage book implosion.  They did not note the lack of questions to figure out what went on in the banking audits from the five years leading to the crash.  These are tough but straightforward questions.These visitors did not realise that €75 billion as a proportion of our GDP - the amount of private bank sector losses going on to our citizens - would equate to €1.2 trillion or €1.3 trillion going on the shoulders of German citizens.  They did not understand that sovereign debt is not our problem but rather household and non-financial corporate debt.  When those three components are added and compared with national income, which is more relevant to us, it is the highest rate in the world.  They did not see that we are only at the start of a marathon of recovery.  They did not know because we have not really got the message across.

Niall Ferguson, the contemporary economic historian, has said either we are courageous and articulate on how to make up the democratic and political deficit and get on with moving towards a banking union with a federal union of countries or the whole thing will unravel.  The consequences of that could be the modern equivalent of what Creditanstalt did in Austria, even notwithstanding the gold standard, and the euro is the modern equivalent of the gold standard.  Everything could go awry and astray.
#SeanConlon	unknown-#SeanConlon-party	unknown-#SeanConlon-dob	unknown-#SeanConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	173	Passing this Bill is the culmination of a process the Government has engaged in with the Irish people in an open and of frank discussion on the benefits and drawbacks of giving the green light to Ireland's participation in and being a signatory to both the fiscal treaty and the ESM treaty.  After weeks of debate, the nation gave a decisive vote to proceed with the plan to restore this country to a state of economic prosperity and that we engage with our fellow members of the EU to build a stable Europe for our children, that we ratify the ESM treaty to ensure the stability of the euro is secured and, by extension, that the availability of funding at affordable interest rates is a certainty instead of an aspiration.The ratification of this treaty and its implementation, which will hopefully take place in January, will lay the foundations for a European economy free from the budgetary mayhem that has caused so much pain and hurt to families in Ireland and across the European Union.  It will remove the concept of less fiscally responsible member states visiting recession upon the entire euro area.  It will, in time, deliver a European economy capable of providing the economic stability essential to encourage the growth and prosperity required to ensure that future generations can live peacefully in the knowledge their homes and jobs will not disappear overnight in another economic meltdown such as we have experienced.In ratifying this treaty, we are putting in place an access route to affordable finance, should it be required.  The very fact this support mechanism is in place should provide the international confidence to launch us successfully back on to the market in 2013 or 2014.  The importance of international confidence in our ability to act rationally and responsibly is a major help to those institutions charged with the task of attracting inward investment and to those who have sustained their fragile growth figures through these harrowing times by excelling in the international marketing and the export of quality goods to the four corners of the world.  To these people, who are the cornerstone of our recovery, it is important we lend every assistance and support and what better way to encourage them on to greater things than to provide the economic climate conducive to their successful endeavours?In ratifying this treaty, Ireland is restoring its integrity and securing its position as a respected and proud nation willing to play its part in solving the economic problems facing the euro area and participating in the establishment of a fiscal policy capable of ensuring the European economy is never again subjected to such self-inflicted chaos.  While offering my unequivocal support for this Bill, it is incumbent upon me to call for a broadening of article 15 to make provision for direct financial assistance towards the recapitalisation of the banks, whereby the arrangement would be directly between the bank in question and the fund, with no Government involvement and no laying of the burden of bank debt of an innocent population who are neither responsible for the banking excesses nor the banking collapse.  These are the people to whom the banks have closed their doors and they should not bear sovereign responsibility for the recklessness of the financiers among us who took part in the orgy of great and self-enrichment.  Let the banks borrow the money to replenish their funds and let the banks pay it back.  These institutions offer no benevolence to those who fall on hard times, often incurred through the recklessness of the banking sector.  It is morally wrong to inflict responsibility for banking debt on the public.I understand the fiscal treaty and the ESM were not intended to deal with bank debt but we have heard calls for that since last week, and I call on everyone in the House to support the Taoiseach and Ministers in their endeavours to secure this policy change.  This single measure would make a huge contribution to removing banking debt from a repayments budget and would be a huge boost financially and morally to a compliant people eager to restore their economic integrity and prosperity.I listened to the tail end of Deputy Calleary's contribution and to Deputy Mathews's contribution.  Deputy Calleary mentioned the concept of fiscal union but he was mistaken.  We are not in a fiscal union; that is the problem with the eurozone.  A monetary union was created in response to the political will to achieve that but those involved did not have the courage of their convictions to go down the route of the fiscal unity which is necessary to have any stable currency.  I agree with Deputy Mathews that it is self-evident that if we want to solve the crisis at the heart of euro project, we need the ECB to act like a Central Bank and be a lender of last resort, to be the bank of default.  We must ensure the debts incurred in the banking sector are transferred from people to the ECB.  To achieve that we must have further centralisation of financial control.  This is crunch time for the euro project.  Do we believe as a people that fiscal union should be the end result of this project?  There would be a problem with our corporate tax rate and other areas but it is time for politicians across Europe to have some courage and to spell out clearly what they want.  For the euro project to survive in the long term, we need greater fiscal union.  It is will be interesting to see if the politicians across Europe have the ability to make this possible or whether project will unravel in the near future.

It provides an absolute guarantee of access to the ESM fund.The current situation in Europe revolves around Spain.  From media reports, it appears that any rescue fund for Spain is being done as a banking rescue package as distinct from a sovereign rescue package.  I would expect if such decoupling happens with Spain, any such solution should be retrofitted to Ireland, which has been the best boy in the class.  We have made the targets.Our sovereign banking debt of €63 billion is 40% of our GDP, seven times the education budget, four times the health budget and three times the social welfare budget.  If we break it down, there is €20 billion with the National Pensions Reserve Fund and €43 billion of sovereign debt.  The promissory note for IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank, makes up 72% of that €43 billion.  It is now around €30 billion.  If we can find a situation where any solution is retrofitted to Ireland and we can decouple the sovereign debt and the banking debt, particularly the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note, we will bring our general Government debt to GDP ratio to the order of 90%.  That ensures we become more sustainable and it will be easier to get back into the bond markets.  For me, our sovereignty is absolutely critical and I want to see us back in the bond markets.  For that, a key element is the level of debt of the sovereign in respect of the banks, none more so than IBRC.  Anything that happens for Spain should be retrofitted for Ireland to ensure we can get back into the bond markets as quickly as possible and that we can retain our independent sovereignty and say "goodbye" to the troika.I welcome the Bill and the vote of the people on the treaty.  That provides an absolute guarantee, although many things are happening externally.  Whatever is done for Spain, Ireland should receive the same benefit for banking debt.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I have followed most of the debate and perhaps we should be flattered by the fact the Labour Party is more concerned with attacking us than dealing with the substance of the ESM.  However, it is a mistake to guillotine the debate.  Had more time been provided, perhaps we would have moved beyond some of that posturing and discussed the substance of the proposition.Previous speakers welcomed the result of last week's referendum.  It is from their point of view a positive expression of our further integration within the European project and lays the foundation for stability.  Obviously, that is not a view I share.  I believe it sent out precisely the wrong message at this critical time.  It is no surprise the German Finance Minister, Mr. Schäuble, interpreted the result as a validation of European policies.  That was always going to be the case.  A bull-headed decision to stick with the politics and policies of austerity, which have so clearly and manifestly failed, is an even bigger mistake.  Following the result, the Government, in the person of no less than the Taoiseach, suggested it opened up a window of opportunity in respect of a deal on our bank debt.  Cold water, as I said earlier in the Chamber, has been poured on that but we are faced with the evolving situation in Spain.  It is incumbent on the Government and on our public administration at every level to ensure this situation is used, leveraged and seized in every way to work to the advantage of this State.  When an interest rate reduction was secured, it was on the coat tails of Greece, and it is not too far fetched to suggest any deal that might be struck with Spain will likely provide similar opportunity, but the Government must be proactive in this.  It is not sufficient to be almost the wallflower of the piece and to hope it will come right and Spain will save our bacon.We, in Sinn Féin, have made clear all along that we absolutely recognise the need for and support the creation of a permanent bailout fund.  For this to happen legally, the Article 136 amendment to the European treaties is necessary.  Last night, we voted in support of that amendment.  For those whoad nauseam lay the charge at the feet of my party that we are against everything and for nothing and we will not support anything emanating from Europe, I point to the fact we have explicitly supported a change to the treaties to make legally possible that permanent fund.  We did so even though the method of ratification of that amendment using the simplified revision procedure is not one we favour.  We also took that decision mindful of the fact a court challenge taken by Deputy Thomas Pringle will be heard later in the month, but such is the necessity for this fund to be established that we supported the amendment, despite the circumstantial factors and misgivings.We do not believe the ESM in its current form is fit for purpose.  Many outside the Chamber have questioned, for instance, whether the size of the fund, at €500 billion or €700 billion, is sufficient to deal with the impending banking crises.  However, leaving that significant issue aside, the main reason we are not prepared to support the ESM is it is posited on policies that have not just been failures but have been deeply damaging to the people and the economy of this State.  I refer to the failed policies of austerity coupled with unlimited banking bailouts.  Even a cursory glance at the state of the domestic economy, the low level of economic activity, the unemployment rate, forced emigration and the other issues with which we are familiar bears testimony to the fact so far the State and Europe have gotten it wrong.  There are flaws in the ESM but a window of opportunity remains to put things right and to secure amendments to the treaty.The Spanish Government and the Spanish system are asserting themselves proactively.  They are not behind the door in stating categorically the needs of their system, economy and people.  Our Government should follow suit.  We want the Government to table amendments at the forthcoming European Council aimed at improving the design of the fund.  I understand that yesterday the Taoiseach, while being evasive, conceded during Leaders' Questions there was the possibility of changes to the ESM treaty and we want the Government, on the people's behalf, to capitalise on that opportunity.  We want explicitly stated in the treaty the option of ESM funds being used for investment in jobs and growth.  This is very much in line with a broader and parallel debate that has unfolded since the French presidential election campaign, which in some respects was given a high profile by Francois Hollande who, along with others, made clear that austerity is not enough and a credible growth and investment strategy is needed.  Everyone seems to have come on board in this regard since the French election.  It is logical, not only from the narrow perspective of this State but also taking into account the rhythm at which the European debate has unfolded, that our Government can credibly seek to have this option of using ESM funds for growth and investment in jobs explicitly stated.There needs to be an option for direct ECB funding of the ESM to provide the necessary firewall to stabilise the euro and, crucially, to limit the liability of taxpayers and individual member states.  During the many years of crisis we have been in, a great deal has been said about the ECB and, at times, the bank has had a great deal to say.  There is a common understanding the role it has played during the crisis has not only been inadequate but, in some cases, very damaging.  We want the Government to address this matter head on and to argue in favour of the funding option from the ECB into the ESM.  We also want a clause ensuring the programme countries such as Ireland are not required to contribute to the fund while in a programme.  It seems bizarre that states in receipt of funding under a bailout programme or from this fund, when established, should also be asked to be contributors to the fund.  By a simple exercise of logic and common sense, one can see that this does not add up.  The capital liability of the State to the fund stands at €11 billion, with the expectation that more than €1 billion of this will be front-loaded this year, while we continue in bailout territory.  It is something to which the Government of one of the programme countries should never have agreed under any circumstance.Our fourth proposal is that a requirement for very strict stress tests and a write-down of toxic debt be a precondition for the use of ESM funds for the purposes of recapitalising banks, whether by way of direct recapitalisation or indirectly via loans to governments.  Our experience of pumping endless billions of euro into toxic institutions has not only been damaging to the broader economy and society but also has not, after all, solved the problems in the banking system.  The issue of toxic debt and the imperative of clearing the balance sheets must be met head on.  It is wholly unacceptable to my party that the ESM should be used, either directly or indirectly, to pump hundreds of billions more into clapped out banking institutions.Our final proposal is that the ESM treaty must provide for greater accountability both at European Union and member state level.  We are also calling for the removal of the immunity granted to the fund and its board members.These five proposals - the five deciding factors for my party - will form the substance of the amendments my colleagues and I intend to bring forward on Committee Stage.  At this point we cannot support the treaty or the Bill.  However, if these issues were to be resolved, we would revise our position accordingly.  The treaty is not a done deal; on the contrary, it is very much open to renegotiation and the Government has a duty to secure a permanent funding mechanism that is fit for purpose.  The objective of all of the exercises and efforts on the part of the Government and all of the hardship borne by citizens is, as we are told repeatedly, to balance the books and get the State match fit to return to the sovereign bond markets.  We are all aware that there is a strong likelihood that we will be looking to a second bailout in due course and that the source of that bailout funding will the ESM, as and when it comes to pass.  In that context, the question we must ask ourselves is whether there is any sense in sleepwalking from one bailout mechanism which keeps us in the doldrums, our bond yields high, our people out of work and so on into a second scenario which is essentially the same.  That does not add up.Every Member of the House and every person in the country wants us to be in a position, as Deputy Kieran O'Donnell said, to reclaim our economic sovereignty and re-enter the bond markets.  The question is how that can be done.  The evidence of recent years is that aggressive austerity and endless bank bailouts are not the remedy.  We need something different.  In establishing this permanent bailout mechanism we must be sure we get the diagnosis of our problem right and that the medicine, as contained within the ESM, will actually work.  It is Sinn Féin's view that the Bill is deeply flawed.  To reiterate, we absolutely support the need for an emergency fund, but we must get it right.  Therein lies the challenge for the Government.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I thank all of the Deputies who contributed to what has been a very constructive debate on the importance of this legislation and Ireland's ratification of the European Stability Mechanism treaty.  The treaty is essential not only to facilitate in the public interest the financial stability of the European Union by establishing the ESM but also to ensure Ireland will have access to a credible funding backdrop should it ever be needed.  That will be very important in terms of Ireland's re-entering the markets and leaving the EU-IMF programme of support.  However, this is most definitely not to say, as some Deputies suggested, that the Government is effectively accepting that Ireland is heading towards a second bailout.  Ensuring we have access to emergency funding as a safety net, were it to be required, is simply prudent management of the country's economy and aimed at creating stability in it.The debate has raised a number of issues, proposals and queries to which I will attempt to respond, beginning with Deputy Pearse Doherty's comments on the negotiations of the ESM treaty.  As I pointed out, the treaty set out in the Schedule to the Bill was signed by euro area member states on 2 February.  The original version of the treaty was signed on 11 July 2011 but was subsequently modified to incorporate decisions taken by the euro area Heads of State and Government on 21 July and 9 December 2011.  These changes are aimed at improving the effectiveness of the mechanism.  Ireland actively participated in the negotiations on the treaty at Euro Group, senior official and technical level right up to the time of the treaty's signature.  Moreover, we are actively participating in discussions on the guidelines for implementation of the treaty's provisions in order to ensure Ireland's best interests are represented and protected, as well as those of the euro area in its entirety.Several Deputies raised the question of direct recapitalisation of the banks.  We support proposals to allow European funds to recapitalise banks directly and will ensure that any such proposal advanced at EU level is in the best interests of the taxpayer.  It is too early to make an assessment as to what mechanism will ultimately be arrived at in regard to the potential recapitalisation of the Spanish banking sector or to speculate on how such mechanisms could, if implemented, be retrospectively utilised in Ireland.  It should be borne in mind that the recent concerns in the eurozone underpin the fact that the solutions to address the Spanish situation, as with the Irish situation, should be seen as part of an overall eurozone solution.  We will continue to review the proposals that emerge in regard to the recapitalisation of the Spanish banks in order to ascertain whether any of the proposed measures would be favourable for Ireland.  This would include potential alleviation of the cost to date of the recapitalisation of the Irish banks.  However, the ESM treaty does not provide for the direct recapitalisation of banks, rather it provides for sovereigns to acquire loans which may be used for that purpose.Ireland's share of the €80 billion of paid-in capital based on the contribution key will be just above €1.27 billion which we will pay in five equal instalments of €253 million.  Unlike the European financial stability facility, there is no stepping-out facility under the ESM when members enter a programme of support and there is no question of such being introduced at this stage.  Every member must, therefore, contribute its paid-in capital and there is no provision for exemptions.  A number of Deputies suggested that programme countries should be allowed to step out but this is a demand which needs to be examined very carefully because if one steps out, one loses voting rights on any decision to use the facility.  If one stays in as a full contributor, one has a full say on any use of funds used in Spain or elsewhere.In regard to the capital structure, I wish to state the following which should be clear to all.  The capital structure of the ESM has been put in place to support the borrowing and lending activities.  If or when the ESM engages in programme funding, it will borrow money on the international financial markets and lend it to the beneficiary ESM member state.  This is how the EFSF operates currently.  The capital of the ESM will not be paid out directly to programme countries but will only fall to be called upon in the event that member states borrowing from the ESM default or that the ESM incurs losses in ESM operations.I would like to pick up a number of other points, one of which was a kind of general demand by many Deputies in respect of growth and jobs.  The House is aware that since coming into office, the Government has been working on a range of measures to boost employment and help stimulate economic growth.  The first such measure announced by the Government was the jobs initiative launched in May 2011 which comprised a range of taxation and expenditure measures designed to help get people back to work.  Most recently, my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, launched the action plan for jobs 2012, a plan to rebuild the economy and create jobs through improving supports for job creation and businesses and removing barriers to employment creation across the economy.  Further work to stimulate economic growth and create employment is ongoing.  I would be happy to receive any proposals Deputies wish to submit in this regard.It should be noted that public infrastructure is funded primarily in two ways - Exchequer financing, which is the bulk of the funding and which will amount to approximately €17 billion over the next four years, and public private partnership funding for particular projects which are suited to the public private partnership approach and which provide value for money for the State.I am very keen that we look at how private sector funding to supplement our Exchequer investment could be attracted.  PPPs have been used in Ireland for more than a decade, mostly in schools and roads projects where they give value for money and are affordable.  The global credit crunch has had a significant impact on the PPP funding market which has, in turn, had significant negative consequences for the delivery of PPPs.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is actively exploring the potential to unlock additional moneys to supplement bank funding.  That Department under the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is also examining, in conjunction with other Departments, how new financial instruments and other EU support mechanisms could help us to access private funding to support investment, growth and job creation.A number of points have been made about the accountability of the ESM.  The ESM will have a board of governors consisting of the Finance Ministers of euro area member states with the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the ECB president as observers.  The ESM will also have a board of directors.  Each euro area country will appoint one director and one alternate director.  The board of governors will appoint a managing director responsible for the day-to-day management of the ESM.  The managing director will chair the board of directors.  The treaty includes provisions in Articles 28, 29 and 30 on internal-external audit and for a board of auditors which will also ensure accountability of the ESM.A number of Deputies, including Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty, spoke against the immunity provisions in the ESM treaty.  The privilege and immunities contained in the ESM treaty are similar to those in, for example, the treaties underpinning the United Nations and the IMF.  The purpose of diplomatic privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals or, indeed, in this case the ESM but to ensure the effective performance of the functions of the ESM.  In the case of the ESM, we believe the immunities are justified in the same way they are justified in the IMF or the UN.I reiterate my earlier words that it is now time for unity among euro area countries to ensure financial stability within the euro area.  Ireland must play its part and stand in solidarity with its fellow euro member states in the interests of this country and the stability of the euro area as a whole.  I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for indicating his party's support for the Bill and for Ireland's ratification of the ESM treaty.  The Government equally shares Deputy McGrath's hope that we will not have to avail of the ESM but it is important that we have that safety net or insurance policy in place to give certainty to the markets if required.  I would like Deputies to support the Bill.Sinn Féin's position is not logical.  Several Deputies, including Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, assured the House that they are very much in favour of a bailout fund and that they would like to see such a fund put in place but said they are not happy with some of the provisions in the Bill and that they will seek to amend them on Committee Stage.  They support the principle of the Bill, which is about establishing a bailout fund and which we have discussed on Second Stage but they will vote against it on Second Stage.  If one was to follow the logic of their position, they should support the Bill on Second Stage and seek to amend it on Committee Stage and call votes then.

This has been the practice for years, probably since national elections began in 1922. The closing of schools results in the loss of a working day for students and a considerable inconvenience for many working couples who must arrange for child care on that day.In the past there were few public buildings other than schools available in many communities to act as polling stations and it was understandable that these buildings would have to be used.  However, times have changed and, thankfully, we have a wide variety of public buildings in our communities which could be provided at a minimum of cost, if that is the issue.  Most small towns have a community hall, a parish hall, a community gym and other such buildings, which would be available and built with a modern finish to include facilities to ensure people with disabilities would have equal access.I call on the Minister to ask returning officers to work towards compiling an audit of their current polling stations and to seek expressions of interest from local communities and local authorities on the supply of alternative public buildings to act as polling stations.  In places where there are not suitable buildings, schools must still act as polling stations but I am convinced fewer primary schools would need to be closed for future elections and referenda if this proposal were considered.I ask the Minister to also request returning officers to supply information on the number of full-time unemployed who act as presiding officers and clerks at polling stations.  Are the people who carry out this work students or people who work in the schools that are closed on the day?  Voters are concerned when they arrive at polling booths and see many people double jobbing, given the number of highly skilled and educated persons who are unemployed.I urge the Minister to review this system within the next year.

I thank Deputy McLoughlin for raising this important issue which is of interest to all Members.One of the duties that fall on a returning officer at elections and referenda is to provide a sufficient number of polling stations at every polling place for which he or she is responsible.  Polling places normally will be a village or some other population centre.  The returning officer is required to locate polling stations as conveniently as possible for use by the electorate in each polling place.  Where, for one reason or another, a sufficient number of polling stations cannot be provided at the appointed polling place, the returning officer can arrange for polling stations at another location.In selecting locations, the traditional approach has been to use schools.  This is understandable given their central location in most communities, and especially so in rural areas over the years where a viable alternative to the local school would have been difficult to find.  In these challenging economic times, it is also worth noting that the use of any school for the taking of a poll or counting of votes is free of charge where the school is in receipt of a State grant.  Nonetheless, returning officers are not obliged to use schools.  In guidance issued by the Department, returning officers are advised that they may hire a hall or other premises if they consider this would be a more suitable arrangement in a particular case.  This is the case even if there is a school available for use in that area.Returning officers must be also mindful of the need to provide access to polling stations.  As the Deputy mentioned, they should be accessible for those with disabilities.  The returning officer is obliged, where practicable, to provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair use.  This has seen a shift to more modern buildings, including modernised schools, being used as polling stations where stricter building regulation requirements have addressed this issue.Returning officers have good knowledge and experience, built up over many years, on the location and use of suitable premises, and they review that on an ongoing basis.  In many cases, buildings other than schools are used.  They have generally ensured that when it comes to elections and referenda, one should have the opportunity to vote in a convenient location.As regards a special audit of current polling stations, what would be important is that the public representatives in a county, Dáil Deputies and others, would be in a position to identify directly with their returning officers where the issues arise locally.  If Deputy McLoughlin were to copy the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with the correspondence, if it was not being addressed to the satisfaction of the public, we would certainly deal with that issue.The final matter Deputy McLoughlin raised relates to who is employed and how they are selected.  I agree that there must be transparency and accountability and I would presume in the first instance a query to each returning officer would be the appropriate way to seek that information.  That information should be available.  The public has a right to expect that those who are unemployed, competent and qualified should be given priority if possible.

We should also consider the cost of child care since sometimes parents must try to accommodate arrangements at short notice, especially when two in the family are working.  It is important to consider polling at weekends.  This is what happens in most other European countries and worldwide.  Perhaps we could consider that arrangement for the future.  We could provide for elections or referendums on Saturdays or Sundays.  Some schools will have to be used but there are many community halls and various other fine facilities that could be availed of as well.  Polling at the weekend would eliminate that problem.Given the current climate it is vital to try to give as many people as possible employment.  I visited many polling booths during the last polling day to see many young people.  I believe more unemployed people could be employed on that day.  It would be an experience for them.  I realise returning officers will counter that they need people who have experience.  Some people involved have been retired for many years.  We should look after young people who are unemployed or seeking employment.  I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

I agree that priority must be given to unemployed people where possible.  Obviously, there must be some experienced staff but there is no reason young unemployed people or older unemployed people should not be able to do all the jobs done in any polling station in the country.

I have no wish to be disparaging towards the Minister of State but it is disappointing the Minister responsible is not present to address this matter.  I was appalled to read the recent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General which identified the shortcomings of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, its financial management, its planning functions and the management of the business of the board.  It was appalling to read of the lies those involved told the Department.  The authority bought a site for €431 million in the knowledge that its value was €220 million and without any analysis of the benefits or costs of the site.  There was no regard for other issues relating to certain planning decisions they made.  Two members of the board of the DDDA were directors of Anglo Irish Bank and another was a director of the Bank of Ireland.A parliamentary question asked of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as he was known then, requesting his views on any conflict of interest which would inhibit the Dublin Docklands Development Authority from making balanced planning decisions in the docklands area.  The question was put by Tony Gregory to the then Minister, Dick Roche, on 4 November 2004.  What could have been avoided had the matter been dealt with then?  Part of the answer stated: "It is difficult in a relatively small city to select people with the talent and the time and who are willing to give service to the public through these boards."  We know the type of service they have given to this city and country.  That is not to take from the current chairperson and the work she has been doing.The involvement of communities is important.  I was born in and I continue to live in one of the docklands communities, like Deputy Kevin Humphreys, although we are on opposite sides of the Liffey.  There have been problematic relations with the communities but there have been positive relations with the communities as well.  I hope and call for the residents and the communities to be involved, consulted and included in any replacement structures.  Will anything happen to the people who told such blatant lies?  I hope the idea of winding down the DDDA will not allow them off the hook.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I thank the Minister of State.  Like Deputy O'Sullivan, I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is not present.  I hope the Minister of State will carry back the message loud and clear.  I concur with what Deputy O'Sullivan has said but I will not concentrate on the negatives because too often we concentrate on the negatives.  In its early years the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was an important structure and made considerable changes in the docklands communities on the north and south sides.  Nevertheless, the authority has questions to answer.  I call on the Minister of State to bring this to the Cabinet and to discuss the need for a full debate on the matter.  A Topical Issue debate is too limited to cover what is an important issue for the city and the country.  This is an area of strategic importance for job development.I have serious concerns that we will miss out on many of the benefits.  Let us recall the early years when the DDDA was set up.  It had a social regeneration remit for the docklands area.  Previously, some 35% of all docklanders left school at 11 years of age, a total of 55% left school at 15 years of age, only 10% sat the leaving certificate and only 1% went on to further education.  Last year, some 60% of docklanders sat the leaving certificate examination.  This is a tangible result.  The docklands area is now close to the national average, only 2% below it, for attendance at third level education.  This is a credit to the teachers and the principals in the community but it is also a credit to the social regeneration bodies and the community councils involved in education initiatives to bring up the standards and results to the national average.  We must consider these and other positive aspects which have delivered during the existence of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  Unfortunately, it lost its way toward the end.Some 300 high-end job placements at the IFSC came through a placement service.  Along with the late Tony Gregory, I served on the community council responsible for this initiative.  We worked with the business sector and the placements came through the authority.  These people are now role models in their communities.  They have shown the value of education and that there are real jobs at the end of an educational process, which jobs pay good salaries.  I call on the Minister of State to take the message back to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, that he should not throw the baby out with the bath water.  This area can create jobs and it can be an engine for growth.  We must consider a mechanism for getting the docklands area in Dublin moving again.  There must be full community involvement and there must be real and tangible community gains.

I regret that the Minister is not present and I must stand in the bearna baol.  I will ensure the Deputies' views will be clearly and absolutely brought to the attention of the Minister and his Department.When Deputy Ross was a Senator, he and I sat on the Joint Committee on Transport, as it was known.  We called in representatives from CIE every month for several months to discuss an issue arising from an audit.  We found this to be a useful mechanism.  I accept totally that this is a short debate and I will not take up too much time with it.  We found that bringing in the relevant people before the committee and questioning the auditors was useful.  Accountability to an Oireachtas committee can be useful.  I am unsure whether that is a helpful suggestion but I will bring the request for a full debate to the attention of the Minister.The Minister, Deputy Hogan, announced last Thursday that the Government has decided to wind up the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA.  When making the announcement, the Minister emphasised the decision had been made following consideration of a special report prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the authority's 2011 annual report and financial statements, both of which were also published last Thursday.Elements of the special report make for grim reading, especially those relating to the authority's assessment and decision-making processes leading to its decision in 2006 to become involved in the purchase of the former Irish Glass Bottle site, an episode which has cost the authority €52 million, aside from the associated reputational damage.  While it is naturally welcome to note the annual report shows the authority having recorded a small surplus, its first in a number of years, the future financial outlook for the authority presents a very different picture.The reality emerging from both the 2011 financial statements and the special report is that the authority's financial position will inevitably remain very challenging in the short to medium term, given the economic downturn and stressed state of the property market from which the Dublin Docklands Development Authority has historically derived its main revenues.Taking all of these factors into account, the inescapable conclusion is that a stand-alone authority is no longer viable, financially or otherwise.  It is for these reasons that the Government decided that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority should be wound up at the end of a transitional period of up to 18 months.  A new executive board, chaired by the Dublin city manager, Mr. John Tierney, has been appointed for this transitional period, during which the authority will finalise some important ongoing business which needs to be brought to completion.  In parallel with this, the Government will finalise the appropriate arrangements for ensuring a continued, concerted focus on the Dublin docklands initiative.It is crucial to note in terms of the concerns raised by the Deputies that while the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is to be wound up, the Government remains fully committed to the ambitious and visionary docklands regeneration concept where many opportunities for renewal remain, both on the north and south sides of the River Liffey.  For this reason, the decision to wind up the authority should be seen not as an end of the regeneration story but the closing of one chapter which the Government is committed to ensuring will be followed by the opening of a new chapter in the rebirth of this core area of the capital city, as the Deputies correctly noted.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I acknowledge the positive aspects of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, including the educational scholarships and other supports provided for communities on the north and south sides of the River Liffey.  While the East Wall district received funding for a community centre, people in the North Wall district, the parish of St. Laurence O'Toole, would respond differently because their district was left without the school it was promised by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  On the other hand, the south side of the River Liffey was not left with the monstrous memorial to the excesses of the Celtic tiger on the North Wall quay, namely, the building that was intended to house Anglo Irish Bank's headquarters.  The docklands community had to fight hard for everything it received.I note the Minister of State did not once refer to the local communities which made up the docklands area, which took second place to speculators and developers at times.  Although there are seven places for community representatives on the council, only five of them have been filled as two long-serving community members have not been reappointed.  What is the position on these appointments?  Representatives of the south side hold three of the five community places, while the north side has only two representatives.  The decision to allocate only one place for a community representative on the board must be addressed.  I ask the Minister of State to bring these issues to the attention of the Minister.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	188	While I welcome the Minister of State's statement that further regeneration will be considered, regeneration without social inclusion is meaningless for local communities.  Our communities must be reinvigorated and job opportunities provided in local areas.  Initiatives taken in the docklands area have been rolled out throughout the city.  The senior citizens forum, for example, which started on the south and north sides of the River Liffey has expanded throughout Dublin and plays a positive role.The docklands area is important not only to the capital but also the country.  Growth will come to the area because new companies want to locate in it.  We must ensure young people in the area are trained and educated to be able to avail of the opportunities that will arise in the area.  This will only be made possible through community involvement which requires us to listen to and invest in the community.  The best investment that can be made in the docklands area is in education.  It is vital that we have strong community involvement and a focus on education and social regeneration.  We must not lose this focus as a result of the abolition of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.

I note also the statistics provided in this regard.  I assure Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that her comments on the importance of community representation in filling the vacancies on the council will be brought to the attention of the Minister.I fully understand the decision to wind up the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is a critical one and concur with the Deputies on the importance of placing community involvement and regeneration at the heart of this process.  This will make the Dublin docklands a living community and ensure good interaction between those who live and work in the area.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Following the announcement of cuts to community employment schemes in the budget, a campaign against the proposed cuts was launched by supervisors and participants in the schemes and trade unions.  The Minister gave a commitment to complete a review of community employment schemes by the end of March and stated on a number of occasions that individual schemes would not close and that additional funding would be provided for those schemes which required it.  According to SIPTU and those involved in community employment schemes, additional funding is not being provided and projects are not being given the funding they need to remain open.The 60% cut in the funding available for education, training and materials, from €1,500 to €500, has major implications for community employment schemes.  I understand it may be possible for participants to source a further €500, but we do not have much information in this regard.  Six months after the budget announcements and nearly three months after the review was to be completed - I am informed it has been completed - its findings have not seen the light of day.Community employment schemes must also contend with the troika sponsored review of labour activation measures.  To date, there has not been significant engagement with community employment schemes or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The indications are that the financial review has not shown that the Government cuts can be achieved because there is little in the schemes that can be cut.  Will schemes be closed if they are considered unviable?The decision to slash funding available for education, training and materials has killed off the chance of progression or involvement in education or training for participants in community employment schemes.  This was one of the main benefits of such schemes.We are informed that the troika review includes a proposal that participation in community employment schemes be restricted to one year, with the exception of persons with a disability where participation should be restricted to two years and persons engaged in drug rehabilitation where participation should be limited to three years.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether this recommendation has been made?The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, must come clean and state clearly, as she promised to do, what are the contents of the financial report.  When will we have sight of the report and when will Deputies be able to debate it?  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that Government representatives will engage with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on this matter?

I will respond on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection who is, unfortunately, not present.  I will bring the Deputy's views to her attention.The financial review of community employment schemes is very near to completion.  The review has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes and the Department.  Given the volume and breadth of the data being returned, the review has taken longer to complete than originally envisaged.  This has allowed more time for schemes to engage with local officials in the finalisation of their respective budgets and the Department to bring forward improvements to the overall operation of the community employment programme which will improve the budgetary position for schemes.As the Deputy will appreciate, the review is of interest and importance to the many individuals involved.  Accordingly, the Minister is not in a position to provide an outline of its content prior to its publication.  However, it is important to note that savings can be made in the operation of community employment schemes.Owing to the current economic circumstances, the Department has had to find significant savings in the budget for 2012.  However, the allowance grants for supervisors are unchanged, as are working hours for staff employed under community employment schemes.  There will also be no decrease in the number of community employment scheme places allocated in 2012.While no final allocations of materials and training grants have been made pending completion of the financial review, the existing commitment to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply.  The Department is committed to supporting community employment scheme participants and sponsors in continuing the valuable contribution the programme makes to individuals and communities.The findings of the separate labour market activation schemes policy review will also inform the Department's decisions on the community employment programme.  The Minister will ensure stakeholders will be able to contribute and respond to the findings of the review.  I take on board the Deputy's point with regard to SIPTU and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I welcome the commitment given by the Minister of State on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection that there will be no decrease in the number of community employment places allocated in 2012.  That is important because most of those schemes provide vital services.  The delay in the report is causing problems and is unacceptable.  Despite the fact there is a commitment to financial support to keep schemes going, schemes are running into trouble and it is important we have the opportunity to debate the report.The Minister of State has indicated the Department will engage with the unions on the process.  They certainly have complained about it.  I ask him and the Minister to do all they can to ensure the survival of the mainstream community employment schemes.  Surely it is better to get people to do work that is socially useful and to receive training at the same time during a recession, enabling them to move back into employment, rather than passing the time away.There is a particular problem with the drugs rehabilitation projects in inner city areas.  Although I do not represent an inner city area, people from those areas have come to us about these problems.  I would like the Minister of State to bring that information back to the Minister for Social Protection and ensure that is protected.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The job losses in Cork represent a quarter of the Pfizer jobs force in the county.  Our first thoughts must be with the workers who are displaced.  It is incumbent on us and on the Government in particular to ensure those workers get the best possible deal.  They are going out into one of the worst labour markets in the history of the country.  It will be very difficult for those generally well paid workers to gain alternative employment, especially in this country.The fact Pfizer has decided to reduce its workforce in Cork by one quarter is pretty ominous for a number of reasons.  First, I am very familiar with the Pfizer company because it has a major plant in my constituency which has been one of the mainstays of employment in the mid-west for decades.  It is a very progressive company that usually does not let people go, and its pay and conditions are among the best in the industry in Ireland.  Second, most of the jobs going in Cork are high-end jobs, involving highly educated and skilled people.  This is not the traditional fall-out where some manufacturing company moves to a cheaper jurisdiction, as happened with part of the Dell plant in Limerick.  Third, the job losses in Cork are inextricably linked with the fact that the patent on Lipitor has expired.  The Minister will be aware this phenomenon will have a devastating impact on employment in the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland, which employs more than 25,000 people in well-paid jobs.  This is the start of a trend as quite a number of patents are due to expire which will have a devastating impact on employment in the pharmaceutical industry.The Minister will also be aware of newspaper reports on the decision of Atlantic Homecare to apply for examinership.  The company has made a proposal to the High Court involving a restructuring which will lead to the loss of a certain number of jobs.  We all hope the application to the High Court will be successful, an accommodation with creditors will be reached, and the job losses will stop at what has been announced.  However, I thought it was very significant that in the explanation of its decision, the company emphasised the fact it was caught by unavailability of legislation to deal with upward-only rent reviews that had been historically agreed.In the recent general election, the current Government parties faithfully promised that upward-only rent reviews, be they present, past or future, would be legislated out of existence.  They said they had legal advice to this effect.  Since the election, some of the victims of upward-only rent reviews have got legal advice of their own which is very compelling.  I would love to see the Government's legal advice and I would particularly like to see the advice the Labour Party claimed it had available before the election.Atlantic Homecare joins a long list of companies - Xtra-vision, Golden Discs and Arnotts, to name but a few - that have thrown people out of the workforce and onto the industrial scrapheap because they were unable to renegotiate upward-only rent review clauses that had been agreed before the recent legislation that banned such rent from that date.  Has the Government been considering the impact on employment of the lack of a remedy for upward-only rent reviews?  Has it any proposals to deal with the situation?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I thank the Deputy for raising these matters.  The expiry of the patent on products manufactured by Pfizer has, unfortunately, resulted in the announcement of the loss of 177 positions in Cork this week.  My thoughts are, obviously, with the workers and their families.  All the applicable supports of the State will be made available to the workers if they are needed.I have spoken to the company about the situation.  These two quality plants in Cork will still employ more than 500 people and will be adapting to achieve operational excellence and deliver competitive manufacturing for the company.  The company has also confirmed Ireland remains a key strategic location.  Factoring in this decision, Pfizer will still employ almost 4,000 people in Ireland across eight locations.  In September 2011, the company announced a €145 million investment in its Grange Castle site to develop a new site to expand the Irish manufacturing process for an invasive pneumococcal vaccine.The Deputy is correct that the expiry of patents is a problem for a number of companies.  In the case of Pfizer, Lipitor was the biggest selling drug in the world by a factor of two.  Virtually all of the API was in Cork, as was most of the formulation.  Having other investments in the pipeline, Pfizer is itself adapting to the challenges of products going off patent.  IDA Ireland has been working for many years to minimise the threat to jobs posed by products coming off patent and has been seeking to diversify Ireland's pharmaceutical base.  Its strategy has been to win leading company investment and to diversify the breadth of operations over multi-product sites, including associated services and development of new compounds.  Ireland has been enormously successful in attracting eight of the major global players and the world's number one biotechnology company to manufacture from Ireland.   IDA Ireland has focused, in particular, on biopharmaceuticals, which represent the next wave of opportunity in the industry, and has been very successful in attracting leading companies, with the result that Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of pharmaceutical products.I have been informed by IDA Ireland that employment in their client companies is surveyed annually by Forfás in its annual employment survey.  Between 2010 and 2011 net employment in IDA client companies in the pharmaceutical and healthcare services sector increased by approximately 1,400.  This is in the context of an overall net gain in employment of 6,118 in 2011.  In the first six months of 2012 alone, Ireland has won five major investments in the pharma and biopharma sectors with the capacity to create 1,175 new jobs.  We are successfully anticipating the changes that are happening in this sector, as some products come to the end of their protected life and move on to others.IDA Ireland has assured me that it will continue to seek to win new investments in the pharmaceutical industry and to win large scale investments in product development and capability to enable its existing client companies take on new product mandates.The examinership at Atlantic Homecare is disappointing and reflects the difficulties facing some retail operators, particularly those with exposure to the construction sector.  My thoughts are with the workers whose jobs are under threat at Atlantic Homecare.  As has been publicly stated, the 13 store chain has been losing money for the last five years, with losses of €11 million last year.  The company has cited high rents as a factor and it is to be hoped this will be addressed in the course of the examinership.As Deputy O'Dea pointed out, the examinership process will last several months and the stores will continue to trade as usual during the process.  The examiner will be preparing a plan for the survival of the business.  The company is engaging with the trade union representing staff interests.Deputy O'Dea raised this issue on previous occasions.  He knows the legal advice to the Government is that the hoped for removal of upward only rent provisions from existing contracts could not be implemented by Government.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I am glad the Minister and IDA Ireland are alive to the danger to employment in the pharmaceutical industry from patents expiring.  A number of patents are due to expire in the next two years.  This presents a real challenge to maintaining employment in the pharmaceutical industry which, as the Minister knows, is a source of lucrative employment, providing more than 25,000 well-paid jobs.  It is also one of the areas the Government has targeted to build and increase employment in the country.With regard to Atlantic Homecare, the Minister said the company has cited high rents as a factor and that he hopes this will be addressed in the course of the examinership.  There is no doubt that it will be addressed in the course of the examinership.  However, it is because of high rents that the examinership has had to take place, and the examinership has resulted in the loss of jobs.  That is the reality.The Minister may be aware that Atlantic Homecare was acquired by the Grafton Group, which is continuing to trade very profitably.  It is a major deficiency in company law that if a company or group acquires another company, the main group can continue to trade profitably while choosing to put one of its units into examinership.  That is a deficiency in company law that should be looked at by the Minister and the Government in the context of the forthcoming Companies Bill.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The situation is not quite as the Deputy projects.  Rent is certainly cited as a factor in the examinership of Atlantic Homecare but the big factor is the collapse in revenue.  That is clearly stated by the company, and is not untypical of many companies closely connected to the construction sector.Deputy O'Dea raises a fundamental point of company law.  To move from a system that allows the establishment of  independent companies with separate businesses while having the protection of limited liability would be a substantial departure in company policy.  A change of such major significance would have to be considered long and hard.  We know that serial entrepreneurs set up different companies and are often very successful.  The ability to establish companies and to have the protection of limited liability is something we give to entrepreneurs.  I would not lightly enter into a commitment to accept the Deputy's point.  However, I will have my officials look at the suggestion, since the Deputy is putting it forward.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	200	Ireland has suffered an enormous dislocation of employment as a result of the deep financial crisis and serious policy failures of the previous Government.  In the three years prior to the Government taking office, over 300,000 jobs were lost.  This scale of job loss cannot be reversed overnight.This employment crisis is the central challenge facing Government.  In response, the Government has developed the Action Plan for Jobs as a cross-Government response with timelines and milestones.  This is the first in an annual process.  We have challenges across a broad range of areas, for example in competitiveness, access to finance and reskilling.  All of these are being addressed.  It will take time to reverse the trends but I believe the new measures being adopted are putting us on the right track.  We are making progress on the delivery of these actions and I am encouraged by the number of new job announcements which have been made since the beginning of this year, including 44 IDA announcements to the end of May with the potential to create in excess of 5,000 jobs.The jobs crisis is reflected in the unemployment data which show that 60.6% of those who are unemployed have been out of work for 12 months or longer.  This compares to 55% at the end of 2010.  The percentage of people under 25 years of age who are unemployed is 29%, compared to 28% a year ago.Tackling unemployment and supporting job creation are the key challenges facing Government.  I work with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and other ministerial colleagues on an ongoing basis at Government and Cabinet committee level as we address these challenges.  Deputy Burton's Pathways to Work initiative complements the work of the Action Plan for Jobs.The objective of the action plan is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs in the economy by 2016, while the aim of Pathways to Work is to help ensure that as many of those jobs as possible are filled by people on the live register.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	201	Lack of employment is one of the greatest problems facing the Irish economy and Irish society.  It is something of a joke that we are discussing this problem at 7.30 p.m. on a Thursday, when the media have departed.  This is the second time in a row this has happened.  I will not engage in this sort of farce again.  This is the last time I will put questions to the Minister on such an important topic at 7.30 p.m. on a Thursday.The Minister referred to the record of the previous Government and said 300,000 jobs were lost during its last three years.  He conveniently overlooks the fact that when the previous Government left office there were 750,000 more people at work than when it took office.  Despite the promises made during last year's general election campaign, we have seen a steady decrease in employment, a steady increase in unemployment and a significant increase in emigration.Does the Minister agree that in the year before the Government took office unemployment stood at 13.5% and that it is now up to 14.8%?  While that gives the appearance of stabilising, will he agree that the pattern of unemployment is significantly different?  As the Minister said, 60% of those who are unemployed have been out of work for more than a year, and 40% of those who are out of work have been out of work for more than two years.  Unemployment among people under 25 has reached one in three.  This was considered a major crisis in France during the recent presidential election campaign.  The figure in Britain is one in five and it is considered such a major crisis in that country that a Minister has been appointed specifically for that area.  It is one in three in this country.  Does the Minister agree we have a massive employment crisis on our hands in this country and one that has not improved one iota in the past 15 months when he has been in office?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I fully agree that the biggest crisis we face as a nation is the employment crisis.  I do not dispute that.To be honest, I had no role in the scheduling of the timing of Question Time.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I know.  I was not suggesting the Minister had.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I take them at whatever is the appointed time.  We are undertaking a difficult transformation in the economy.  That is the truth of the matter.  We built a property bubble that was unsustainable.  Part of it meant the construction sector grew well beyond what was sustainable in the long term.  The reason we have seen the huge rise in unemployment is the wipe-out of the construction sector.  From memory, approximately 160,000 jobs were lost in that sector alone.  It is many of those male workers who are finding it very difficult to reintegrate into the workforce.  That dislocation is what is driving the pattern to which the Deputy referred, the high proportion of people who are out of work in the long term.The response must be twofold, one of which I am primarily responsible for, namely, getting enterprises to create more employment.  We are beginning to see positive signs in terms of investment from foreign companies.  We are also seeing good signs in terms of start-ups, but we have real problems, as the Deputy himself acknowledged, in banking and elsewhere in getting enterprise back on its feet.  We have significantly improved our competitiveness and we are seeing exports recover.  We are seeing the start of the transformation but I admit that it is taking time to reverse the trends.  It will be a significant challenge.The other dimension is the one on which the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is working, namely, helping people who have been displaced to transfer to new skills with Springboard, and to get the support of activation work experience, JobBridge and other schemes to help them re-enter the market.  I do not understate the challenge by any means but the Government's approach in having an annual jobs plan, committing to change year-in and year-out and holding ourselves to targets is the best way to address those problems.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The procurement innovation group's report and the accompanying 10 Step Guide to Smart Procurement and SME Access to Public Contracts were both published in July 2009.  Some of the recommendations were incorporated subsequently into the Department of Finance's current guidelines to public contracting authorities which are designed to ensure tendering processes operate in a manner that facilitates increased participation by SMEs.  These include the lowering, from €50,000 to €25,000, of the estimated value of contracts to be advertised on the e-tenders website, the splitting of larger contracts into lots, and the communication by contracting authorities of future procurement plans by issuing prior information notices.  None the less, it is clear that more effort must be made to ensure the guidelines are applied by procurement officers in contracting authorities, and work is under way to ensure this is happening.The action plan for jobs contains a number of specific measures designed to facilitate an increase in SME participation in the tendering process, and my Department is working collaboratively with key players such as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the National Procurement Service, NPS, Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland to deliver the commitments as set out in the action plan.In addition, the Department chairs a steering group bringing together the main stakeholders in this area.  Under the aegis of the steering group, Enterprise Ireland, the National Procurement Service and InterTradeIreland are working on a number of initiatives to boost SME participation in the public procurement process, including, for example, the establishment by Enterprise Ireland of clusters of SMEs to work with contracting authorities develop innovative supply chain solutions.  The aim is to establish a level playing field in the area of public procurement to facilitate increased SME participation.

They show there are 18,000 fewer people in the workforce in the first quarter of this year compared with the last quarter of 2012.  They also show an increase in unemployment to 14.8%.  That is despite the fact approximately 70,000 people are emigrating these shores annually.Today marks the 450th day in government for the Minister, and that is his record.  It is a damning one in terms of the lack of work that has been done on job creation.  Public procurement is directly related to job creation.  Yet again, this country has one of the worst records in Europe on public procurement.  The report to which reference was made in the question has been published since 2009 and by all appearances it has been gathering dust on shelves since then.  A total of 22.8% of contracts awarded by the State were to companies outside the State.  The European average is 3.4%.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Could I have a question from the Deputy?

It is a scandal at a time of severe economic recession that so much public funding is going abroad.  We have seen how Balfour Beatty won the Bord Gáis contract.  Will the same thing happen with the children's hospital?  The time for talking is over.  Will the Minister of State set targets for the agencies under his remit for public procurement delivery within the State?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Specifically on the issue of public procurement, I refer the Deputy to the action plan for jobs.  Actions 3.49 to 3.54, inclusive, relate to pre-qualification criteria, the establishment of a mechanism to allow SMEs to engage with contracting authorities on issues of concern, the establishment by Enterprise Ireland of advisers and mentors to help client companies to prepare better public procurement opportunities, encouraging more SMEs to register on the Government's e-tenders website to enable forthcoming procurement opportunities to be brought to their attention, encouraging a more flexible approach to tendering by focusing on innovative solutions to procurement needs rather than specific products or services, and identifying a number of key procurement projects that will provide subcontracting and supply chain opportunities for SMEs.In terms of specific actions, a round table discussion on the advantages of innovative procurement through the procurement innovation initiative organised by the Department took place on 2 April 2012.  It was attended by senior procurement officials in public bodies and by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  A number of SMEs presented examples of innovative solutions they are already providing to public bodies.  Some public bodies have indicated specific, upcoming procurement projects that would be suitable for the procurement innovation initiative.  They included the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, the Department of Defence, the Health Service Executive, HSE, An Post and the ESB.  Given the time constraints I will refer the Deputy to the specific actions in that regard.InterTradeIreland also organised popular "Go-2-Tender" training workshops.  The workshops give SMEs the skills to tender successfully for public sector contracts on an all-island basis.  Three were held in the past three months, involving more than 70 SMEs, including one held in Cork.  A further three workshops are due to be held in Enniskillen, Armagh and Waterford before the end of July.  An advanced "Go-2-Tender" workshop was held in April-May and another is planned for later this year.  There is constant engagement by Enterprise Ireland with contracting authorities to raise awareness of innovative ideas and capabilities of SMEs to provide innovative solutions to their specific needs.  We have moved well beyond the 2009 report, and the action plan for jobs has clear action deliverables in terms of public procurement.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I have met the representatives of small businesses in north Dublin, including Drumcondra and Clontarf, and recently held a public meeting with small businesses across the north side to discuss the action plan for jobs.  The concerns raised included access to finance, competitiveness of costs, prompt payments, VAT thresholds, enterprise supports, regulatory burdens, employer costs and sectoral opportunities.  The action plan for jobs addresses many of these concerns with specific initiatives.  They are in the course of implementation and will benefit small businesses on the north side of Dublin.A key measure in the action plan for jobs is to facilitate the development by Dublin City University, DCU, of the vacant former Enterprise Ireland site in Glasnevin into an internationally recognised innovation campus, involving a partnership of education and research institutions, enterprises and the semi-State sector.  Its focus will be on research active clean tech firms.  The agencies under my Department are also rolling out their plans of support for businesses on the north side of Dublin.  Enterprise Ireland is actively promoting entrepreneurship in Dublin and provides a range of enterprise programmes and other initiatives for approximately 500 companies on the north side to ensure emerging technologies and business ideas with export potential are supported to become a commercial reality.In February Enterprise Ireland launched a new community enterprise centre programme for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in community enterprise centres funded by the agency.  Enterprise Ireland is funding community enterprise centres on the north side of Dublin, two of which are based in Coolock and Darndale.  The Dublin City Enterprise Board and Fingal County Enterprise Board support enterprise development and job creation throughout the north side of Dublin through the provision of direct and indirect assistance for small business.  Hundreds of companies will benefit from start-up grants, mentoring and management development training.We are commencing work on the action plan for jobs 2013 and will welcome submissions from business groups on the north side of Dublin.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Is the Minister aware of the mass unemployment problem on the north side of Dublin?  In some areas the level of youth unemployment is 30% and there is significant emigration.  Does the Minister accept that supporting small businesses plays a key role in job creation?  If unemployed persons found jobs at the average industrial wage, total earnings would amount to approximately €18 billion.  Does the Minister accept that not enough attention is being given to this issue?  Some 436,700 people signed on in May.  Spending €1 billion on infrastructure would lead to the creation of approximately 10,000 jobs.  Has the Minister considered proposals in this regard?  Has he considered the role played by the semi-State sector, given the fact that its considerable borrowing power offers significant job creation potential?  We can grow our way out of this problem.  Many talented individuals are involved in small businesses.  With a little help, they could each create three to eight jobs.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I do not accept that the needs of small business are not receiving sufficient attention.  In my Department the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, specialises in supporting small businesses and has been active in that regard.  This is not to say the problems have been solved.  Far from it, but we have access to finance and a micro-finance initiative for small businesses is being worked on, as is the loan guarantee scheme.  We have tendered for a development fund which we will use for slightly larger companies which are seeking to expand.  We are examining the spectrum of needs of small businesses with a view to making it easier to start up and survive.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Sherlock, outlined, we are seeking to make it easier for small businesses to access the public procurement process.Like Deputy Finian McGrath, we recognise that the bulk of jobs will be created by smaller businesses, to which end we need to support them.  However, some of the issues he raised go well beyond my brief.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has established an infrastructural fund amounting to €1 billion to support opportunities in that respect.  Last week NAMA stated its belief that, as a State company of a different sort, it would invest €2 billion in practical infrastructural projects during the coming years.  Attention is being paid to infrastructural requirements and the need to find off-balance sheet initiatives to leverage activity in that regard.  That is the thinking behind NewERA and much of the work being done by the Ministers, Deputies Brendan Howlin and Michael Noonan.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	239	The action plan for jobs 2012 which was published on 13 February includes an extensive range of measures across government that will help to reduce costs for businesses and support job creation, including in each of the areas identified by the Deputy.  For example, the majority of local authorities have reduced or frozen their annual rates of valuation at 2011 levels, NAMA is taking action to place downward pressure on rents in its property portfolio, a series of actions is aimed at reducing energy costs and improving energy efficiency for enterprises and downward pressure will be put on insurance costs through the enactment of the legal services Bill.In my area of responsibility I have taken a number of specific actions that are directly aimed at improving the competitiveness of enterprises.  These include the reform of the joint labour committee-registered employment agreement system which is before the House.  A number of initiatives are being implemented or being progressed to improve access to finance.  My Department has reduced business burdens within its areas of responsibility by more than 24%, which will yield potential savings of €206 million per annum for business.  Tangible progress is also being made in the reform of the State's employment rights and industrial relations structures, which will result in a more cost effective and swifter service for workers and employers.  The implementation of all of these measures will help to improve our international competitiveness further.The Government's progress in improving Ireland's competitiveness is reflected in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook rankings which were published last week.  Ireland has reversed the downward trend of recent years and improved four places in the rankings to 20th overall and eighth out of the 24 EU countries benchmarked.  Of course, there are still many issues to be addressed and the Government will continue to focus on these through the action plan for jobs process.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	240	Does the Minister agree that, despite the recent survey findings, many of the improvements in competitiveness have been cyclical rather than structural?  For example, unique among the countries of Europe, Ireland has a major trading relationship with the United Kingdom and the United States.  The reduction in the value of the euro against sterling and the dollar has helped to improve Ireland's competitiveness.  In so far as structural issues are concerned, being areas within the Government's control, what has the Government done to reduce commercial rates?  Regardless of which side of the House one is on, every Deputy knows of cases in which small businesses are being forced out of existence by the requirement to pay commercial rates.  It is not sufficient to claim that some local authorities have frozen their rates.  Some businesses are struggling.  They are on the margins and cannot afford to pay commercial rates.  Rates are not a progressive form of taxation, in that one has to pay regardless of whether one is making a profit.The Government has abandoned all attempts to fulfil its election promise on the issue of upward-only rent reviews.  It is not enough to say there is conflicting legal advice, throw one's hands in the air and walk away.  Earlier, we were discussing the situation with Atlantic Homecare which is being driven into examinership due to high rents which predate the Government's recent legislation.  There appears to be runaway inflation in certain areas, for example health insurance, which are directly under the Government's control.  The Minister referred to the Legal Services Regulation Bill which I believe will increase rather than reduce costs.  This, however, is not the time to debate that Bill.  The Minister will be aware that several years ago, the then Government radically changed the insurance system which drove down costs.  Some of these costs, particularly in public liability, are beginning to creep up again.  What are the Government's proposals in this regard?  Will the Minister confirm the Government has no proposal to increase the element of energy costs that come under its control?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The Deputy has raised several issues that are not my direct responsibility.  Accordingly, I cannot give him comprehensive answers on these and would advise him to table questions to the relevant Ministers.The ESB is undergoing a cost-reduction programme of 20% in its cost base.  The valuation (amendment) Bill will be introduced to deal with commercial rates as has the legal services Bill.  We have achieved cost competitiveness improvements that are not cyclical.  The 20% improvement in unit wage cost compared to the rest of the eurozone is not a cyclical factor but a genuine change.  The Minister for Finance has reduced PRSI so that it is now cheaper for employers to take on employees.  We have reduced the tax burden, particularly targeting small businesses to enable them to take on people on job assist and using research and development.  There have been many changes to make it easier and cheaper to help drive businesses to success.  These are the issues we seek to address.  The Deputy is entitled to table parliamentary questions to other Ministers in their specific areas which I am not competent to fully answer.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The main reduction in costs seems to be unit labour costs concentrated among the lower paid, which is what the industrial relations Bill is about.  That is no proud boast.The Minister claims tax has been reduced on employment initiatives.  Tax in this area has increased appreciably over the past year which has increased the cost of employment.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Could the Deputy put a question because he is over time?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Deputy O'Dea is simply wrong.  The Government did not increase any of the employment related costs, neither income tax nor PRSI.  In fact, it reduced PRSI and took people out of the universal social charge.  We actually reduced the costs on employment directly in the last budget.It was the previous Administration that did what the Deputy has just claimed.  Action is being taken against constrained resource time.  It is not true that wage costs are focused on the lower paid.  The unit wage cost improvement of 20% is on the aggregate of wages across all scales.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I acknowledge that many small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are functioning in a very difficult operating environment at present.  Some costs, such as fuel and energy prices, are primarily driven by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  The Government has not introduced any tax increases.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	250	There has been no tax increase for business since we took office.The Government's approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to SMEs.The action plan for jobs includes several measures to improve supports for SMEs.  For example, a small business division in Enterprise Ireland is being established for the first time.  The county and city enterprise boards are being restructured to create an enhanced national enterprise support model for small businesses at local level.  The aim of the new model is to ensure a seamless system of support for indigenous enterprise and entrepreneurs.  Access to credit is being addressed through the introduction of the micro-finance loan fund and the temporary partial guarantee scheme, which will make it easier for viable small and medium businesses to access finance.  Improved tax incentives have been introduced for small business such as the employer's PRSI incentive scheme and Revenue's job assist which provide for significant cost savings for employers which take on extra staff and an improvement in the seed capital scheme for new start-ups.We are actively working to facilitate more SMEs to compete for public procurement opportunities.  There is an increased emphasis on mentoring of SMEs in the action plan and funding has been provided to support a new management development networks programme.  Other supports which help companies to reduce their costs through greater energy efficiency are available from Electric Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has established a new potential exporters division to deliver a wide range of initiatives focused on helping companies to export to international markets.  The Finance Act extended corporation tax exemption for start-up companies until the end of 2014 and provided for improvements in the research and development tax credit.The Government will report on the delivery of these measures in its quarterly progress reports on the action plan for jobs.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	251	The Minister of State is a small businessman as I am myself.  There is no point in codding ourselves reading out those figures and so-called facts.  There have been tax increases.  VAT went up which was a disastrous move.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	252	VAT has come down.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	253	The former Minister for Finance, God rest him, put it up by 0.5% but it was an utter failure and he had to reduce it after six months.  Putting it up by 2% was a disaster.  Tax credits and allowances were also reduced.The Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures today confirm what everyone knows – businesses are closing down due to many factors such as lack of credit, high rates and so forth.  Nothing is being done for small businesses.  The Minister earlier referred to the ESB helping competitiveness.  The energy regulator has given price increase after increase to the ESB and Bord Gáis.  The Government should insist there are no more increases in energy costs and drive them downwards instead.  I have been in business 30 years and know of many similar businesses, some even in business for 50 years, that are going to the wall.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	254	The Deputy should put his question.

There are too many policies and not enough that are pro-small business.  We need to encourage existing small businesses to take on extra workers which could ultimately take 300,000 or 400,000 off the live register.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	256	Access to credit is an important factor for this sector.  The temporary partial loan guarantee should assist this.  It was based on the report by John Trethowan's Credit Review Office.  However, it is not just about giving money to businesses.  Many of them that were viable-----
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	257	They are not able to get credit.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	258	The point is that savings of up to €1 billion a month are made in the domestic economy and we must encourage people to buy Irish goods.The Deputy referred to the retail sector.  I see many manufacturing and high-tech companies in my job which are doing very well.  There are already 1.8 million working in this economy.  The Government's objective is to make it one of the best economies in which to establish, grow and develop a business.  Even in good times there was pressure on small companies.There are rights and responsibilities when it comes to loan applications.  There is a simplification process for going through the procedure.  Equally, it is not just about getting credit facilities.  Likewise, it is important to get a bank that is fit for purpose.  The Government has recapitalised the banks.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, are meeting with AIB and Bank of Ireland to deal with the €3.5 billion ring-fenced by them both to assist growth in the indigenous industry and enterprise sector.Despite what the Deputy says, up to €15 billion worth of goods will be exported by indigenous companies this year.  There are challenges and no one is denying that fact.  Business, however, is never simple.  The motto in business is "No problem, no business" which the Deputy should know himself.  There will always be problems in business from an efficiency and management point of view.  It is not just a case of a quick-fix solution of the banks throwing money at businesses to make them viable.  We have become far more cost competitive and everyone is getting more value for money in every sense.The market is improving and I have seen signs of it in the job I do daily.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	259	We are moving to ordinary questions.  For the information of Members, six minutes are allocated for each of these, with two minutes for the Minister's initial reply and four minutes allocated for supplementary questioning, with a maximum of one minute allocated for asking each question.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	260	In accordance with national and EU legislation, my Department is responsible for issuing licenses for exports of dual use items outside the EU, certain military products both within and outside the EU and for implementing EU trade sanctions.  The first report on the operation of the Control of Exports Act 2008 was published in September 2011.  One of the most significant aspects of this report is information on the new public access to data on licence applications, the value of licensed goods to be exported and their destination as well as licence denials.  This is valuable information for the wide range of stakeholders that rightly expect increasing transparency in the operation of export controls.At the time the annual report was published I made a commitment to publish on the Department's website every six months summary information about export control licences issued.  Summary data in respect of 2011 is on the website and data covering the first six months of 2012 will be put up shortly after the end of June.  I can assure the Deputy that human rights and foreign policy concerns are central considerations in the examination of export licence applications.  Prior to issuing any export licence for goods intended for a country where there is civil or military unrest, my Department consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This consultation process forms an essential and integral part of the decision making process for any export licence applications.  It involves detailed consideration of any human rights implications connected with a possible export.Human rights are, and have always been, a priority of successive Irish Governments and a cornerstone of our foreign policy.  The importance of human rights in the application of export control is reinforced by Article 12 of the dual use regulations.  This provides that member states take into account the EU Council's common position defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment.  This includes respect for human rights in the country of final destination as well as respect by that country of international humanitarian law.The first report under the Control of Exports Act 2008 identifies for both dual use and military goods the numbers of individual licenses issued for each country of destination, the product category to which they relate and a band of values related to issued licences.  I will keep under review the possibility of providing additional information but I have to take into account the fact that licence applications involve my Department receiving commercially sensitive product information from a large number of exporters.  All exporters have a legitimate expectation that this information will be treated in confidence.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I thank the Minister for his reply.  The first report indicated that Ireland had authorised €90 million of equipment for ammunition and arms use, including gun and weapon sensors, between 2008 and 2010, and that €10.6 billion of dual use product licences were also authorised.  In that period we gave licences for sales to countries including Libya, Iraq, Egypt, Algeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Lebanon.  Most of the contracts involved Britain, the US, Germany and China.The Minister indicated that reports would be published every six months and from speaking with representatives of Amnesty International, it seems that group is pretty keen for more information to come available in future, and that there would be a greater effort towards achieving transparency.  When will the annual report for 2011 due under the Control of Exports Act 2008 be published and will it contain detail not included in the annual report documentation covering 2008 to 2010?  Will it contain information on values of actual rather than licensed exports and on end use?  We are trying to get on the UN human rights committee, which is important, and it would be good for us to show more transparency.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	262	As I indicated, I will look at the issue.  There is quite a bit of transparency in the existing document and, for example, it shows the military licences by destination.  None of the countries to which the Deputy referred is on that list.  There is quite a bit of information on the different types of products, setting out the criteria used which are pretty robust.  The document details all the UN sanctions, respect for international humanitarian law, attitude towards terrorism and the nature of alliances.  The criteria used are very clear, and denials are detailed where they have occurred.  It complies with the various requirements of EU regulations where dual products are involved.I am content that the system is robust and I will consider the extent to which we can provide more information.  I will revert to the Deputy on a date for publication of the 2011 report, which will go into the level of detail I outlined.  We have published the overall figures for 2011, including the number and value of licences in the three broad categories.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	263	Will it include the information on end users and end use?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Each licence is different.  Some specify the end user where there is a high level of concern.  Some licences are more global, and the country rather than the specific end user is specified.  We go into that level of detail to assure ourselves that a dual use product will not go to a country where there is high risk to an end user or if we have questions about the process.  There is a level of policing in the system but we do not publish that level of detail.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 9 together.The Government has approved the restructuring of the enterprise supports for the micro and small business sectors with a view to creating an enhanced national enterprise support model.  This restructuring will include the creation of a small and micro business division within Enterprise Ireland with a new and enhanced focus on the wider small business sector, and the establishment of local enterprise offices, LEOs, to provide a "one-stop-shop" for small businesses within local authorities.As agreed by the Government, the county enterprise boards will be dissolved in their current legal format and their functions, assets and liabilities transferred to Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland is being mandated to work with the local authorities to develop benchmarks for service delivery and enterprise supports, as well as appropriate structures and delivery models for the local offices.  In this regard, a detailed formal service level agreement will be put in place between Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities, which will set out how the new enterprise support model will operate in practice.  The existing staff of the county enterprise boards will be an integral part of the new arrangements.There is much detailed work to be done to effect these changes.  An implementation working group has been set up under the auspices of my Department to progress the matter.  In conjunction with this, my Department is seeking formal advice from the Office of the Attorney General regarding appropriate legislation.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I thank the Minister of State but unfortunately he answered every question but the one I asked.  On 7 March, I was told in the Dáil that a steering group was being established to advance the process.  Legislation is required to abolish county enterprise boards and set up new structures, and much administrative work must also be done.  The work can be done simultaneously.Currently, county and city enterprise boards, which are doing much vital work in the midst of a significant unemployment crisis, are living under a sword of Damocles, with an element of uncertainty palpable.  The people involved know a change is on the way.  In order to focus the operation and get it running, I ask on behalf of the people working in county and city enterprise boards if the Minister of State will give some indication of approximately when the new system will be put in place.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	267	As I mentioned in the reply, legislation is required and there is no doubt that will not be published before the summer recess.That does not take from the mandate enterprise boards currently have.  I have been in constant contact and there has been clarification for the CEBs and everyone is clear on the new template that is being introduced.  The funding that has been allocated to each board is being used progressively by each county and city enterprise board.  This is a major change from 1994 and when the Government has approved the restructuring, there will be a one stop shop facility and the restructuring of services in local government offices will enhance the support services provided to small businesses in each county.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	268	The Government obviously believes this change is vitally important.  Surely the Minister must have some idea when it will be able to get through this necessary reform in the context of a huge unemployment crisis?Will the staff of the new one stop shops consist of the present staff of county enterprise boards and enterprise staff in local authorities?  Will there a be a one stop shop in each local authority area?  Some local authorities are being merged but there will still be a fair few local authorities.  The action plan for jobs indicates there will be.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	269	There will be respect for county boundaries, which is very important.  We must get this right.  It is vital that all services locally with the involvement of local development offices within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland cooperate fully to offer a single service and one stop shop facility.  The staff of local authorities and enterprise boards will be integrated to give an enhanced service.I do not want to mislead anyone so when I get clarification of the timeframe from the Attorney General's office, I will pass it on.  This is detailed legislation and it is important we get it right.  Currently the services offered by enterprise boards are confined and we want to extend the services and incorporate other services that are currently excluded.  The remit of the service level agreement being worked out with Enterprise Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is comprehensive.  It is vital we get on with this as quickly as possible and the Government is determined to roll out these support services to every county as quickly as possible.

This whole area has been in flux since Batt O'Keeffe was Minister and suggested the reform.  The sword of Damocles has been hanging over the county enterprise boards ever since.  This is a vital sector, it is the interface between young entrepreneurs and their ability to see their business come to fruition.  Right now there is confusion within the sector.  It is important we get a better indication of when this will happen.  We need an outline for the individuals working in the boards and for local businesses.Previously, the Minister of State said local authority workers would be involved in county enterprise board work on top of their own work.  How will that happen?  What will the budget savings be in 2012, 2013 and 2014?  The last time we discussed this in February, the Minister of State said there would be a wider range of Enterprise Ireland programmes for companies with rapid growth potential.  What did he mean by that?
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	271	We are not in flux in any way, we have been clear since the first day we entered government about the need to establish a county enterprise office in every local authority but we cannot just click our fingers and expect these things to happen.  The Government has formally approved the restructuring of the existing micro and small enterprise boards.  As a result the CEBs will be dissolved in their current legal format and a new micro-enterprise and small business division has been established within Enterprise Ireland with a new and enhanced focus on the wider small business sector.  Enterprise Ireland will work with local authorities to establish a new network of local enterprise offices situated in local authority offices to deliver the support functions currently delivered by CEBs and to be the front door for a more embedded culture of enterprise development across the country.  EI will work with local authorities to develop a structure, detailed functions and staffing levels.  LEOs will have staffing complements from both CEBs and local authorities.  That is agreed.  Enterprise Ireland will allocate an annual budget to each relevant local authority to contain competitive elements where some part of the allocation will be subject to a bidding process.  On foot of the annual budget allocations to each relevant local authority, a formal service level agreement will be agreed between EI and the local authority to contain performance targets and service standards which must be met to ensure a continuous flow of funds.

There have been no operational changes and there is no understanding of the plan of action and how it will be implemented.  Will there be a centralised structure for the administration of grants?  Will it reduce regional flexibility, which is very important?  The Minister of State mentioned the bidding system he wants to introduce.  With bidding there will be winners and losers so will certain counties have a reduced level of grant delivery as a result of bidding?Business people are worried about going into a local authority office and being asked about the household charge, planning levies and service charges.  There is a relationship between people and the county enterprise boards that transcends such matters and focuses purely on business while the other elements are left at the door.  How will those fears be resolved?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	273	There has always been cooperation between the local authorities and the county enterprise boards and an exchange of staff between them.  Generally the county manager has been the chairman of the county enterprise board.  In my county, the county enterprise board has been very successful but the value of the boards has never been properly recognised.  There are enterprises from my county that are multinational corporations that started out as small enterprises with initial support coming from the former country development boards, as they were then.The restructuring I advocated when I was in government was that the LEADER programme and the former partnership boards should have been subsumed into the county enterprise boards.  Does the Minister of State envisage a substantial proportion of the funding from the county enterprise boards will come from the revenue of the local authorities?  That is a concern in rural counties.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	274	Funding will come directly from the voted Estimate of the Department; it will not come from the local authority in any way.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	275	That is the impression people have.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	276	There is no ambiguity about this.  This Government understands and respects small companies and will provide services for them.  The 200,000 small companies are the backbone of the Irish economy.If people are fearful of going into the local authority office because they might be requested to pay other charges, I would sincerely hope they will pay the social charges they are supposed to pay.  Our job is to support small companies and when we look at the charges levied by local government on business, that is an integral part of running a business.This is an ideal partnership between local government and Enterprise Ireland.  The hub will be enterprise driven by Enterprise Ireland.  With regard to the allocation of funding, the added value delivered by enterprise boards through mentoring supports currently means we can save money.

We want to ensure the allocation of taxpayer's money goes to the most important person, the employer and potential job creator.  The job of Government is to enhance opportunities for people who can create jobs.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 41 together.The latest available data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO,  indicates that exports of medical and pharmaceutical products to the United States in the first quarter of this year decreased by €1.1 billion and that total exports of these products decreased by €772 million when compared to the corresponding period in 2011.  A substantial part of the decline was due to a high value product coming off patent.The expiry of the patent on products manufactured by Pfizer unfortunately resulted in the announcement of the loss of 177 positions in Cork this week.  My thoughts are with the workers and their families.  I have spoken to the company about the situation. These two quality plants in Cork will still employ over 500 people and will be adapting to achieve operational excellence and deliver competitive manufacturing for the company.  The company has also confirmed that Ireland remains a key strategic location for it.  Factoring in this decision, Pfizer will still employ almost 4,000 people in Ireland across eight locations.  In September 2011, the company announced a €145 million investment in its Grange Castle site to develop a new site to expand the Irish manufacturing process for an invasive pneumococcal vaccine.IDA Ireland has been working for many years to minimise the threat to jobs posed by products coming off patent and has been seeking to diversify Ireland's pharmaceutical base.  Its strategy has been to win leading company investment and to diversify the breadth of operations over multi-product sites, including associated services and development of new compounds.  Ireland has been enormously successful in attracting eight of the major global players and the world's No. 1 biotechnology company to manufacture from Ireland.  IDA Ireland has focused, in particular, on biopharmaceuticals, which represent the next wave of opportunity in the industry, and has been successful in attracting leading companies with the result that Ireland has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of pharmaceutical products.Employment in IDA companies in the pharmaceutical and health care services sector increased by approximately 1,400 in 2011.  In the first six months of 2012 alone, Ireland has won five major investments in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sectors with the capacity to create 1,175 new jobs.  I have been assured by IDA Ireland that it will continue to seek to win new investments in the pharmaceutical industry and to win large scale investments in product development and capability to enable its existing client companies take on new product mandates.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	280	Yesterday, as the Minister said, 177 jobs were lost at Pfizer in Cork.  This is a significant blow to the employees and also to the Cork area and should act as a wake up call to the Government regarding the patents cliff, on the edge of which we are perched.  A large proportion of the State's GDP comprises products that are coming off patent and this will threaten jobs, growth and our GDP and debt to GDP ratio.  The Minister mentioned that five of the top 12 selling medicines in the world are produced in Ireland but it is estimated that more than €100 billion worth of sales of drugs will come off patent before 2015.  Chemicals and medicines comprise 60% of merchandise exports.  How many jobs could be lost if this were to come to pass?  I commend the work done in bringing FDI to the State, especially in this sector.  What level of patent replacement is being undertaken?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The IDA has recognised and anticipated this for many years.  Part of the response was to shift into biopharmaceuticals, which is a growth area.  There are horizon and sunset products in this sector and the trick for the IDA is to make sure we are at the horizon side.  For example, Eli Lilly announced an investment of €330 million in a new facility at Kinsale, County Cork, creating 200 jobs.  That is an exciting project and it will be particularly effective.  Mylan, which will create 500 jobs in both Dublin and Galway is in the generics field.  This is the first major generic drugs company to come to Ireland to establish a new niche within the pharmaceutical sector, which is robust and strong in the context of growth.  Companies respond in different ways.  A number have had products come off patent but have maintained their production and employment levels by introducing new product streams to replace them or by taking on new lines of production.  Pfizer is determined to remain competitive in this area.  It has a high quality plant and it is determined to remain competitive and support the employment it has but at a lower volume than previously.  The challenge for the IDA - and it is what we have been doing - is to make sure we position ourselves to avail of the opportunities in the sector and that is borne out by the increasing employment numbers.

A total of 60% of our exports emanate from this sector.  Putting all our eggs in one basket, as happened previously in the construction sector, is dangerous and could be catastrophic.  I asked previously at joint committee meetings what targets the Government has for the creation of patents and the reply was that they are demand-led.  However, it is important that the Government stimulates the development of patents not only in the FDI sector but also among domestic businesses.  A large number of patents are developed through FDI and not enough is being done to develop and stimulate intellectual property and patents among Irish firms.  What will the Government do to change this?  Is the Minister confident the sunset products will be matched in future with sunrise products?  Is he also confident the patents that are falling off the cliff will be matched at the very least by new patents and jobs will be maintained?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I am confident, although I acknowledge this has not been an easy year by any means.  However, the evidence is that despite our difficulties, this sector, which employs 25,000 people, increased employment by 1,400 last year.  We are, therefore, beating the trend about which the Deputy is worried.  A total of 1,200 new job approvals have been announced so far this year.  It is not true that we are over reliant on the pharmaceutical sector.  It produces a high proportion of our exports but, as an employment creator, it is an important sector and it has become a strong cluster.  We can attract new opportunities because we have the skills base.  It is recognised that we have good people in this sector and, therefore, it is not true to suggest we are over reliant on it or that it is a bubble sector.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I agree with the Deputy that more patents need to be generated.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and I have gone through the research prioritisation exercise and tomorrow he will launch the IP protocol to make it easier for small companies to access higher education research in order that it can be rolled out into commercial products.  Enterprise Ireland backs technology clusters that bring together small indigenous companies as well as foreign companies to identify the opportunities for innovation.  There is a great deal happening in the innovation space and, like the Deputy suggested, we want to sweat it to get more patents and commercial ideas out of the investment we make.Question No. 9 answered with Question No. 7.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The Government's jobs initiative of May 2011 was aimed at restoring confidence in the economy, providing opportunities for re-skilling those who had lost jobs and assisting people in getting back to work.  Key measures in the jobs initiative included halving the rate of employer's PRSI on earnings up to €356 per week, a reduction in the lower rate of VAT on certain goods and services, targeted capital spending on labour-intensive projects, and the introduction of the national internship scheme, JobBridge.  Additional education and training places were also provided for those seeking to upskill.The impact of these measures is being seen across a range of sectors, but particularly in the tourism and hospitality sectors where the latest quarterly national household survey, published today, shows a year-on-year increase of 8,700 in the numbers employed in the accommodation and food service sectors.  Almost 7,500 interns have commenced placements under the JobBridge programme since it was launched last July.  Feedback from the Department of Social Protection indicates that 966 of the 2,575 people who have already completed JobBridge have gone directly into employment with the host organisation or elsewhere.  More than 3,500 people recently graduated from the first round of Springboard programmes, which were put in place in 2011, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, recently announced a further roll-out of the Springboard initiative with an additional 6,000 places in 2012.The Government has built on the jobs initiative this year with its action plan for jobs and the Pathways to Work strategy, adding a significant range of actions to promote employment and assist those seeking work.  Pathways to Work places a particular focus on the long-term unemployed, while the new €20 million labour market education and training fund will include specific provision for those under 25 years of age.  FÁS has issued a call for expressions of interest from training and education providers in regard to this fund.In the three years prior to the Government taking office, more than 300,000 jobs were lost.  This scale of job loss cannot be reversed overnight, but we are systematically delivering on the commitments we made in the action plan for jobs and Pathways to Work.  While employment may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in this transition phase of our economic recovery, the significant job announcements since January - which include BSkyB, Mylan, Apple, Eli Lilly, PayPal and others - point to the return of a level of confidence in the Irish economy that will translate into an increase in the number of people in employment as the jobs come on stream.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	287	We have had a number of jobs initiatives at this stage.  The last budget was referred to as a jobs budget, after which we had the action plan for jobs.  In the wake of all of this, however, the quarterly national household survey figures released this morning show that unemployment has crept up to 14.8% and, more significantly, that the number of long-term unemployed - those out of work for more than a year - has increased by 10% in the past 12 months and now constitutes 60% of the total number of unemployed.  The data indicate, moreover, that the numbers unemployed for more than two years have also increased and now make up some 40% of the total unemployment figure.  Given that more than 200 people per day are leaving the country, it is clear that emigration is the only thing preventing an even higher rate of joblessness.The Minister of State is correct that the number of people in training schemes has increased.  In fact, I understand an additional 12,000 to 14,000 training places have been filled since the start of the year.  The corollary of that, however, is that there are up to 14,000 more people without jobs.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	290	Traditional manufacturing is an area in urgent need of assistance, with the increase in VAT in the last budget, in particular, creating immense difficulty for certain enterprises.  Yesterday a provisional liquidator was appointed to Flair International in Bailieborough, County Cavan, a company which manufactures quality bath and shower screens.  This development endangers the jobs of the 52 people currently employed there, following the unfortunate laying off of 26 workers last January.  I appeal to the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, with whom I was in contact previously regarding this company, to ensure that the Department and Enterprise Ireland provide all possible support to it.  The employment it provides is of great importance to the town.  Enterprise Ireland has, at my request, done some work with the company in the past.  Will the Minister of State undertake to ensure that Enterprise Ireland is as proactive as possible, with the support of the Department, in seeking to protect the jobs at this enterprise?

However, the reality is that some 450 nights have passed since this Government took office.  Every time I ask the Minister and his colleagues questions about the action plan for jobs, their answers are phrased largely in the future tense.

Is it not the case, including in the matter of procurement, that what is needed, instead of round-table discussions, analyses, meetings and the provision of some training, is action?

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I am particularly concerned that Enterprise Ireland should be involved.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Yes.  A dialogue can be entered into in that respect.On the question of whether the jobs initiatives introduced by the Government are proving a success, the central point is that this is a ship which will take a long time to turn around.  We acknowledge the figures and are bold and honest enough not to bury our heads in the sand in that regard.  We are seeking to implement a set of policy prerogatives in the form of labour market activation measures and education-related measures.  The latter include JobBridge, Pathways to Work and Springboard, while the former includes the extension of the PRSI incentive scheme in a way that incentivises employers to engage employees and interns.  We are also concerned with identifying skills shortages and seeking to address those through the education sphere.  All of that will take time.On the procurement issue, the action plan for jobs includes a range of deliverables for the end of 2012, to which I respectfully ask Deputy Peadar Tóibín to have regard.  If he does not accept what I am saying, he should speak with representatives of the State agencies tasked with these actions, who will demonstrate the actions they are undertaking at the behest of the Government.  There is a reporting mechanism attached to the deliverables which sees the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs reporting directly to the Taoiseach.  It is not at all accurate to say our activities in this regard are based merely on aspiration.  With respect to the Deputy, my response pointed to the clear action points we are driving in regard to procurement.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	297	In July 2011 my proposals for reform of consumer and competition legislation were approved by Government.  These embodied two commitments given in the Programme for Government, namely, the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority and the introduction of a legislative base for a code of practice in the grocery sector.  In addition, the proposals gave effect to the recommendation of the advisory group on media mergers and updated certain elements of competition and consumer law.Under the proposals, responsibility for the application of the public interest test in respect of media mergers will transfer to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The consolidation of the various elements of consumer and competition law into a single Act is entirely in keeping with the principles of better regulation and with the trend within Government to consolidate and simplify legislation for ease of reference for all users.All of the elements of the package are important measures to be delivered.  I see no benefit in progressing a stand-alone item of legislation for one element, to be followed in due course by a more comprehensive package of reforms.  I expect the consumer and competition Bill to be published later this year.The Dáil adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 June 2012.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Driving export growth is central to our economic recovery and it is a key focus of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs. Enterprise Ireland (EI) has established a new Potential Exporters Division, a key measure in the Action Plan for Jobs.  Its role is to stimulate greater activity within companies across all regions and to reorient those demonstrating real growth potential from the domestic to the international market place. The new unit provides assistance designed to aid client companies investigate, prepare and execute an international strategy including:Practical business advice, information and market intelligence,Targeted funding supports where appropriate,Suitable training and development.So far this year EI has held six Export Awareness Events around the country with the next one taking place on 12th June.  Approximately 200 companies have attended these events with more than 1,200 companies contacted and invited.  EI has commenced a number of two day "Exploring Exporting" workshops with over 40 companies participating.  Further events and workshops will continue to be rolled out during the year.Enterprise Ireland's 29 overseas offices and international networks have an important role to play in the internationalisation of EI's established and start-up client companies, through positioning them to meet the needs of specific international market and guiding them in the right direction regarding market contacts and introductions to potential buyers.  Through this network, EI clients have secured 294 new buyers this year, while 316 buyers have been attracted to engage with indigenous companies on international business opportunities.Another essential support to underpin the export ambitions of SMEs is developing a wider network of EU Free Trade Agreements. These agreements increase market access for our exporters by reducing barriers to trade and investment, encourage the mutual recognition of EU standards so that technical barriers to trade are removed and generally make it easier and less costly for our exporters to trade. We are coming up to the first anniversary, on 1 July, when the first major FTA with Korea came into effect to improve market access to this powerful Asian economy. Other agreements are being negotiated with Canada, Singapore and Malaysia while talks about improving market access to Vietnam have just started. All these are markets that have been identified as priority markets in our Trade, Tourism and Investment strategy.

Cloud computing is a key sector identified in the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and the development of this SWiFT by National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) marks the delivery of a Q2 measure under the Action Plan."SWiFT 10:" was launched on 21 May 2012. The Irish Internet Association disseminated information on the SWiFT to the 6,500 subscribers of their Newsletter and 12,500 followers on Twitter. Both mainstream and IT specialist media reported on the Launch.It is intended for use as a means of assessing Cloud adoption prioritisation and suitability. The SWiFT guidance will support organisations to thoroughly assess the practical suitability of Cloud computing across the gamut of their business operations.  It includes a thorough review of all legal, security, maturity and cost/benefit considerations.SMEs in particular will be receptive to this SWiFT, as they are looking to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, increase agility and open up new avenues.Recent research indicates that while SMEs are convinced of the merits of the Cloud, they are hesitant to take those first steps. SWiFT 10 will guide business owners and managers through the process and assist them in making the appropriate decisions and setting the right course for their Cloud adoption strategy.SWiFT 10 helps organisations determine whether Cloud is a right fit for them or not. It provides not only a starting point for businesses considering Cloud, it guides them through all the features that need to be considered when adopting Cloud and helps organisations large and small assess the risks and more importantly the benefits for their business at a small cost of less than €20.In this regard this SWiFT will clear some of the confusion which may be hampering Cloud adoption and provide a means of promoting and encouraging greater adoption among Irish SMEs. It is not possible at this stage to put a number on the SMEs that will avail of the SWiFT 10 guidance.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 19 together.As the House is aware, the Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending, including lending for working capital purposes, of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets. The progress on their lending plans is closely monitored each month.Notwithstanding this close monitoring, access to finance in the current risk averse lending environment remains restricted for certain sectors.  Mr. John Trethowan stated on Tuesday in his latest report that although the pillar banks are being supportive of medium and low risk new lending to well established SMEs and farms, there is little evidence of support for "enterprise risk taking" on new and increased lending in the banks' lending policies.  The Deputy will be aware that I am introducing two targeted initiatives to support an additional flow of credit into the economy. I am currently finalising primary legislation to establish both a MicroEnterprise Loan Fund and a Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, thereby supporting micro enterprises and specific categories of SMEs with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.Further work with the banks is continuing to ensure that they meet the needs of non-traditional sectors, such as the technology and other emerging sectors.  Enterprise Ireland is working with the banks to develop propositions for exporters and technology companies that are suited to different stages of growth and encouraging them to adopt cashflow lending as opposed to the asset backed approach that has been the norm in recent years.  Knowledge sharing between EI and the pillar banks is on-going, including reciprocal secondments, sector briefings, and trade mission involvement.Furthermore, the Development Capital Fund Scheme announced as a central recommendation in the Action Plan for Jobs will assist in increasing the availability of risk capital and closing the ‘equity gap' experienced by SMEs seeking risk capital in excess of €2m.  This Fund was launched in March and a competitive call for expressions of interest was launched on 12 April 2012.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 24 together.On 8 May last, the Government approved a number of amendments to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2011.  It should be remembered that the main purpose of the Bill is to implement reform proposals in line with the commitment in the Government's Programme for National Recovery to reform the JLC system to make them more flexible and responsive to the needs of the economy and to provide for the more comprehensive measures required to strengthen the legal framework for the Employment Regulation Order and Registered Employment Agreement sectoral wage mechanisms.These reforms, and this Bill, is all the more important in the light of deficiencies in the original legislation identified in the judgment of the High Court in John Grace Fried Chicken Limited and Others -v- The Catering Joint Labour Committee and Others delivered on 7 July 2011 which struck down the whole ERO/REA system of wage settlements.  So, this Bill is not just reforming the ERO/REA system it is actually rebuilding them and replacing a system that wasn't legally robust with a system that is better designed to meet the challenges of the Irish economy in the 21st century.The legal and technical challenges to bring forward this legislation, on foot of that High Court ruling, were many and varied but I am satisfied that the Bill as presented, with the amendments that improve it arising from engagement at political, legal and Troika level, strikes a good balance between the dual ambitions of providing protection for a particular group of workers and having a system of wage settlements that is reflective of the modern, dynamic and changing economy we operate in today.The amendments I shall be presenting cover a number of issues including:The timeframe for the variation of REAs,The provisions regarding the granting of temporary exemptions from the obligation to pay the terms prescribed under EROs and REAs,The basis on which comparisons would be made with wage rates elsewhere,The basis on which up to two higher hourly wage rates might be set to include standards and skills as well as length of service,The principles and policies that need to be considered in setting orders,The role of the LRC in preparing a code of practice on Sunday working,The issues to be considered in setting orders in an inability to pay situation and,Measures required to strengthen the legal framework for the EROs and REAs.The precise wording of the amendments is currently being finalised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and will be forwarded to the Bills Office for publication in advance of the Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann which is scheduled for 19 June.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	302	An annual Exchequer allocation is provided under the Estimates process for the CEBs.  The 2012 allocation is €26.4m of which €15m is for the provision of direct grant aid and the provision of training, mentoring and advisory services to micro-enterprises.Individual CEB allocations are determined by the CEB Central Coordination Unit within Enterprise Ireland (CCU). In determining these allocations a systematic approach is adopted to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  Individual allocations are done on the basis of a standard allocation to each CEB (i.e. 70% of the overall grant allocation is divided between 35 CEBs) together with an additional allocation that is determined mainly by population but which, particularly in relation to the allocation for direct grant aid, also takes account of local unemployment trends, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional considerations.It is a matter in the first instance for individual CEBs to determine how they will use allocated funds in the most effective manner possible.  Some Boards might commit funding as eligible projects present themselves while others might reserve funding until later in the year so as to support eligible projects that emerge at that time.  Importantly not all grants approved (or "committed") are drawn down for a variety of company specific reasons.The CCU works closely with the CEBs throughout the year to monitor the draw downs of funds by CEBs and the level of commitments being entered into.  The CCU has advised that it is currently conducting a mid-year review of CEB finances to measure demand to year-end and to identify any situations where a Board might not fully utilise their allocation which could then be re-allocated to another Board.In addition to this ongoing oversight and monitoring of budget spend it should be noted that within the CEBs all recommendations on whether or not projects should be grant-aided are made by an Evaluation Committee whose membership is external to the Board and executive of the CEB.  I would also point out that all CEBs are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General on an annual basis.In light of the recent Government Decision to dissolve the CEBs in their current format and to deliver enterprise supports from within the Local Authorities via the new LEOs the existing funding mechanisms will be reviewed as part of that restructuring.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	303	The Health and Safety Authority — an Agency of my Department — is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and associated statutory provisions.To date this year, 17 workplace deaths have been reported to the Authority.  54 workplace fatalities were reported for the whole of 2011.Every workplace fatality is a tragedy.  In that context, there is an obligation on everybody — Government, employers and employees alike — to play their part in helping to reduce the numbers of these tragedies.The agriculture sector continues to have a disproportionately high number of fatalities.  In 2011, of the 54 fatalities reported to the Authority, 22 occurred in agriculture and the Authority has again identified this as a high-risk sector in its 2012 Programme of Work where 3,000 farm inspections are planned this year.  The construction sector will also remain a strong focus of attention.The data so far this year shows a reduction of 32% in fatal incidents compared to the same period last year and a 23% reduction in non-fatal incidents.  Hopefully, this improvement can be maintained.The HSA's Programme of Work also outlines a comprehensive range of activities to make workplaces safer and strikes a balance between prevention, advice and enforcement activity, at a period of tighter resource constraints.To promote smarter compliance, the Authority publishes Guidelines, Codes of Practice, web based compliance tools and other advice on workplace safety on a regular basis as well as organising sectoral seminars or conferences to promote the occupational safety and health message, as part of its advocacy role.  These activities, together with the information on the Authority's website, are of critical importance to all those in the workplace as we work to improve workplace safety generally.It is, however, important to stress that day-to-day responsibility for workplace safety rests with those in the workplace in the first instance.  Safe workplaces can ultimately only be delivered by those who control and work in them, that is, by employers and employees working together.  Even in these challenging economic times, it is important that we all maintain a strong focus on workplace safety.

Over the same period 44,650 jobs were lost in the agency's client companies.  At the end of 2011 there were 145,878 people employed in 1,004 IDA client companies.  The following tabular statement shows the yearly movements.2011 saw a strong performance in the level of FDI won by Ireland. IDA Ireland client companies created over 13,000 new jobs despite the current global economic situation and a strong increase in international competition.  In accordance with the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, IDA Ireland is working to target another 144 new FDI investment projects in 2012, which will create 12,500 new jobs with an associated 8,750 in the wider economy, giving a total impact of 21,250.  Up to the end of May 2012, there have been 44 IDA announcements with in excess of 5,000 jobs.The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is the official source of estimates of employment in the State and is compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  Changes in the level of employment are a function of both jobs lost and jobs created over the period in question.  The most recent figures available for employment levels are for the fourth quarter of 2011.  These showed an estimated 1,807,800 people in employment in the State, a fall of 331,000 from the corresponding level at the end of 2007.  It can be noted that the annual rate of decline in employment peaked during 2009 at over 8%.  Since then, the rate of decline has been slowing and, as of the fourth quarter of 2011, an annual employment reduction of 0.8% or 15,400 was recorded.Employment Data2008200920102011No. of IDA Client Companies1,0431,0191,0141,004Total Jobs in IDA Client Companies152,514138,171139,760145,878Total New Jobs Created in IDA Client Companies6,7193,56811,22413,068Job Losses in IDA Client Companies-10,154-17,911-9,635-6,950

www.djei.ie/trade/export/Export_Licences_2011.pdf
This information shows the number and value of licences issued by my Department.  In the interests of improving transparency on the issue of export licences, similar information in respect of the first six months of 2012 will be published on my Department's website in early July.Transparency and an understanding of how export control operates are important for both business and civil society alike.  That was foremost in my mind when I published the first annual report under the Control of Exports Act, 2008.  This contained a detailed description of how the system operates and how export control policy is developed.It is also for transparency reasons that I am providing a greater level of information about my Department's licensing operations than has been available previously, including the provision of six monthly data on licence volume and values.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	306	The figures in respect of jobs in Enterprise Development agency-supported companies and those supported by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) are compiled in the Forfás Annual Employment Survey and the CEB Annual Employment Survey respectively on an annualised basis.  The figures in respect of jobs created in 2011 are set out in Table 1 accompanying this reply.In 2011, IDA Ireland made approximately 62 announcements with the potential to create a total of 7,047 jobs.  The total amount of employment grants paid for New Name companies in 2011 was €3,856,077.  So far this year, IDA Ireland has announced 44 investments for Ireland, 36 of which have the potential to create over 5,000 new jobs.  It should be noted however that jobs announced are typically created over a period of up to three to five years approximately.  Due to the volume of detail involved it is not possible to furnish in this reply full details of investments announced by IDA.  However, the Deputy may wish to access them directly on the agency's websitehttp://www.idaireland.com.IDA's primary responsibility is to attract foreign direct investment to Ireland and to grow and expand those companies once they have established operations in Ireland. IDA Ireland's Strategy, Horizon 2020, sets out its national targets to 2014 for direct job creation in the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) sector.  These targets include the creation of 62,000 direct jobs in 640 investment projects over the period, which could result in an additional 105,000 jobs overall in the economy.  50% of those investments will be targeted for locations outside of Dublin and Cork.Enterprise Ireland's objective is to drive the growth of client companies in overseas markets which in turn will support existing jobs and job creation in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland (EI) partners with entrepreneurs, Irish businesses, and the research and investment communities to develop Ireland's international trade, innovation, leadership and competitiveness. The ultimate goal is increased exports, employment and prosperity in Ireland.  Details of funding to client companies is set out in the agency's annual report which will be published later this month.EI actively works with viable companies to help them to both sustain and create jobs.  A total of more than 162,000 people (full and part-time) directly rely on Enterprise Ireland client companies for their employment.  Where a client company wishes to publicly announce new jobs created, Enterprise Ireland can facilitate this announcement by issuing a press release on the development.  Table 2 provides information on the jobs announcements made by Enterprise Ireland between May 2011 and end of May 2012.The role of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at a local level through the provision of financial and technical support to small and micro-enterprises. Priority is given to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector.CEBs are funded through an Exchequer Allocation each year. In 2011 the allocation for Capital expenditure (direct grants and "soft supports" to micro-enterprises) was €15m.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	answer	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 29 together.My Department, through the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards offer a range of supports to assist and enable entrepreneurs and enterprises to exploit the value of Intellectual Property (IP) and to engage in the optimal exploitation of research and development, and specifically in applying for patents.Reflecting Enterprise Ireland's enterprise development mission, the agency supports companies to be more competitive through innovation.  An output from this can be the creation of patented Intellectual Property (IP), however, measuring the resultant number of patent applications is not an effective metric to assess the output from these supports. This is because there are many alternative and often more appropriate ways for companies to capture and exploit their intellectual property.  For example, in the software sector patenting may be prohibited by patent law, therefore, copyright is a more common means of securing a company's intellectual assets.  Enterprise Ireland therefore does not set targets for the number of patents filed or for increases in the number of patents filed by its client companies. Enterprise Ireland's focus is on supporting businesses to be innovative and where this produces IP, the business is supported to use the most appropriate process to protect it, which can include patenting.Intellectual Property supports are integrated with the broader range of innovation supports provided by EI.  Under the R&D Fund companies, including HPSUs, can receive support for the costs of the early stages of patenting.  However, companies may determine that patenting is not the optimal means of protecting any new Intellectual Property and may rely, instead, on copyright, or non-disclosure and/or first mover advantage, depending on circumstances and sector.Considering the diversity of needs that the client base represents Enterprise Ireland also provides a number of non-financial supports to help companies to make the best Intellectual Property protection decisions based on their specific situation. In some circumstances the most effective way for a company to secure key IP (including patents) is not to develop it themselves but rather to licence or acquire it from another company or college.  Enterprise Ireland's Technology Transfer Executives working with the Enterprise Europe Network provide access to IP from a range of sources and support companies to transfer targeted IP into their companies.In terms of building the capability of Irish companies a joint exercise between Enterprise Ireland (with the Enterprise-Europe Network) and the Irish Patent Office ran a very successful campaign of events, under the heading "Building a Business on your ideas".  With support from the County Enterprise Boards and Institutes of Technology this initiative addressed an Innovation Task Force recommendation that, "An understanding of the importance of IP, its value and commercial potential should be strongly cultivated in the business community and Irish society at large".Recently Enterprise Ireland appointed an Intellectual Property Manager to strengthen the agency's resources dedicated to the promotion and use of intellectual property.In addition, the Patents Office provides a range of information supports to prospective patent applicants through the Office's websitewww.patentsoffice.ie including a detailed Patent Application Guide for applicants who wish to file a patent application without using the services of a patent agent.  To reduce patenting costs for applicants for Irish 20 year patents, the statutory fee for the search which is required in order to establish novelty and non-obviousness has been reduced from €361 to €200.The report of the IP Implementation Group is due to be published very shortly which will spell out a new national protocol aimed at encouraging the transfer of more IP into Irish companies from the third level sector.  Enterprise Ireland will play a central role in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.I am satisfied that national supports directed at Irish companies engaged in research, development and innovation will continue to result in new inventions that are patented adding further to economic growth and development.

The 2012 Revised Estimates for Public Services makes provision for an allocation of €47.349 million to Forfás this year for Pay and Pensions under Subhead A3 of my Department's Vote.  The detailed Agency Statement for Forfás in the Revised Estimates Volume shows that only €6.769 million of this allocation is for pay purposes, while €40.58 million is for pension purposes.  The City and County Enterprise Boards have a pay allocation of €7.143 million for 2012, and an additional pension allocation of €414,000.In total, Forfás is responsible for paying the pension entitlements of approximately 1,200 retired agency staff and so any comparison of their costs with the pay and pensions costs of the City and County Enterprise Boards is inappropriate.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Details of IDA Ireland's job and investment announcements are available on the Agency's website and show that, in 2010 and 2011 combined, there were 157 such announcements, with the potential to create almost 13,000 jobs.It is important to point out that there is always a time lag, in the region of 3 to 5 years, between the announcement of jobs and their creation.  That time is required for such activities as locating and requiring a suitable site for the company's operations, constructing a facility, installing machinery and recruiting and training staff.In the same two year period, there were a total of 24,292 jobs created in IDA client companies. Of course, many of these jobs related to projects announced prior to the period in question or not announced at all.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	310	The proposed Europe-China Trade Hub was not discussed during my meetings with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping during his visit to Ireland earlier this year.  This initiative is entirely a private sector venture with no official Chinese Government involvement.  Therefore all aspects of its development are a matter for the promoters, i.e. the Chinese/Irish consortium.Although not qualifying for grant-aid from IDA Ireland, that Agency would assist the company where possible by way of direction in the marketplace and support locally, should they require it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 77 together.The Action Plan for Jobs contains over 270 actions to be implemented by all 15 Government Departments as well as 36 State agencies, and is intended to improve supports for job-creating businesses and remove barriers to employment-creation across the economy.  The Plan aims to deliver on the Taoiseach's commitment to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business, and increase the number of people at work in Ireland by 100,000 — from 1.8m to 1.9m — by 2016.  The Action Plan for Jobs has also set the following established ambitions:To get Ireland back to a top-five ranking in international competitiveness,To build world-class clusters in key sectors of opportunity,To build an indigenous engine of growth that drives up the export market share of Irish companies,To get the number of people at work in the Irish economy back to 2m by 2020.Enterprise Ireland's objective on behalf of Government is to drive the growth of Irish companies in overseas markets which in turn will support job creation in Ireland and develop Ireland's international trade, innovation, leadership and competitiveness.  The ultimate goal is increased exports, employment and prosperity in Ireland.  The agency has a number of programmes in place to achieve this goal, including direct financial support to industry for capability development, support for the Seed and Venture Capital sector in Ireland to promote availability of equity financing and support for Entrepreneurship and High Potential Start-Ups.EI actively works with viable companies to help them to both sustain and create jobs.  More than 162,000 people directly rely on Enterprise Ireland client companies for their employment.  In 2011 alone, 9,038 new jobs were created in EI client companies.The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) have primary responsibility for the delivery of State support to the indigenous micro-enterprise sector i.e. businesses which employ 10 or less workers.  Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support, the CEBs are central in assisting many micro-enterprises in developing into strong export entities where they have sufficient mass to access the services of Enterprise Ireland.  In 2011, 7,253 jobs were created in CEB-assisted companies.In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland is aiming to create 62,000 direct jobs in 640 investments over the period 2010 to 2014, with 50% of these investments located outside of Dublin and Cork.  In implementing its strategy, IDA Ireland is also working with existing client companies in Ireland in order to transform the existing foreign direct investment (FDI) base with a view to developing, retaining and growing employment opportunities in these companies.In 2011, IDA Ireland client companies created 11,594 new jobs despite the current global economic situation and a strong increase in international competition. In accordance with the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, IDA Ireland is working to target another 144 new FDI investment projects in 2012, which will create 12,500 new jobs.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	312	A number of agencies under the remit of my Department provide supports for research and development including Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.Science Foundation Ireland operates a range of programmes designed to deliver a world class standard of research activity in third level institutions and linked to Irish enterprises. Their Centres for Science, Engineering and Technology and Strategic Research Clusters help link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry. Their Principal Investigator Programme supports those fields of science and engineering that underpin biotechnology, ICT and energy and their Research Frontiers Programme supports research in framework or integrative fields of science, engineering and mathematics that contribute educational benefit that will advance national scientific progress.Enterprise Ireland operates a suite of programmes to expand research capacity in companies, to increase collaboration between enterprise and the research sector and to maximise the commercialisation of the State's research investment. They offer 14 main initiatives for supporting research and development in businesses. Ireland's strengthened national research ecosystem has enhanced IDA's capacity to attract increased levels of high-value R&D projects and new RD&I investment approvals are playing a strategic role in embedding existing employment in FDI companies and setting the groundwork for increased future employment.The work of the enterprise agencies is underpinned by investments under the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions which is aimed at strengthening national research capabilities in human and physical infrastructure.There are a number of other programmes providing research and development supports delivered by other state agencies, funding for which is channelled through a number of other Government Departments, full details of which are outlined in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators Report published in December 2011 which is available on my Department's website.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	313	My Department and its Agencies continue to focus on reducing administrative burdens on business, with a reduction of 24.8% already having been achieved; this amounts to annual savings for business of over €207 million.  Details of all the initiatives making up this total are available on my Department's website.Successful initiatives resulting in significant savings include:In Company Law, savings of €82 million per annum have already been realised, more than €33 million of which are due to the work of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), as companies can submit their annual returns online via the CRO website and can now use digital signatures for the B1 Form and Accounts.The audit exemption threshold has been increased to the maximum level permitted under EU law and the draft regulations are with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for finalisation.  This will achieve potential savings for Irish SMEs of approximately €2.8 million annually.In Health and Safety Law, a total of €123 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the HSA via two key projects: the BeSMART online tool for preparing the Risk Assessment and Safety Statement (€59m), and the SMP20 Guidelines (€64m), which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.The reform of the State's Workplace Relations Services, that I set in train last year, will, among other matters, deliver a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court. This new structure will provide a better service for both employees and employers, with fewer delays and reduced administrative burdens. Already there has been some significant early progress, including the development of a single complaint form for all workplace relations complaints, the establishment of a single contact portal, Workplace Relations Customer Services, to handle all complaints and enquiries, the launch of a single website,www.workplacerelations.ie, containing all relevant information on employment rights and industrial relations and the commencement of a Pilot Early Resolution Service which will seek to resolve disputes without recourse to adjudication or inspection. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to this new structure.My officials are currently using the Standard Cost Model to estimate the likely savings for business that will be delivered by the Workplace Relations Reform Programme, and will report on these later in the year.  Estimates of the administrative burden savings that will arise from some of the simplified approaches within the Consolidated Companies Bill will also be produced.My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target by the end of 2012.  A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011.  Following completion of its measurement exercise, each participating Department must then immediately begin planning how it will achieve the remaining reductions necessary to reach the target.  The first cluster of Departments should report to Government with Simplification Plans by the end of the second quarter and the remaining Departments should report by the end of the third quarter.Work is continuing to identify new areas where administrative burdens on business can be reduced and in this regard the High Level Group on Business Regulation has prioritised a number of areas for attention in its Work Programme for 2012.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	314	The figures in respect of jobs in Enterprise Development agency-supported companies and those supported by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) are compiled in the Forfás Annual Employment Survey and the CEB Annual Employment Survey respectively.  As the information is compiled on an annualised basis, the figures in respect of 2011 as a whole are set out in the following table and are recorded on a full time equivalent basis.Job creation is at the top of the Government's agenda.  Since we came into office, we have been working hard to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones. Our objective is to put the country back on the road to economic recovery and full employment. The Action Plan for Jobs, which was launched on 13 February, outlines the Government's plan to rebuild the economy and create jobs.The first quarterly Progress Report on the implementation of the Action Plan was published on 20 April, and is available on my Department's website,www.djei.ie.  It shows that 80 of the 83 measures due to be delivered in the first Quarter of 2012 have been completed.  Some important deliverables already achieved under the Action Plan include the development of the Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme and the publication of legislation to bring it into effect, the launch of the “Succeed in Ireland”initiative, the design and launch of Enterprise Ireland’s Development Capital scheme, the enactment of pro-jobs measures in the Finance Bill, and the establishment of a new Education and Training Fund.  IDA Ireland’s Strategy, Horizon 2020, sets out its national targets to 2014 for direct job creation in the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) sector.  These targets include the creation of 62,000 direct jobs in 640 investment projects over the period, which could result in an additional 105,000 jobs overall in the economy. 50% of those investments will be targeted for locations outside of Dublin and Cork.This year, Enterprise Ireland has continued to drive the growth of client companies in overseas markets which in turn will support existing jobs and job creation in Ireland.  The ultimate objective is increased exports, employment and prosperity in Ireland.  The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) have continued to develop the potential of small and micro-enterprises through the provision of financial and technical support. The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector.  The jobs created with agency and CEB assistance contribute greatly to the development of local economies throughout the country and, in addition, the agencies and CEBs work closely with their clients both in the early start-up stages of businesses and also to ensure the sustainability of those businesses through on-going support, advice and mentoring.I am confident that the measures outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs together with the other initiatives being pursued will bring about the employment and investment opportunities necessary for economic growth.Enterprise IrelandIDA IrelandShannon DevelopmentCounty and City Enterprise Boards9,03811,5944067,253
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	315	A study published in October 2011 by Forfás entitled "The Games Sector in Ireland: An Action Plan for Growth”   states that employment in the games sector had increased five fold to 2,500 since 2004. The report estimates that employment in the sector could double by the end of 2014 if appropriate action is taken to support the sector in Ireland.  The actions that Forfás has set out are critical enablers, not only for the games sector, but also have a much broader application across all enterprises operating in the wider digital economy.  The analysis also reveals a number of challenges that remind us that while potential is there, growth is not assured, and we need to take actions to ensure that this sector will continue to thrive here.In order to build upon the Forfás study, the whole of Government has committed, through its Action Plan for Jobs, to exploit the opportunities offered by the digital games sector and to address the challenges posed in this regard. The Action Plan outlines a number of Actions that will be implemented in the latter half of this year. These include providing a clear commitment to:Establish, by mid year, a Clustering Development Team to support the implementation of actions called for in the Forfás Games Strategy. The membership of this team is currently being finalised and it is intended that the Team will hold their first meeting shortly;Convene an R&D supports workshop to promote awareness about available R&D supports and issue an enterprise friendly guide on R&D tax credits to include examples of relevance to games companies;Support industry in working with third level institutions to introduce a pilot game development/publishing "hothouse" initiative for undergraduate and Post Leaving Certificate courses.  The initiative will bring together, in multi disciplinary teams, students from games, multimedia and animation courses (from a range of participating PLC and third level colleges) to work together on a game development project for a defined period.  Each of the teams will receive mentor support from industry practitioners;Undertake a feasibility study to examine what structures and policies could be developed to make Ireland a world  centre for managing and trading in intellectual property;Compilation of the report of the Copyright Review Committee on barriers to innovation;Assess the case for a new financial instrument/relief to incentivise creative content development; and,Progress measures in relation to Next Generation Broadband.Progress in implementing these actions will be monitored on a quarterly basis.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	answer	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 37 together.Under the Europe 2020 Strategy, the European Council adopted a number of headline targets, including improving the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 3% of GDP. In accordance with the Strategy, Member States have adopted national targets on the basis of these headline targets, as set out in their National Reform Programmes, taking account of their relative starting positions and national circumstances. Ireland's National Reform Programme, transmitted to the European Commission on 29 April 2011, specified that Ireland's 2020 target in relation to R&D is to improve the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 2.5% of GNP (approximately equivalent to 2.0% of GDP).The latest available data on total research and development expenditure in the State, known as Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD), relates to the year 2010, and indicates that GERD as a percentage of GNP was 2.16% or 1.77% of GDP. Approximately two thirds of this expenditure is by the private sector.  The National Reform Programme outlined a number of assumptions to reach the target for expenditure on R&D by 2020, in relation to the period up to and including 2014, in the context of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support, and subsequently on the basis of a return to sustainable growth domestically and a recovered global economy.  This growth will be driven through a continuation of a supportive fiscal environment for R&D investment as well as supports for higher education R&D, industry linkages with higher education researchers, commercialisation of research results, in-company R&D and start-up companies.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	317	Enterprise Ireland receives budgetary funding from the Exchequer reflecting national priorities in the support of indigenous industry and the development of the knowledge economy.  Value for Money and generating economic return are key principles in the work of the Agency, necessarily supported by effective targeting and performance monitoring.Enterprise Ireland's performance is assessed at a number of levels:Oireachtas level: Oireachtas oversight of the activities of the agency, Comptroller and Auditor General audit of financial statements in Annual Report and Accounts, attendance at a range of Oireachtas committees including the Committee of Public Accounts, and Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education, targets/deliverables in line with national strategies, e.g. Food Harvest 2020, and the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 for which quarterly deliverables are reported upon.Departmental level: reviews of agency outputs by the Minister and Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in a variety of fora, including formal liaison meetings, monthly reporting and performance budgeting.Organisational level: the Board (and Executive Committee) of Enterprise Ireland has established clear processes related to the measurement and oversight of agency performance including the development of strategic, corporate and operational plans with associated performance metrics and targets.This process of performance monitoring will be strengthened with the introduction of a detailed Service Level Agreement between the Department and the Agency which is currently being drafted.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I acknowledge that difficulties have been experienced by some successful claimants before the various employment rights adjudication bodies in enforcing awards made by those bodies.There are no statistics available by which I can gauge the level of unimplemented determinations of employment rights bodies. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation currently has discretion to pursue enforcement proceedings on behalf of claimants under certain employment rights enactments. This role is carried out by NERA on my behalf. Likewise, the Minister for Justice and Equality has similar discretion under equality legislation and family protective leave enactments. Alternatively, individual claimants can take enforcement proceedings themselves or through their trade union. In cases that NERA has pursued the success rate has been poor.In order to have credibility a system of employment rights adjudication must be backed up by an efficient and effective enforcement regime. Therefore there is a need for a robust method of enforcement of awards.  TheBlueprint document which the Deputy refers to highlighted that fact that there is a general consensus that enforcement is becoming increasingly difficult and ineffective and that a faster, more robust, and cheaper method of enforcement of determinations of the employment rights bodies is required. Respondents to the Blueprint again confirmed the need for an effective and user-friendly system of enforcement of awards under employment legislation.It is my intention, having considered the difficulties inherent in the current enforcement system and having given due regard to the observations and suggestions of interested parties in both sets of consultations to date, to design and legislate for  a revised system for the enforcement of all determinations made under the reformed adjudication structures.  I will be outlining my proposals in this regard in the coming weeks in a Policy Paper which is being prepared in order to inform the members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education in relation to the Workplace Relations Reform Programme.  It is my intention to engage in a dialogue with the Committee so that the views of the Committee can inform the detailed design of the reform and the subsequent drafting of the Workplace Relations Bill that will give statutory effect to the reforms including strengthening of the enforcement of awards.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	319	North South economic co-operation is and will remain a priority for myself and the Government. To this effect, there is ongoing dialogue between relevant Ministers, North and South, in all areas to promote economic development in the border region.From my own perspective, I attend meetings in the trade and business development sectoral format of the North South Ministerial Council which are held twice a year.  I also attend two meetings each year of the North South Plenary which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers. At these meetings there is full engagement with Northern Ministers, particularly at the sectoral meetings where I have face-to-face discussions with my NI counterpart on issues around cross-border trade and the work of InterTradeIreland, the North/South Implementation Body whose remit is to ‘exchange information and co-ordinate work on trade, business development and related matters in areas where the two administrations specifically agree it would be in their mutual interest’.  InterTrade Ireland is co-funded by my Department and its counterpart in Northern Ireland.My officials engage in ongoing dialogue with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and keep me informed of all key North/South related issues including the North/South activities of the enterprise development agencies.  In fact, there is a long history of co-operative action between North/South enterprise agencies to achieve mutual benefits.  The enterprise development agencies, North and South of the border, have for many years co-operated where this has added value to their activities, and this collaboration has greatly increased in recent years. Enterprise Ireland, which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes.  IDA Ireland collaborates with Invest Northern Ireland, for example, in the Northwest Now initiative. More recently, there have been very positive developments where a wide range of agencies and institutions now co-operate on science and technology issues, including participation in the EU Research Framework Programme.In addition, my Department provides funding support for enterprise-themed Interreg projects jointly approved with DETI.  Through Interreg, my Department has supported a number of North/South projects, including enterprise networking for the border counties and Northern Ireland.  The process of assessing further Interreg projects for joint funding is ongoing.  The Government, along with the enterprise development agencies, will continue to work diligently with the Northern Ireland Executive and its agencies to increase the economic benefits accruing from cross-border co-operation and the work of the North South Bodies, particularly in the border region.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The Cross-Border Economic Renewal Report is a very comprehensive report published by the Centre for Cross Border Studies.  The report represents a comprehensive assessment of a wide range of factors that could be pursued in relation to cross border regeneration.  It provides a good historical background and a strategic framework within which a competitive future for the border region of the island could be developed.  This is worth considering in the wider all-island approach to economic development, especially in the border counties. The report also provides a useful insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the cross-border regional economy, focusing in particular on the manufacturing sector and the potential for manufacturing in the border region.  My Department is currently considering the contents of the Cross Border Studies Report and its proposals, including the proposal regarding a new development strategy for the border region referred to as a ‘Border Development Zone'.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	321	Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) was established in 2000 with a mission to build and strengthen Ireland's scientific and engineering research capacity and human capital in the areas of greatest strategic value to Ireland's long-term competitiveness and enterprise development. This was one of a range of key industrial policy initiatives taken to grow our employment value chain as decades of relative under-funding had left Ireland lacking internationally competitive research and development capability and human capital in areas of strategic national interest. This was deemed to be an impediment to attracting large-scale international R&D-based firms and to building knowledge-based, internationally competitive indigenous firms.Since 2000, SFI, along with significant research investments supported through Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Higher Education Authority amongst others, Ireland has developed an internationally recognised and credible research base. Following the Government's approval of the Research Prioritisation report, the next phase of Ireland's research system evolution places the emphasis on areas with the greatest potential for economic return.  Since its establishment SFI has managed a portfolio of award programmes to support scientific and engineering research ranging from early career researchers to large research centres with multiple industry collaborations.  The overriding criteria in determining what investments SFI supports are research excellence allied to relevance to Ireland's enterprise base.Through its various programmes SFI now supports over 500 research groups, comprising approximately 3,000 team members, located across Ireland's higher education institutions.  Many of these research groups have established very significant collaborations with industry and this is strong evidence of the maturing of the SFI investment.To build on this level of engagement with industry and ensure further economic impact for Ireland, SFI recently called for proposals under the newly developed SFI Research Centres programme. The programme builds upon the success of the SFI Centres for Science Engineering and Technology (CSET) and Strategic Research Clusters (SRC) programmes.  Successful SFI Research Centres will have to achieve and maintain at least 30% of their overall centre budget in industry contributions. There is a requirement that 10% of this be a cash contribution. Not only does this ensure that the Exchequer gets best value for its investment, it will ensure that the needs and opportunities of industry are well represented and are reflected in the research programme. SFI, in devising the new Research Centres programme, has placed a greater emphasis on flexibility and responsiveness to industry-related opportunities, and researchers will be in a position to embrace additional targeted projects and extend their outreach with commercial stakeholders.  SFI is currently assessing pre-proposal applications under the new Centres programme. The initial call has demonstrated a clear demand from industry for this focused engagement — over 450 companies are involved in the 35 pre-proposals submitted to SFI.SFI has put in place a balanced portfolio of award programmes that supports excellent research while ensuring that funded research groups are in a position to convert and commercialise this research in collaboration with industry. As part of the enterprise development system in Ireland, SFI will continue to fund top-class research with impact and train people that will play a critical role in attracting, retaining, growing and forming companies in Ireland.

A total of more than 162,000 people (full and part-time) directly rely on Enterprise Ireland client companies for their employment.It is important to note that Enterprise Ireland created 9,038 jobs in 2011 in what was a challenging economic environment, both here and in our overseas markets.  While I accept that there was a net loss, it should be noted that the number of full time jobs lost in Enterprise Ireland assisted companies reached their lowest level in 10 years.  These results represent a critical stabilisation of employment among EI client companies. A significant proportion of the losses sustained in employment over the last three years is linked to the impacts of a construction sector downturn which has also impacted a large number of companies providing products, services and materials for use by that sector. Among the sectors reporting a net increase in full time employment in 2011 were Food; Machinery and Equipment; Electronics (Electrical Equipment); Engineering (Basic and Fabricated Metal Products); Transport Equipment; Mining and Quarrying; Medical instruments and supplies; Computer programming, consultancy and related activities; and Other Information/Communication Services.The Action Plan for Jobs contains over 270 actions to be implemented by all 15 Government Departments as well as 36 State agencies, and is intended to improve supports for job-creating businesses and remove barriers to employment-creation across the economy.  A significant element of the Plan falls to Enterprise Ireland for implementation and key actions on which EI has already delivered include:The launch of the newPotential Exporters Division   in Enterprise Ireland to support more indigenous companies to trade in foreign markets, and a new programme of supports, “Get Export Ready” tailored specifically for pre-export and early stage exporting companies.Design and launch of a new Development Capital Scheme, aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth, indigenous companies with significant prospects for jobs and export growth.Issuing of a global second call under Innovation Fund Ireland to top venture capitalists to signal their interest in establishing a presence in Ireland, with investment by Government of more than €60 million in venture capital funds which establish a presence in Ireland.Establishment of a new Enterprise Ireland/IDA Ireland Senior Management Team to drive effective collaboration on key priorities.As we continue the step-by-step process of rebuilding the economy, Enterprise Ireland, as the lead agency responsible for driving growth of Irish companies in overseas markets, will play a significant role in delivering real progress in job creation.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	323	It is an inevitable, but unfortunate, consequence that as a result of the reorganisation of the banking sector, redundancies will arise in that sector.  Essentially, our banks need to adjust their operations downwards in order to service the present real economy.The Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has primary responsibility for the banking sector and has taken the lead in terms of the Government's approach to the announcement of major redundancy programmes in the banking sector. The Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection also have important roles to play, in addition to my own Department.In terms of my Department's role, the Labour Relations Commission was actively involved with the parties in a number of the covered institutions, facilitating agreement between them as to the detail and terms of the very significant redundancy programmes in those financial institutions. The achievement of agreement on such matters contributes to a positive transition in these very difficult circumstances for those employees who volunteer to leave those organisations. The services of the State's Industrial Relations bodies remain available to the banking sector as required.In addition, the services of the Enterprise Development Agencies — Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards will also be readily available to those who may be interested in starting new businesses and to help them to make informed decisions as they consider their options for the future.  Additionally, IDA Ireland will keep a particular focus on marketing the skills which are coming on stream as a result of redundancies in the financial sector, to potential investors in Ireland.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I am committed to delivering a world-class workplace relations service. I am determined that the new structures and systems that are designed and implemented will be ones that we and future generations can be proud of.  The reform I am proposing will bring about major improvements while incorporating the best practice elements of existing dispute resolution bodies.  My aim is to provide a simple, independent, effective, impartial, and workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.  The system will operate to the highest standards and earn the confidence of employers, employees and all who will use it.Ireland has an excellent record in relation to equality matters. Ireland was in fact one of the first countries to give effect to the European Equality Directives.  The Employment Equality Act 1998 not alone transposed the Directives in place at that time but also anticipated future Directives.  The reforms I am now proposing will modernise and enhance the redress mechanisms available to those who believe they have not been treated equally in the workplace on the grounds set out in the Equality Acts.In addition to enhancing the equality redress mechanisms, I am committed to putting in place reformed Workplace Relations structures and processes that fully embody the spirit of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. To achieve this, detailed design and drafting of the legislation will be proofed against the requirements of the Charter.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The Government's Action Plan for Jobs outlines a number of actions to ensure that Ireland can reap substantial benefits in terms of jobs and growth from the global expansion of cloud computing. It recognises the opportunity for Ireland to promote the growth of cloud computing by supporting the emergence of start-up companies providing technology solutions and services in cloud computing and by simulating its take up and use by small businesses.I am pleased to confirm that two of the actions in the Action Plan, which are designed to ensure that SMEs across Ireland can exploit the opportunities offered by cloud computing, have been implemented. In April I announced details of the €1.2 million industry led Cloud Computing Research Centre which is being funded by Government. This centre brings together a team of researchers from DCU, UCC and Athlone Institute of Technology with a cohort of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland companies to establish ways to generate business from cloud computing. One of the priority objectives for the team is to conduct research on maintaining and managing cloud based applications for businesses of all sizes.On 22 May I launched new standards which were developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland in partnership with the Irish Internet Association (IIA) to help increase the number of Irish enterprises to successfully provide and procure cloud computing services. The new standards are designed to provide guidance to enterprises of all sizes on the various issues that need to be considered when moving to cloud computing. They are intended for use as a means of assessing cloud adoption prioritisation and suitability as they provide a comprehensive roadmap for businesses to encompass all cloud delivery and deployment models.A number of other actions, which will assist micro enterprise and SMEs provide cloud computing services and avail of the opportunities offered by cloud computing, are being progressed this year in accordance with the Action Plan. These include:providing support to industry groups, such as the Irish Software Association, to develop and deliver a practical tool kit to assist SMEs in assessing the adoption of cloud computing for their business;examining the potential for demonstration projects in cloud computing to promote Ireland as a centre of excellence for this technology, and, to provide a reference site for Irish companies, while potentially lowering costs and improving services; and,supporting research groups in areas of relevance to exploitation of cloud computing, such as semantic web and financial stock analysis, through, for example, support for the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI). In other areas, such as middleware, information security and distributed computing, researchers are furthering research in this area with direct application in the cloud computing context.Progress reports on all of these actions will be provided on a quarterly basis throughout the year.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	326	A range of initiatives have been put in place over the last thirty years to enhance Ireland's competitive strengths in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). These include competitive tax offerings, a commitment to increase levels of R&D activity, investment in higher education to produce a suitably skilled workforce and the provision of high quality, tailored property solutions for inward investors. This policy has been successfully implemented with the result that the FDI sector that is supported by IDA Ireland accounts for around 250,000 jobs (1 in every 7 jobs) in the economy. FDI is a key stimulator and driver of the economy through its contribution to exchequer finances, exports and R&D, generating over 70% of corporation tax, €110bn in exports and expenditure of €19bn in the Irish economy.Historically, manufacturing has been a significant segment of IDA's investment portfolio and it will continue to remain so into the future.  Higher technological investment and higher value products are the hallmark of future manufacturing operations in Ireland. These operations are knowledge, capital and skills intensive, typified by a participative innovative culture where management and staff continuously collaborate to drive innovation, productivity, agility, learning and adaptability.  The Government's Action Plan for Jobs recognises the potential offered by high valued added manufacturing and, in accordance with the Plan, IDA Ireland will continue to attract new investment into high value added activities manufacturing.Innovation Technology will continue to be a key driver of economic recovery. IDA Ireland is working with Enterprise Ireland to support an industry consortium approach on a range of applied research initiatives through the Technology Centres Programme. Nine Technology Centres have been established where research is being conducted in the following areas:Food for HealthInternational Energy Research CentreBiorefining and BioenergyIT InnovationApplied NanotechnologyComposite MaterialsMicroelectronicsManufacturing ResearchEnergy EfficiencyThree further Technology Centres are due to be established shortly to focus on Learning Technologies, Financial Services and Cloud Computing. In addition, four centres, addressing the themes of Medical Device Technologies, Drug Production Technologies, Connected Health and Data Analytics are under active exploration with industry partners with a view to establishing what an effective and desirable research collaboration agenda would consist of. Services activities are now the prime drivers of growth in the developed and developing economies of the world creating over 60% of global employment.  Ireland is now a successful services economy with two-thirds of the workforce engaged in services and ranks as the 10th   highest exporter of services in the world. Ireland provides a low-risk, quick start-up, high-performance, knowledge economy for service companies. Services companies in Ireland have delivered better customer service, provided innovative business solutions and reduced costs enabling increased shareholder value.Ireland has earned the reputation as one of Europe's leading locations for shared service centres.  With its abundant, high quality IT, financial and HR skills, Ireland continues to attract shared services operations to serve European and global markets.  Companies operating in the internationally traded services sector have located and expanded here because of Ireland's knowledgeable/innovative workforce, low risk environment, excellent infrastructure and favourable corporate tax rate.The Government's Action Plan for Jobs has set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020. Our ability to attract new FDI will play a key role in this regard. For that reason, the Government has tasked IDA Ireland with the target of winning another 144 new FDI investment projects in 2012, which will create 12,500 new jobs with an associated 8,750 in the wider economy, giving a total impact of 21,250.  Good progress is being made as, at end of May 2012, there had been 44 IDA announcements to date in 2012 with in excess of 5,000 jobs.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	327	On March 1st 2012 the Government published the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group, which is now Government policy and a key pillar of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.As a consequence of the prioritisation process the changes to Science Foundation Ireland's (SFI) pre-selection procedure have only been recently introduced and therefore we should be cautious in making conclusions at this early stage.  The objective of the change is to further increase the quality and diversity as well as the impact of the research supported by SFI.SFI has responded very quickly in using impact and the alignment of the Government's new research priority areas to help assess its major research funding decisions in the months ahead.In February 2012 SFI issued a call for proposals under the new SFI Research Centres Programme. This centres based programme builds upon the success of the SFI Centres for Science Engineering and Technology (CSET) and Strategic Research Clusters (SRC) programmes, while taking on board all that SFI has learned in the past 12 years since establishment.The new programme will address the needs of industry by ensuring that, up-front, the research programmes of each Research Centre will be aligned with one or more of the prioritisation areas identified by the Research Prioritisation Steering Group.  In addition to the rigorous scientific evaluation for which SFI is already very well regarded, proposals received by SFI under the 2012 call will receive a thorough and rigorous evaluation of the potential impact that the Research Centre may deliver to the industry sector, as well as the Irish economy as a whole.As part of the Research Centres Programme call process, SFI has used an impact panel of leading investors in science, leaders of industry and internationally competitive research centres to help it assess the strategic value of the research projects it is considering at the pre-proposal state.  Overall, having some assessment based on impact and commercialisation criteria can provide a very useful mechanism, but only when made in the context of research excellence. This will ensure that the SFI Research Centres that are established have demonstrated their relevance and potential to contribute to the success of industry based in Ireland. In undertaking this strategic pre-proposal review SFI was mindful to ensure that research with less obvious or immediate impact is not ignored.  These changes will build on SFI's established and well regarded independent international review process.It is anticipated that the actual awards arising from the 2012 Research Centres Programme call process will be announced early in Quarter 1, 2013.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	329	In 2010, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (and IMPACT acting on behalf of their airline pilot members in Ryanair) submitted a complaint to the Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Labour Organisation that Ireland was not in conformity with the provisions of ILO Convention No. 98 — Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949.The complaint involved allegations of anti-union discrimination and the refusal to engage in good faith collective bargaining on the part of Ryanair, as well as the failure of labour legislation to provide adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and promote collective bargaining.The ICTU complaint arises as a result of the 2007 Supreme Court decision in the Ryanair case.The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association considered the submissions during the March session of the ILO Governing Body. The Committee's findings were1) As the information available to the ILO Committee is insufficient to determine whether the alleged offer by Ryanair of conditional benefits to employees provided that the company would not be required to enter into a collective bargaining relationship with the union, the Committee requests the Government to ensure that the protection available against anti-union discrimination would adequately cover such acts, including through a thorough review of the protective measures with the social partners concerned.2) The Committee requests the Government to carry out an independent inquiry without delay into the alleged acts of employer interference in order to establish the facts of this specific case and, if necessary, to take the necessary measures to ensure full respects of the principles of freedom of association.3) Noting the commitment on collective bargaining in the Programme for Government, the Committee invites the Government, in full consultation with the social partners, to review the existing framework and consider any appropriate measures, including legislative, so as to ensure respect for the freedom of association and collective bargaining principles set out in its conclusions, including through the review of the mechanisms available with a view to promoting machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers' and workers' organisations for the determination of terms and conditions of employment.I welcome the fact that the ILO report did not find Ireland to be in breach of its obligations under ILO Conventions in respect of collective bargaining rights. Neither did the ILO find that a resolution of the difficulties arising over the Ryanair judgement would require the introduction of a legal regime of mandatory trade union recognition.The ILO's formal request for the Government's response to the Committees' findings was received on 25 May. The preparation of a formal response to the recommendations made to the Government is currently receiving attention.

We are working with our EU partners to ensure that, in addition to a focus on the political and security situation, priority is given by the international community to the vital issue of humanitarian access to people and communities affected by the conflict and the tension in the region.  We will continue to use all available opportunities, within the EU and internationally, to raise these issues.   The situation in Sudan and South Sudan, including the humanitarian crisis in Southern Kordofan, has been discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at their meetings over recent weeks and months.  In January, with Ireland's encouragement, the EU urged the Government of Sudan to allow safe and unhindered access for international humanitarian workers to all civilians, and reiterated its readiness to provide humanitarian assistance. The EU also emphasised that the ongoing conflicts in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur remain obstacles to progress in providing the full range of support that we would like to provide to Sudan, and in the region.  In April, the EU called on the Government of Sudan and the SPLM North to engage in an inclusive political process to resolve the ongoing conflict.The UN Security Council on 2 May and 17 May adopted Resolutions demanding that both Sudan and South Sudan fulfil their obligations under international law to allow access by humanitarian agencies to civilian populations in need of assistance.  Through Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government has provided substantial assistance for those affected by the conflict in this region.  Earlier this year, we allocated €2 million for the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Funds for both the Republic of Sudan and South Sudan.  On 24 May, we announced an allocation of a further €3m in funding.  These funds are being provided to help UN agencies and NGOs target the most critical humanitarian needs across both countries, including in areas affected by conflict and by displacement of populations from the Blue Nile and South Kordofan areas.  We have made available a further €1.22 million to Irish NGOs for programmes in Sudan and South Sudan under the annual Irish Aid Humanitarian Programme Planning funding scheme.Ireland's emergency humanitarian assistance to Sudan and South Sudan is saving lives daily.  The Government will continue to monitor closely the situation in South Kordofan, the Blue Nile, and other areas facing critical need across the Horn and Sahel regions of Africa.  Along with our EU partners, we will continue to press for unrestricted humanitarian access to affected civilians.

For the purposes of the relief "health expenses" means expenses in relation to the provision of health care, being expenses representing, among other items, the cost of the services of a practitioner.  The legislation defines a "practitioner" as a person who is:(a) registered in the register established under section 43 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007,(b) registered in the register established under section 26 of the Dentists Act, 1985, or,(c) in relation to health care provided outside the State, entitled under the laws of the country in which the care is provided to practice medicine or dentistry there.Expenses incurred for services by a person who is not a "practitioner" as defined above do not qualify for health expenses relief.I do not intend changing the policy in relation to this matter at this time.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the purposes of Capital Acquisitions Tax (Gift and Inheritance Tax), the relationship between the person who provided the gift or inheritance (the disponer) and the person who received the gift or inheritance (the beneficiary) determines the maximum tax-free threshold, known as the Group threshold, below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.  There are three separate Group tax-free thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.  For gifts and inheritances from parents to children, which is the subject of the Deputy's question, the threshold is €250,000.When calculating whether a beneficiary has received benefits in excess of his or her group tax-free threshold, any other gifts and inheritances received by that beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same group are also taken into account.If the total value of all inheritances and gifts received by the beneficiary since this date from within the same group exceeds the group tax-free threshold, a 30% rate of Capital Acquisitions Tax will apply on the difference.Apart from the group tax-free thresholds available to a beneficiary, the Capital Acquisitions Tax code contains significant reliefs and exemptions such as the Dwelling House Exemption, Business Relief and Agricultural Relief.Where a gift or inheritance consists of business property, the value of the business may be reduced by 90% provided certain conditions are met.Business property relief applies only to trading activities. Businesses consisting of the owning and letting of properties are excluded from business relief because the rental earning aspect is an investment activity rather than a trading activity. Investment activities are specifically excluded from business relief.Therefore, the position is that children inheriting property from parents, who were making their sole living as landlords, would not be in a position to reduce the value of those properties by 90% for the purposes of calculating Capital Acquisitions Tax.  They can claim the Group A tax-free threshold of €250,000 and may be able to claim other reliefs, depending on their circumstances.I have no plans to extend CAT business property relief to cover investment properties.

Due to an administrative error, underpayments of Income Tax arose in respect of the persons who are the subject of this question, for the years 2010 and 2011.  This resulted in the issue of incorrect tax credit certificates to their employers.  These certificates granted the individuals additional tax credits that they were not in fact entitled to.Revenue have apologised for this error, and agreed to spread the collection of the underpayment over three years commencing from January 2013 in recognition of their error.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are a number of options available to an individual who feels aggrieved with their treatment by Revenue.  In the first instance, the individual should contact the Revenue Office dealing with their tax affairs and make that Office aware of the particular complaint so that the matter can be investigated.  Additionally, an aggrieved taxpayer can ask for an internal review to be carried out either: by a senior Revenue official who was not involved in the original decision, or jointly by an External Reviewer and the Revenue official mentioned above.Requests for an internal review can be made to: Revenue Commissioners, Internal Review Unit, Dublin Castle, Dublin 2.  Furthermore, there is a right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners where a taxpayer is dissatisfied with an assessment or determination by the Revenue Commissioners.A person can also contact the Office of the Ombudsman if they are unhappy about the way in which Revenue have handled any aspect of their tax affairs.  The Ombudsman's staff examine complaints about the administrative actions of Government Departments and Offices, including the Revenue Commissioners.  Contact details are as follows: Office of the Ombudsman, 18 Lower Leeson St., Dublin 2.Lastly, the Commissioners advise that the complaints procedures are explained in detail in their Customer Service leaflet CS 4, which is available on the Revenue website.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	336	Section 149(1) of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended) requires Credit Institutions to submit a notification to the Central Bank of Ireland of their intention to introduce a new charge or increase an existing charge imposed on customers for a service.  Furthermore Section 149A of the Act extends this notification requirement to the ‘holders of an authorisation'; namely bureaux de change.  Following submission, the Central Bank considers these requests assessing each under the following criteria, as set out in the legislation: the promotion of fair competition, the commercial justification submitted in respect of the proposal, the impact new charges or increases in existing charges will have on customers, passing on costs to customers.Having analysed the proposed charge(s) under the assessment criteria as set out under the legislation and referred to above, the options open to the Central Bank are that the proposed charges are:approved in full,approved at lower levels than requested by the entity or,rejected.Approvals are issued in the form of a ‘Letter of Direction' which sets out the maximum amount a credit institution can charge.  It is important to note that: it is an offence under the Act for credit institutions to impose charges that have not been notified to the Central Bank and subsequently been approved, where approval has  been granted to a credit institution, it may introduce these charges up to that maximum approved limit.  However, an institution may choose not to apply charges immediately for which it has approval for commercial or competitive reasons but may later apply such charges at its own discretion.I have no plans to amend the current legislation in this area.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The Revenue Commissioners are aware of the threat that oil laundering and the sale of laundered fuel pose to the Exchequer and to legitimate businesses, and accord a high priority to action to combat these illegal activities.  Revenue is addressing the problem on a number of fronts, including robust enforcement action against those involved in these activities.  To date in 2012, Revenue's enforcement officers have seized five oil laundries and 95,050 litres of laundered fuel, together with two oil tankers and five other vehicles.  Two people were arrested during the course of these operations, which play a crucial role in cutting off the supply of laundered fuel.  Following the strengthening last year of the conditions governing the sale of road fuel, Revenue has implemented a programme of action against filling stations operating without a licence or in breach of licence conditions.  These compliance measures, which resulted in the closure of 32 filling stations in 2011 and a further 12 to date in 2012, are continuing.  Revenue will maintain its approach of seizing illicit fuel and closing down retail outlets that do not have the required licence or fail to comply with licence requirements.In the case of County Longford, a number of outlets in the Lanesborough area have been visited in recent months and two have had product seized from them.  Revenue officers are continuing to monitor retail activity in that area and, indeed, throughout the State.  If the Deputy or a member of the public has any information in this regard it should be conveyed to the appropriate authorities.  This important work that Revenue is undertaking against criminal activity in the fuel market will be assisted by the measures I included in the Finance Act 2012 to enhance the control and supervision of the supply chain for fuels.There will be a new requirement for anyone dealing in marked fuel to have a licence for the purpose and fuel traders will have to submit a detailed electronic return to Revenue each month giving information on oil receipts and sales.  Action is being taken in conjunction with HM Revenue and Customs in the UK to identify a more effective marker for fuels.  I understand it is expected that an invitation to make submissions in relation to the provision of a new marker will be issued shortly.

The legislation to give effect to this was introduced by way of Section 9 Finance Act 2012 and provides that the new 30% rate of tax relief applies to qualifying interest paid on a qualifying loan taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2008. In addition, I have sought to be as flexible as possible within the constraints pertaining.  A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period.  I do not intend to extend the parameters of the measure any further as it would become less targeted and more costly.

The practical implementation of the recommendation will include direct inspections of relevant audit files by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.  In addition, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is involved in EU negotiations on two proposals in the audit area, in which there is a focus on the provision of specific requirements regarding the statutory audit of public-interest entities.  The definition of "public-interest entities" will include a wider range of financial service providers than heretofore.In so far as my own Department is concerned, the Central Bank of Ireland has issued an Auditor Protocol which provides a framework to allow the Central Bank and the auditing profession to exchange relevant information on a timely basis with the aim of enhancing the regulatory and statutory audit processes.  The framework governs communication between the Central Bank and auditors, providing a structure for bilateral meetings between the Central Bank and auditors and trilateral meetings between the Central Bank, auditors and the audit committee or independent non-executive director of regulated entities.  The Auditor Protocol came into effect this year and will apply, in the first instance, to those firms which are rated high impact under the Central Bank's new regulatory risk model, PRISM.  The implementation of this protocol follows on from the Nyberg report, which recommended that auditors should have a regular, compulsory dialogue with its clients' senior management and boards on the business model, strategy and implementation risks.  The report also recommended that the result of such discussions should, at least when clearly relevant, be communicated to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 is to be amended to make provision to support this closer engagement between auditors and the Central Bank.

The 2009 National Assessments of Mathematics and English Reading, which are the most recent in this series of national assessments, provide baseline data for future national assessments in mathematics and English reading at second and sixth class but are not directly comparable with previous assessments.  In 2009, test scores were grouped into four proficiency levels, or clusters of skill sets and competencies describing what pupils are likely to be able to do.  Those proficiency levels are described in the report of the 2009 National Assessments, which is available on the website of the Educational Research Centre,www.erc.ie.  To facilitate comparability across classes and subjects, the cutpoints used to create each proficiency scale were based on pre-defined percentages of pupils.  Thus, 10% of pupils were classified as at Level 4; 25% at Level 3; 30% at Level 2; and 25% at Level 1, with 10% of pupils described as failing to reach Level 1.  The next national assessments in 2014 will facilitate direct comparison with the 2009 results.  The National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, which I launched in July 2011, contains a range of actions to improve the literacy and numeracy skills of children and young people up to 2020.  These actions are being implemented.

Copy of accounts (that is, trading account, profit and loss account, capital account and balance sheet) for each business for the year ending between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2010. The accounts extracts pages from the applicant's Return of Income do not satisfy this accounts requirement;2. Adjusted Profit Computation for income tax for the 2010 tax year;3. Notice of Assessment for 2010 or its foreign equivalent;4. If it applies a current letter from the Revenue Commissioners exempting the relevant person from filing tax returns or equivalent from another state;5. If the accounts contain a wage or remuneration expense, a detailed breakdown of wages paid to the following as outlined in Article 22 (1)(d) must be provided:wages or payments made without applying the PAYE and PRSI regulations or equivalent regulations;wages or payments to dependent children;wages or payments to non-dependent children where the payment is above the norm for the work undertaken.For Revenue purposes certain expenditure is allowable in arriving at taxable profit/loss but may not be allowable in computing reckonable income for grant purposes. Therefore, a set of accounts must be submitted to allow for the accurate calculation of reckonable income for a student grant. An applicant shall not be eligible for a grant if the reckonable income for the purpose of the means testing is over the prescribed income limits or if there is insufficient supporting documentation for the application to be assessed.

The Regional Aid Guidelines govern the areas in which Member States may grant regional aid, more commonly known as investment aid.  Investment aid is intended to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the European Union in order to redress regional disparities.  The current Regional Aid Map for 2007-13 was drawn up in accordance with the Commission's Regional Aid Guidelines.  The details of the support in terms of aid intensity for each county are available on my Departments website.Under the approved map, Kerry, Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary and the Cork Urban Regeneration Area retained entitlement to Regional Aid from 2007-2013 for small and medium sized firms at the higher aid rates permitted for such firms under the Regional Aid Guidelines.The process of Member States agreeing the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Guidelines has begun. The Commission are due to forward proposals to Member States in the coming months documenting the structure and provisions that will form the basis of the revised Guidelines. My Department is leading an interagency group that is currently examining issues around the new guidelines, including which counties could be included in the next map. The group will be examining all counties without prejudice as to their status in the revised map.

Following the launch of the Plan on 2 December 2011, I have been kept informed on the progress made by the stakeholders and the state enterprise development agencies on the implementation of the plan in the region.I had met with representatives of all the enterprise agencies, local authorities, CEBs, education institutions and other local representative groups on 24 November last year. That meeting was the first time that a group of that nature had met collectively with the focus solely on what can be done to improve the fortunes of the South East region. What has become clear from consultation with these stakeholders and agencies is the need for greater co-ordination of effort from all those with an interest in improving the enterprise potential of the region.I also held a Business Forum in Waterford as part of the regional launch of the Action Plan for Jobs in March this year where I had wide ranging discussions involving the enterprise agencies at local level and regional business representatives.  I will again meet with key representatives from the agencies and stakeholders within the coming weeks and it is my intention to maintain this engagement into the future as a means of monitoring the implementation of the proposals in this report.  I look forward greater co-operation and collaboration between all the various stakeholders across the South East region to pursue the Action Plan recommendations.

The new website will, over time, replace the existing Departmental website which has remained substantially unchanged for over ten years.  Design and development work is being carried out by pTools Software, who were selected under an open tendering process in a very competitive market.  The site is hosted in SunGard Availability Services.  The work being undertaken includes the delivery of a new web content management system which gives the Department a modern and flexible tool for managing web content and opens up options for consolidating existing diverse website platforms.  This incremental approach minimises risk and optimises the use of constrained personnel resources.  The new website platform presents a much more sophisticated tool than the existing website to draw data from the Department’s diverse Offices and Agencies in real time to provide a holistic view of the enterprise agenda.  As a first step in maximising the value of the new web content management system, the new platform will also be used to host a separate website which delivers guidance and support for businesses in understanding the regulations which apply to them and which will be available shortly.

Information is collected annually and aggregated at county level.  The survey shows that in the 5 year period 2007 to 2011, there were a total of 45,512 jobs created in IDA supported companies. Figures for 2012 will not be available until the end of the year.Over 50% of the investment came from the United States. The remaining investment came in the main from Europe, mainly Germany, the United Kingdom and France, Japan, China, India Canada and the rest of the world.  The attached tabular statement lists all the countries of origin of IDA supported companies.Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been hugely important for the Irish economy and job creation over the last 30 years.  The IDA supported FDI sector alone accounts for around 250,000 jobs (1 in every 7 jobs ) in the economy. FDI is a key stimulator and driver of the economy through its contribution to exchequer finances, exports and R&D generating over 70% of corporation tax, €110bn in exports and an expenditure of €19bn in the Irish Economy.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21634	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	354	The Government has an ambition to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business by 2016. To achieve this objective, we must improve our international competitiveness and the competitiveness of companies based here.The Action Plan for Jobs, which was launched on 13th February, aims to transform the operating environment for business in order to improve competitiveness and support enterprise growth and job creation.  The Government has also identified, in the Action Plan, a number of key sectors where Ireland can gain competitive advantage in global markets, including in manufacturing and a number of services sectors.The National Competitiveness Council, in its annual Competitiveness Scorecard report, benchmarks Ireland's competitiveness performance against many of its closest trading partners and competitors.  The Council has identified an improvement in Ireland's competitiveness in recent years.  This improvement is reflected in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012, published in recent weeks by the Institute for Management Development (IMD).  Of the 59 countries benchmarked by the IMD for 2012, Ireland ranked 20th overall, up from 24th in 2011, and 8th out of the 24 EU countries featured.   Ireland was ranked first in a number of areas, including in relation to investment incentives, skilled labour and attitudes towards globalisation.This is a very positive and encouraging performance.  However, more must be done to ensure that the improvements we have achieved are structural in nature and sustained in the longer-term. One of the key actions to be undertaken by my Department and Forfás this year under the Action Plan for Jobs is to identify a set of competitiveness indicators where Ireland's international performance can be improved through domestic policy action.  In the areas identified, we will quantify the level of improvement necessary and we will set out the policy actions required to achieve this goal.

Enterprise Ireland in particular, employs a range of supports to encourage and facilitate Irish companies to adapt to, purchase and use new technologies.  Amongst these supports are:E-Business Initiative — under which companies are supported in making effective use of computer-based services including internet, customer relationship management, finance and general business administration.  Since 2005, almost 400 such supports have been offered.Over 250 projects have been initiated under the Lean Start or Lean Plus programmes which provide companies with the Lean tools and techniques to help companies to address competitiveness issues within their businesses by building their capability to identify problems and improve operations.A range of grant schemes have been offered particularly to support capital equipment investment for improved productivity, competitiveness and growth, including:  Productivity Improvement Fund;  Job Expansion Fund; Growth Fund; Company Expansions; Dairy Process Investment Initiative; Beef and Sheepmeat Fund; Scaling including R&D; HPSU Package.In addition, Enterprise Ireland leverages private sector investment in companies through its various Seed and Venture Capital supports which provide valuable investment capital to companies requiring major capital for growth.The competitive advantage created by the use of technology and innovation will be a key driver in achieving Irish economic recovery. Companies that undertake Research and Development and capitalise on innovation have shown a level of growth in trade and exports during recent years that demonstrates the value of technology, high calibre research and innovation activity. A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies —Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland  and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote innovation and cost efficiency and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place.Among the numerous measures that have been taken to help companies to achieve internationally high levels of innovation are:R&D Funding through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.Technology Centres have been established in strategically important sectoral areas like nanotechnology, bioenergy, IT Innovation, manufacturing technology, energy efficiency and food.  These centres are designed to allow groups of multinational and indigenous firms to work together with academics to undertake cutting edge, industry led research. The intention is to establish 16 centres in total by 2013.The Innovation Voucher Scheme is facilitating and encouraging enterprises, particularly small enterprises, to engage in research or development by availing of the services available in research institutions. 453 Innovation Vouchers were redeemed in 2011. The total number of Innovation Vouchers redeemed since the scheme opened in 2007 is over 1,800.In 2011, 52 companies were given support under the Innovation Partnership programme   which provided funding of €9.9m to Higher Education Institutes to collaborate with companies.The recently announced New Frontiers Programme   aims to raise the number of business start-ups and to increase the pipeline of HPSUs and other sustainable businesses. This new programme forms part of one of the action points set out in the Government's recently announced Action Plan for Jobs. The programme is currently being phased in across the country.

The first interviews for Phase 2 began in mid-May and four institutes have completed the recruitment process with 48 places offered on the 6 month courses taking place in their incubation centres.Collaboration between SFI funded researchers and industry has also increased significantly in recent years largely through the SFI Centres for Science Engineering Technology (CSETs), Strategic Research Clusters (SRCs) and the Principal Investigator (PI) teams. At present SFI is supporting 28 top-class research centres (9 CSETs and 19 SRCs) and SFI funded researchers are involved in 1,305 industry collaborations with 583 distinct industry partners, both multinational and indigenous.Both in 2010 and 2011, IDA investments of over €500m and €700m respectively were in research, development and innovation, and these investments are central to productivity and new business development in the multinational sector.The initiatives being delivered by the enterprise agencies are supporting enterprise and are ultimately geared towards driving growth, sustainability, exports and job creation. Our objective is to continue to use research and innovation to build competitive advantage and to build on the strengths that have emerged from the investment to date in Science Technology and Innovation.

This strategy has set a number of ambitious targets and its overall objective is to marshal and coordinate the resources of the State in a way that best supports companies which are trying to trade and grow their business overseas.   Implementation of the Strategy is driven by the Export Trade Council which has ensured that  trade, tourism and investment teams, comprising Irish diplomatic and agency representatives have, through a joined-up approach,  developed and are implementing market plans to support Ireland's trade objectives in many key export markets.The UK, USA and our Eurozone partners continue to be key markets for Ireland, given our strong knowledge and understanding of these markets and our shared historical and cultural linkages.  But we are also fully committed to developing and expanding engagement with key high potential markets such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, the Gulf States, South Korea and South Africa.  Each of these has been designated a key priority market and in the five years between 2006 and 2010, the last year for which full export data is available, Irish exports to these countries have risen by 56% with merchandise exports rising by 37% and services exports by 72%.Key instruments to pursue trade expansion are, of course, Trade Missions.  In 2012 a total of 19 Ministerial-led Trade Missions are planned, including missions between now and the end of the year, to the USA, India, UK, Russia, France, Brazil, Italy, China, Japan, Canada (plus Seattle USA), South Africa and three Gulf States.Enterprise Ireland is focused on helping its Irish client companies to maintain and win new sales from customers in international markets and has identified and targeted a number of priority sectors and sub-sectors in each individual market which offer clear opportunities.  Enterprise Ireland is working with those clients which have the expertise and experience to win sales and grow exports in each market.  The agency's overseas network of 29 offices is taking a highly sector-focused approach to markets which is yielding strong results in terms of export growth rates in priority high growth markets.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14428	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7), with a budget of €55 billion for the period 2007 to 2013, is the EU's main instrument for funding research and development in Europe. FP7 offers Ireland's SMEs, multinationals, and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts.  The Framework Programme enables companies to work with academic research groups and other industry players across Europe and derive the benefits associated with collaborative research. This enables them to gain benefits such as access to knowledge networks, access to specialist equipment, sharing of costs and risks and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening up commercial opportunities.The total funding secured by companies based in Ireland since the commencement of the Seventh Framework Programme in 2007 to November 2011, the latest figures available, is €87.8 million. The figure for 2011 was €25 million and the corresponding target for 2012 is €30 million.  Of the €87.8 million secured by companies based in Ireland, €66.4 million went to SMEs and €21.4 million went to multinationals based in Ireland.The European Commission, in its Fourth Monitoring Report on FP7, covering the years 2007 to 2010 and published in August 2011, states that, in one of the main funding programmes within FP7, Ireland has the highest participation rate of SMEs of the EU 27. This is the rate of SME participation in FP7 compared to the population of SME's in the country.  EU support for innovation is also provided through the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) which runs from 2007 to 2013, and which has a budget of €3.6 billion.  Unlike FP7, funding under the CIP does not go directly to companies; almost 50% of the funding is via European Investment Fund (EIF) Guarantees which are provided to financial intermediaries, and the remainder is used to fund actions such as best practice exchanges and provision of information networks through the Enterprise Europe Network.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	359	The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers. The average time taken to award a carers allowance application is 28 weeks at present, however individual cases may vary. Some will be processed more quickly, others will take longer.  In particular, where a customer requests a review of an initial decision to refuse an application, this will take additional time.In determining entitlement to the allowance, in certain cases unavoidable time lags are involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made. Delays can also arise if those applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim at original claim stage.A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to address the large increase in the claim-load and to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme. This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  In addition to the deployment of new systems, the Department is allocating additional resources in the form of overtime working and temporary staff to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  However, it is expected to be a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.  The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed with a view to ensuring claims are processed as quickly as possible. I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate steps to resolve the situation.  In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on an application, he/she may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment.

I have also outlined details on the State pension (transition) for the Deputy's information.In relation to the pension reform measure being introduced in September 2012, currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only €4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable.  A lower pension will be payable to new applicants for State pension who have a yearly average of less than 48 PRSI contributions which better relates to their PRSI record. This measure introduces additional rates bands for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) to more fairly reflect the attachment to the workforce by the claimant.The maximum rate will remain unchanged which is currently €230.30 per week.  The rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year will also remain unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  This change moves somewhat closer to the total contribution approach outlined below where those who pay more, benefit more.There is an important context to the proposed changes to State pension provision. Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, you will appreciate that savings have to be found in the social welfare system.There is also an important long-term policy context for the proposed changes to State pension, including the forthcoming change to pension rate bands being introduced for new customers from September 2012, which is that the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.Taking all of these factors into consideration, I introduced legislation in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 to abolish the State pension (transition) with effect from January 2014 which will standardise State pension age at 66.   State pension (contributory) age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 with effect from 2028.In the future, a ‘total contributions approach' to State pension will be adopted to replace the current averaging system.   The current proposed date for its introduction is 2020.   Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential in order to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.Yearly average contributionsPersonal Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged under 66 years Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged over 66 years Rate per week48 or over€230.30€153.50€206.3020-47€225.80€153.50€206.3015-19€172.70€115.10€154.7010-14€115.20€76.80€103.20Yearly average contributionsPersonal Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged under 66 years Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged over 66 years Rate per week48 or over€230.30€153.50€206.3040-47€225.80€146.00€196.0030-39€207.00€139.00€186.0020-29€196.00€130.00€175.0015-19€150.00€100.00€134.0010-14€92.00€61.00€83.00Yearly average contributionsPersonal Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged under 66 years Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged over 66 years Rate per week48 or over€230.30€153.50€206.3024-47€225.80€153.50€206.30Yearly average contributionsPersonal Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged under 66 years Rate per weekIncrease for Qualified Adult aged over 66 years Rate per week48 or over€230.30€153.50€206.3040-47€225.80€146.00€196.0030-39€207.00€139.00€186.0024-29€196.00€130.00€175.00

There are 2,200 places ring-fenced for childcare on Community Employment programmes.  These places are delivered through dedicated CE childcare projects and through the allocation of places to childcare services as part of mainstream CE schemes.Nationally there are 276 schemes with ring-fenced places for childcare. There is no decrease in the number of Community Employment ringfenced   places allocated in 2012.Forty-one per cent of ring-fenced places are located in the Dublin Region. The South West and the North East Region are the largest providers of childcare ring-fenced places outside of the Dublin region.A key element in the approval of all CE programmes, including childcare ring-fenced places,  is the requirement that such programmes do not displace current jobs or employees or that they are not used to fill vacancies. All applications for CE must be accompanied by letters from local Union representatives that such displacement or replacement is not occurring. In addition there is a National Monitoring Committee that meets at regular intervals to review all CE applications to ensure that the above criteria are being met. The programme is managed within this context at a regional and local level, subject to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.It should be noted that the Department has a significant role to play in ensuring progress in the area of quality childcare training through Community Employment; providing quality childcare services to local communities through the continued provision of ring-fenced childcare places on CE; and providing progression options into further education/training or employment in the sector.

This department received a claim for invalidity pension for the person concerned on 10 February 2011. The person concerned attended for a medical assessment with a medical assessor of the Department. On the basis of this assessment, the medical assessor was of the opinion that the person concerned was not eligible for invalidity pension as he does not satisfy the medical criteria. The application for invalidity pension was, accordingly, disallowed by a deciding officer.  The person in question was notified of this decision and the reason for it.  Further medical evidence was subsequently submitted by the claimant.  This additional evidence, along with the original information, was evaluated by a different medical assessor who expressed the opinion that the person concerned does not satisfy the medical criteria.  The deciding officer found that there were no grounds to overturn the original decision to disallow invalidity pension and the person concerned was notified of the outcome of this review. He was notified of his right to lodge an appeal with the social welfare appeals office however no appeal of this decision was received.This department received a subsequent claim for invalidity pension for the person concerned on 12 January 2012.  The medical evidence provided by the claimant in support of this claim was examined by a medical assessor who expressed the opinion that the person concerned was not eligible for invalidity pension as he does not satisfy the medical criteria.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	374	The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is the statutorily independent body charged with all aspects of the regulation of the natural gas market.  A key responsibility of the CER is to promote the safety of natural gas for customers and the public generally.The CER's remit now also includes specific responsibility for natural gas safety.  The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 empowered the CER to regulate from a safety perspective undertakings involved in gas transmission, distribution, storage, supply and shipping.  The CER has established a natural gas safety regulatory framework, including a system for the audit and inspection of natural gas transmission and distribution pipeline safety systems.The CER places obligations on undertakings to ensure that any safety risks associated with their operations are reduced to as low as reasonably practicable.  Bord Gáis Éireann's (BGÉ) transmission and distribution operations are subjected to ongoing audit and inspection by the CER.  Additionally, BGÉ reports quarterly to the CER on a comprehensive range of safety performance indicators to verify that all operations are in compliance with the overall natural gas regulatory framework.Safety is BGÉ's first priority and the company is committed to ongoing development and maintenance of the gas networks and systems to ensure safety and to deliver continuous safety improvement and performance.  Systems are in place to deal with gas leaks and to advise the public and all gas customers on the steps to be taken in the event that they smell gas.  BGÉ's continuous programme of safety promotion also includes the Gas Efficiency Service, the Dial before you Dig Service, promotion of Registered Gas Installers and public awareness of the dangers of Carbon Monoxide.  Since its establishment BGÉ has developed and modernised a national gas distribution pipeline network of nearly 11,000 kilometres and a gas transmission pipeline network of over 2,000 kilometres as well as the two Interconnectors with Scotland.  There are over 640,000 gas users in Ireland.  BGÉ operates the Networks in compliance with recognised Irish and international quality and safety standards.In this context, Bord Gais Networks (BGN) has been liaising with the Pyrite Action Group and the Pyrite Panel over the last number of months.  BGN continues to monitor the performance and reliability of its Network associated with the supply of Natural Gas to all currently identified ‘Pyrite-affected' housing estates.  To date BGN has seen no increase in leakage occurrences associated with these estates.BGE advised that the internal gas pipework in a domestic house will have been installed by an installer engaged by the house builder/owner.  Since June 2009 such installers must, by law, be registered with the Register of Gas Installers of Ireland.  BGN requires the provision of a ‘Certificate of Conformance' signed by the installer before a gas meter can be fitted and natural gas supplied to the premises.Maintenance of the gas installation is the responsibility of the premises owner.  BGN in its safety advice to customers recommends the annual servicing of gas appliances and in particular that regular safety checks of the gas installation are carried out by a Registered GasInstaller.I have every confidence in BGÉ's priority commitment to safety and its safety and emergency response service.  There is never room for complacency however, and BGÉ itself is engaged in a constant process of safety review and enhancement working with CER.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	376	Ireland's energy policy priorities are framed in the context of the European Union.  Policy is based on pursuing the objective of a sustainable, competitive and secure supply of energy.  Natural gas is the predominant fuel for power generation in Ireland accounting for over 60 per cent of electricity generation.  Overall, it continues to be an important fuel for power generation, and remains the fuel of choice for new thermal power station projects.  The predominant future fuel mix for power generation over the medium term is projected to be gas and renewable energy.  This policy approach is an approach that is complementary.  The planned ‘merchant' Shannon LNG terminal near Ballylongford in the Shannon Estuary is supported by the Government as a means of providing additional security of supply for Ireland in that it would bring diversity to gas supply sources and give connectivity to the global LNG market.EU policy has focused in recent years on bringing about change in Europe's electricity and gas markets, for example, as regards industry structure, the extent of competition, security of gas supply and greater EU energy market integration.  EU targets have been set for 2020 in relation to both energy efficiency and renewable energy.  These EU developments recognise Member States' subsidiarity in relation to the fuel mix.  The successful implementation of these policies should contribute to a lesser dependence on fossil fuels, including gas, and therefore a lower vulnerability to global price increases in such fuels.Directive 2009/28/EC imposes a legally binding target on Ireland for a 16% share of renewable energy in all energy consumed by 2020, with a minimum of 10% in the transport sector.  Ireland has set targets of 40% renewable electricity, 12% renewable heating and 10% renewable transport by 2020.  The combined effect of these sectoral targets is commensurate with the achievement of the overall 16% target.  In 2011 around 17% of Ireland's electricity was generated by renewable technologies.The latest modelling undertaken by Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates that capacity of around 4000MW of renewable generation will be required on the system to deliver the 40% renewable electricity target by 2020.  Ireland's National Renewable Energy Action Plan, available on the Department's website, indicates that of the 40% renewable electricity required, approximately 36% is expected to be from wind generation.EirGrid's latest data, which is available on their website, shows that at the end of 2011, Ireland had 1900MW of renewable generation on the grid.  This includes 1630MW of connected wind, 234MW of hydro and 46MW of additional other renewable generation.In addition to projects already connected, there is around 1000MW from the Gate 1 and Gate 2 rounds which have contracted and are scheduled to be built out and connected over the next few years.  Around 4,000MW of additional renewable capacity is provided for in the Gate 3 process.  Policy and regulatory interventions designed to facilitate and encourage renewable electricity include REFIT as a price support mechanism and priority dispatch.EirGrid's Grid 25 strategy and implementation plans are designed to deliver the necessary grid developments and grid reinforcements to underpin the new renewable generating capacity, as well as to support regional economic development.EirGrid has also developed a programme to manage the integration of high levels of renewable electricity on the system from a grid operations perspective over the coming years.  The East-West Interconnector and the planned North-South Interconnector will play a key role in integrating large amounts of intermittent generation into the electrical system.  EirGrid's programme, known as DS3, includes enhancing generation portfolio performance, developing new operational policies and systems to efficiently use the generation portfolio to the best of its capabilities and regularly reviewing the needs of the system as the portfolio capability evolves.  Further information is available on EirGrid's website at:http://www.eirgrid.com/operations/ds3/.

With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), has had an important role to play in this regard.The Taskforce report has now been published.  The report notes that by 2015, over 50% of the population will have access to high speed broadband services with speeds in excess of 70 Mbps.  The report also highlights areas where Government and industry can work together to facilitate the roll out of high speed services across Ireland, and particularly in areas where the case for commercial investment is marginal.Following on the work of the Taskforce, I will shortly be bringing proposals for a National Broadband Plan to Government, with a view to agreeing a comprehensive set of policy actions to underpin the provision of high speed broadband services on a national basis.  This is a key priority.  A particular challenge will be the source of funding to address gaps in high speed coverage in areas that the market may deem to be commercially unviable.

The legislation does not specify the type of security required.However, guidance issued to planning authorities stresses that, in the case of residential development, planning conditions must require the giving of sufficient security prior to commencement of development, and that the authorities must ensure that they are in a position to draw down the security in cases where a developer fails to satisfactorily complete a residential development, or phase of a development, within the specified period.Section 34 (4) (g) bonds are to ensure that the infrastructure (including roads, footpaths, water mains, sewers, lighting and open spaces) of a development is completed satisfactorily. Where building defects occur, their remediation is a matter for the parties concerned, namely the building owner, the relevant builder and the builder's insurers, in line with any contractual arrangements agreed between the parties.  In order to identify solutions for a resolution to the pyrite problem I set up an Independent Pyrite Panel in September, 2011.  I look forward to receiving its report shortly.

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, are in the process of assisting the Committee to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government's Legislation Programme as announced on 11 January 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current Dáil session. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.

It is important to bear in mind that the current jury system is a fundamental part of our legal framework. There are advantages to retaining a larger jury as that formation can include a greater mix of jurors in terms of, for example, gender, ethnicity and experience.  I do not believe that any reform of this nature should be undertaken solely based on cost considerations.I have made enquiries and the Courts Service has informed me that expenditure on accommodation, meals and transport for jurors in the period from 2008 to 2011 was as follows:2008200920102011€575,656€441,659€339,160€318,196Considerable savings have been achieved in this area since the new Criminal Courts of Justice Complex was opened in November 2009 as refreshments for juries are now provided on site.In addition, as the Deputy may be aware, the Law Reform Commission is in the process of undertaking a detailed examination of jury service, although this particular matter does not form part of the current process, which includes qualification, eligibility, selection process and related matters. A consultation paper was published in 2010 and the Commission is currently engaged in extensive consultations with relevant parties with a view to finalising its report. I understand that the report including its recommendations is to be published in Autumn 2012 and I look forward to considering the matter when that is to hand.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	388	As I have previously advised the Deputy, I am informed by the Garda authorities that following an investigation of the incident referred to, a person was arrested, charged with assault and convicted following a plea of guilty. The court ordered compensation to be paid to the injured party, and I understand this was done. I am also informed that subsequently civil proceedings instituted by the injured party were settled before coming to court.Where an offence is disclosed, the matter is investigated by An Garda Síochána and, where appropriate, an investigation file prepared for the law officers, who, in the exercise of their independent role, determine the matter of criminal charges against any person. The incident referred to was fully investigated and brought before the criminal courts, where a conviction was secured. As the Deputy is aware, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, and it is not open to me to comment on or intervene in any way in the conduct of, or decision in, any individual court case.In light of the above, there is no further assistance I can offer the Deputy on this matter.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	390	The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is being reduced to from €220 million to €190 million. In order to make the necessary savings it is proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows:To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community;To maintain the countryside;To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density. The principles of force majeure/exceptional circumstances will also be provided for in the process and provision will also be made for new entrants to farming.It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, especially from an economic perspective, as it contributes to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families. Therefore, in proposing the changes in question, the intention is to better focus the Scheme, which is to the benefit of the majority of those farming in areas with recognised constraints, while at the same time attempting to cater for those genuinely prevented from achieving the revised minimums. Furthermore, every effort will be made to accommodate all active farmers who may find themselves otherwise adversely affected by the changes introduced for the 2012 Scheme.EU Commission approval has not been received to date and the proposed changes may be subject to change.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is being reduced from €220 million to €190 million. In order to make the necessary savings it is proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows:To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community;To maintain the countryside;To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.Rather than simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area as a means to achieving these savings, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme, namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures.While changes are being introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision is being made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to an agri-environmental measure, such as a Commonage Framework De-stocking Plans, Rural Environmental Protection Schemes (REPS) or Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).All applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, will be written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in one of the above measures resulted in the lower stocking density.

The animal was not removed by my Department under the TB Eradication Scheme but was condemned by the factory when presented for slaughter by the herdowner some days later.There is no provision for compensation for an animal injured during the course of a TB test. The herdowner, when registering for a herd number had signed a document which clearly states that  "it is expressly agreed and understood that the carrying out of any tests or inspections under the official Department Schemes is without liability of any kind on the part of the Veterinary Surgeon or the Minister".  The herdowner was advised in writing on 29 November 2011 that, in line with the foregoing, he is not entitled to compensation for the animal concerned.  As  provided for under this scheme, the herdowner appealed the decision to the Regional Assistant Principal Officer and to the Agriculture Appeals Office who have both found in favour of the original decision.  The herdowner has been advised of the option to raise the issue with the Office of the Ombudsman.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	395	Tackling child poverty is a priority for Government and a goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007- 2016, coordinated by the Department of Social Protection. Children are more likely to be poor if they are living in lone parent households with low labour market participation and dependent on income support. The departments of Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, are working to deliver a range of measures aimed at getting people back to work.My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection in a ‘whole of Government approach' to tackling poverty in the population. The Department is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare established by the Minister for Social Protection to examine issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular.As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children's outcomes is my primary objective. The development of the Children and Young People's Policy Framework, 2012 -2017, as the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State, is an important initiative for cross departmental collaboration to secure this objective.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children's opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents undertaking training and participating in employment. The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department have an important role in this regard. These programmes and the results of pilot projects to enhance children's development in Tallaght, Northside and Ballymun, which are jointly funded by my Department with a philanthropic organisation, will inform the Government's plans to develop a new area based approach to child poverty.My priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Agency.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	396	All children's residential centres are inspected to ensure that the children living in the centre  are receiving the care and protection that they require.  TheNational Standards for Children’s Residential Centres,provide a basis for consistently promoting quality of care in children’s residential centres. They provide inter-alia for consultation with children, procedures for making a complaint and access to information  by a child. The HSE registers and inspects  non-statutory voluntary and private children’s residential centres against these standards. A copy of the standards is available on my Department’s website at www.dcya.ie.The process of assessing standards of care in the centres is undertaken by a HSE inspector who visits the centre and  gathers information through interviews and meetings with the centre management, staff members and young people, analysis of case files and centre records and contact with guardians, social workers and other professionals as appropriate. Centres are thoroughly inspected and where an inspection report identifies non-compliance with a regulation, the centre will not be registered and re-registered again until compliance has been achieved.My Department led a major consultation exercise with children and young people in the care of the State over the course of 2010. Over 200 children and young people took part in consultation sessions. The aims and objectives of the consultations were to get the views of children and young people in the care of the State on the issues that really matter to them and on which they would like to be heard; to explore existing mechanisms for children and young people to express their views and to make recommendations on future structures to be established for children and young people to express their views.The Report of the consultation, entitled ‘Listen To Our Voices' was launched by me last July, when I indicated that I would be establishing an Implementation Group. The Voice of Children in Care Implementation Group was established in May 2012 and is being facilitated by my Department. The Group will meet over a nine month period, to consider the recommendations from the ‘Listen to Our Voices' consultations and work on implementation of recommendations relevant to ensuring that their voices are heard.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	397	Adoptions from Ethiopia, effected  under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined,  and  recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2012. The Adoption Act 2010 also contains provision for a one year extension to declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which may lead to a one year extension to this date.Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.  In these circumstances, adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that "the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State.”  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.A delegation from the Adoption Authority  visited Ethiopia in April and held exploratory meetings with the Ethiopian authorities regarding the system of adoption which operates in that country. The delegation, in the course of its visit, held preliminary discussions with the Ethiopian authorities around the potential for a bilateral agreement on inter-country adoption. The Authority submitted its initial report which summarises the conclusions and recommendations of the delegation's visit on the 21st of May.  In addition, the Embassy in Ethiopia recently submitted a detailed background note on inter-country adoption in Ethiopia, which officials in my Department are considering in conjunction with the AAI report.  The AAI has stated that it is seeking further legal advice in Ethiopia on whether adoptions there are full or simple adoptions. The Authority indicated that it will contact me again once it has received this legal advice and has completed its consideration of the matter.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	398	With effect from 1 November 2010, inter-country adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption (the Hague Adoption Convention) or with countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  Kazakhstan has ratified the Convention.Over the past 18 months the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) has written to its counterpart Central Authority in Kazakhstan on three separate occasions to begin the process of developing an administrative agreement for inter-country adoption. To date there has been no reply from the Kazakhstani authorities to any of the contacts made by the AAI. The Authority continues to indicate that it is open to discussing the issue of inter-country adoptions with its Kazakhstani counterparts at any time, and the most recent correspondence from the AAI was in March of this year. I understand that an official of the Irish Embassy in Moscow has now presented the copy correspondence to, and raised the issue of inter-country adoption with, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kazakhstan.  I understand the Kazakhstani authorities hosted a meeting on inter-country adoption on the 11th of May. I would like to point out that at no stage were the AAI, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Embassy contacted by the Kazakhstani authorities regarding the meeting. While it is, of course, a matter for each country to decide with whom it co-operates, as soon as the issue came to the attention of my Department, official contact was made with the Embassy in Moscow in this regard. The Embassy officials in Moscow are endeavouring to secure feedback from this meeting to assess its relevance for progress towards an administrative agreement on inter-country adoption between Ireland and KazakhstanThe Embassy has been asked to request information from the relevant authorities on the position for Irish couples hoping to adopt from Kazakhstan as soon as possible.  In the interim the AAI is currently completing a review of Kazakhstan's adoption legislation.

The regulatory framework for medical devices is set down in EU legislation which has been transposed into Irish law.   Under the EU regulatory framework, medical devices may be placed on the market anywhere in the EU following certification by a notified body.While the EU regulatory framework does not make specific provision regarding the regulation of distributors, there are obligations on manufacturers to have systems in place to ensure traceability of medical devices.The regulatory framework for medical devices is currently being reviewed by the EU Commission.  I understand that the revision, due to be published in September, will contain proposals in relation to the regulation of distributors.  My Department, in conjunction with the Irish Medicines Board, has undertaken work on this issue and is currently awaiting publication of the EU proposals to ensure that any national legislation put in place is consistent with future EU regulation of medical device distributors.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by  improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of  referrals from GPs by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

Primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services.  The question of possible changes to legislation, including regulation and inspection, for Home Care services for older people is at present under consideration. The Department is examining this matter in the overall context of the licensing of Health Care providers. Legislation is currently being prepared  and various options are being considered,  including the complex legal issues involved, and the need to prioritise legislation across the Social Care area overall.I wish to emphasise that statutory regulation or licensing is only one way of improving the safety and quality of services and that other measures have or are being taken to improve the standards of Home Support services delivered by, or on behalf of, the Health Service Executive (HSE). This approach is reflected in the agreed HSE Service Plan 2012, and includes a new publicProcurement Framework for Home Care services (with quality and screening requirements); new National Quality Guidelines for Home Care Support Services, and  new National Home Help Guidelines.These various measures, taken together, have been designed to improve relevant aspects of HSE Home Care provision nationally, pending progression of the legislative proposals raised by the Deputy.

GPs receive an annual capitation payment of €280.31 where his/her medical card or GP visit card patient aged 70 years or more is residing in the community.Under Section 1 of the General Medical Services (GMS) contract, a medical practitioner shall provide services or arrange for the provision of services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract for all eligible persons on his/her GMS list of eligible persons as approved by the HSE and who have not been notified to him/her by the HSE as having ceased to be on his/her list, regardless of whether they live in the community or in a private nursing home.Under Section 11 of the General Medical Services (GMS) contract, a GP is required to provide the eligible patients on his/her GMS list with all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  This section of the contract also states that the medical practitioner shall accept clinical responsibility for persons on his/her list who need medical treatment and treat them or, when the clinical condition is such that it is appropriate to transfer them to appropriate consultant care, do so and accept clinical responsibility for them on becoming aware of their discharge from consultant care.In addition, the medical practitioner shall also make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with him or his/her locum/deputy outside normal hours for urgent cases in respect of which a separate out-of-hours fee is payable, e.g. €45 for an out-of-hours domiciliary visit.

The area which has been most successful in terms of co-operation relates to the development of joint road safety advertising campaigns. While each jurisdiction has different road numbering and, in some instances, traffic signage every effort will be made to seek consistency where possible between the traffic signage in the two jurisdictions in respect of destinations.Some major difficulties exist in relation to the harmonisation of road signage. For instance, Section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 requires text to be displayed both in English and  Irish on all road traffic signage in this country. Currently Northern Ireland is only required to display English text which allows them to fit more destinations on a single sign. Another point to note, is that the Road Traffic Act 2004 provided for the changeover from imperial speed limits to metric speed limits and this is reflected in the road signage in our jurisdiction. Northern Ireland still use only imperial speed limits.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-06-07 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.The regulation of the taxi industry, including issues pertaining to vehicle age limit, is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA). As to the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, I have arranged for your question to be forwarded to the NTA for a direct response. If you do not receive a response within ten working days, please notify my private office.A public consultation was carried out by the NTA last year concerning vehicle standards, including vehicle age, and the outcome of the consultation was made available to the Taxi Regulation Review Group. Action 10 of the Taxi Regulation Review Report proposes that existing vehicles in the fleet prior to 1st   January 2009, should be allowed to operate until they are 14 years of age, subject to passing a roadworthiness test and an NTA Licence Renewal Assessment at six monthly intervals for vehicle nine years or older. This approach will give licence holders time to adjust to the new arrangements and will work out cheaper than replacing the car outright as was proposed previously. It is hoped that the 6-monthly NCT testing of these vehicles will be commenced in tandem with new vehicle standards to be introduced by the NTA, in January 2013.It is envisaged that vehicles older than nine years will gradually transition out of the fleet. In considering matters relating to vehicle standards, the Review Group was conscious of the need to ensure an effective balance between the provision of a high quality and safe service to the public and the interests of taxi drivers with a long-term commitment to the industry.

In that context, road authorities are empowered by Section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and in the interest of the safety and convenience of road users, to provide traffic calming measures or low speed zones on public roads. In the case of national roads, such measures may not be provided without the consent of the National Roads Authority.In implementing traffic calming measures or low speed zones on public roads in areas deemed appropriate by local authorities, reference must be made to the "Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits" as issued by my Department to all local authorities on 18 April 2005 pursuant to section 9(9) of the Road Traffic Act 2004. It should be noted that the lowest maximum speed limit that can be applied under the Road Traffic Acts in this country is a special speed limit of 30 km/h and the making of speed limit bye-laws is a reserved function of the local authority.  This special speed limit needs to be self-enforcing through use of traffic calming and engineering measures, such as those utilised in ‘home zone' areas.

My Department is in regular contact with the Road Safety Authority (RSA) in relation to the possible initiatives that might be taken to improve the situation.The RSA undertakes initiatives regarding all aspects of road safety, including the reduction of child pedestrian deaths and research into any causal association between social deprivation among children and injury from traffic. I have referred the Deputy's question to the RSA for a more detailed reply. She should advise my private office if she does not receive a reply within 10 working days.
