For the past past five years the normal procedure in dealing with Commencement matters has been that the Senator raising a topic has four minutes, with one minute to ask a supplementary question following the Minister's response. Technically, under Standing Orders, a Senator has five minutes and he or she is not permitted to ask a supplementary question. My suggestion, therefore, as Cathaoirleach is that we continue the practice of allowing a Senator to speak for four minutes and to then ask a brief supplementary question following the Minister's response. I think that would work well and unless there is a desire on the part of Members to do otherwise, we should stick to precedent.

The concrete block is the core component of the family home. Senator Paudie Coffey visited County Donegal in his time as Minister of State and examined this issue. Essentially, family homes in County Donegal are literally falling apart. Families have to decide whether they continue to live in their homes and risk the roof falling down on top of them because of the impact on the gables of their homes. The Government set up an expert panel to look at this issue, but its terms of reference are inadequate. The Government has only asked the panel to look at the issue as it pertains to private homes. I can confirm that Donegal County Council has examined hundreds of examples of its housing stock and confirmed that very large numbers of houses are affected by this disaster for many families across the county. The issue also apparently affects schools and other public buildings, yet the Government has only asked the panel to look at the matter as it pertains to private homes. I am asking the Minister of State simply to amend the terms of reference to ensure the panel can investigate the matter as it pertains to private and public homes. The Minister of State also needs to clarify whether the panel can recommend a redress scheme similar to the pyrite redress scheme that was rightly put in place for devastated families in Dublin and north Leinster.Families have had to make difficult choices. They had money set aside for education of their children in years to come, but they have had to rebuild the outer leaf of their home. They had no choice and could not wait for the Government to take action. Will the Minister of State clarify these matters today? I know that he will travel to the county and meet families soon. I hope he will meet a delegation from Donegal County Council. He should be aware that public representatives in his county took action on a similar matter when pyrite had an impact. This affects hundreds or probably thousands of homes across County Donegal. It was caused by a profound failure in State regulation, as it was left to manufacturers to ensure concrete blocks were built to a required standard. I urge the Minister of State to take the opportunity to clarify the matter and assure us he will amend the terms of reference.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	12	I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Minister of State for being here. This is a very important issue for the people of County Mayo also. I was extremely disappointed that the "Prime Time" programme only covered County Donegal as there are hundreds of homes in County Mayo affected by pyrite. A representative group met officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in March 2014 and presented photographic evidence and the reports indicating beyond doubt that the houses were affected by pyrite. I know that families that have had to flee their homes because of pyrite and that is not fair. Hundreds of families in County Mayo have had to stand by and watch households in the eastern part of the country be compensated. I understand the difference between pyrite being in the foundation and blocks. I welcome the setting up of the expert group, but I am absolutely dismayed that it has indicated it will not come to County Mayo until September. That is not good enough. We know that the only solution to the problem is the demolition of buildings. Will the Minister of State consider intervening with the Central Bank in order that a stay can be put on the mortgages of the people concerned who are being crucified paying mortgages while paying rent also? Are there proper standards now in place and are we sure this is not happening this very day? Are similar materials being supplied by unregulated quarries throughout the country?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	13	I thank both Senators for raising this important issue. In April this year an expert panel on concrete blocks was established to investigate the problems that had emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in counties Donegal and Mayo. In fairness to the Senators' colleague, Senator Paudie Coffey, that expert panel was set up quite quickly when compared with other panels in the past. We must recognise the timeframe and it is important that it is up and running, doing its work. In May the expert panel held meetings with the mica action group and elected members and officials from Donegal County Council to seek any information that might be available on the nature of the problems that had emerged in blockwork and affected homes. The panel's report is due in October and I look forward to receiving it in order that we can see where to go from there. I am aware the elected members of Donegal County Council welcomed the establishment of the expert panel during their meeting of 12 May and they have corresponded on the matter with me, requesting a meeting. I am also aware that elected members expressed the view that the panel's terms of reference were too narrow and proposed that the terms of reference be amended to include buildings owned by public authorities. However, unlike many private home owners, public authorities are generally better equipped and better resourced to investigate problems that may have emerged with their buildings and identify appropriate remedial solutions. In a specific case of local authority dwellings in County Donegal that may be affected by defective blockwork, it would be a matter in the first instance for the council to deal with it. As the owner of the properties and the organisation most familiar with their construction, it should investigate the nature of the problems, establish the number of dwellings affected and identify practical and cost-effective solutions to address the problems. Subsequently, it would be a matter for the council to present a detailed business case to my Department for consideration, should capital funding for remedial works be required on foot of those investigations. This is in line with standard practice in such matters generally and in other areas also. For the avoidance of doubt, my Department will examine any proposal brought forward by Donegal County Council in this matter and will work closely with the council to solve any problem identified in the concrete blockwork of the social housing stock to facilitate the delivery of cost-effective and timely solutions. As was confirmed by the Taoiseach a few weeks ago on the floor of the Dáil, I intend to visit a number of private homeowners in north Donegal next week and at some stage to visit County Mayo in the near future. I can give that guarantee. As part of the visit, I will meet elected members of Donegal County Council in order to listen to their concerns about these matters. They were in touch with me via written correspondence in the past few days and I have written back with confirmation that we will meet. I hope that will happen next week.Ultimately, the terms of reference involve establishing the facts behind the problems in counties Donegal and Mayo, engaging in consultation and outlining technical solutions for addressing the problems identified in order to assist affected homeowners. I have no proposals to amend the terms of reference of the expert panel, particularly given that it is already two months into its investigations. In this regard, I will await the outcome of the panel's report before considering what further actions may be required to assist the parties directly involved in reaching a satisfactory resolution to the problems that have arisen in the two counties. To be very clear, the expert panel is moving quite quickly. It did not waste any time after it was set up and a chair had been appointed before visiting County Donegal and it will visit County Mayo also. We will let it do its work first and we will see what comes out of it. The Senator referred to the pyrite problem in north Dublin and County Meath. I have been very much involved in that campaign during the years. I understand what it is all about and what had to happen eventually to make it work. It took a lot of time, but those homes are being fixed and I hope in the next 12 to 18 months all of the homes affected will have been fixed. It is a step-by-step procedure, but first we must identify exactly what is behind all this. That is the first job of the expert panel and we will take it from there.

This is a profound failure in State regulation and it is staring the Minister of State in the face. I am sure he has watched the documentary and seen for himself the impact of this problem, as has the former Minister of State, Senator Paudie Coffey. I cannot understand why he cannot ensure the terms of reference of the panel will be amended immediately to allow it to examine the impact on the private and public housing stock. Why is that important? It is important because then the Minister of State will have a full sense of the scale of the challenge that lies ahead. He gave a vague commitment that the county council in Donegal or Mayo can submit costings and there might be a capital grant. We are talking about a significant amount of money that would be taken away from other local services in County Donegal to be deployed towards resolving this issue. Will the Minister of State amend the terms of reference? The Minister of State has pointed to his own involvement in the pyrite campaign in his own county, on which I say, "Well done to him". The families there were rightly given a pyrite redress scheme and fair play to them for the campaign they conducted. Will the Minister of State make a commitment here and now that the Government will put in place a mica redress scheme to assure families in counties Donegal and Mayo that the nightmare they are living through will be addressed by the State and the Government whose profound failure caused the problem in the first place?

The Senator has his facts and assumed a particular position. That is fine. He is very much involved and was involved in this issue before I was. The "Prime Time" programme addressed certain issues also, but a panel has been set up, independent of the Senator, me or anyone else, to establish the facts. That is the first procedure to be implemented. If the Senator does not mind, it would be advisable for us to stay with that. It will take a couple of months for the panel to complete its work and I will engage with and work with it and visit the sites myself.

In the meantime, I will go there myself to meet residents and councillors from any party. I will meet anyone who wants to meet me. There is no problem whatsoever. The door is open. However, we will establish all the facts behind this and follow a procedure from then on. That is the best way to address the issue. It is the way we have implemented other schemes. The Senator commented on the pyrite scheme, to which the same approach was used: first, we established the facts behind it. Each case is different. The pyrite and mica problems are different, but we will establish the facts. That is the right way to go and I will continue the work the former Minister of State, Senator Paudie Coffey, started to try to find a solution to the problem in the end.

The matter has been spoken about in the past few years. If affects many people within the Department and the Civil Service. The class K PRSI contribution is paid by a large sector of society with no benefit to them. They qualify neither for pension purposes nor for any benefit. During the last Seanad election it also came to light that a large number of full-time councillors, in particular, did not receive any benefit or pension in paying the class K contribution on their annual allowance. The wording of this important matter speaks for itself. The class K contribution does not confer any benefit on a large sector of society who pay it, particularly councillors, who are working hard, and especially those who are working as councillors full-time, are young and have not yet retired. They depend on the councillor salary for their livelihood. I believe they are entitled to some benefits and hope the Minister can address this issue in the next budget or the next social welfare Bill.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	27	I thank Senator Paddy Burke for raising this very important matter which has been raised with me on a number of occasions and which I know is of real importance to councillors and Senators. PRSI class K contributions are paid by a number of categories of contributor. Since 1 January 2011, public officeholders pay PRSI at the class K rate of 4% on their income as officeholders, provided that income exceeds €5,200 per annum. All public officeholders are liable to pay the contribution, regardless of their age. Public officeholders include the President, Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, members of the Judiciary, the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General and city and county councillors. Payment of class K PRSI does not contribute towards the establishment of a social insurance entitlement - in short, a person gets no benefits from it. Prior to the introduction of the class K contribution, all public officeholders were exempt from PRSI on their income as public officeholders. Then, as now, they could establish and protect their social insurance entitlements based on their non-officeholder activities, or through the payment of voluntary contributions. When the class K PRSI charge on the income of public officeholders was introduced in 2011, it was done on the basis that public officeholders had been identified as a group that were not paying PRSI on their income as officeholders. The charge was, therefore, introduced as a measure of solidarity, allowing them to contribute to social insurance at a time when extensive curtailment of social insurance entitlements to other public and private sector employees was introduced. Since the introduction of the class K contribution for public officeholders, further measures to charge class K PRSI have been introduced. Since 2013, class K PRSI at 4% is charged on the non-employment income of certain Civil Service and public sector workers who pay modified rates of PRSI, classed as B, C and D, where they also have income from a trade or profession. Payment of class K PRSI by this group does not give cover for a range of benefits and pensions such as the State pension, jobseeker's benefit and illness benefit. In 2014 employees and pensioners under the age of 66 years whose only other source of income was unearned became liable to pay class K PRSI at 4% on that unearned income where they were paying tax on that income. I am examining whether changes are required to the basis on which class K PRSI is charged, particularly the position of local authority members.Most councillors already have cover under the PRSI system through their other employment or activities. A minority of full-time councillors do not have cover. Any change to the current class K arrangements will need to have regard to the social insurance and occupational position of the officeholders generally and I will have to consult other relevant Ministers in this regard.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	28	I thank the Minister for his reply, but it still does not clarify the position. I hope the Minister, in the run-in to the social welfare Bill, will address the issue because it is one that needs to be addressed. It can only be addressed in the context of the budget. This issue involves more than simply giving benefits to one group or another. I hope the Minister will address it in the budget.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	29	I am definitely keen to do something. The issue has been ongoing for a long time and I have the opportunity now to do something about it. I intend to make some change in the forthcoming budget or, more particularly, in the forthcoming social welfare Bill which will be brought before this House in the winter. The situation, as it stands, is unfair. Local authority members pay PRSI at 4% but get no benefits in return for it, which is uniquely unfair and a position that applies to other public officeholders also. However, it is different for us in the sense that we have severance and pension arrangements but councillors do not. Therefore, they are in a uniquely unfair position and one which needs to be dealt with. I think all councillors know this, but what they may not know or realise is that local authorities which are not technically but which are effectively their employers do not pay employer's PRSI. If one were to change the position and make them, for example, class A contributors like everyone else who works for the councils, the councils would then have to pay employer's PRSI and that would have an impact on the councils' budgets. That needs to be borne in mind. Another potential option is to treat them in the same way as those who are self-employed and move them to class S contributions. A further option would be to raise the minimum threshold below which one does not have to pay anything. In that way they would not have to pay anything, but they still would not get any benefit. There are a number of options and I will be meeting representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government in the coming weeks to discuss those options and decide on the best one. As is always the case with these things, there are knock-on consequences. I want fairness for councillors, but I am not in favour of special treatment. Whatever the case, we should bring them into line with other workers or other self-employed persons. However, it must be something that is fair and not something that creates special treatment or a special class or privilege. In fairness, I do not think that is what they are looking for.

For the benefit of new Members, while the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, is coming, when Commencement matters are submitted, I try to be fair to the parties when they are first submitted. This time there were three matters from Sinn Féin, of which I chose one, and there were three from Fine Gael, of which I chose one. I tried to achieve a balance between the different groups in order that there would not be four matters from one party and none from another. I will try to do this as best I can, even though this time, with the new groupings, it may be a little more difficult. We will deal with it as we go along and if there are issues, I will discuss them with the groups also.

I congratulate Deputy Simon Harris on becoming Minister for Health and thank him for attending to deal with this extremely important issue which concerns the co-location of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, with St. Vincent's University Hospital in Elm Park. I am disappointed because this is an issue which has been running since I was a member of the board of the National Maternity Hospital in 1999. At that stage, it was expected that the National Maternity Hospital would move to the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus within ten years. It is now 2016 and there is a problem which was not flagged before at any stage relating to the governance of the hospital, as a result of which the moving of the hospital is now in danger. The National Maternity Hospital was built in the 1800s. A total of 9,500 babies are delivered in very cramped outdated conditions, putting mothers' and babies' health, if not their lives, at risk because of the conditions in the hospital. The staff do a fantastic job and give a very high standard of care. We face a turf war between two hospitals in the form of an argument over a budget. I do not believe this argument is about the health and well-being of up to 10,000 babies or their mothers, nor is it an argument about the quality of care. In Holles Street there are ten delivery wards where 9,500 babies are delivered. There should be 24 delivery wards for that number. There are knock-on implications. It is very much welcome that the Minister has appointed a mediator and hope they will be successful. I have raised this issue on a personal basis and know the Minister’s personal commitment to it and that much of it is outside his control. I urge him to consider his next step if the mediation is not successful because we cannot allow up to 10,000 babies to be delivered in a hospital that was built in the 1800s. That has a real negative and possibly detrimental impact on the babies and mothers who deliver them in an outdated facility. I look forward to the Minister's response.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	32	I congratulate the Cathaoirleach and all Senators on their election and appointment to this House. I look forward to working with them.  I thank Senator Keving Humphreys for raising this important issue. The proposal to redevelop the National Maternity Hospital on the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus has been under consideration for many years. Within a couple of days of my appointment as Minister for Health, I visited the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street. One cannot leave the place without thinking it is an entirely inappropriate and substandard building. It is not up to the standards we would want for expectant mothers and their infant children and front-line staff to work and deliver babies in. It is utterly unacceptable. It is quite disgraceful to think we went through the entire Celtic tiger period without ever building the new national maternity hospital. In 2008 the KPMG independent review of maternity and gynaecology services in the greater Dublin area noted that Dublin's model of stand-alone maternity hospitals did not align with the considered norm internationally and acknowledged that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services. The report recommended that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus. In 2013 the then Minister for Health, now Senator James Reilly, with the agreement of both hospitals, formally announced the Government's intention to relocate the National Maternity Hospital to Elm Park and said funding had been approved in the HSE's capital plan to allow the project to proceed. Work on the design brief for the new maternity hospital has concluded. I have seen a scaled model of the new hospital and can say it represents a very exciting development for maternity services. The project is one example of the Government's commitment to maternity services. That commitment was underlined by the launch of the country's first national maternity strategy earlier this year. The programme for Government commits to implementing the strategy and I look forward to leading the improvement of maternity services for women and their families over the lifetime of the strategy. The House will be aware, however, that difficulties have emerged about the future governance of the new National Maternity Hospital on the Elm Park campus. Concerted efforts have been made to get the agreement of both hospitals to allow the project to proceed. Meetings were held last year with both hospitals at departmental and ministerial levels and a facilitated dialogue was undertaken earlier this year. Unfortunately, that process did not achieve a solution. Since taking office, I have met both hospitals separately and jointly and stressed to them the need to resolve the outstanding issues as a matter of urgency. I have also visited the National Maternity Hospital and I am acutely aware of the very significant infrastructural deficits there which are impacting on the ability of the hospital to deliver appropriate clinical services.I am heartened, therefore, that both hospitals have now committed to a further independent mediation process. I have appointed Mr. Kieran Mulvey as a mediator and the process has commenced. A number of meetings have already taken place. I acknowledge that a lot of work went on over the weekend. It is now important that we step back and let Mr. Mulvey and the two hospitals work on a solution outside the media glare. However, I assure the Senator and all other Senators that my overriding aim is to try to find a solution. I must stress that both hospitals are voluntary independent hospitals and, therefore, I cannot simply impose a solution. I intend to use my office to facilitate the finding of a solution. An unedifying spat between two of our great medical institutions does not serve patients well. It is important that the overriding objective of delivering property maternity services in appropriate accommodation for expectant mothers and their families is not lost in some bureaucratic row. It is frustrating, given that the project is fully funded and a plan is ready to go. We could lodge planning permission for the project within weeks if we were to find a solution. Ultimately, both hospitals will have to reach an agreement on the outstanding governance issues. The process cannot go on forever. Agreement needs to be reached quickly. The hospitals are working constructively with Mr. Mulvey and I hope and expect to see the outcome of that work in the coming days. I remain hopeful a solution can be found. It is important that this happen as quickly as possible in order that this landmark project can proceed.

I am deeply disappointed and frustrated that this problem was raised at a very late stage. The plans should have been lodged at the end of the second quarter of 2015. As far as I am aware, they were substantially finished and were ready to be submitted and at that stage the issue was raised. Some €150 million has been committed to the project in the capital investment programme. We now know that €5 million has been spent on the preparation of the planning application. A lot of consultative work was done at the early stages of the project and at a very late stage the issue of governance arose. I do not believe it is acceptable for there to be any further delay on the part of the two hospitals concerned. I wish the mediation every success and offer it every encouragement, but both hospitals have to be practical and put the health of mothers and children first. This is not a case of money not being available. The money is in place and has been ring-fenced and €5 million of it has already been spent. I know that the Minister cannot comment on my final point. If mediation is not successful, the Minister will face a number of bad choices and whave to pick the best of them. I urge him to investigate and be ready to consider the possibility of a compulsory purchase of the site to allow the hospital to be built and the planning application to be lodged. I know that they are two voluntary hospitals and that this is a turf war. They have to set aside their interests and put children and mothers at the forefront.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	34	I share the absolute frustration of the Senator. He is correct; about €5 million has been spent on the project already by a Government of which he was a part, because as a country we want to deliver this landmark project. Let me be very clear: this is a priority project for me. I have invested a significant amount of time in the project since becoming Minister for Health because we are close to delivering a landmark project for maternity services, not just a hospital for the Dublin area but a national maternity hospital that will care for some of our sickest newborn infants. It is important that we get this right. The national maternity strategy needs to be implemented, but if it is to be implemented correctly, we need to have the appropriate physical infrastructure in place, that is, hospital buildings. I have to be very honest with the Senator. There is not an apparent plan B. That is why it is so important that the hospitals get this right. We have decided as a matter of policy that co-location works. We know that the co-location of maternity and acute hospitals works. If these hospitals walk off the pitch, there will be no simple option. The only people who will suffer, with front-line staff, are future expectant mothers and their babies. We cannot allow that to happen. This process has to work. I need be very careful about what I say because I do not want to say anything that will undermine the mediation process in any way.My hope is the mediation process under the stewardship of Mr. Mulvey will deliver an outcome and that it will happen very quickly.
#LynnRuane	unknown-#LynnRuane-party	unknown-#LynnRuane-dob	unknown-#LynnRuane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	35	I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his election. I thank the graduates of Trinity College Dublin for giving me a mandate to be here. I also thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, for his time. To give some of the background, I spent the past 15 years on local drugs task forces developing addiction programmes. I have been involved in drug research into drug trends and the changing nature of drug use. I have also worked directly with those involved in low-level dealing. I was alarmed to read in the media last week about proposed amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Acts that would further criminalise the drug user. How we as legislators respond to the use and sale of drugs illustrates our values. With others, I was elected to advocate for a progressive drug policy. Criminalising drug users has been proved by international evidence-based research to have failed to address addiction and drug problems. All over the world societies are recognising that addiction needs to be treated as a public health, not a criminal, issue. If we look at the amendments in the light of recent developments on injection rooms, it is nonsensical; it is a case of one step forward and two steps back. For example, the Minister has named zopiclone as a drug that would be targeted by the amendments. Many of the people selling zopiclone are selling it to fund their own drug use. People who are addicted to zopiclone, a widely used street benzo, would be at risk of resorting to other substances that would create further harms to the individual and the community. The proposed change would also alter trends in drug use, with which the services cannot keep up in the absence of adequate resources. Many who use street benzos cannot access treatment for benzo addiction. Many people have suffered benzo fits from trying to detox themselves. The Bill does not help the matter as it potentially forces the removal of such drugs from the market without matching that with treatment beds, which pushes the addict further into harm. I hope that would not be the desired outcome for the Minister for Health. I draw the Minister's attention to studies that clearly demonstrate the need to be progressive with drug policy, not regressive, which the amendments are mostly. In the context of the UN General Assembly on the world drug problem, a Brookings Institution report outlined that "socio-economic approaches for addressing drug-related crime and alternative livelihoods policies should be fully integrated into overall...economic development efforts". The report also stated: "Mass incarceration of users and low-level, non-violent pushers does little to suppress - and can exacerbate - the use of illicit drugs. It may also increase drug market violence". Possession of street benzos and their legality put extra strain on already under-resourced gardaí and potentially cost the State owing to unnecessary imprisonment of low-level dealers. In another study, the International Drug Policy Consortium, an important point made was that the level of harm was more important than the size of the market. For me, the amendments are harmful. Further criminalising individuals will further alienate them, prevent them from moving on and having prospects, especially with the current Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill. The success of the Portuguese model has been well documented and I urge the Minister to explore the evidence for a decriminalisation model that includes a person-centred approach to drugs and addiction. I call on the Minister to delay the introduction of the measures to allow for input from all involved stakeholders in order that policy is evidence based. Will he commit in the future to evidence-based drug policy that has harm reduction at its foundation rather than contributing to the cycle of criminality? How will the banned drugs be scheduled? Will the Minister indicate whether the control of the substances will be extended to the medical and pharmaceutical industries, as the over-prescription of the drugs has been much more harmful than the illegal street dealing. I understand the Minister possibly feels compelled to respond to the incidents in the north inner city, but I hope he will consider that the measures are regressive, potentially harmful to the users health, and ultimately will never affect those at the top of the drug trade.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	36	I thank the Senator and congratulate her on her election to this House. I take the point she made very seriously based on her experience, but there are two issues involved and my contention is that they are somewhat separate in terms of what I am trying to do but also what the Government must do in a national drugs strategy. I wish to start with a brief explanation of the existing misuse of drugs legislation which has two primary purposes. First, it aims to protect the public from dangerous and harmful substances which have no therapeutic or other legitimate use, for example, ecstasy or head shop drugs by establishing a system of tight control over them.Second, the legislation facilitates the safe use of certain controlled drug substances which have a medical and therapeutic value but which are harmful if misused such as benzos, heroin and cocaine. The misuse of drugs legislation is an important element of the Government's arsenal in the fight against drug dealing and trafficking and consequent gangland crime. There is a problem in parts of Dublin and elsewhere with the on-street sale of prescription medicine such as benzos. To be clear, while it is already an offence under medicines regulations to supply or sell such products without prescription, the Government and An Garda Síochána are of the view that controlling these products under the misuse of drugs legislation will lead to more effective enforcement. Following the recent murders in Dublin's north inner city, I instructed my Department to expedite the drafting of the misuse of drugs Bill which was originally scheduled for publication in the the autumn of 2016. I brought the Bill to the Government yesterday and received agreement to publish it. To be clear, the Government resolved to give the Garda whatever tools it felt it needed to respond to the situation in the north inner city and this was one tool the Garda asked to be put in its toolkit. This measure to address the issue was sought by the Garda and I am responding, as part of the whole-of-government approach, to what the Garda has asked the Government to do to address the ongoing worrying situation. On-street drug dealers often carry relatively small quantities of drugs on their person which can make it difficult for the authorities to proceed with the sale or supply charges. Therefore, the Bill seeks to make possession of controlled medicines an offence to enable An Garda Síochána to disrupt the activities of dealers and to protect local communities. If enacted, the Bill will provide for the drafting of regulations in order that it will not be an offence for legitimate users such as patients with a prescription and health care professionals to be in possession of controlled drugs. In addition to controlling a number of prescription drugs, the Bill will also control a number of substances which the European Union or the United Nations have identified as harmful and open to misuse. These include substances in the NBOMe or N-bomb family of drugs that are implicated in the tragic incident in Cork earlier this year, in which one individual died and five others were hospitalised. The Bill will also control clockwork orange, a psychoactive substance that is being abused in the Border counties and elsewhere. This legislation is necessary and appropriate and part of the suite of measures to assist in tackling crime and protecting public health. Importantly, I intend to bring forward a second misuse of drugs Bill later this year which will provide for the establishment of supervised injecting facilities for chronic drug users. I reaffirm the Government's commitment to doing this, which is a commitment in the programme for Government. I acknowledge the work done by Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin in his time as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy. My colleague, Deputy Catherine Byrne, now Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, is developing a new drug strategy. In that context, I understand consideration is being given to the establishment of a group that would consider alternative approaches to dealing with simple possession offences. There will be public consultation on the drugs strategy in the coming months and Senators and others will have an opportunity to contribute to this process. The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, would welcome an opportunity to benefit from the Senator's own knowledge and expertise in this area. In the meantime, however, I ask for the co-operation of Members in enacting this legislation as just a piece of the jigsaw the Government has been asked to put in place by An Garda Síochána. I make the point clearly that this legislation is not my response or that of the Government and is not the new national drugs strategy. That piece of work will be undertaken and there will be a second misuse of drugs Bill in the autumn. Moreover, a new national drugs strategy which will be an action-based strategy to deal with the larger issues the Senator has legitimately raised will be published this year.

As for N-bomb and clockwork orange, if one looked further into those cases, polydrug use is usually more the issue than simply the use of N-bomb. Many of the recent deaths have been due to a toxic mix of alcohol, other drugs and this substance. It has not been proved to be due to this substance alone. I reiterate the programme for Government is committed to a health approach to addiction and note my belief these amendments are regressive and retrograde in this respect and do not reach the intended target of high-level dealers. They just serve to criminalise further the most vulnerable in society.

I hope she will accept mine also that the Government intends to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government to a health-based approach to addiction. I intend to prove this to the Senator and others through the second misuse of drugs Bill later this year and the new national drugs strategy. In addition, however, from my perspective, when An Garda Síochána asks the Government to give it a range of tools to deal with a specific problem in the north inner city, I feel obliged to act in that regard. That is why I am bringing forward this legislation which I hope to have in this House before the summer recess.

Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time and we condemn what was a devastating and hateful act. I also convey the sympathy of the Fianna Fáil group to the families of the police officer and his partner who were murdered in Paris. I express my disappointment that the Seanad will be taking a longer than usual break this summer, given our late start to the term. However, despite the short window, I assure the House that the members of the Fianna Fáil group will use the time available to initiate and progress much legislation. As a new Member of this House, I welcome the enthusiasm shared by all sides last Wednesday for reform of Seanad Éireann. There have been over a dozen reports on the subject in recent times and I am pleased to say the Fianna Fáil group will be spearheading and supporting reforms during this Seanad. As all Members are aware, this is National Carers Week. We all accept and recognise that carers play an integral role in our society in looking after loved ones and family members at a substantially reduced cost to the State. Without them, the health service would collapse. However, many face a serious financial burden because of substantial delays in reeiving their payments. Fianna Fáil learned last week that the average processing time for carer's benefit and carer's allowance was more than 18 weeks. The appeals process could take a further 23 weeks. This means that a carer could be waiting more than nine months before receiving a payment. This is unacceptable and symptomatic of the unfairness perpetrated by Fine Gael in government. I ask the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to address the House and explain the delays and outline the actions he is taking to ensure his Department fully supports and engages with the carer community. These processing delays place additional stress on carers who are already under immense pressure as a result of their caring roles. Efforts should be made to ease the burden, not exacerbate it. As carers provide an invaluable service for the State, it is only fair that the Government show them the respect they deserve.

You will be an excellent Cathaoirleach. I refer to the situation in Orlando. It is quite clear that it was a hate crime. The people targeted were overwhelmingly gay latino men. It seems that Mr. Mateen was a troubled person. He had expressed violent views on gay people and had been very negative. Apparently, he had been upset by the spectacle of two men kissing, as recorded by his wife, yet he had been obsessed by Pulse. He had been there more than a dozen times and engaged in gay chat services. It appears as if he might have had some trouble with his own sexual identity, which suggests there is a great deal of work to do, even in countries like America. This was a terrible crime and highlights the situation regarding gun use. It is extraordinary that people can be put on a "no fly" list, yet they can still go and buy heavy machines guns.  We have a lot to do in this Seanad. I suppose the most striking issue before us is Seanad reform. I believe virtually everybody in the House has views on it. They strongly believe in reform of the Seanad. The Government claims to believe in the reform of the Seanad a;sp and it is by this yardstick that this Seanad will be judged. We will be judged on whether we get substantial and real Seanad reform, not just some tricking around and loosening at the edges and so on. It has to be comprehensive and full. I look forward very much to the debate on the issue.  There is also the issue of the eighth amendment. It is extraordinary that people in this country still believe that from their religious position they can intervene in a situation where a 13 year old girl has been raped and direct her on what decision she should take. The same applies in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. It is an obscenity that the mother of an unfortunate child with no brain, no nervous system and so on should be forced, regardless of whether it was against her will, to keep the child. We must look also at the question of direct provision on which I have legislation that I hope to present to the House. It nearly passed the last time. The President has called on the Oireachtas to become involved in this issue. We nearly did it the last time and I believe we can do it again in this Seanad.  There is also the Living City initiative which was introduced partly as a result of pressure from this House to rescue the inner city core of buildings. This has been completely unacceptable. Only 33 applications were made nationally. This is because it was hedged around, festooned, as The Irish Times editorial stated this morning, with all kinds of inhibition preventing people from taking it up. In particular, speaking as somebody who is interested in the preservation of the Georgian core of Dublin, I was horrified at the restriction of 210 sq. m. As a civil servant said at the time, it was specifically to exclude what were described as Georgian mansions.These buildings are a feature of the city; they are the identifying mark. They are the buildings that most need to be rescued. I understand the postion will be kept under review by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, but this House should have a significant role to play in extending and making acceptable the terms under which Living city initiative grants are made. Despite some people's faint-hearted anticipation that we will have very little to discuss other than statements, we will have much to discuss. There is legislation from these benches. My colleague and friend, Senator Michael McDowell, will, for example, be presenting a Bill. I have some difficulties with it and will make them clear during the discussion on the legislation. Senator Gerard P. Craughwell also has a Bill to introduce. There are many legislative measures being brought forward by those on this side of the House and I look forward to the Government treating them with respect.

I commend the Yes Equality and LGBT groups throughout the country and in County Mayo for the vigils they are organising in solidarity and support for the community in Orlando. I will refer briefly to the issue of Seanad reform. Our team in the Seanad is adamant that the recommendations that have been made must be implemented and that the necessary reform must be carried through. We have a motion which will be submitted tomorrow on the establishment of a sub-committee to examine properly how this could be done, but we will also be supportive of other Bills which reflect our commitment to the reform that is necessary of this House. The Minister for Health should be invited to the Seanad to address the emergency where 26,000 operations and procedures have been cancelled in hospitals. This is due to beds being taken out of the system from the 1980s to the present. This allows medical teams who are paid huge amounts of money to stand by and do nothing because they do not have beds in which they can treat patients. Those who have taken the beds out of the system must be held accountable for the 26,000 people who have not been able to have their procedures performed. In addition, will the Minister with responsibility for heritage be invited to the House to explain the bizarre situation where the Government is appealing the decision on the monuments on Moore Street and outline the rationale for it?

On behalf of the Civil Engagement group, I echo the message of solidarity and concern following the tragic events that unfolded in Orlando. I attended the vigil that took place this week in the same location, next to Dublin City Hall, where last year Ireland celebrated the transformation in LGBT rights. It was a very sad occasion and sad to see such a solemn and concerned atmosphere among those attending. We extend our concern and solidarity to those in Orlando, but it is also imperative that we send a message on the importance of a considered response grounded in respect and peace and a concern for diversity and a recognition of diversity. That is very important, as well as to acknowledge the homophobic nature of the attack. On the Order of Business, my colleagues will address a number of the motions which have been tabled. The Civil Engagement group is happy to support what we believe could be a transformative opportunity in terms of the introduction of a Bill to implement the Manning report. It will be introduced later and we look forward to supporting it and working with all Members of the House as it proceeds through the House.Senator Lynn Ruane who spoke earlier during the Commencement debate will address other concerns and some of the motions tabled.  We note that statements on delivering sustainable full employment are included in the Order of Business. We should move speedily within this House in order that we do not simply look to make statements on issues such as full employment but also look to debate solid motions and legislation. I echo the points made by Senator David Norris. I believe there is a wealth of proposals and legislation that could emerge from all sides of the House and there is the strength to pass them through this House. I look forward to seeing this in play. An issue that emerged today that is not included in the Order of Business is the publication by Women's Aid of figures that are shocking to us all. They concern the continued depth and presence of violence against women. We may look at this issue at a future date. Again, this House could play a role in driving forward the practical measures that will be needed to ensure real implementation of the Istanbul Convention.

I commend GLEN, BeLonGTo and Transgender Equality Network Ireland for organising the vigil on Monday evening and the Lord Mayor of Dublin for opening the book of condolences in the Mansion House. I understand it is open until 4 p.m. today. Again, I express my sympathy not only to those in Orlando but also the family of the police officer killed so horrifically in Paris. I join Senator Alice-Mary Higgins in calling for a debate on domestic violence in the light of the figures published today by Women's Aid. We had some very good collaborative work in previous Seanadaí on domestic violence and mechanisms to address this huge problem. I also look forward to working with colleagues from all parties and the Independent group on the pressing issue of Seanad reform. In particular, the Labour Party group in the Seanad will reintroduce the Competition (Amendment) Bill. We would like to see further progress on this Bill, a Private Members' Bill which was accepted on Second Stage by the Government in January. I hope we will see it proceed through the House as a Private Members' Bill. I ask the Leader for a debate on the ruling last week of the United Nations Human Rights Committee on the application brought by Amanda Mellet. I commend her for her bravery and that of her family and those involved in Termination for Medical Reasons because the ruling of the committee has shone a light on the need to address the eighth amendment to the Constitution. The finding that Ireland was in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and had violated the human rights of Ms Mellet because of the prohibition in our law of termination, even in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, deserves a very prompt and urgent response from the Government. I am disappointed to hear the Taoiseach appear to dismiss or denigrate that ruling as not being binding. I am concerned for two reasons about his proposal to establish a citizens' assembly. First, it appears to be an attempt to delay taking any action on the need to abolish the eighth amendment. The Taoiseach did not need to put the issue of Seanad abolition to a citizens' assembly before he called the referendum on it and I do not believe we need a citizens' assembly before we have a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment. Second, some commentary on the citizens' assembly from Fine Gael politicians has betrayed an anti-politician tenor that is disturbing, that this idea is somehow going to be better than the Convention on the Constitution, a model which I think all of us in the previous Seanad agreed was a very worthwhile model that paved the way for the marriage equality referendum. The Constitutional Convention was made up of representatives of political parties and citizens chosen in accordance with the demographics of the country. This sort of model would be preferable to a citizens' assembly. If a citizens' assembly is to be held, it needs to be done expeditiously and we do not want to see further delay. We do not want to see any more cases like that of Savita Halappanavar or the tragic case in the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar. We need to move towards repeal of the eighth amendment without delay.

That would give post office more business. I ask the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Seán Canney, to come before the Seanad to speak about the issue of flood defences, particularly the minor works scheme. We know that a major €430 million major capital investment was announced last summer by the OPW, which was very welcome. Some of these schemes will not be rolled out for several years and in the meantime, there is a minor works scheme that could be used. I am concerned that there may be obstacles or delays in rolling it out. In particular, I am thinking of Crossmolina, near where I live, as people were very badly affected. Such is their frustration with the pace of progress that they are prepared to go into the river, which is not a good idea. We must receive an update on how the existing scheme which can facilitate shorter term solutions is being used to our benefit and to avoid potential flooding when the winter comes. This is the time to act in the summer.

A couple of years ago 91% of American people polled wanted background checks to be carried out to ensure gun control, but such an initiative could not get 60 votes in the US Senate because of the money the National Rifle Association had donated to politicians. In my own restaurants in Chicago I have a notice on the doors with a gun and a red line through it, as it is legal to carry concealed weapons in Chicago. That is so that I will be covered legally if someone shoots in my restaurant. This has all come from the money spent by these political action committees. There is no control over the money coming in to these committees and they can spend it how they like, with no disclosure. We must ensure we do not allow that to happen in this country.

Members may be aware that such policies involve an applicant taking out a life cover policy for events after his or her death and it would protect the family financially. It is good and useful for most people to take out such a policy. However, people do not seem to realise that after paying into such a policy for ten years, an anniversary is reached where an insurance company may, and invariably will, increase the premia significantly, with no corresponding increase in the guaranteed sum. I can give a brief example. Ten years ago an individual took out a whole-of-life assurance policy, with the premium set at €90 per month and the assured sum at €100,000.Ten years later the sum insured has grown to approximately €220,000, a 100% increase, but the premium has increased from €90 up to €800 per month, something most people cannot afford. When these policies are being sold, it is not made clear to the purchaser that this is going to be the scenario. One finds people who are entering middle and old age and can no longer afford to maintain the premiums on their life cover at a time when, actuarially, they probably have more need of it than ever before. This matter was raised in the previous Dáil by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, who has identified a very significant cohort of people who are caught in the trap to which I refer. It is a trap because in many cases individuals have used life cover as security for their mortgages and cannot arbitrarily opt out because they do not then have mortgage protection, which is more difficult to obtain the older one gets. This matter must be examined. I raised it briefly in the previous Seanad. I am going to bring forward a Bill to deal with it soon if I do not see the Minister moving on the issue. I hope the Leader will make that possible.

I am very pleased to see the consensus among speakers today in favour of reform of this House and moving ahead with that process. Senator Catherine Ardagh, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, has spoken about it; Sinn Féin is committed to it, as is Senator Ivana Bacik on behalf of the Labour Party and Senator Alice-Mary Higgins on behalf of Civil Engagement. Given that the Leader of the House represents a Government that has as part of its programme the implementation of the Manning report, it strikes me that there is overwhelming consensus in this House on moving forward on the question of reform, even allowing for the minor difference that Senator David Norris has about his particular constituency. In these circumstances, two things strike me that I want to put before the House. I understand completely that due to the delay in the formation of a Government and the fact the Government is in a minority in the Lower House, there will be a dearth of Government legislative proposals for some time and the volume of Government legislation will be less than has been the case for a long period. I urge the House to make good use of the time available to it to deal with proposals which do not necessarily come from the Government but which are, particularly in the case to which I am referring, in accordance with the programme for Government. We should not just shoehorn everything that is not proposed by the Leader into Private Members' business. Rather, we should order business so as to accommodate the issues the House wants to deal with. It is in that context that I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that No. 11 be taken before No. 1.

Tuigim go bhfuil roinnt Gaeilge ag an gcuid is mó den dream atá anseo agus tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh muid ag tabhairt ceannródaíochta ó thaobh na Gaeilge de i dTithe an Oireachtais. Chomh maith leis sin, ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an gCeannaire go mbeadh díospóireacht againn leis an Aire Stáit Gaeltachta maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta agus na pleananna atá aige ins an tréimhse Rialtais seo. I am encouraging any Senator who does have a cúpla focal to try to use them. It is important that we show ceannródaíocht and that we use it in the Seanad. The amount of Irish used in recent years has been very positive. Will the Leader also clarify the time slots allotted to different speakers in dealing with Private Members' business? It is not clear how much time will be allotted in the various slots. We are often accused in the Seanad of speaking rubbish. I think we need a Minister to come here and talk rubbish to us because there is a huge issue with the final act of the Labour Party and Deputy Alan Kelly in government to allow private companies to increase refuse collection charges. There is a plethora of companies providing these services and no regulation of what is happening.There is a situation in Connemara where companies are trying to charge people a €224 standing charge without ever picking up a bin or a bag. I am told that the same company is running the exact same service in County Leitrim, but it is only charging a standing charge of €80. Fair play to those involved in County Leitrim. I am not sure how they pulled that one off, but certainly we in Connemara and Galway will not take it sitting down. It illustrates how this bin tax which is being imposed on people is totally unacceptable. It comes from the privatisation of the refuse collection system which was ill-thought out and which, in our opinion, should not have been put forward. It needs to be reviewed. We need the Minister for rubbish - I am not certain whether it is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government who is dealing with the matter or if it is has been passed over to the new Minister - to discuss this isue immediately. The measure is to start in July and has been ill-thought out. There are families who cannot afford to pay their water charges, the property tax and so forth and they see this as another tax being piled upon them with very little choice and very little consultation. There are questions about where the money is going, where the data are being collected and how they are being used. I urge the Leader to have that debate next week, if possible. It is a very pressing issue.

I acknowledge the work of carers in society. This is National Carers' Week and, as my Fianna Fáil colleague said, there are long waiting lists of people applying to be carers.

I have just returned from Paris where I spent a few days and want to advise Members of this House that we should be very proud of the travelling supporters who are doing the country's name great service as supporters of the Republic of Ireland soccer team and also the supporters of the Northern Ireland soccer team in the European championship. I extend best wishes to them. I wish to raise two issues. I was taken aback by the response of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to Senator Lynn Ruane's Commencement matter today on the nature of addiction and drugs issues. It appears that the Minister is intending to separate the Misuse of Drugs Act into two pieces of legislation, which I do not think is necessary. What is needed in this House is a more elongated debate on the nature of addiction, drugs and drug crime and to put the issues on a proper footing, which would be in keeping with the international move towards decriminalisation and having a health rather than a criminal justice response.

The House was never more powerful than it was on the issue of direct provision. I believe Members will know, regardless of their political background, that this House was very impressive and managed to move that debate onto a higher platform when Members all stood together and tried to move the issue along. Once again, I was very taken aback when I saw a deletion from the programme for Government. It was a line from the draft programme for Government which referred to implementation of the McMahon report. Many Members of this House had difficulties with the report and possibly felt it did not go far enough. They believe the direct provision system should have been abolished, but at least the McMahon report was the first proper report on the direct provision system in 15 years and it would have gone a long way towards helping the lives of those in the system. The recommendation made in the draft programme for Government that the McMahon report be implemented was deleted and does not feature in the actual programme for Government. I ask that the House again use its campaigning zeal to seek reform of the direct provision system. Collectively and regardless of political backgrounds, all Members believe these reforms and the McMahon report need to be implemented in full.

I congratulate him on his election as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and look forward to working with all colleagues across the House on various issues during the term of this Seanad. I also wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to those affected by the Orlando killings which were terrible. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of those in the LGBT community and all those affected by these horrible killings. I call on the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on the future employment skills needs of the country. As the economy recovers, we see employers struggling to find workers with the appropriate skill sets to fill the vacancies being advertised in locations throughout the country. As a former apprentice, this is an area that certainly needs review and reform. We should always be evaluating and considering lifelong learning, reskilling and training, but there is a particular need for this now, especially in the construction sector where there is a lack of apprentices coming through in the various trades, as the economy recovers and demand increases. It is important that we have a debate in the House and that we bring in the various Ministers responsible for education, employment and job creation and have an in-depth analysis of current and future skill needs not only in Dublin but in all regions. We need to improve the language capabilities of students who are qualifying, given the job opportunities available to them. It is another area in which there are huge job opportunities for the country. I ask the Leader to make provision for a debate in this House on skill needs and future requirements and demands.

I ask the Leader to convey to the American ambassador the deepest sympathy of the House. On Thursday week we face a major challenge in the Brexit referendum in Britain. Our trade is €1 billion a week with Britain which is our biggest import market and second biggest export market. Ireland is its fourth largest trading partner. There are many Irish families living in Britain. Some may resent the fact we would intervene, but it would be helpful if we were to contact friends and relations in the United Kingdom in the next few days. The vote will have a major impact on the future of this as well as the British economy. A number of former Ministers and Ministers of State are now Members of this House and will realise what is involved in negotiations. I was involved in the negotiation of the Single European Act. Britain had a major input into that Act, as did Ireland. We worked together as a team in the European Union. I do not think the British people have been sufficiently informed about the influence of the United Kingdom and Ireland in those negotiations, the co-operation we received in the negotiations and the benefit to both island nations on the edge of Europe. It is vital that Britain remain in the European Union. The latest opinion polls are concerning. The Financial Times has just published that 44% of voters say they will vote to leave, while 47% say they will vote to remain. There are a number of undecided voters and the next few days will tell the tale. The campaign has been led with propaganda, particularly on the "Out" side, which reflects poorly on the ability and the achievements of the United Kingdom within the European Union. I appeal to anyone with relations in that country to give them a ring in the next few days and ask them to vote to stay. It is in our interests and the national interest and for the love of their country that they should vote to stay in the European Union.

I also wish well the Leader of the House, Senator Jerry Buttimer, as he takes the House forward. I note that we are starting on a bad footing, with statements. I would like the House to avoid statements as much as possible and to deal with legislation as we move forward. I would also love it if Members of the House remembered, regardless of whether they want to be in the Dáil, that they are in the Seanad and that we do not have geographical constituencies.This is a House of Parliament and I ask Members to try to keep the old constituency stuff at a minimum. I second Senator Michael McDowell’s amendment to the Order of Business.  I congratulate my colleague and good friend from Galway, Senator Billy Lawless, for drawing attention to gun law and the outrageous situation involving the National Rifle Association in the United States. The issue might be worthy of debate.  The former Ministers for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Defence and Public Expenditure and Reform did a fantastic job during the Easter celebrations to commemorate the centenary of the Easter Rising. As a result, a medal was struck for the members of the Defence Forces who paraded on that day. That medal will be available to anyone who joins the Defence Forces between now and the end of the year. However, 120 men who formerly served in the Defence Forces and are now members of the Irish United Nations Veterans Association, IUNVA, are denied access to the medal. That is an outrage. Not only did these men parade on Easter Sunday and at every military event but they have also served the country with distinction, at home and abroad. It is miserable in the extreme to deny them the medal that every other serving member of the Defence Forces will receive. I ask the Leader to take up the matter with the Minister for Defence. Other Members might perhaps join me in this request. Many suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, etc., and have sacrificed being with their families for a long time to serve the country. Will the Leader, please, ask the Minister about this and report back to the House?

I send my support, solidarity and love to the victims in Orlando. This is National Carers' Week. I acknowledge the hard work carers do day in day out, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, looking after their loved ones and the struggle they have in accessing facilities and resources. I also pay a tribute to the over 100,000 of my colleagues, nurses and midwives, of the entire island of Ireland. I thank them. I will miss them, but I will be here to support nurses and midwives throughout my tenure.  A matter in Cloverhill Remand Prison has come to my attention. The prison has a dedicated psychiatric nursing staff to care for persons placed on remand from remote courts all over the country during the night. They are often very disturbing cases and many involve mental illness. The nurses have an excellent record in not having to use special observation cells. They make the assessment immediately a person is admitted, realise what is needed and how much care and supervision is required. Mr. Fergal Black, the director of health for the Irish Prison Service, has decided to cut this night cover by 50%. That is outrageous and this House should support me in calling on the Minister to engage with the nurses and Mr. Black to stop the proposed cut.

I look forward to the debate on homelessness. The current situation is causing major hardship for families. A colleague of mine who came to Dublin last week had to pay €160 for a hotel room on a Wednesday night because of a concert. That is one aspect of the issue that needs to be addressed. The cost of hotel rooms is affecting the tourists who come to the country, particularly in Dublin. Tourism increased by 33% between 2010 and 2015, but the number of hotel rooms has decreased. This issue must be tackled immediately because it could damage the tourism potential of the city and country.

He was well chosen and brings experience and integrity to the role. He is a great listener and fair. I also congratulate Senator Jerry Buttimer on his appointment as Leader of the House. He has the qualities to make the Twenty-fifth Seanad which comprises an elected group of powerful people come alive internally and externally. He chaired the meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children when it was discussing end-of-life issues and did so with exceptional ability, determination and compassion. He will bring the same talent to the House. Everybody is talking about reform of the Seanad which we need internally and externally in terms of how people get here and what they do afterwards. I would like to make a suggestion to the Cathaoirleach. Perhaps we might have more control of electronic equipment in order that Senators who come to the House would listen to arguments and argue against each other without having their heads in phones or tablets, especially when some of the subjects about which we are arguing are quite profound, if not life-changing. It is very disconcerting to be sitting beside somebody who might be ordering shoes or talking to relations all over the world. I am not against electronic media, but we should show a certain discretion, especially when the national and international world is now watching us on screens. My grandmother used to say that if one wanted to change things, one had better start in one's kitchen as opposed to going up town. Perhaps we should start with a few mannerly changes in the House, one of which could involve the discretionary use of electronic media.

I also extend my condolences to the families of those killed in Orlando. It is National Carers' Week and we are all endorsing the great work carers do. It is all very fine to talk about that issue, but it is another thing to provide proper support. Some 63% of people with dementia are living at home and are primarily cared for by the carers of whom we speak. We know that those diagnosed with dementia would like to live at home, but their carers would like some help. Until such time as we put home care on a similar statutory basis to the fair deal scheme for residential care, we will continue to have budgets that are inadequate and people who cannot access that level of care. At some point I hope to receive cross-party support in the House for the establishment of a fair deal scheme for home care in order that we are not just saying nice words and patting carers on the head. I want us to do something practical for them and those for whom they are caring. We know from reports that people have a preference to be cared for at home.

I wish to see equality, awareness of disability and difference and diversity become a mandatory component of primary education in this country. As legislators, we can introduce the most forward thinking, radical legislation one could possibly imagine to prevent inequality, prejudice and people being treated in a bad way but no matter what we do we must change people's mindset. The only way we can do that is through education. The reason I make such a call is because in one seaside resort in County Clare, in recent months, a person of small stature was hired by ladies on a hen party. He was chained to the hen and displayed in a most despicable and vulgar manner and it was portrayed in the media as entertainment. It was not entertainment; it was a disgraceful abuse of somebody who was of small stature. We can introduce legislation in this House, but we will not stop such things happening. The only way we can stop it is by creating awareness among young people in order that future generations will not consider such behaviour as a form of entertainment worth paying for. This country is great and the vast majority of people who go on weekends away, be they for stag parties, hen parties or any other kind of entertainment, behave themselves and act in a respectful manner. Unfortunately, a minority do not and the only way to eliminate them is through education. I call on the Leader to organise for the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to talk about reviewing the primary school curriculum in a way that would embed, embrace and deliver equality and disability awareness in a way that would be meaningful and make a difference.

As Fianna Fáil spokesperson on health, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the district hospital network with a view to establishing a capital investment programme to upgrade some of the facilities. District hospitals should not be seen as a relic of a bygone era and if adequately resourced, they can provide a vital cog in the delivery of a modern health service. They are a widespread resource. We are not talking about a new layer of bureaucracy. There are more than 100 district hospitals around the country. Without being parochial, in deference to what Senator Gerard P. Craughwell said, there are four district hospitals in County Mayo and with the correct level of investment, we could alleviate the pressures on the secondary hospital system. The district hospital network operates in three separate ways in so far as they prevent admissions to acute hospitals, facilitate discharges from acute hospitals and can also work as an interface between the fair deal system, which is experiencing some delays, even though it has improved in recent months.
#VictorBoyhan	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-party	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-dob	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	76	Will the Leader considering inviting the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, to the House to explain and give some rationale for a proposal that was announced in the national media yesterday about the provision of €200 million for a critical infrastructure fund? We know that there is a social and affordable housing crisis. Everyone in politics and public life knows this, as do citizens, yet it seems to be taking so long to address it. From talking to councillors right around the country we know that critical infrastructure is short in many places. We know that many bad planning decisions were made where no critical infrastructure was provided on land that had been zoned by people of all parties and none across local government. We also know that the Planning and Development Act clearly provides for sections 48 and 49 levy schemes for planning permissions to provide for contributions by developers in respect of development and that ultimately they would be ring-fenced for critical infrastructure to aid, assist and bring about these developments.I refer, in particular, to housing. It is great that, yesterday and the day before, the Minister made a host of announcements in the media that funding for housing was coming, which is welcome. It is interesting that the Minister has hit the ground running with announcements, but they must go a little further. I note that in today's edition of The Irish Times there is a correction regarding these announcements yesterday in the media and that this funding will not come until the back end of 2017. I ask the Leader for clarification in this regard because, throughout the country, approvals for planning permission are withering on the vine because developers cannot get projects off the ground as a result of the lack of infrastructure and bad planning in preparing for that infrastructure. More importantly, in some cases it is not viable and I was informed the other day of a cost of €45,000 for critical infrastructure before one even got going. As that will not happen, Members must face up to the reality. A continuous supply of affordable and social housing is needed and I look forward to partaking in the debate on homelessness later because this also is part of the subject. However, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister into the Chamber to clarify what this fund is, when will it come on stream and where he will allocate it.

However, on listening to the contribution on Brexit of a Fianna Fáil colleague, I note that I am in the unique position of having a vote in that referendum which I will use to put Ireland first by voting to remain. That is because, in the first instance, that is the best thing to do in the national interest and our interests as an island nation. There is, of course, another Union to stay out of on which I would love to have a vote, but I hope down the line, as allowed for in the Good Friday Agreement, perhaps the Seanad might fulfil the ideals of 1916 as outlined and work towards having a Border poll and democratically give everyone the right to assert national independence. Ar an drochuair, is in ísle brí go gcaithfidh mé i dtús báire tragóid a tharla sa Fhrainc i rith na seachtaine le linn comórtas sacair Euro 2016, atá ar siúl sa tír sin faoi láthair, a ardú sa Teach inniu. As many Members will be aware, despite all the joyous revelry taking place in France during the European Championships this week, unfortunately we lost young Darren Rodgers from Ballymena while over there, when he tragically fell to his death. On behalf of all Members I am sure, I send sympathy to Darren's family, friends and all those who were with him.  I hope the Chair will indulge me as I intend to ask the Leader to do something unique and I will be brief. I refer to the fans who have travelled and represented both teams, and us overall, exceptionally well by their behaviour and conduct and in the revelry in which they have been engaged. However, Members will also be aware that the family of Lee McLaughlin in County Donegal has issued an appeal for people to keep an eye out for him. He is missing and his family is unaware of his whereabouts. We have a duty of care to thoe who travel overseas, in particular for major international soccer or rugby tournaments, to which such vast numbers of citizens travel. Perhaps the Ministers with responsibility for sport, both North and South, as well as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, OFMDFM, might consider organising a concerted campaign on how to promote welfare, look after one another and engage with people back home. While I appreciate I am not seeking something specific, perhaps the Seanad might consider the welfare of citizens who are travelling abroad in such big numbers.

I wish them both, as well as all Members, well. While they may have different views, they are a family in the work they are committed to doing as part of the Oireachtas. I wish to take a moment to remember a former Member of this House with whom I became very friendly many years ago, namely, Joe Doyle, and send my regards to his wife, Peggy, and family. He was a lovely man and I worked closely with him a number of times. In respect of what happened in Orlando, in one way it absolutely and horrendously was an attack on a community. Members also must understand, within that horrendous context, that it was an attack on democratic participation.Democracy guarantees that every life, no matter whose, is sacred and as valuable as anyone else's. I have been heard to say before that the issue of disability is not a sectoral one but a societal one. In the same way as for any group in society that is being attacked or not getting fairness, it is an attack on the whole of society. It has been mentioned that this is National Carers' Week. I was pleased to have the opportunity to participate in its launch on Monday morning. I will bring two insights to the debate. First, the great majority of carers, up to 80%, are female. I put this thought to us all: what more practical way to support, liberate and encourage the full participation of women in society than taking the yoke of 24/7 care from them as best we can? The other point I make about caring is that one does not just become a carer and cease being a lover or relative - son, brother, father, mother or whatever else. It is something that comes with living, but it should not be something that absolutely consumes the person involved. My being here is a function of receiving support from everybody from right across the political spectrum, not only the Members of both Houses but particularly local authority members. I was extremely struck - it was an eye-opener for me and is a reflection on some of the points made this morning - by the fantastic and often unsung work members of local authorities were doing and the commitment and heart they brought to it. Every entity in the Oireachtas is in support of the ratification and implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which is to be ratified by the end of this year. My request to the House and the Leader is to ensure we can bring that flavour of inclusiveness for persons with disabilities, their families and carers into every debate and our every consideration.
#CatherineNoone	unknown-#CatherineNoone-party	unknown-#CatherineNoone-dob	unknown-#CatherineNoone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	79	I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his elevation and congratulate the Leader, both of whom will do a fine job. I want to highlight an issue that I highlighted several times in the previous Seanad, that is, childhood obesity. In particular, I highlight a report produced by the Irish Heart Foundation which has found that junk food companies or food companies which are selling particular junk food products are purposely targeting young Irish teenagers on social media sites such as Facebook. These companies are trying to get them as young as they can, but, as young as they are, they are being targeted. The report reveals that the sophisticated techniques used to target children online through Facebook include tagging and comments. They do it in a humorous way and sometimes make reference to sports stars and festivals. It is subliminal and sophisticated. According to a child psychiatrist - this morning I was researching this a little - these companies are using high-tech analytics to target children directly in order that they can monitor them. Perhaps Senators have seen on social media that if one shows an interest in a certain matter, suddenly one finds one has many other things to do with it on one's feed. This is dangerous. We have legislation in place to restrict this type of advertising, which is targeted at children in specific ways and social media should not be any different. According to the research, 75% of parents were extremely unhappy when they discovered that this was happening. They did not have a clue that this type of marketing was ainmed at their children. We have a serious issue with childhood obesity in this country, with one child in four either overweight or obese. I must have stated that statistic about 150 times in the Seanad. We have not done enough to date. The Government now has a Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion and I do not want the job to be symbolic.I want us to take this issue seriously as the situation is grave. Hospitals already suffer under the weight of diabetes, cancer and other lifestyle-related issues. Obesity is the elephant in the room. We have to address and face up to the issue. Some people are very aware of it. The vast majority of the population are busy living and perhaps not putting as much focus on it as we should. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on obesity, in particular childhood obesity, as early as possible. I ask him to bring the new Minister here to discuss how we will tackle the problem in a real way and have no more symbolism.

Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill referred to a Donegal man who was missing in Paris. I understand the missing man has been found safe and well, which is good news for sports lovers and the House. I wanted to inform the House of that development in case the Leader responded to the matter. The next speaker is Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor. I apologise for the delay. I will try to get around to everybody who wants to speak.

I know that he will do exceptionally well and will be very fair to everyone, which is so important. Second, I convey my sympathy to the families of the Orlando victims. Everybody has been affected by the incident. It was an awful tragedy. I do not wish to repeat what everyone has said about National Carers' Week. A carer's work is invaluable. It is so hard to learn, when one reads the figures and is fighting for people to have carers, that there is a backlog of 11 months in arranging appeals to have carers provided. We live in a society where people are living longer and we encourage them to stay in their homes, which is part of the policy of the new Government, yet we must fight for 11 months to arrange appeals to have carers provided for the elderly and others. This is not good enough. I ask the Cathaoirleach to call on the Minister to address this matter because it needs to be addressed urgently. There will be no point in us sitting here next year during National Carers' Week having waited a further 11 months for appeals to be heard. This is not good enough and unacceptable. On a local issue, I represent Carlow as part of my role in the Seanad. I do not know if in many other counties there are respite centres, but the only one in Carlow was called Tir na nÓg and it catered for children aged from two to 18 years. As Senators may know, Carlow has a population of 59,000. Sadly, the centre was closed a few months ago, even though it provided a vital service for the people, particularly the children, of Carlow. I need answers; the people of Carlow want the centre to be reopened and I need to make sure funding is in place. I ask the Minister for Health to come here to address the matter.

Bhí mé an-sásta cloisteáil go raibh an Seanadóir Trevor Ó Clochartaigh ag labhairt ar ball ó thaobh Gaeilge a úsáid mar is í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga atá agamsa. I had to learn English which means that English is my second language. People sometimes say to me that they know from the way I speak English I grew up speaking Irish. I do not know if that is a compliment or otherwise. Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach as ucht an deis labhairt ar feadh nóiméad nó dhó. In this House I feel like a square pin in a round hole or whatever because I come from a different space. I am still working my way around, but I have learned two things. First, there is tremendous passion in this room and I feel very privileged to be part of this group. Senators really mean what they are talking about and are totally passionate, which will make a difference. Second, as Senators, we come from so many backgrounds. I do not want to pick out one person, but it is really important that we have somebody here to represent the diaspora and that person is Senator Billy Lawless. I hope someone in the media is listening to me. Senator Billy Lawless has employed not only my daughter but hundreds of sons and daughters of people from all over Ireland. Fair play to him. Not only that - it has not just been him - other Irish people living abroad back each other up. Sometimes I ask the following question. Could we not back each other up a little more on this island? It is for that reason I believe I can work with everybody in the Seanad and hope everybody here can work with me. It is not really Seanad reform that I seek. I want it to be reinvented, which goes a little deeper than reform, because we can and will make a difference. For me, the measurement of whatever length of time I will be in the Seanad, will be asking myself what little contribution I made and what did we do as a group to make a real difference. I ask the Cathaoirleach to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to address two issues. The first is the drop-out rate at third level, with many people who take the leaving certificate examinations and go on to third level dropping out within 12 months. In some third level institutions the rate is 25%, while in others it is around 12%. That is a huge loss to the economy and the country and I would like to know why it is happening and what can be done about it. The second issue relating to education, about which a number of people have contacted me, albeit not recently but in the middle and more distant past, is the level of depression and stress among secondary schoolchildren. This is significant in the context of fighting depression in adult life. Teachers, particularly career guidance teachers, should be supported and equipped to deal with it in the first instance. I would appreciate it if we could invite the Minister to address the House on these issues.

I also join other Senators in expressing my sincere sympathy to the families of the victims of the recent tragedies in Orlando and Paris. Senator Terry Leyden raised the very timely and important issue of the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom on its continuing membership of the European Union. This is vitally important and I echo the Senator's call for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, or the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, to come into the House to take statements on the issue, although I know that they are both travelling today. It is my strongly held view that membership of the European Union has been a wholly positive experience for the people of the United Kingdom, Ireland and all other member states. I hosted a briefing this morning on opportunities for young graduates within the European Union. A huge amount of EU funding is available for groups all over the country. However, the Erasmus+ programme only receives half of the number of applications that it should owing to the difficulty of the application process which is implemented by Léargas and other bodies. In that context, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to the House to take statements on the process of applying for Erasmus+ funding and to resolve the issues involved in order that more groups in Ireland will be able to avail of this much-needed funding.

I ask that extra resources be provided because this is an essential service, particularly at this time of year when many people are going on holidays and need passports at short notice. In that context, I also ask the Minister to ensure the Passport Office will do as the motor taxation office does and text people a month or two before their passport expires and send them a reminder by post. This is not rocket science. People can forget, particularly as passports last for ten years, that their passport is out of date and it is only when they have a journey to make that they become aware that it has expired. I welcome the comments made today on Seanad reform. As I said last week, everyone here has a part to play in reforming the Seanad. I welcome, in particular, the legislation introduced by Senator Michael McDowell, and my party will be making a contribution to the debate on same. I also welcome other parties making contributions and bringing forward motions, particularly as they campaigned vigorously to get rid of this House. If they had their way, the Seanad would not be in place to be reformed. In order for it to remain, there is an obligation on us to reform the Seanad and not leave it to others to do so.

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to come to the House to debate the crisis in child care. There is a massive crisis, at the root of which is funding. As an illustration of how bad the funding position is, as a percentage of GDP, we spend 0.2% on child care. We are not just at the bottom of the European league; we are at the bottom by 1 million miles. The next worst is the United Kingdom which spends four times as much. It is clear we are in trouble when the Tory Government spends four times as much as the Irish Government on child care. Three crèches have closed in Limerick in the past week. In one case, at Tic Toc crèche in Westbury, the workers had to sit in to get their rights to redundancy payments. At the heart of the crisis is funding. Typical pay for a child care worker is €9.80 per hour. That is how little we value child care, despite all the rhetoric, and it is an indictment of the last and previous Governments in the past ten or 20 years. That it was not addressed during the Celtic tiger period is an absolute disgrace. Child care workers on the front line are voting with their feet. People who are qualified with doctoral and master's degrees are leaving to take up child care posts in America, Britain and other countries where they are paid properly. We need a debate on this issue. We need to address the crisis. I am proud to be a member of SIPTU which is working hard to address it with its Big Start campaign. It deserves support and recognition from the Department. The workers who are on the front line need to be at the heart of the solution to the child care crisis. I would appreciate it if that request could be made.
#FrancesBlack	unknown-#FrancesBlack-party	unknown-#FrancesBlack-dob	unknown-#FrancesBlack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	86	I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his new post. He is a kind, good and fair man and comes from a great part of the county, Sheep's Head, which I love dearly. I convey my condolences to the people of Orlando and the LGBT community. I ask the House to bear with me. I am a little nervous, as this is my first time to speak in the Seanad. I wish to highlight the issue of the misuse of alcohol in Ireland. It is an issue about which I have been concerned for many years. I have spoken openly about my recovery from alcohol misuse. Following my recovery, I became an addiction therapist and have seen the issues that have arisen and how we are losing young people to alcohol misuse. We are losing them not only to drug problems and gambling but also to alcohol misuse. I highlight the devastating impact of alcohol misuse, drug misuse and gambling on families. I have worked with such families for many years and witnessed the devastation caused. Family members can have mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, stress and worry. There is not a family in the country that does not have somebody in their lives who may have an alcohol misuse problem. I am not talking about the final stages of addiction but rather alcohol misuse. We have a huge binge drinking culture, which is scary. It is connected to many issues such as road deaths and suicide. Alcohol is a depressant and causes depression. After people binge drink at the weekend, the devastation and depression they experience during the week is beyond the beyond. I would like to think the House would debate the alcohol Bill and bring it to the next Stages. I hope we can also work on the impact alcohol misuse has on families.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	87	I congratulate the Cathaoirleach, both as a colleague from the legal profession and as a person from Cork, and wish him every success in his new role. I compliment him also on the role played as Leas-Chathaoirleach in the last Seanad when he was always fair to everybody in every debate. I also congratulate another colleague from Cork, Senator Jerry Buttimer, and wish him well in his new role as Leader of the House. I look forward to working with both of them. I wish to raise an issue about health care.There is a perception that hospitals are not providing the services we require, but it is interesting to consider the figures that were published recently. In 2015, there were 3.5 million outpatient attendances - 60,000 per week or 12,000 per day. That includes services such as day case procedures and outpatient departments. It shows the dedication and commitment of the nurses, staff and all the people who are working in the HSE. I compliment them on the valuable service they provide. The figures of 12,000 people per day and 60,000 per week attending as outpatients are sometimes not mentioned. My colleague in Sinn Féin raised the issue of bed closures. The health service has moved from a situation where many procedures required admission to hospital to one where many of them are now day procedures. There is also the issue of general practitioners. Many GPs seek to deal with certain areas of health care which were traditionally referred to a hospital. It is extremely important that the contract negotiations between GPs and the Department of Health be progressed and concluded. There is no point in returning, three or four years hence, to negotiations that should have been concluded. It is time for the Department to move on this matter. It is also time for it to include all the representative bodies for GPs in these negotiations, which means not only the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, but also the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP. As these negotiations are important, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to outline the progress that has been made on the matter in the past 12 months and whether there is a timeline for making progress to bring it to a conclusion. GPs can then provide additional services and be adequately remunerated for them. It will also encourage more people to come home to this country to work in the service. The more GPs working in the service, the fewer referrals there will be to hospitals. That is extremely important for trying to progress and provide a comprehensive health service. Will the Leader deal with this issue and ask the Minister to outline the current position on it?

Will the Leader ask the appropriate Minister to visit the House to outline the whereabouts of the proposed national wind energy guidelines? Recently, Westmeath County Council introduced a variation to the county development plan which was supported unanimously by all parties and non-party members to include the equine industry in the noise sensitive receptors. As somebody who is very involved in that industry, I welcome this. Unfortunately, however, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, made a submission stating the council was contravening the existing wind energy guidelines. The current guidelines are outdated and archaic with regard to the modern wind turbines proposed. I am not opposed to wind energy projects, but the equine industry is a major one in this country. While we all probably have an eye on the soccer matches this week, the Royal Ascot race meeting is also taking place and every newspaper one opens carries plaudits from people all over the world for our horse breeding industry and the performance of the Irish thoroughbred. Thoroughbreds are extremely sensitive to wind turbines. Owing to the large equine industry in County Westmeath and also with an eye on the national industry, Westmeath County Council introduced the variation I mentioned, but it has been ruled out of order. When one tries to inquire about the proposed new wind energy guidelines, not only does nobody know what shelf they are on but also nobody appears to know which Minister is responsible for them. Today, it could be an energy matter but on another day it could be a planning issue. Will the Leader invite the appropriate Minister or Ministers to the House to inform us of the whereabouts of the new guidelines and when they will be announced? Perhaps we might then have a debate on the matter.

I also wish the Leader and the other Members who have been elected leaders and Whips well. I will start today as I mean to go on, as I did in the previous Seanad. A total of 43 Members of this House have been elected by councillors and it is important that we look after the welfare of those councillors. I listened to some of the contributions in which the issue of mental health and well-being was raised. There was a tragic incident during the Seanad election campaign in which a councillor took his own life. During that campaign I met scores of councillors suffering from stress and anxiety. They are unable to handle the case work they have been given; they do not know where or to whom they should guide people and they have nobody to whom they can turn to look after their mental well-being. I have checked this matter out with various local authorities. There are welfare officers in each local authority in the country but, believe it or not, they are not available to councillors. This issue must be addressed, and I hope it will be done quickly during this term. It requires a little common sense and the intervention of the Minister. It probably requires a special service to be put in place. I sat in the kitchen of a councillor's home for two hours - I will not say where in the country it is located - during which time he explained the cases with which he was dealing. They included people who were facing bankruptcy, people who were being put out of their homes and people who had marriage difficulties. He asked me how he was equipped to deal with these issues. He said he was not and that he was not even equipped to listen properly. Gone are the days when a county councillor attended a meeting once or twice a month and dealt with a few housing issues and perhaps some medical card issues. The workload of councillors has increased dramatically as a result of what has happened in this country. I commend my colleagues, Senators Gerard P. Craughwell and Victor Boyhan, for tabling the motion, to which I will propose an amendment relating to terms and conditions. This is about well-being. This week is Men's Health Week and this issue has been shoved under the carpet. Nobody wants to talk about it and some people are embarrassed about it. We normally take action after an event has happened. In this case, unfortunately, the event has happened. Obviously, I will not say where, as we all know what happened. It is the result of what I have just mentioned. On the first day the Minister comes to the House to discuss local government, he should address this issue.

The specific issue I wish to raise is Mr. Justice O'Higgins's report. The report which is excellent has generated an enormous amount of coverage on all national media, including social media. That is reasonable, given that it is a huge and important report. One element, however, that has received no coverage is very important for Garda morale, well-being and the provision of a Garda service. The Garda station is identified by Mr. Justice O'Higgins as being an old RIC station from 1870, to which a flat roofed area was added around 1970. The judge uses terms in the report such as "not fit for purpose", "deplorable conditions" and "not sound" to provide Garda services. He says that while it is not the only reason there were problems, it was a huge contributing factor. It is a relevant issue for the Leader to address. Perhaps he might get a response from the relevant Ministers on what will be done about accommodation for gardaí in Bailieborough. In the previous Oireachtas I lobbied the relevant Ministers - former Deputy Alan Shatter and Deputies Frances Fitzgerald and Simon Harris - intensely. I am aware that a site has been acquired for a new Garda station and that the legal procedures are ongoing. Will the Leader find out whether that process has concluded and if there is a timeframe for when the new station in Bailieborough will be built?It is a regional headquarters, of which this is an important element. I will provide the Leader with the relevant pages of the O'Higgins report which chronicles all of the deplorable conditions in five pages, including the various rooms that are not available and reception areas. I do not propose to read it, but I will hand it to the Leader later. The situation is chronic and immediate action is required. I need to know that there is a commitment that the legalities in acquiring the site which I gather is imminent have been concluded and that there is a timeframe for building the station.

I know that Senator Diarmuid Wilson was a member of an all-party committee that carried out much good, stable and common-sense work on councillors' terms and conditions. Given my seven years experience on a county council and five years on a town council, I know that there has been an immense increase in the workload of county councillors. This House needs to examine the issue. I would appreciate it if the relevant Minister attended the House for a debate on it.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	92	I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his election and the Leader of the House, Senator Jerry Buttimer, on his appointment. Reference was made to Seanad reform. I think Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh spoke about how this Chamber was very diverse in terms of Members' array of talents. Seanad reform is key, but the items the House deals with are more fundamental than this.  This is National Carers' Week. Senator Colette Kelleher spoke about people being cared for in their homes. We need to look at the fair deal scheme to see how it could be adapted in terms of providing care in a home setting. Putting someone in a nursing home is seen as a last resort by most people, regardless of whether they have a disabled spouse, disabled children or elderly parents. It should be seen as a last resort. We need to look at providing proper day-care services. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to come to the House? Ireland is recovering but, in the area of public procurement, I have come across a number of small family-owned businesses which had public contracts for the past 20 years but which have been unable to tender for them because they do not meet the size requirements for public tendering. As we need to consider this issue, I ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to come before the House to ensure that if a family business is doing a good job, it will not be at a disadvantage because of its size. I share all of the sentiments expressed about the tragedy in Orlando. I compliment Senator Billy Lawless because he brings a perspective on the holding of guns in the United States. I hope this will be a watershed, that common sense will prevail in the United States and that we can learn from what happens outside the country which has had issues with gun crime. We should learn from it and look at the legislation. The role of this House is to question legislation and decisions being made and for Members to operate collectively as a group. This Seanad has an opportunity to do things in a slightly different way. I look forward to it being a debating Chamber. I take Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's point. I was not aware that someone could order shoes on the Internet, but her basic point is relevant - that this is a debating Chamber and that we should have robust debate. We do not have to agree on everything, but it is important that everything be discussed to the proper degree.

I congratulate all Senators on being elected to the House. I am very honoured and privileged to be elected and be among the fine body of people I see in front of me. I compliment all Senators on their contributions. I compliment, in particular, Senator Frances Black whose contribution was very much from the heart and related to her personal experience and journey. If we are honest, every family in the country could tell a similar story. It is an issue we need to explore in more depth. I ask the Leader to ask the relevant Minister to come to the House to see how we can look at online gambling and the constraints we can introduce because it is a serious problem that is getting worse, among many others. Harking back to my past, many Senators mentioned the role of county councillors. I was elected as a town councillor in 1999 and as a county councillor in 2004. I would like to think I speak with some authority on the issue. The abolition of town councils was a serious mistake. It has done nothing for towns in rural Ireland and must be addressed. The workload has increased. Based on my experience - I do not say this lightly - that workload is unbelievable. It has reached the stage where very few people will be able to enter politics because the role of a county councillor is a full-time job if it is to be done properly. This issue, including that of terms and conditions, must be addressed at a time when we are trying to get more people, including more women, to become involved in politics. In removing town councils we have taken away the first tier of local government and the first step on the ladder. That is a mistake. The relevant Minister should come to the House to address all of these issues.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	94	I thank all 39 Senators who spoke on the Order of Business. In response to Senator Diarmuid Wilson, the time limits in dealing with Private Members' business are ten minutes for the proposer of the motion and six minutes for the seconder. Other speakers will have six minutes each and the Minister will have 15 minutes in which to respond. The time limits have been fixed by the House. Today, like many Senators, I have my "L" plates on and tá mé an-neirbhíseach. I thank all 20 Senators who spoke about what had happened in Orlando. As a member of the LGBT community, I was left numb on waking up on Sunday morning to and watch and listen to the television and news coverage of the depraved killing of 49 people. I say this as somebody who uses and sees night clubs, gay pubs and community venues as havens and a place of refuge where men and women of all ages can feel safe and secure without fear of being attacked, verbally or physically, let alone being gunned down, and where those within that community have a sense of belonging and acceptance. I join all other Senators in sending our sympathy to the husbands and wives, partners and families of those killed and ask the Cathaoirleach to send our deep condolences to the US ambassador. This is an act that took place during Pride month and to those who ask why Gay Pride continues, the events in Orlando and others across the world where people kill others in the name of religion show why it is needed. It comes 12 months after the referendum in this country when we acted as a beacon across the world. This week, across the country in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and other cities, a vigil is being organised through GLEN, LINC and the Gay Men's Health Service. It is an example of why we must continue our work and ensure no person who is born this way will be afraid to come out and live the life he or she can.I know that it is not a day for political statements, but I agree with Senator Billy Lawless that the issues of gun control and the right to bear arms in the United States of America are ones we must collectively try to change. I hope that, through his good offices, the Senator will be able to help in bringing about that change, irrespective of political ideology. That a person under surveillance can walk into a gun shop and buy two types of weapon and a couple of days later do what he did begs a serious question. It is a lesson we must all consider. I hope that following the events in Orlando we can send a message to our sons, daughters and friends that it is okay to come out as gay and live a normal life. If we do not do this, we will go back to the days when they were suppressed. I appeal to those of other religions not to see this as western values versus those in the Far East or wherever else. Those of us who are gay are men and women of value, principle and integrity. We must all work to ensure our society and world will be better and kinder places. Seven Members mentioned that this was carers' week. Last Monday morning I was fortunate to be with Senator Alice-Mary Higgins in University College Cork where she made a fine speech on carers at the launch of a new study conducted by people at the university. It is important that we collaborate to ensure the national carers strategy is implemented. There are parts of it that can be put in place without cost. It is important that we, in this House, with Deputies, set up a cross-party group, as we did to deal with the issue of mental health. We should not just pay lip service to the national carers strategy; we must ensure it is put on a footing, with implementable action plans. I look forward to working with Members on the issue. I am happy on behalf of the Government to accept Senator Michael McDowell's proposal on Seanad reform. To the eight Members who spoke about the issue, we on this side of the House will not stand in the way of reform. It is important, if we are serious about the issue, that the legacy of the Twenty-fifth Seanad be bringing about change. We may have different views on how to achieve the end result, but as part of the process, it is important that we begin a discussion on how we can implement the Manning report which is central to the programme for Government. I have already spoken to the Taoiseach about this and he will make his views known in a couple of weeks. It is incumbent on us, in a cross-party manner, to bring about reform of the Seanad which encompasses all views. Senator Catherine Ardagh raised a number of questions. It is important for us to consider the issue of waiting times. The Minister for Health will be in the House next week to discuss health issues.  Senator David Norris, in a very fine address, and Senator Ivana Bacik referred to the eighth amendment of the Constitution. The Taoiseach has proposed the establishment of a citizens' assembly. I share Senator Ivana Bacik's view that it is important we have Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas as part of that assembly. I say this as someone who served on the Constitutional Convention which brought about profound change in the country. Those who decried the convention should read some of the scholarly articles written by Professor David Farrell and others in which it was described as mould-breaking. It allowed citizens and elected public representatives to come together to discuss matters of sensitivity and political policy and reform. A citizens' assembly is the way to go in dealing with the eighth amendment. For those who propose abolition, there is a hiatus and, for those who seek retention, the answer is not kept for those who want to get rid of the eighth amendment. It is important that we take the issue away from the body politic and the heat of the political process. As a former Chairman of the health committee that dealt with the protection of health during pregnancy legislation, I see it as important that we handle this issue in a sensitive and careful manner. It is about the lives of people and there are different views. It is important, therefore, that we hear from all sides, not just the extremes, whatever our own views or ideology may be. Senators David Norris and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, a former Minister of State, raised the issue of direct provision. I commend the former Minister of State for the work he did on it. I have already spoken to the relevant Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, about it, as, despite Senator Gerard P. Craughwell's view of politics and constituencies, it transcends such constituencies. In my city of Cork there are a number of centres-----

The Minister of State is visiting direct provision centres and I hope he will, in time, come to the House to discuss the issue. I agree fully with Senator David Norris on the Living City initiative. In a number of budgets the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, referred to the scheme for those living over shops, if one likes to use such a term. It is an issue that should be considered by the Government in order that we can not only preserve the buildings mentioned but also attract people to inner city areas in cities such as Cork and Waterford. When Senator Paudie Coffey was a Minister of State, he worked very closely with the Department, councils and the construction sector to ensure we had people moving to cities. In my city of Cork there is a lot of space over shops and businesses where there could be apartment dwellings, as there are elsewhere in Europe. I hope we can also have a debate on that issue. Senator Rose Conway-Walsh spoke about waiting times in the health service. I am pleased to point out that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive are working on a dedicated waiting time initiative. The Minister for Health will be in the House next week when we can discuss the issue further.  With respect to the Moore Street monuments, I will ask the Minister responsible, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to come to the House for a debate on the issue. I do not have the exact answer right now, but I will revert to the Senator with it. Senator Alice-Mary Higgins referred to the need for us to get ready for full employment. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will be in the House tomorrow when we can debate the issue further. I hope we will be able to have a series of discussions about employment. If Members are on the list to speak when we reach the end of the time allocated, as Leader, I will be happy to ensure the debate will roll over as it is a very important issue. In the course of the last Dáil we saw the unemployment rate fall from 15.9% to 8%, which was a tremendous record, given the economic decline we had experienced. It is an issue we need to address and, as Senators, we have a role to play.  The report on domestic violence is shocking and significant action must be taken to deal with the issue. The Istanbul Convention should be examined. I will certainly take up the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality on behalf of Members. The report presented this morning was very upsetting. Senator Ivana Bacik raised the issues of gun control, a matter I have already addressed, domestic violence and the eighth amendment, on which I hope we will see movement with the establishment of the citizens' assembly.  Senator Michelle Mulherin raised the very important issue of flood defences, with particular reference to the minor works schemes. I agree that the Office of Public Works and local councils should prioritise the provision of flood defence mechanisms. To be fair to the previous Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, there has been work done. He worked with councils in many parts of the country in developing policy and the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme.  Senator Billy Lawless spoke convincingly about the issue of gun control and the events in Orlando. I welcome him to the House. His is an important voice, not only for the diaspora but also for Irish-Americans in general, as he will play a key role in articulating our views. I agree with Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh as we have all benefited from friends in America giving us jobs. I spent a summer there on a J1 visa when my cousin found me a job; I would not have found it without him. Every summer we receive requests from many people looking for jobs in America. In that regard, some of the commentary is unfair to Senator Billy Lawless. He will bring an important dimension to the House and I look forward to working with him in building a cross-party approach to illegal immigrants and Irish America. It is important that we continue the link with America where many of us have family members and friends. Although there has been a change, I know of people who left Ireland because they were gay. They are living open and happy lives in America.  Senator Ned O'Sullivan referred to the marketing of life insurance policies. I will be happy to have the Minister responsible come to the House to discuss this important issue. The Senator has indicated that the companies involved have a duty of care to those who buy their products. Sometimes the small print is not read or pointed to.  I agree with Senator Michael McDowell's comments on the issue of Seanad reform. The Government will not challenge the amendment proposed to the Order of Business.It is important, however, that we take our time and get it right rather than rushing to be the first to provide for Seanad reform. It is important, as Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell said, that we speak with one voice and work together. It is also important that we cast aside our political differences on various issues because new politics is not about opposition the whole time but working together. As Leader of the Seanad, I hope we will have a business committee to run the business of the House. I met some of the leaders yesterday and will be meeting the leaders and the Whips together again in order that we can order the business of the House in a collaborative way. On a personal level, it does not serve us well in the House when we have divisions every day on the Order of Business to bring a Minister here to discuss A, B or C. If we can operate in a mature manner, work together to ensure we run the business of the House properly and in a manner that will ensure Members will have a fair say and their voices heard, that will serve us better not just in the Chamber but also in the eyes of the public. Bhí an Seanadóir Trevor Ó Clochartaigh ag caint mar gheall ar úsáid na Gaeilge. Níl an Ghaeilge go líofa agam ach tá mé ag foghlaim. Chleacht mé í uaireanta sa Dáil. I hope we can have debates in Irish and that we will be able to speak as Gaeilge, no matter how good or bad we are in our native tongue. The Senator also spoke about waste, but he knows that the polluter pays principle applies: the more one uses, the more one pays. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, to come before the House to speak about the matter.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan referred to carers. I agree with her on the need to have an all-party committee and have said we should work together on the matter, as there is a consensus within the House. As we saw in the previous Dáil and Seanad, where there were cross-party working groups on many issues, from symphysiotomy to mental health, we can bring about change and affect how the Government and the world sees us. The former Minister of State, Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, spoke about health and criminal justice matters. I agree with him. We need to take a twin approach to the problem of drugs. It is about justice, health, education and employment and it is important that we speak with one voice. I agree with the Senator that the McMahon report marks the beginning and that it is important that we bring about reform because, as I said, there are young children, in particular, who are very badly affected. We meet them every day in our constituency offices and constituencies as we walk about. Their parents cannot work and they are being treated like second-class citizens in terms of their ability to live their lives. It is important that we see reform. My colleague, friend and former Minister of State, Senator Paudie Coffey, spoke about the skills deficit. He is right; there is a deficit in many areas. When we see the tourism figures increasing and advertisements for chefs abroad, it poses the question as to why the training of chefs was stopped in the country. I agree that we need to discuss the skills shortage, not just in the construction sector but also across the entire economy. The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, in his previous life, launched a national skills strategy. It was an important beginning, but the strategy cannot be left to gather dust on a shelf. We must see its active implementation. I agree with Senator Paudie Coffey. I remember that he raised the issue in a previous Seanad and it is one to which we need to return. Senator Terry Leyden, with Senators Neale Richmond and Niall Ó Donnghaile, raised the issue of Brexit. It was my hope to have a debate on it this week, but both the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, and the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, are away. I hope we will have it next week because it is a very important discussion that we need to have. We need to urge Irish voters in the United Kingdom, including the North, to vote to remain. From an economic point of view, the United Kingdom is of critical importance to us. I urge all Members, if they will have an opportunity to do so, to travel in person to the North to canvass at the weekend or use social media to advocate a vote to remain. It is not about us interfering, rather it is about us, as Irish citizens and citizens of Europe, asking our fellow countrymen and women to vote to remain. Senator Gerard P. Craughwell spoke about getting off on a bad foot. I look forward to working with every Member to ensure this will be a productive, meaningful Seanad. We cannot produce legislation just like that; there was a hiatus in the other House. I have, therefore, asked that some legislation be initiated in this House. It is important that we try to achieve some measure of balance in this regard. I do not agree with the Senator regarding constituencies. We all represent the people and it is our duty to advocate on their behalf. The issue he raised about medals for the men and women who served the country should be looked at and I will take it up with the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe. Senator Máire Devine referred to Cloverhill Remand Prison. I do not have the answer to her question, but I will take up the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality. She might also want to raise it in the Commencement debate to give her an opportunity to articulate her viewpoint. I agree with her about the men and women who are midwives and nurses. They do great work every day in hospitals. When I was in college, I had the pleasure to work as a porter in Cork University Hospital when I saw at first hand the work they did every day. The Senator might write to the health committee to ask it to take up what is an important issue. I do not have the answer to her question, but I will take up the matter on her behalf with the Minister. Senator Frank Feighan raised the issue of hotel rooms and prices. He is right. As one of its first acts, the last Government cut the VAT rate on the basis that we would see an increase in tourist figures and that is what happened, but now we are seeing greed or profiteering in hotels starting to raise their prices. The Senators who stay in hotels in Dublin will have seen the increase in prices over a five-year period. It is not just about that however; it is also about the tourism product we are selling and ensuring the country remains viable and attractive from a tourist perspective to encourage people to come here. If they see escalating costs, I am afraid of what will happen. We will take up the matter with the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, who has strong views about bedroom prices in Dublin and across the country. I thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for her kind remarks and compliment her on pursuing the issue of end-of-life care. It is an important topic, to which I hope we will again see a cross-party approach which she has been spearheading and which we, as a society, have not addressed. It is one on which we need to continue to work. In the last Dáil I was Chairman of the health committee and the pleasure of being involved in the work we undertook on the issue. I am glad that the Senator has taken it up. It is important that, as a collective, in both Houses, we work to ensure we devise a strategy to deal with it. Senator Colette Kelleher also referred to carers, with particular reference to the fair deal scheme. I fully agree with her. It is important that we see a change. The Senator brings to the House the benefit not just of her work with The Alzheimer Society of Ireland but also of her work with the Cork Simon Community and the Cope Foundation in Cork and in the disability sector. Senator Martin Conway spoke eloquently about how we could eliminate bullying or peer pressure. Thankfully, in the previous Dáil two former Ministers, Ruairí Quinn and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, introduced major changes to the curriculum to tackle homophobic bullying and bullying in general, from which I hope we will see much better results. It is important that we continue to see the education system and the curriculum reflecting a more modern society. Senator Keith Swanick referred to the old district hospitals. I remind him that the last Government had a capital investment programme for district hospitals which I hope we will see continue. He is right that they are a resource we can use to provide step-down facilities before allowing people back to their homes. I pay tribute to the former Minister, now Senator James Reilly, who was instrumental in bringing about change. The Minister for Health will be in the House next week. I hope to arrange debates on health issues, including mental health services. Senator Victor Boyhan referred to the infrastructure fund. I hope the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, will come before us. The Government has prioritised housing provision, in which a significant investment has been signalled. A stand-alone Department for housing has been created and it is a crisis we need to see resolved. My colleague, Senator Paudie Coffey, when Minister of State, was very strong and pivotal in relaunching the housing policy.It is important that this work continue. I will certainly ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter. Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile raised the issue of Brexit. He also referred to the European Championships and sport in general. We can work together on the proposal made and I would happy to be meet the Senator to discuss it. Sport unites people. I am very happy that Lee McLaughlin has been found and join the Senator in sympathising with the family of Darren Rodgers. I thank and compliment the Irish supporters who paid tribute to him during the championships.

I think we all saw them play on Monday night - I know that I am digressing a little, but Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin raised the point - and there was a great uplift among people, perhaps not at the end of the game which ended in a draw, but the team certainly got off to a reasonably good start. There is now confidence that we can feel and it is important that we support each other. I would be happy to talk to Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile about the matter in question. Senator John Dolan's remarks were clear and strong about people with a disability and carers. The Senator has huge background experience. I worked with him in the past and look forward to working with him again in the future. It is good that we have individuals such as Senators John Freeman, Collette Kelleher and John Dolan in the House in the interests of people - I will not say sectoral interests - because they come with first-hand knowledge. I know that Senator John Dolan is very persistent and I look forward to working with him. Senator Catherine Noone raised the very important issue of obesity and stated that unless we, as a nation, tackled this problem, particularly as it related to juveniles, we would be in serious trouble. I commend the Senator for her tremendous work in the previous Seanad, for I which pay tribute to her. I also acknowledge former Senator Eamonn Coghlan whose Steps for Life programme is one I hope will come to fruition. We have the Healthy Ireland umbrella and I hope that, as part of Seanad's programme of work, the Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, will come before the House to discuss this very important issue. Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor referred to carers. She also referred to the Tír na nÓg respite care services in Carlow. I do not have an answer to her question, but I will certainly be happy to speak to the Minister responsible on her behalf about the matter. As I know the town of Carlow quite well, I will be very happy to ensure whatever the Senator requires is pursued. Deputy Pat Deering has also raised the issue with me. It is one that requires work and if the Senator gives me the details, I will be happy to take them to the Minister. Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh raised an issue similar to that raised by Senator Paudie Coffey about the importance of education. There is a concern about third level dropout rates, particularly in the first year of college, either as a result of lack of information or students choosing the wrong course. It is about providing proper information and guidance. It is important to look at how students can be kept in suitable courses. Equally, if a student drops out of a course, he or she and his or her family should not necessarily be penalised all of the time. The Senator is correct on the level of stress among students at second level. I look forward to bringing the new Minister for Education and Skills to the House to discuss the second level curriculum and the level of stress among students. Senator Neale Richmond raised the issue of Brexit. He also raised the issue of European funding for the Erasmus+ programme. I will be happy to take up the matter with the Minister for Education and Skills. I compliment the Senator on the role he plays in the pro-European movement. It is important - I repeat what I said earlier - that all Members become active in promoting a vote to remain in the Brexit referendum. Senator Diarmuid Wilson's suggestion in respect of the Passport Office is a good one. If he was to go by what happens in my office, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade would be aware that there was an issue with people submitting their applications late or forgetting about the expiration date on their passports. The Senator is right that people receive reminders about the late payment of different bills. This is a matter in which they might benefit from receiving reminders. What the Senator said made common sense. Sometimes the common-sense approach is the best one to take because it means that people can avoid a great deal of hassle, fear and panic. All of us in the House have received requests for assistance in having passports issued. Senator Paul Gavan raised the issue of child care and funding. It is fair to request the establishment of a committee on children, but it is important to recognise that the previous Government established Tusla, provided child care services for an extra year and changed the child care landscape. However, it is also important that we work with the child care sector to ensure remuneration levels and conditions of service are improved. The zero-to-three or even the zero-to-five year age group is important. It is vital, therefore, that we invest adequately in child care services because if we do not, the cost will be paid later in life. We look forward to receiving any proposal the Senator wishes to make. It is important to prioritise the early years sector. The Senator will find no issue with me in that regard. I compliment Senator Frances Black on her very personal and important contribution. She is correct to highlight the issues of alcohol abuse and gambling. Concerns about online gambling need to be addressed. I had the pleasure of working on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill which is on the Government list for publication. It is an important Bill because, as a nation, we have an issue with alcohol consumption, not just in terms of the volume consumed but also in terms of binge drinking. In recent weeks we have heard many sports people speak about their gambling addiction. It is easy for someone to pick up his or her mobile phone and use a gambling app. With the press of a button, he or she can spend X amount of money, perhaps without even realising it. That might be a simplistic view, but it is an issue on which we need to be very vigilant. I look forward to working with the Senator on it. The issue of health care was raised by Senator Colm Burke. He is right that the talks between the Department, the HSE and the two doctors' groups - the IMO and the NAGP - need to come to fruition because the primary care system is dependent on doctors playing a pivotal role. I hope to see that change happen. On hospital attendances, I hope the hospital groups will see a change such that there will be a better and improved system by which the issue of waiting times can be tackled. Senator Paul Daly referred to national guidelines for wind energy projects. I will be happy to invite the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, who is responsible for the planning element for the energy sector and the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources, Deputy Denis Naughten, who is involved in the other element to come to the House to discuss this important matter.  Senator Paul Daly also raised the issue of thoroughbreds, a topic on which I have also received representations and to which consideration should be given. Senator Denis Landy spoke about councillors who are not just responsible for electing many of us to this House but who also play a very important role in local government. The Senator is correct that the role of councillors has changed considerably. We need to reflect on how training and resources can be provided to improve how they do their business. I was very pleased when Senator Paddy Burke tabled a Commencement matter on the topic earlier. I know that the Fine Gael group had a meeting yesterday on it to see how the cause of conscience could be advanced. It is important that all Members work collaboratively on the issue. I know that Senators Gerard P. Craughwell and Victor Boyhan have a motion on the Order Paper and that Senator Aidan Davitt has also raised the matter. If Members speak with one voice, rather than being half-cocked, a better return might be achieved for councillors who are, in many cases, working full-time in their positions, with little or no remuneration or few resources. It is important that this be acknowledged. Senator Joe O'Reilly referred to Bailieborough Garda station. From speaking to him, I am aware that this is a very important matter about which he is extremely concerned. I will ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW to communicate with him on it. If he requires a debate on it in the House, we will be happy to facilitate him. As I mentioned, Senator Aidan Davitt raised the matter of local government and councillors. I fully agree with what he said and hope we will work together on the issue. Senator Kieran O'Donnell spoke about public expenditure reform and procurement. This is a concern for many small and medium-sized enterprises that are locked out of the procurement process because of the tendering procedures that apply. It is important that we debate the matter with the Minister responsible. I will try to organise such a debate as early as possible.

Máire has been an elected councillor since 2011 and worked diligently for her constituents in the south Dublin area for many years. Before being elected as a public representative, as a psychiatric nurse she had years of sterling commitment in the area of psychiatric care and was a champion of people who were being abandoned by the system. Wherever institutions were being threatened with closure, she worked with communities to ensure patients received the care and support they needed. She was very passionate about that issue, in particular. On the broader issue of workers' rights, she has been a trade union official and a leader and spokesperson for many years. We want to see strong women coming to the forefront of Irish politics and being elected to senior positions. Máire is a strong woman. She is a spokesperson, a campaigner and a fighter for disadvantaged people and for those who do not otherwise have a voice. I am delighted to nominate Máire to be Leas-Chathaoirleach of the House.

Sinn Féin will keep putting forward strong, capable women for positions of leadership in this House until we either have a woman elected or force other parties to put forward women in the House. There are many strong, capable women in this House who deserve to be elected.

I speak as a former Deputy Leader of this House. Quite a number of women have held the positions of Leader and Deputy Leader in recent years. In fact, the Seanad has a much better record than the Dáil - it just needs to be stated - in terms of women's representation. That is an important point. We have hit the figure of 30%. The Dáil still has not got to that point. It gives me great pleasure to nominate Senator Denis Landy for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach. As leader of the Labour Party group, I am delighted to do so. I have worked with Denis for the past five years. Many of those who were Senators during the previous session will know him as an active and highly engaged Senator. For those who do not know him and are new to the House, he is from Carrick-on-Suir. He was a councillor for many years before his election to the Seanad in 2011 and has long experience of chairing meetings at local level as a councillor, as well as at national and European level. Colleagues may be unaware that he previously chaired a committee within the Committee of the Regions at EU level. I think all will acknowledge that he is regarded as fair, trustworthy and honourable in his dealings with his colleagues and in the work he has done and will continue to do in this term as a Senator. I ask colleagues of all parties and none to consider supporting, in the spirit of the new politics, Senator Denis Landy as Leas-Chathaoirleach. We have already paid tribute to the Cathaoirleach who is not from the largest party in the House but who is from one of the two largest parties in it. I suggest, in the spirit of new politics, that the Leas-Chathaoirleach not be drawn from one of the two largest politics in the House and that instead we look to someone from a different grouping. In particular, I ask colleagues to support Senator Denis Landy for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach. Senator Kevin Humphreys will second the nomination.

I have known him for the past 20 years. He would bring great experience and fairness to the post. There is one thing that everyone who deals with him knows, which is how fair and honourable he is. His word is his bond. When he gives a commitment that he will chair meetings in this House fairly, he will do so and will deliver. I ask all Members of the House, including non-party Members, in the spirit of new politics, to vote for him today.

Molaim an Seanadóir Paul Coghlan mar Leas-Chathaoirleach ar an Seanad. Is mó bliain atá tugtha don pholaitíocht ag an Seanadóir, ní hamháin ag leibhéal an rialtais náisiúnta ach ag leibhéal an rialtais áitiúil leis. Leas-Chathaoirleach cumasach neamh-chlaonta a bheidh ann. It is my privilege, on behalf of the Fine Gael group, to propose Senator Paul Coghlan for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach. He comes to this position with huge experience in local and national government, with his tremendous business acumen from his role as a business person. He is also a husband and a father and will bring to the role of Leas-Chathaoirleach an experienced voice and a fair perspective that will embrace all sides of the House. In all his time in this House, I am sure, he has never had a cross word with anyone. He was elected to Killarney Town Council in 1985, Kerry County Council in 1991 and Seanad Éireann in 1997. As we all will remember from the Seanad election just gone, his Lazarus-like resurrection, thanks to a huge outpouring of transfers, will testify to his warmth and the goodwill towards him across the political divide. He will bring to the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach a wide network of friends and contacts with which he can work. It is also as a Member of this House that Senator Paul Coghlan has demonstrated his ability to work on many issues. They include banking and industry and commerce issues, as well as issues regarding, in particular, the British-Irish Parliamentary Association where he was the chairperson of Committee A. The committee produced an important report on illicit trade and police co-operation and the Government accepted the recommendation made in it that a task force be established. Equally, Senator Paul Coghlan's efforts in regard to cultural life in County Kerry, in particular Muckross House, have shown his ability to work on many facets. Those of us who know him will know and understand his love and passion for Muckross. He was a trustee and is a former chairman of Muckross House which he revolutionised and transformed into a very important visitor centre for the people of Killarney. He played a pivotal role in that regard.Those of us who used to work in local radio will know that he was one of the pioneers of the local radio movement when it began and is to this day involved with Radio Kerry. Those of us who live on the Cork-Kerry border regularly hear him on a Saturday morning speak about anything from the price of milk to the price of whatever you want across Europe or the world. He appears regularly on Radio Kerry. It is important in this era of new politics that we have a person of experience. I commend the other Senators for their nominations and contesting this election. They are two very fine candidates. I know Senator Denis Landy better. He is a very fine person and I wish him well, as I do Senator Máire Devine. I hope she understands there is nothing personal in our putting forward Senator Paul Coghlan. It is important that we have a person of his calibre to deputise for the Cathaoirleach and be an impartial Chair of the House in his absence. He is a man of the people, this House and the Oireachtas. He is extremely able, conscientious and firm and gives wise counsel. Those who have met and known him during the years will recognise this. I have had the pleasure of having him as my beau on several occasions and he has been a very able date. On a serious note, it is my pleasure as Leader of the House to propose him.

He has been a county councillor, a Senator and, for the past few years, a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly. He is also a former banker and a member of the Institute of Banking. He was a member of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers. He was also involved in establishing links with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry. As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, he co-authored a report on illicit trade and police co-operation North and South which highlighted all criminal trading along the Border and recommended the establishment of a task force to tackle such issues. He brings with him a wealth of experience from inside and outside the House. I have no doubt that he would be an excellent Leas-Chathaoirleach. He has been an Acting Chairman in this House for the past ten years and has gained valuable experience. He is also an undertaker and was the last man to put a smile on a lot of faces. I have no doubt that he is an ideal candidate for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.

Craughwell be elected as Leas-Chathaoirleach."This House, unlike the other one, has never addressed seriously the manner in which its Chairman and Vice Chairman are elected. It is not a position that should be in the gift of any other House or any person who is not a Member of this House. It is not a position that should be bartered in a process of exchange for support in the other House for people who want to be elected to positions in that House. The time has come for this House to seriously consider how it elects its own officers and to accept for itself the autonomy of deciding who should and should not be its Chairman and Vice Chairman in the future. We are blessed on this occasion that all the candidates proposed and the candidate I am proposing are suitable to be appointed Vice Chairman of this House as the Cathaoirleach was to be appointed Chairman. All, I have no doubt, are worthy of the position. The only way to ensure that in the future this House will take its autonomy seriously and elect the person it really wants to have in a position, rather than engaging in horse-trading among various outside interests or the interests of the Government or the Opposition because the new politics may not always prevail, is to make the changes to the Standing Orders of this House that were made to the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to provide for a system of election by secret ballot on a proportional representation basis. That was done in Dáil Éireann as a result of a campaign. I played a minor part in that campaign, speaking in Glenties in County Donegal about the necessity for it to happen. A campaign was carried out to ensure the last Dáil was not dissolved without making the position of Ceann Comhairle autonomous, with the person to be elected by the Members without reference to party Whips, diktats from the Government or deals between parties but on the basis that each individual Member, voting with his or her conscience, experience and judgment, would vote for the candidate he or she thought best. This House should follow the precedent the other House has set and give itself the scope of private judgment to decide these matters rather than reading about them in the newspapers. I read a fortnight ago about what was likely to happen today and that people were putting together deals on positions in the other House. This does not apply to Senator Paul Coghlan, but I read in one newspaper article that a particular outcome had been bartered between two groups, depending on support in one House for one outcome and for another in this House. That is not right.  Turning to the merits of my candidate, Senator Gerard P. Craughwell is a former president of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI. He has immense experience in chairing individual institutions. He has chaired conferences. He has chaired the national executive committee of the TUI and joint meetings between the TUI, the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Irish Federation of University Teachers. He has chaired further education and training committees and the organisation and training committee of the TUI. Senator Gerard P. Craughwell came into this House by the Independent route. He has no party political baggage behind him. He would discharge his functions in a totally independent and non-partisan way. Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to nominate him. In nominating him, Senator Victor Boyhan and I want to make it clear that the group to which we belong, the Seanad Independent group, is not allied to any other political party and not part of some informal coalition. We will exercise our independent judgment on all issues. In that spirit and for that reason, I commend Senator Gerard P. Craughwell for election as Leas-Chathaoirleach of the House.

That is very important and valid. It has happened in Dáil Éireann; why should it not happen in Seanad Éireann? That is a challenge to all of us as Senators with our respective contacts and parties. Senator Gerard P. Craughwell is neither an undertaker nor a caretaker but has proved himself very hardworking. I spoke to several independent councillors yesterday about local government reform and local councils and they asked me if it ever would be possible for an Independent to be elected to either of these prestigious positions. We have heard a lot in the past few days about new politics. Let us not cod ourselves: it is about the reality of a new political issue. We have been dealt figures and numbers on the returns in the last general election and the last Seanad election. We have to face up to a new political reality, but to gloss it as something else is a little misleading. I endorse the nomination of Senator Gerard P. Craughwell and I am happy to second Senator Michael McDowell's proposal.

He picked me up at home to take me to that lovely place in Killarney where he was guest of honour at an Irish Medical Organisation do. Then I had Senator Paddy Burke talking about my days as an undertaker. The only undertaking I do now is undertaking to be scrupulously fair and impartial any time I occupy the Chair. I commend everything that has been said and sincerely commend the other candidates.As Senator Michael McDowell said, any one of the them would have been fit to occupy the Chair.

The voice of the Kingdom is not just Sentor Paul Coghlan, it is also Radio Kerry, of which he was one of the founding members. He has also protected Killarney House and seen the project to fruition. He has done tireless and quiet work. He has also been a member of the trustees' board for Muckross House. He is very proud of Killarney, but he is also very proud of County Kerry and the people of County Kerry are very proud of him. He has also worked on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and British-Irish relations. Again, he has been a quiet advocate in that regard.

First, I sincerely thank all of the Members who have showered bouquets on me. A little like the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I am not sure if I have yet earned such accolades, but time will tell. I sincerely thank everyone for his or her kind remarks.  I wish Senator Paul Coghlan every success as Leas-Chathaoirleach. As someone said, he has been an Acting Chairman for the past ten years; therefore, he is quite experienced. I have no doubt that he will do a fantastic job and that he will let me away every second day.

I congratulate him and pay tribute to his wife, Peggy; his sons and daughters and his brother, Michael, who are seated in the Visitors Gallery. I welcome all of them and congratulate him. He will bring his keen sense of fairness and equity to his new role. We all look forward to working with him and wish him every success.

I congratulate you and wish you well in your role. I also congratulate the new Leas-Chathaoirleach. I also wish the new Leader of the House and the other Members of the Seanad well in their deliberations. I am in the House on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to discuss the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. The House will recall that the Act was passed following the callous Omagh bombing, a terrorist atrocity in which 29 innocent people lost their lives. That appalling act lives in all our memories and our sympathy remains with the families of the victims. The 1998 Act made a series of amendments to the Offences Against the State Acts. It principally provides for changes in the rules of evidence for certain offences under the Acts, including the drawing of inferences in certain circumstances; the creation of new offences such as directing an unlawful organisation, the possession of certain articles and collecting information; and extending to 72 hours the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939. The Omagh atrocity demanded a clear and resolute response from the State in defence of the desire of the vast majority of law abiding people on the island to live their lives in peace. Section 18 of the Act, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, provides that sections 2 to 4, inclusive, 6 to 12, inclusive, 14 and 17 must be renewed by the Oireachtas at specified intervals if they are to remain in force. By virtue of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2015, these sections were continued in force for a period of 12 months. Prior to moving a motion for renewal, the Act requires that the Minister lays before the Oireachtas a report on the operation of the relevant provisions. The current report covers the period from 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2016 and was laid before the House on 10 June. Given the time available, I will not go through all of the relevant sections in detail. The report, based on information provided by the Garda authorities, sets out the detail of usage of the various sections in the period. It also includes a table of comparative usage for each of the years since the Act came into operation. It indicates that two sections, sections 6 and 12, were not used during the reporting period in question. However, it should not be inferred that these provisions are in some way redundant as the usage of the different sections can vary from year to year. It is the clear view of the Garda Commissioner that the Act continues to be a most important tool in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism. The Garda authorities have stated the provisions of the Act are used regularly, which is evident from the report. They are, in short, a necessary legislative support in the fight against terrorism. There remains on the island a persistent threat from republican paramilitary groups that are, simply, opposed to peace. They have no support; they have no reason to remain in being and should go away for good. The Tánaiste's decision to bring the second Special Criminal Court into operation is in response to this threat. It is now up and running and underlines the Government's determination to deal with serious crime affecting the security of the State. The threat level in Northern Ireland is severe. The appalling murder of the Northern Ireland prison officer, Adrian Ismay, earlier this year highlighted the lethal nihilism of these groups that act in direct opposition to the democratic wishes of the majority on the island. The Garda authorities work tirelessly and in co-operation with their counterparts in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, in countering the activities of these paramilitary organisations and deserve credit for their ongoing work. Combating the security threat is a key priority for the Government and the additional funding the Tánaiste has secured for the Garda Vote this year will go in part towards support for measures against terrorism. The Government is determined that these groups will never prevail and that there will be no let-up in actions to tackle them. It would be a happy day if provisions in the law such as those we are discussing were no longer needed because the threat they target was no longer in place. The sad truth, however, is that they are still needed because that threat persists. I will now refer to the second motion to be discussed on section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009. It proposes the continuation in force for another year of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which section provides for a limited number of serious, organised crime offences to be tried in the Special Criminal Court, thus removing the possibility of jury tampering or the intimidation of jurors or potential jurors. The offences in question are set out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006. They are, in section 71A, directing the activities of a criminal organisation; in section 72, participating in or contributing to certain activities of a criminal organisation; in section 73, committing a serious offence for a criminal organisation; and in section 76, liability for these offences committed by a body corporate.The 2009 Act makes these scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences Against the State Act 1939. While this means that the Special Criminal Court will hear trials for these offences, the Director of Public Prosecutions retains the power to direct that the offences be tried in the ordinary courts. In order to assist Senators in their consideration, section 8(6) provides that the Minister must prepare a report which shall be laid before both Houses on the operation of the section. That report, covering the period from 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2016, was laid before the House on 10 June. Section 8 was not used during the period in question. It has not been used since 2009. This does not invalidate the reasoning for having such a provision available for use if it is needed, nor does it diminish its potential value in bringing organised criminals to justice. The operation of the provision to date highlights the considered approach of the Director of Public Prosecutions in using her discretion to direct that cases be tried in the ordinary courts where it is possible to do so. This is proof positive of the balance that has been struck with this provision. It is a robust but nonetheless proportionate power.  In the period under report there were a total of 17 arrests under two of the four offences covered by section 8 - seven arrests under section 72 and a further ten under section 73. Sections 71A and 76 were not used in the reporting period in question. Of course, there is a variety of other provisions of the criminal law that have been and are being used against organised criminals. My Department is examining whether there are other changes to the law that might be made to tackle these gangs. The Minister will shortly be bringing forward changes to the law to strengthen the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in seizing the proceeds of crime. None of us can be under any illusion about the danger to society from organised crime. Recent gang related murders in the Dublin region put into stark relief the utter disregard of these criminals for human life and the rule of law. Counteracting this danger presents very real challenges for the State. However, the State has faced down such gangs in the past and will do so again. The Government is fully committed to providing An Garda Síochána with the necessary resources to confront these criminal thugs and bring them to justice. To this end, as I have said, the Minister secured substantial additional funding of €55 million for An Garda Síochána for the remainder of 2016 that will, among other things, support the necessary activities to target gang-related crime. The Garda Commissioner has made clear her view that this provision will be required for some time to come and we must have the utmost regard for her analysis. Trial by jury is the standard for our system and should be preserved to the greatest extent possible. However, none of us can afford to ignore the threat to the rule of law from violent, organised criminals who will stop at literally nothing to protect themselves and their profits. We have a duty as legislators to ensure we respond robustly but proportionately to that threat. I commend the motions to the House.

On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group, I voice our support for the two motions before the Seanad. Both the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 and the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 require that certain sections of the Acts be renewed by the Oireachtas on an annual basis. Fianna Fáil has consistently supported the renewal of these sections and does so today as it believes both statutory provisions are necessary. We hope that in the future the threat of dissident republican activity on the island will no longer be a reality but until then, we must have effective mechanisms to deal with it. In the aftermath of the shocking act of terror in Orlando, we are reminded of the ever-present threat of international terrorism. Unfortunately, Ireland is not immune to this threat. It is, therefore, not appropriate to remove the powers from An Garda Síochána at this time when there is no evidence that these powers have been abused. The police force needs to have the ability to act immediately in the face of terrorism.  Section 8 of the 2009 Act allows serious organised gangland crime offences to be tried by the Special Criminal Court similar to some of the proposals contained in the Offences against the State Act. The operation of drug gangs in Ireland is to the forefront of our minds due to the horrific murder in the Regency Hotel in February 2016 and subsequent murders. Communities are being terrorised and calling for a tough response from An Garda Síochána.  Opposition to these provisions is mainly based on the fact that these crimes are tried in Special Criminal Court settings without a jury. Unfortunately, some offences cannot be tried by jury as it would jeopardise the safety of jury members. We have a duty to ensure the criminal justice system operates fairly. The system cannot operate if jury members can be intimidated or harmed in any way. Gangland criminals have murdered journalists and innocent members of the public in broad daylight. Intimidating jury members would not be beyond the pale. Witnesses were intimidated during the trial of four members of the Provisional IRA for the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. This intimidation resulted in the lesser charge of manslaughter being laid against the four accused. If witnesses have been intimidated in the past by dissident republicans, there is a real possibility that jury members will also face intimidation in the future should these provisions not be renewed.  Putting in place the witness protection programme for jury members, as has been suggested in the past, would be completely unworkable. Trial by jury was provided for in Bunreacht na hÉireann to ensure a fair criminal justice system. Owing to the nature of the crimes that are the subject of these provisions, trial without jury is required to achieve the same outcome - a fair criminal justice system. Therefore, I support the motions.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	153	I welcome the Minister of State and wish him every success in his new role in the Department of Justice and Equality. I think it is his first occasion in the House as Minister of State.  I welcome the motions which have my full support. It is important that we give the necessary support to gardaí who are working at the coal face. History has shown that if that support had not been given, it would not have been possible in years gone by to take criminal proceedings against certain people. The Special Criminal Court has at all times been very effective and very fair. The criminal justice system has always been very balanced. Where there is any threat to a fair trial taking place and a prosecution cannot proceed because jurors might be intimidated, it is important that the appropriate procedures be put in place. That is the reason two pieces of legislation were passed. It is also important that there be checks and balances and that they not be abused. That is the reason the provisions come back for review every 12 months. It is extremely important that they receive our full support. The Minister and the Minister of State do not take this decision lightly. They take it because they have received the advice that in respect of the criminal justice system operating properly, certain elements could not be prosecuted unless these procedures are in place. That is the reason they are bringing forward these motions and why they seek the continuance of section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 and the appropriate section in the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  It is also welcome that an extra €55 million has been allocated to the Garda to give it the necessary back-up support because it cannot operate unless it has sufficient support and expertise to deal with criminal elements. Crime is becoming more sophisticated and a way of sidestepping the Garda and the judicial process is available to the criminal community. It is important that we have the appropriate procedures for the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Therefore, I support the motions, as does Fine Gael.There are checks and balances. The sections will come back for review again in 12 months time.

Beidh mise leanúnach le seasamh Shinn Féin maidir leis an ábhar seo agus ar ndóigh beidh muid ag caitheamh vóta in éadan na moltaí atá os ár gcomhair inniu. As the Minister of State knows, criminality is a scourge for communities. All parties across the island must be both united and relentless in their pursuit of ending criminality. It must be made clear that those responsible for the recent killings and the ongoing feud in Dublin or anyone involved in organised crime must face the courts and be brought to justice. There can be no equivocation in that respect. If they are found guilty and prosecuted, they must face the sentences handed down to them. There is no equivocation in that regard. The Minister spoke yesterday evening in the Dáil about improved and increased resources to An Garda Síochána to help combat organised crime. It should be noted that in recent years it was the Fianna Fáil Party that closed the Garda College in Templemore and stopped recruitment of members to the force, a measure continued by the previous Fine Gael Government, but now both want a tough response to such matters. While I welcome the recent announcement of increased investment in tackling crime, it has to go beyond investment in armed response units. If we want long-term solutions to deal with organised crime, we need to prevent young people from going down that path in life. We need to invest in programmes with a proven track record of working such as the youth and juvenile diversion programmes. These are areas in which we need increased investment. The legislation we are being asked to extend for a further 12 months does not have the effect of ending criminality in communities. It clearly has not worked, although it has been in existence for the past 20 years. We also have to look at international best practice and what actually does work. What does is increased investment at community level in meaningful programmes that prevent young people from engaging in criminality. It is important to say it is not only young people who engage in criminality. Sinn Féin is opposed to criminality and we will support any measure we believe will work in ending it. The Fresh Start agreement negotiated in November last year by the Executive in the North deals with measures around stronger law enforcement and co-operation with the Government in this state aimed at tackling organised crime and criminality. A new joint agency task force has been established, led at senior management level by An Garda Síochána and the PSNI, the Revenue Commissioners, Revenue and the Customs service. This new inter-agency task force will bring together the expertise of a range of law enforcement agencies involved in tackling organised crime gangs that seek to exploit the Border between the two jurisdictions. The Good Friday Agreement which preceded it requires steps towards security normalisation, including the progressive elimination of the Act's provisions. It is not justifiable to continue with this legislation with the Good Friday Agreement now in place for a full 18 years. There is no emergency that could justify the continuation of the draconian measures contained in the sections that are up for renewal, or the rest of the Offences against the State Acts. This legislation has a highly corrosive effect on human rights, civil liberties and democratic life in the State. We in Sinn Féin are not alone in holding that opinion, given that the UN Human Rights Committee, Amnesty International and many other groups have stated this issue needs to be dealt with by the State as a matter of urgency. Certainly from a Northern perspective, I have worked with the PSNI and seen the change in policing, moving away from a very negative, draconian and oppressive culture. Although the change is still incomplete and imperfect, much has been achieved in terms of independent oversight and creating a force that is community oriented and compliant with human rights. There are lessons to be learned to set the highest possible standard for international best practice for both policing services across the island which puts the ending of criminality but also the rights of and protections for citizens at its heart.

It is my first opportunity to do so and think it is his first opportunity to be with us. I welcome him and congratulate him on his appointment, having working with him on the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which he so ably chaired for the past five years. I know that he will do a great job and I wish him the very best with his work. On the motions before us, I welcome the opportunity to be back debating them. Every 12 months these provisions have to be reviewed. It is important that the Oireachtas keep them under scrutiny, given that they interfere with due process rights of accused persons. It is in that context that we are back discussing them. Having said that, we all recognise the major threat posed, in particular, by organised crime. We would all be very conscious of events in Dublin's north inner city and the real fear that so many members of that community are living under. We all watched the Taoiseach and other Ministers meeting community leaders last night in the north inner city. Clearly, there is a significant threat from organised crime and from paramilitary crime. I should declare an interest as somebody who practised as a barrister in the Special Criminal Court in previous years. I have been here, speaking about the renewal of these provisions, for some years. We need to keep them under scrutiny. On a practical level, while a report has been laid before the Oireachtas, in previous years a table of usage has been appended to the Minister's speech which we have been provided with in advance of each of these debates. It is very useful to see for ourselves the pattern of application of the provision. That would be very helpful. I know that the Minister of State dealt with this a little, but it is also useful to have the overview provided for us. Looking first at the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 motion and its renewal, as has been said, these provisions do depart from normal principles of due process. Section 3 requires an accused to give notice of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his behalf when charged with membership of an unlawful organisation, and section 4 potentially gives rise to guilt by association, allowing inferences to be drawn from conduct such as associations on the part of the accused concerning evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation, an offence which, we will all be conscious, is a very serious one. I looked previously at a 15-year pattern of usage of these provisions and some of them were not used for many years. This requires that we look at the utility of continuing them in force. Section 4, in fact, had not been used for some years between 2008 and 2014 and was then used. Having said that, as the Minister of State said, the fact a provision is not used for some years does not mean that it will not be and that it will not be useful. We need to take a balanced approach to this. The Minister of State said two sections, sections 6 and 12, had not been used during the reporting period in question, that is, the past year. While he pointed out that it should not be inferred that these sections were redundant, as the usage varies from year to year, as we have seen in the past, it is still something that requires us to keep under review. I understand section 12 has not been used since 2002. That is 14 years in which section 12 has not been used. There is a strong question to be asked about keeping the utility of that provision under review.  I will deal briefly with the motion on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009. We are looking at another provision that interferes with due process rights. Section 8 provides for the right to a jury trial to be bypassed by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of certain offences. In the period under review no cases were, in fact, sent forward to the Special Criminal Court through the exercise of the Director of Public Prosecutions's discretion. Since 2009, no cases have been sent forward under that provision. Section 8 has not been used since 2009, as the Minister of State said. As I said last year, this indicates the considered approach being taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions who is not exercising her discretion in any liberal fashion. That is right and proper, given the encroachment section 8 represents. One also has to look behind section 8 and look at the provisions it refers to, which are laid out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006. Looking at these provisions, it is clear from the Minister of State's contribution and speeches made and data we were given in previous years that sections 72 and 73, the two offences of participating in or contributing to the activities of a criminal organisation and committing a serious offence, are well used. The Minister of State has pointed out there were seven arrests under section 72 and a further ten under section 73. However, he says, section 71A, directing the activities of a criminal organisation, and section 76, liability for these offences committed by a body corporate, have not been exercised. Looking back, as far as I know, they have not been exercised for the past three years. One should look at the merit of retaining them in their current form and whether there is something about them that makes them unworkable.Clearly, the directing of activities of a criminal organisation is an offence which one hopes should have a utility on the Statute Book, given the very serious offences that have been committed in the name of criminal organisations in recent months. There is a question to be asked about these offences being kept in their current form if they are not, in fact, being used. I simply raise these questions. I certainly do not oppose the motions, but we need to keep these sections under careful scrutiny and be critical, where necessary, of aspects of the motions without simply passing them every year in a knee-jerk or token way.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, and congratulate him on his appointment. As Senator Ivana Bacik said, the Minister of State brings with him years of dedicated service at the justice committee. I was pleased, when Chairman of the health committee, to work in a cross-departmental way with him on the issue of drugs. I wish him well. It is important that the Minister of State said the Act was an important tool in the ongoing fight against terrorism and that we must ensure An Garda Síochána and the Government had every tool available to them in the war and fight against organised crime. We must eradicate organised crime. I listened to Senator John Dolan's comments and agree with some of what he said about how we could tackle this issue through education, empowerment and rebuilding inner cities, in particular, through working in a cross-departmental and cross-sectoral way to make life better for people. That work could begin in a multiplicity of ways. However, if we do not allow for the State to be able to do its work and have resources and measures such as these, we are in big trouble. Equally, the issue of resourcing, the rostering of staff, community gardaí and education are very important. We saw the amount of money which had been invested through the RAPID programme in inner city areas. I worked with it while a member of Cork City Council where we enhanced the public realm and domain in streetscapes to improve people's quality of life. That means that we must look at the issue of child care and its affordability, housing, including affordable housing, in tandem with resourcing the Garda and ensuring community leaders and citizens, with An Garda Síochána and the courts, can tackle and eradicate gangland crime. It is important that this cycle be ended and, equally, that we work together to ensure a situation where we will not need this legislation because, as Senator Ivana Bacik rightly said, some of the sections has not been used at all. When we talk about new politics, it is important that we take it out of the Chamber and, following on from the visit by the Taoiseach yesterday evening to the inner city, ensure there will be a new way of doing business, a way where community leaders and those employed by the State, by city councils and NGOs, in tandem with active volunteers, can make life better and where the culture and attitude among people will change also. I say this as someone who has been in schools. As the Minister of State knows from his own background, education is critical. Empowering young people and giving them a dream of a better future and a vision of a better life would be a great step forward. I hope the visit of the Taoiseach last night will not just be seen as a photo opportunity, as it was reported in some of the newspapers today, but as the beginning of something different.

I hope it will last.  I am grateful to the Seanad for its consideration of these matters. I thank Senators on all sides for their contributions to the debate on both motions. Naturally, I welcome the support expressed by a number of speakers for continuing these provisions. I also appreciate the shared commitment in the House to maintaining in place a robust legal framework for the Garda and the courts when dealing with the most serious of offences that may threaten the State and the operation of the criminal justice system. I also recognise that there are genuinely expressed concerns about the robust nature of these provisions. However, we simply cannot ignore the activities of so-called dissident paramilitaries; neither can we ignore the grave threat posed by gang-related crime. The ongoing actions of the Garda in combating the paramilitary groups, including, fortunately, seizures of explosives and firearms, bear witness to the real and persistent threat presented by these groups to the people, both in this state and Northern Ireland. These terrorist groups have no support and no mandate. They cannot now and never will offer anything positive. We must do all we can within the law to stop them. By the same token, the Garda continues daily to take action against the criminal gangs, the activities of which seek to undermine society. The recent series of gang-related murders in the Dublin region bears witness to the ruthlessness and lawlessness of these criminals. As public representatives, we have all seen the profound damage drugs, in particular, have inflicted on communities across the State. We cannot be blind to the fact that there are serious criminals who are only too happy to feed on that misery and misfortune and will literally stop at nothing to protect their well funded lifestyles. I take on board the comments made by Senators John Dolan, Jerry Buttimer and others about the other side of the coin in boosting communities, education and youth services, youth centres and so on which are also vitally important. However, we cannot ignore the fact that we are dealing with ruthless people. In the face of these threats we must, as legislators, do our utmost to ensure the protection of the State and its institutions and to protect the lives of citizens. In doing so we must strike a balance between necessity and proportionality. This is not always an easy balance to strike, but I am of the clear view that it is achieved by these provisions. While they are outside the normal course of the criminal law, the measures are a response to extraordinary circumstances. I also emphasise that these provisions do not somehow operate in glorious isolation from the rest of the criminal law and the range of protections available in the criminal process and at trial for persons charged with serious offences. We are fortunate to have a robustly independent and impartial Judiciary which has time and again proved to be the bulwark in protecting the citizen's fundamental rights. I remind Senators also that provisions of the Offences against the State Acts and the Special Criminal Court have faced challenges to their operation and constitutionality on many occasions in the Supreme Court and at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and have largely withstood them. I remind the House of the key role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the process, a role carried out independently in accordance with the law.  Some concerns were expressed about the process for renewal of these provisions. It may be difficult to identify an ideal way to do this, but I emphasise that the current arrangements place the legislators in control. This House and the Dáil, together, have the final say. This is the democratic way which I believe has much to recommend it. The Garda deploys considerable operational resources to tackle terrorism and organised crime and we, as legislators, must provide it and the courts with the necessary means to bring terrorists and serious criminals to justice. I am sure we all wish circumstances were otherwise and that laws such as these were not needed. However, the stark reality is that until conditions allow, these provisions are a necessary addition to the general criminal law. I commend the motions to the House.

With my Kerry connections, I am delighted to a see a Kerryman in the position. I wish him the best of luck for the coming term. I propose the motion on behalf of my Fianna Fáil colleagues, as we believe the scandal of over 2,000 homeless children in the State needs to be addressed and resolved immediately. I thank the Minister of State for making himself available to listen to this debate.  At a pre-budget submission by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul yesterday, it was noted that it received, on average, 2,300 calls per week from families that requird its assistance to meet essential basic costs such as heating, food and clothing and that at a time of growth and recovery. One in nine children is living in consistent poverty, which means that these children live in households where the income is below 60% of the national median income. Children in lone-parent households are at particular risk of consistent poverty and deprivation and this deprivation can mean going 24 hours without a substantial meal, or being cold owing to the fact that the parent cannot afford to heat the home. Given these increases in poverty levels, homelessness among families has risen to what is now accepted to be a crisis level. As I mentioned, more than 2,000 children are without a home and in emergency accommodation. This figure does not include the many more thousands living in overcrowded homes and thousands more still are one small step away from losing their homes. Urgent action is needed to end the practice of housing homeless families in hotel rooms. In recent weeks Focus Ireland warned that the record number of homeless families, combined with the pressure on hotel rooms due to increased economic activity, meant that the risk of families sleeping rough had re-emerged. This is putting additional stress on parents and children in an already stressful position. Hotel accommodation is wholly unsuitable for families, as children do not have space to play, a table on which to eat a meal or complete homework, or the privacy to develop and grow as individuals. Educators and charities supporting children living in emergency hotel accommodation report that children are not able to get a proper night's sleep and are arriving at school sleep-deprived, which naturally has a knock-on effect on their ability to learn and thrive in school. Often, hotel accommodation is far from schools and this leads to days being missed more frequently. This disruption to education has a lasting and long-term effect. Children often report they feel the stigma of homelessness more acutely owing to the fact they live in a hotel, as others who see them in their school uniform in a hotel know instantly that they are homeless. We are all aware of the existence of empty local authority housing in our constituencies and priority must be given to refurbishing these housing units in order that families with children can be moved from hotel accommodation as quickly as possible, thereby giving these children the security of a permanent and high-quality roof over their heads. Only with this stability and security can they enjoy a happy childhood and thrive. I very much look forward to the publication of the report from the Committee on Housing and Homelessness this Friday and take the opportunity to thank the members of the committee for their diligence and commitment in the past few weeks. However, the recommendations of the committee regarding homeless families in emergency accommodation will only carry meaning and worth if the funding is provided to enable immediate and swift action; otherwise, they are moot. It is acknowledged the lack of available housing has caused this crisis and it will only be solved on a long-term basis by the construction of more social and affordable housing. We are calling for an emergency building programme to do this. My colleague, Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor, will speak further about this. Families experiencing poverty and deprivation but who are currently in private rented accommodation need to be given assistance to remain in their homes in a climate where rents are ever-increasing. It is much easier to keep a family in its home than to help a family that has lost its home. Childhood is short. The experiences we have as children shape the adults we become. Children living in poverty and children living without the security of a permanent home live life on the margins of society. They are unable to participate fully in the cultural activity of their community and struggle to reach their educational potential. This has an impact on their health and opportunities in life. Children who have experienced homelessness are far more likely to experience homelessness as adults and find it extremely difficult to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty. In the centenary year of the Easter Rising, in particular, we must ensure all children have a home to call their own. Therefore, I call on the House to support the motion.

The Minister of State is aware that there is a very urgent housing crisis. It is welcome that all local authorities recently received a new assessment of the social housing needs that will qualify people and let them know exactly what housing support is available. I want to know the figures for people in receipt of housing support and those who depend on rent supplement.Will the Minister provide those figures separately? Also, can we have separate figures for Dublin and rural counties? I would appreciate receiving figures for both. Second, the Minister will be aware that we have accommodation that is unfit, overcrowded, unsuitable or unsuitable owing to exceptional medical needs or on compassionate grounds. These are people in real need. Their low priority is an indication that the Department has never highlighted them as a particular group. When one goes to the local authority, one's name is put on a housing list. Regardless of whether it is unfit or unsuitable accommodation, one's name goes on the housing list, but one is not in a particular group. I ask the Minister to address this because it is an urgent issue. The people concerned in need must be made a priority. The Department has long been informed of several sources for capitalising house purchases, whereby the rental money could be used to purchase houses instead of renting. I have a major issue with this. I believe the current crisis is due to the fact that we are renting or leasing and it is costing the Government and the country a fortune. There are cases where the Department is promoting the leasing of units and has prohibited councils from purchasing priority housing for a small amount of money. Councils are seeking to buy houses, but the Minister is not providing the money. He is saying, in effect, that we will continue renting but will not buy houses. That is unfair. I have some statistics from last year. In 2015 some €67 million was spent on renting, leasing and hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation. We must look forward and progress. We must buy and, as my colleague said, build housing. I have a query for the Minister about capital construction. This is construction of local authority houses. There is a four stage plan for every local authority when it is building houses. I ask the Minister to reduce this four stage plan to a single stage plan. As he knows, when a local authority brings the first stage to the Department, it might not be returned for six months. After sending the second stage, it could be another six months to get it back. The timescale with this is not good enough. As there is a housing crisis, the Minister should change the four stage plan to a single stage plan. There has been a housing crisis for the past two years, but I do not understand why the Minister and the Department, through the national spatial strategy, have reduced the amount of land zoned for housing. Under the spatial strategy, local authorities have had to do what we could call de-zoning - we have de-zoned lands. However, there is a need to build houses. There is a report in the newspaper today of a recommendation to the housing Department to consider building 50,000 local authority houses. I ask the Minister to change the national spatial strategy to enable us to build houses and give planning permission to build them, because we must. There is major potential for the credit union sector to issue home loans to assist in meeting the major social need for housing. I ask the Minister to examine this aspect. In addition, I read a newspaper report today, although I understand this information emerged yesterday, that the Government is considering introducing legislation to put a moratorium on repossessions. I beg the Government to do this. This is probably one of the most urgent requirements of the Government - that it keep people and children in their homes. We have a crisis and unless these simple things are addressed it will not be solved. Renting is the reason there is a housing crisis. I have a question for the Minister about my local authority in Carlow. Carlow is always forgotten. A maximum rate is set to get on the local authority housing list and in Carlow it is €25,000. If one is earning €25,000, one does not qualify to be put on the local authority housing list, yet in the neighbouring counties of Kilkenny, Laois and Wicklow the maximum is €30,000. Why has Carlow been forgotten again? Why is it that Carlow people cannot be put at the top of the scale at €30,000 like everybody else? I urge the Minister to answer all of these questions because they are serious issues. In this day and age, it is criminal if every county in Ireland does not have a refuge for women and their children. There is no women's refuge in Carlow, nor is there emergency housing. As there is talk of €200 million being allocated to emergency housing, I ask the Minister to ensure every county in Ireland has a women's refuge. There are buildings which are being sold for reasonable prices and I am aware that the Minister must work with the HSE and Tusla in this regard. It is about everybody working together, but this must be done. As I said, we are in a crisis. I welcome the new tenant purchase scheme. It had not been made available to local authorities for over two years. Who writes these schemes for local authorities? Again, the most vulnerable in the community are not allowed to purchase their house. The new tenant purchase scheme provides that there must be a 50% income coming into the household. Old age pensioners who have just retired do not qualify and are not allowed to buy their house, even though they might have come into a certain amount of money or they might have been made redundant. People who inherit money or who perhaps win money are not allowed to purchase their house. Once again, the new tenant purchase scheme only suits very few. Who drafts these schemes? It just does not make sense. My colleague referred to child poverty and homelessness. In the past year in Carlow, we set up a soup kitchen; we called it St. Clare's Hospitality. With the summer approaching there will be more children and families attending, as the children are not in school. We are trying to keep these families fed. We also give food parcels to families most in need. I am ashamed to say that when St. Clare's Hospitality set up the soup kitchen over a year ago, we could not get any streamlined funding from any Department to fund it. There is a homelessness crisis and a housing crisis and we are setting up soup kitchens because people are hungry, but there is no funding from the Government. With the €200 million in funding and with all the Departments working together, the Minister must look after the poor and most vulnerable in the community. I seek answers to my questions, but I also seek results. I want funding to be allocated to these areas.

They face a real challenge. I welcome the motion tabled by Fianna Fáil. Fine Gael agrees with much of its content and, in fact, much of what it proposes is already under way. I was formerly the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and appointed to office in 2014 in the middle of the crisis. Without pointing fingers or laying blame, the environment in which the Ministers are trying to meet this challenge must be acknowledged. People ask why this happened. The reason was obvious. We had a bankrupt state in which, unfortunately, the local authorities had abdicated their responsibility for building houses for over a decade. As a result of the economic crash, access to credit dried up both for builders and individuals seeking to build their own homes. In addition, repossessions began to take place. We see the obvious result with homelessness. It is a shame for the country. It is something on which we all must work together, irrespective of party politics. We are depending on local authorities, all political parties and society in general to respond to this challenge in a responsible way. I commend the Ministers for the work they are undertaking. Many of the foundations were laid in the past few years. The previous Government, despite the fact that the State was bankrupt when it took office in 2011, committed over €4 billion to the social housing strategy; therefore, it is not a matter of throwing funding at the problem. I believe, as a result of my experience in the past two years, that it is about improving the efficiency of delivery of supply in both the public and private sectors.There is a lot to be learned in this regard. We have systems in place in local authorities and the Department - I am being constructively critical - that are old and which were set up for a day that is long gone. The challenge is of such proportions that we need serious reform, not only of the local authorities and how they deliver houses but also of the Department. Some Senators have alluded to the fact that there are too many barriers or stages in the approvals process. The Minister has committed to undertaking a review of it, which is to be welcomed.  Another measure taken recently is similar to the devolved scheme for schools under which local authorities can apply to the Department for a sum of €2 million and it is then up to them, on receiving approval, to go ahead and build units with that amount of money. I ask the Minister to tell the House how many local authorities have come forward to take advantage of that scheme since it was announced a number of months ago. It is a quick, accessible way to address the housing crisis in many local authority areas and I would have thought that once the scheme was announced, local authorities would be breaking down the door of the Department to get projects up and running. Under the scheme, no further approval is required once initial approval is given by the Department. That is a welcome development and I urge all local authorities to take advantage of the scheme. On homelessness, I agree with the content of the motion. It is unacceptable that there are young families and children residing in emergency accommodation. However, it is the reality in the current environment that building houses takes time because projects must go through the planning process, infrastructure must be put in place, tenders must be issued and construction must then take place. I note that there has been criticism, some of it deserved, of the last Government and its failure to deliver. However, I can say without fear or favour that funding, approvals and necessary mechanisms have been put in place to enable houses to be constructed. I understand almost 200 construction projects are under way. They were given the green light by the Department and will deliver houses as soon as possible. It is important that local authorities and the project managers therein accelerate and complete these projects. I agree with the points made by Senators opposite about voids. Obviously, this was an issue that needed attention because much of the local authority housing stock was lying vacant or in a derelict state while people languished on housing lists. That is just not acceptable. Funding for local authorities was prioritised to enable them to refurbish voids as quickly as possible. The figures in this regard are available from the Department. Some local authorities are excellent in dealing with voids, but others are woeful. Some view their housing stock as an asset to be managed and when it is unused, they invest in it and turn around units as quickly as possible, but others leave houses empty for months, if not years. That is not good enough and those local authorities that do not come up to the mark should be held to account by councillors and Members of this House in order that those on housing lists can be better served.  I draw the Minister's attention to a number of issues. First, I believe we should prioritise the quick-wins, voids being the obvious one. Existing stock must be turned around quickly and put back into use as soon as possible. Urban regeneration is also very important because the required infrastructure is already in place in urban areas. While it is welcome that the €200 million fund has been put in place by the Government for critical infrastructure, I point to the many cities, towns and villages in which existing full serviced housing stock is lying derelict and vacant. We need to provide incentives to unlock the potential of these sites and get the owners to either sell or let them. That would increase footfall in the centre of towns and villages all over the country. That would be a quick-win solution and a cross-cutting departmental response will be required to make it happen. I know for a fact that the Department cannot do it on its own. It will need help from the Department of Finance and several others.  Part V obligations and the viability of construction are huge barriers to supply. Builders tell us that they are finding it very difficult to access credit and if they cannot do so, they cannot build. We can talk all we like in this House about the matter, but unless we can find sources of credit for builders, we will not see enough houses being built. The local authorities have been provided with funding and set on the path, but they must be held to account if they fail to deliver. In order to reduce the overhead costs associated with delivery, the last Government reduced the Part V obligations - from 20% to 10% - which exposed it to some criticism and it will be interesting to see how many housing units are provided under the new regime. Unfortunately, for a number of years a Fianna Fáil Government accepted cash from developers in lieu of housing units under the Part V arrangements. Had that not been the case, we would have 10,000 more social housing units in the system today. That measure was simply wrong and when I was in office, I removed that mechanism, with the result that developers are now obliged to provide social housing units under Part V, which is the way it should be. During the boom years a lot of money was collected by the local authorities under Part V arrangements. That money was supposed to be ring-fenced for reinvestment in housing, whether by way of the maintenance of existing stock or through new builds, but it appears from the figures for voids and new builds that there was very little activity in that regard. I want to know what happened to the Part V money collected by every local authority. I suspect some have invested it in housing, but that others are sitting on it, even to this day. This matter should be examined very closely to determine the level of funding available under the Part V arrangements which can now be used to purchase sites and build new housing developments. I wish the Minister well in his role, but there is no easy answer to this problem which requires a cross-departmental, cross-societal response. We all have a responsibility. It is not just about throwing money at the problem but also about finding efficient ways to deliver housing quickly. I urge the Minister to tell the local authorities to look again at towns and villages which contain derelict houses and vacant sites, in respect of some of which planning permission has been granted, instead of focusing on greenfield sites. There is a far more efficient way to deliver housing. I will certainly be putting my shoulder to the wheel in whatever way I can to assist the Minister and every other Senator will do the same. This is a national problem that crosses politics and political parties and it behoves us all to respond in a responsible way.

I urge those involved, the Whips and others, to get together to see if we can negotiate an arrangement whereby we will not have a vote on this matter. There really is a homelessness crisis. I have just looked at the figures for those who have accessed homeless services in Dublin in the past two years. In 2014 the figure was 2,306. It has almost doubled to 3,777 this year. That gives real cause for worry - the constant incremental increase. We also know that in 2014 there were 20,000 people on the housing list in the Dublin City Council area. I assume there are considerably more than on it now.  I wish to talk a little about the banks. We have had banks putting people out on the side of the road. It is an increasing phenomenon and the Government appeared to endorse the policy. I remind the banks that they were rescued with money from the purses of the ordinary, small people of this country. It was our money, but now they are turning around and putting people out of their houses. It is disgraceful.  One of the most fundamental rights in any decent democratic society is the right to housing, shelter and a home. We now see NAMA and others selling off mortgage portfolios to vulture funds.These are individuals who will be utterly callous. They just kick people out on the side of the street. Why was it not found possible to offer those mortgages to their original proprietors at the discount at which they were sold to the vulture funds? That would have kept people in their homes and would have been the decent thing to do. Now we have people in hotels. That might sound very grand - as though it would be nice to be in a hotel. I do not think it is very nice. They are stuck in unsuitable accommodation and very often told they cannot go in the front door but must go around to the tradesman's entrance at the back. They are second-class citizens. The children are not allowed to play and there are no facilities for them. If one looks at the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin, for example, on the night of 24 April this year there were 102 people counted as sleeping rough. There were certainly more than this. During the years the gender breakdown shows that between 84% and 91% of these are men, mostly young men. Behind this is a nexus of poverty. We have seen in the past ten years the biggest transfer of money from the poor to the rich that I have ever experienced in my life. We have various definitions of poverty. We have the consistent poverty rates. "Consistent poverty" describes the situation of people whose income is below the poverty threshold and cannot afford at least two of 11 staple items, to which I will come back. The at-risk-of-poverty threshold is an income of €10,926. That is about the level of the contributory old age pension. There are 11 deprivation indicators: two pairs of strong shoes - anybody could see it is real poverty if one is not able to afford a pair of weatherproof shoes - a warm, waterproof overcoat; buying new, not second-hand, clothes; eating meat, chicken, fish or a vegetarian equivalent every second day; having a roast joint or its equivalent once a week; having to go without heating in the last year through lack of money; keeping the home adequately warm; buying presents for family or friends at least once a year; replacing any worn-out furniture; having family or friends for a drink or a meal once a month; and having had a morning, afternoon or evening out in the last fortnight for entertainment. These are the qualities that give people a human life. It provides not just for decent clothing, shelter and food but also for a degree of human dignity in terms of provision for entertainment. The percentage of Irish people living in consistent poverty in 2014 was 8%. The figure had nearly doubled from 4.2% in 2008. The consistent poverty rate for the unemployed is 22.6%, up from 9.7%; therefore, it has more than doubled in those four or five years. Children remain the most vulnerable age group, with 11.2% living in consistent poverty. It is particularly marked in single-parent households. The percentage of people who are at risk of poverty was 14.1% in 2013, the seventh lowest in the European Union. It is very easy to trick around with these figures and say we are doing pretty well because the figure is the seventh lowest in the European Union. Being at risk of poverty means living on an income below 60% of median income. If one looks behind these figures and takes away the social welfare payments and various things like that, Ireland's position falls: the actual at-risk rate in this country without social welfare supports would be a staggering 49.8%. In other words, without the support of social welfare, nearly half the people of the country would be at risk of poverty. That is a salutary figure that ought to bring us up short. Consistent poverty rates have increased during the years because of the financial difficulties this country found itself in. In 2014 it was estimated that just 370,000 people were in this category. This is in a society in which there is a very high cost of living. Prices in the Republic were 22.3% above the European average in 2014, making the State the joint third most expensive place in the European Union and we have these levels of poverty. In the midst of this, we have 140,000 childrenat risk of poverty. That puts in context all the bleating about treating all the children of the nation equally. Fergus Finlay, the chief executive of Barnardos, who is well known to this House has said the child poverty rate is "a national scandal". He said:We would expect to have seen the beginnings of a reduction in child poverty rates in 2014 [...] However one in nine children still live in consistent poverty and more than a third of children experience deprivation, while the number of children at risk of poverty has not improved since 2010. This puts paid to the rhetoric that ‘a rising tide will lift all boats’ [...] two children in every classroom are living without access to basic necessities through no fault of their own or their parents. They are going without warm winter clothing, living in substandard housing and even going hungry.In what condition are those children to absorb the lessons of education? I pay tribute to the sponsors of the motion. It is a very good one and I hope agreement can be reached on it in order that Seanad Éireann will put its muscle, back and united effort behind those Ministers who are seeking to address this most urgent problem.

Doorstep after doorstep in Dublin provides unacceptable accommodation for people who are living at the margins of society. This worthwhile motion is very welcome. We can work together across all parties to try to sort out the homelessness crisis. Outside the large cities, homelessness may not be as visible, but it is no less a challenge for those who want their own homes but have to rely on the couches or floors of family and friends or emergency accommodation. Much human despair is unfolding every day for families. We have also heard worrying reports of homeless children being accommodated on blow-up beds in adult hostels. How did it come to this? Ten years ago we had housing estates being built. When I was a member of the local authority, I felt apartments and housing were of a great standard. We felt we had addressed the housing crisis, although there was no crisis then. One of the reasons is that there were many buy-to-let investors who were involved in business and decided they would buy apartments to let. I was probably one of them. However, many of them have now lost their properties because of the downturn. I see many buildings for sale that are vacant for three or four years because the owners are still trying to deal with the banks. That is no good for the homeless who want a place to live. There is an issue with many of the banks which have been very slow in having properties sold to local authorities to ensure people can move into them. We talk about ghost estates and think of estates that were built in the past five or ten years.To me, the new ghost estates in my own town are in places such as Marian Road - so-called because it was built in the 1950s and 1960s. Most of the people from such areas which I would describe as having quite good housing stock moved to newer estates. The ghost estates are the local authority estates that were allowed to deteriorate when most of the families moved out. The local authorities should have done much more work to address this issue. It is very good-quality accommodation, as we are all aware from canvassing. We go into the old traditional estates that I canvassed 16 years ago and there is nobody living in them now. They were quite good houses. There is a need for joined-up thinking and I know that the Minister will do this. That is where a lot of the work is being done. I am pleased that the Dáil agreed to establish a special Committee on Housing and Homelessness to review the implications of the problem of housing and homelessness and make recommendations. These recommendations are logical. On the main street in Boyle, Bridge Street, where 150 people grew up 40 years ago, I think my mother is the only person living over a shop. There is high-quality accommodation in every town and village. I speak of a small area in County Roscommon; it is not the same as in Dublin. Even around Dublin, over shops, there is high-quality accommodation. There is a need for some incentive to encourage people to live over shops or in towns and villages again. We cannot have a situation akin to that in the United States where there was a quick exodus to the suburbs. The suburbs were nice and they were great, but there is a need to reinvent the towns. As a person who grew up over a shop - we did not even have a back door - I was very happy and still live there. Could one raise a family there? It may not be acceptable today, but years ago many families were raised over shops. The fact is that there are people who are homeless and we need to do something about it. The scale of the housing construction challenge is huge. Recently, local authorities have estimated that more than €1 billion per year is needed in the next five years to address the social housing shortage across the country. A capital funding commitment is a major challenge, but it is not about money; it is about joined-up thinking such as demonstrated in the special Committee on Housing and Homelessness. In this Chamber we can work together to try to ensure we sort out this issue. The banks have much to answer for because they have been slow to wash out many of the properties that should be opened up immediately for housing. I have seen apartments empty for four or five years. On the question of allowing somebody in for nothing, the local authorities have been slow to address the matter.  On the need for emergency measures to tackle the crisis, much more needs to be done. There is a need to build approximately 30,000 to 35,000 houses to make up for the lack of building during the past five years. It is an issue of which we lost sight and it crept up. It was a perfect storm, although that is no good to the people who are living on sofas or in hotel rooms. As a Government, I do not believe we will oppose the motion. I hope this is the new politics - the cross-party politics where we can accept motions and work together to try to alleviate the problem of homelessness. In two years time we will have another issue, but I hope it will not be homelessness.  I commend Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee for bringing forward the motion which I support.

Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Leas-Chathaoirleach as ucht a cheapacháin. Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh sé sin leis.  Having heard so much about new politics and seeing everyone so happy-clappy, I hope we will receive full support for the amendment. It is unbelievable to have to listen to the two sides of the one coin singing the same tune for the first time in a long time. The substantive motion has very little that could cause offence. Of course, Fine Gael will support it; it has no choice, as it does not have the numbers to oppose it. There is an element of the brass neck in Fianna Fáil icoming forward with such a motion today, when it was the architect of the disastrous situation in which we find the housing sector. For five years in government, Fine Gael continued the broken policies. To say it had not realised there was an issue or that it had crept up on us is astounding coming from a Fine Gael Member because we certainly raised the issues involved time after time in the Houses. We have tabled an amendment because the motion simply does not go far enough. We are calling on the Government to declare a state of emergency, as it is more than a crisis. We are asking it to declare a state of emergency, admit how bad the issue is and recognise the scale of the housing crisis. We are calling on it to double investment in social housing, to fast track the approval, procurement and tendering process for local authorities, to introduce rent certainty, linking rent with the consumer price index, to legislate for a moratorium on home repossessions until adequate measures to deal with mortgage distress are enacted and to introduce emergency legislation to give tenants in private rental properties greater protections when properties are bought by vulture funds. We hope there will not be a vote because we hope all Members will accept the amendment, but we will certainly push it to a vote. At the latest count by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, there were almost 6,000 homeless people in Ireland, including 2,000 children. The most recent figures for the number of homeless children in Dublin show that there were 1,723 in 839 families. The recent Housing Agency report for the Government put the number of vacant homes across the State as high as 230,000 and included a vacant home tax among its recommendations. Sinn Féin calls on the Minister to take action immediately because there may be as many as 230,000 vacant homes across the State. I am informed that in Dublin there are 255 vacant units. There is no point in talking about the issue; these have to be turned into homes for families.  There are up 130,000 households on local authority housing waiting lists, including well over 10,000 in Galway. Rents and house prices are spiralling out of control. It is simply not good enough for the Government to sit on its hands and do nothing about vacant properties when so many families are in severe housing need. We have been told repeatedly by the Government that the central cause of the housing crisis is an undersupply of housing, particularly private housing, yet the Housing Agency has prepared a report for the Government which includes a mention of empty houses. This does not include holiday homes. We want to see these empty houses turned into homes for families.  There has been a little talk about repossessions. Last month I decided to go to the repossessions court in Galway to see it with my own two eyes. What is going on there is an absolute disgrace. I had a misconception that many of the people in the repossessions court had totally defaulted on their mortgages, but the opposite is the truth. In many cases, banks and vulture capitalists are chasing people for a couple of thousand euro. These are people who are maintaining a certain level of payment - a substantial amount, in many cases - and who have paid hundreds of thousands of euro towards their mortgages over a number of years. It is not the case, therefore, that those in the repossessions courts are total and utter defaulters who do not want to pay their debts back. There are vulture funds in a land grab to take the houses from people who have very little debt left to repay. It is an absolute scandal. Even the set-up of the courts is an absolute scandal. Cases are not heard by a judge. The court in Galway is tiny. I counted 21 seats, nine of which were taken up by solicitors and barristers. The others were taken up by people from NGOs and agencies supporting people in distress. Most of the people who had hearings to attend could not get into the courtroom. They had to queue in the corridor and down the stairs in Galway courthouse, which is an absolute disgrace. That issue needs to be addressed. They could not receive a proper hearing.  Sinn Féin calls for legislation to give tenants rent certainty.I again put it to Fianna Fáil that if it is so serious about this crisis, it should support the Bill going through the Dáil today. I say this to all others present also. Rents across the State continue to rise as the watered down rent certainty measures introduced last year by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, failed to make any dent in rental prices. I believe in Galway the highest increases in rents were witnessed in the past quarter and numerous reports have illustrated this fact. The recent quarterly rental report showed an increase in the average rent nationwide of 9.3% in the year to March 2016, with average rents now at a rate of more than €1,000 per month. In Dublin the report showed rental inflation for the year to March at 8.8% and that it cost an average of €1,663 per month to rent in parts of the city. It also demonstrated that nationally, rents were 8.6% higher in the first three months of 2016 than in the same period last year. There is definitely a perfect storm in Galway in this regard because it has a huge student population, as well as a number of reasonably affluent companies. Consequently, people who come to work for these companies are taking up a lot of the better private accommodation. In addition, in Galway there are rent caps that do not recognise the cost of rented houses in the rental market and a new phenomenon has emerged. When I attended the briefing held yesterday by the Society of St. Vincent De Paul, I raised the issue of the hidden homeless because I wished to ascertain what was the society's experience in this regard. There is a whole cohort of people who are couch-surfing. I am aware of many single parents, in particular, who are staying with their children in the homes of friends or family, including sisters or brothers. While some might state they are lucky to have relatives to look after them - they are - the stress this puts on them is unbelievable. They have the right to their own home and a right to proper accommodation and their own space. It is causing mental health issues and great stress and putting huge pressure on all the families involved. This issue of hidden homeless also must be addressed. I also visited the refuge for homeless women in Galway recently, Osterley Lodge, where the waiting list is simply incredible. Accommodation is not available for women who may be in abusive situations, particularly due to domestic violence. They have absolutely nowhere to go and service providers such as COPE Galway simply cannot control what is going on. It is time for Senators to put their money where their mouths are. If this is the new politics, Sinn Féin has tabled a progressive amendment to thie motion. If Fianna Fáil wishes to prove it really is reinventing itself, this is the time to show Members what it intends to do. One must remember that Fianna Fáil has the control, in that it holds the balance of power. Its Members can force through any of these measures because Fine Gael must come on board to get the majority to put through any measure. I am calling on and putting it up to Fianna Fáil Members to make sure these measures in the amendment are included, after which Members together will push collectively the Government to deliver on the promises I hope all Members will make in the Seanad this evening.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	172	I second the amendment and will divide my few words into two parts. I, first, wish to talk about child poverty. Members are aware that poverty and the hardship caused by poverty and social exclusion are not new phenomena. They are aware that in 2010, under the Fianna Fáil-led Government, more than 200,000 children lived in households experiencing poverty. Moreover, the number of children at risk of poverty rose by more than 35,000 in the three years between 2007 and 2010. One major disservice and wrong done by Fianna Fáil in 2008 was to get rid of the Combat Poverty Agency. It was the only agency dedicated to addressing poverty and because the Government did not like what it had to say - it was saying exactly what Members are saying in the Chamber today - it axed the agency. Had the Combat Poverty Agency been listened to at the time, an awful lot would have been learned because it had the information and evidence available for Members to formulate policies that would have prevented the crisis we face today. Child poverty cannot be addressed in isolation, but must be considered within the wider issues of poverty and all households must be lifted out of poverty by Government policies and joined-up thinking. I am not simply talking about properly-paid employment but about essential public services such as access to health services, equal access to education and a level playing field. In particular, I refer to a level playing field for children who are living in homes that are not conducive to their full participation in either the education system or society because of what they are going through. As a nation, we have failed to address poverty and social exclusion. Even when the country was awash with money, we gave more to the rich and robbed the poor. The protection of the golden circle was more important than keeping open community development projects, homework clubs or projects that addressed social exclusion and addiction or which helped poor mental health and many other social issues. Eight successive cuts were imposed on lone parents alone and the price now is being paid for the failure of successive Governments to invest in families and communities. Many of the young people who now are shooting and being shot all over this city and in other cities were children who grew up in communities that were crying out for investment and attention and we have failed them. As Senator David Norris observed, a rising tide does not lift all boats and targeted comprehensive interventions are needed to tackle the injustice of poverty in all its forms. In respect of housing specifically, it is scandalous that thousands of units are left vacant by local authorities. However, from my time as a member of Mayo County Council, I am aware that local authorities are starved of resources and when they do get some money, the manner in which it can be spent is highly restrictive. I ask the Minister of State to address this point. Local authorities must have autonomy on where money can be spent and how it can best be used, rather than it being purely prescriptive because local authorities and the Government are among the most reckless landlords in the State. I know of people who have been renting council houses for 30 years and more but who are without central heating or insulation and whose windows and doors have not been replaced throughout that time. However, they are being asked to pay rent and live in these conditions, which is not right. Even though money was available last year, which I welcome, this money cannot be spent on the refurbishment of the local authority stock or if it can, the local authorities certainly are unaware of this. Consequently, I call for immediate investment into the existing local authority stock. As the Sinn Féin amendment states, an emergency response is needed. Local authorities must be able to buy private houses, as well as those that are available through the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA. The procurement process is holding everything up and the Government is aware it can announce however many millions of euro for housing in the next week or ten days in the full knowledge that this money cannot be spent because of the restrictions and delays in procurement. There is another issue also in that because of the moratorium, there is not a sufficient number of housing officers within local authorities to be able to prepare the procurement papers and everything that must be done to fast-track the process. Local authorities must be allowed to have a response and the response by the local authority in County Mayo may be different from the response needed in Dublin. Many vacant private units in County Mayo could be brought up within weeks and used as social housing and I suggest this be done rather than building new homes. In addition, this obviously would serve both rural and urban regeneration, whereby families would then be living in these communities, which is badly needed to keep open schools, post offices and everything else in rural areas. I wish to comment on the housing assistance payment because rental limits are forcing families to break the law by lying about rent.The Minister says time and again that there is flexibility around rent limits and what can be paid in different areas. I categorically refute this. Mayo County Council is not one of the local authorities given the flexibility to do this; therefore, if a tenant needs a home, he or she must say he or she is paying a certain amount in rent and go with that in the fear that he or she may be found out and have to pay back all the money to the Department of Social Protection. I will finish with the issue of repossessions because I attended the court in Castlebar last Monday. Like Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, I saw how families were being put out of their homes. One incident backed up what Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh said. The housing debt was €66,000. Last January somebody offered to pay €50,000 on behalf of the family and the bank refused to take it. Where is the write-down and the discretion? Where is the cut-off for families after all we have done for the banks and how the banks have been supported? There is a major loss of revenue to the Government in respect of deals given to vulture funds. It is not only the haircuts; it is the loss of revenue where these vulture funds which are based abroad do not have pay VAT. There is drainage from the State. That money could be put towards housing. The Minister might consider training for housing officers on the dynamics of domestic violence because very many of them do not understand these dynamics. They need to remove the barriers in order that it is easier for women and children living in horrific conditions to escape from violent homes. I ask the Minister to support the amendment because while I have no problem with the Fianna Fáil motion, the amendment is more comprehensive in respect of what we are trying to address.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	173	I welcome this debate. It is important that we look at where we are in the provision of housing. Yes, we have problems and there are many measures that could be taken immediately to solve some of them. I will give the Minister a simple example that relates to downsizing. Quite a number of my constituents who occupy three or four-bedroom houses have told me that they have been contacting their local authority for four, five or, in some cases, eight years looking to move to a one or two-bedroom unit that would be more suitable because they have moved on in years and need to be near shops and services. There are suitable units available for them, but they find there is no response from the local authorities. They are occupying three or four-bedroom houses that would be suitable for families. I am astonished. If one goes to other areas, be they in the private or public sector, there is a much faster response in respect of dealing with issues. This is one area where local authorities could react immediately. I know of at least six houses in one local authority area that would be very suitable for families. I do not understand why it can take up to two years to bring a vacant house back into use. I am talking about houses that are handed back after a person has died. There seems to be a huge delay. I understand some local authorities will send a different person to look at the house and one could find at least six to seven people going out to look at a house, regardless of whether it is the plumber, the electrician or the person who will look at the windows. Why can local authorities not set up a team that would go out on the same day and carry out an assessment of what needs to be done? I know of one local authority where the keys are handed back to the housing department, the housing department then sends them down to the electrician or plumber to go out, it takes another six weeks for the keys to come back to the housing department, they are then sent to another person to go and look at the house and it takes another six weeks. It seems to go on and on. Surely in this day and age we could co-ordinate house inspections and how this matter can be managed to ensure the house is brought back into use at a very early stage. Somebody contacted me last week who surrendered their house to a local authority because they had entered a new relationship and moved in with their new partner in another area of the city. Unfortunately, the relationship did not work out and the person contacted me to find out whether they could move back into their old local authority house. I told them that I did not think the house would be vacant only to be told that it was and that all the shutters were still up 18 months later. This raises very serious questions. At a time when we badly need houses, we are not responding in time. Some of my colleagues have raised the issue of how we manage finances. We are paying out money in social welfare, rightly so, because we need to give support to people, regardless of whether they are retired or in receipt of various allowances such as disability allowance. However, we are paying out €20 billion per annum, which works out at €57 million per day. I do not like the impression that is created that the State is not giving the necessary support. Yes, there are areas where not all of the supports available cater for the needs of some people, but it is about ensuring those who fall between two stools because they do not qualify for various supports are identified and dealt with. Likewise, we must ensure housing support is provided for those who require it. When one looks back over the past 20 years, a scheme once operated under which if someone put money on deposit, another 25% was added to it over a period at a time when we were getting a huge amount of money in from housing. If one looks back to before 2008, it is sad to see how little of the money that was coming in between PRSI paid in respect of people working for building contractors, VAT paid by building contractors, capital gains tax and stamp duty was used at the time to provide local authority housing when we needed it. It is always difficult to say we will rely totally on the private sector because that is exactly what happened. It was fine relying on the private sector when there was an oversupply of housing, but that suddenly changed. When the Government changed in 2011, there was an oversupply of housing, but that has changed in the past two years. We also need to look at structures relating to housing, for example, how letting in the private sector is short term. In other European countries one can get a 20-year lease and the same is true if one is in the commercial sector. Someone renting a shop unit or office can get a 20-year lease with five-year rent reviews. They are then obliged to fit out their own offices in order that they are not relying on the landlord. We need to look at arrangements in other European countries for those who cannot afford to buy a house but who want certainty and permanency. They are able to save some money and invest in a property. In Germany a person renting a property carries out all the internal work in a property such as putting in a fitted kitchen, bathroom, curtains and flooring, but he or she pays a very low rent for 20 years; therefore, he or she has certainty and security of tenure.He or she also has far lower costs in terms of wear and tear compared to our system. We need to examine new structures such as that. In order to do so, the necessary legislation must be in place. If we want to make any change in housing policy, we have to provide certainty for people who are renting in the private sector and that is what we need to focus on. We need to develop a structure very quickly.

There are some very positive measures we would welcome. We welcome that one of the first debates in the House highlights and focuses on such a vital, important and crucial issue. The motion and supplementary amendments that have been proposed by Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil offer very constructive and positive measures. Many others and I in our group would be very interested in driving forward an all-party consensus and in moving forward together in terms of highlighting these issues. That is something we can do constructively. I wish to highlight a number of issues. The figures for deprivation in Ireland are shocking. Deprivation involves not just poverty in terms of income but a lack of any form of safety net, security or capital reserve. Deprivation means the lack of means to purchase the basic necessities of life. That puts into very stark contrast those who want to manage housing in terms of day-to-day spending. I welcome the specific acknowledgement of the very shocking deprivation levels affecting lone parents in Ireland. One-parent families are a cause of concern in terms of the deprivation levels experienced. I refer to housing and homelessness. While it is important that we highlight the large numbers of people on housing waiting lists, we must also be aware of the large number of hidden homeless. Previous speakers focused on those who were staying in unsafe and unsuitable accommodation, particularly people who were dealing with issues such as domestic violence, because of a lack of appropriate housing and the fear of entering what is now seen to be a long and desperate journey to obtain housing or alternative accommodation which may involve bringing children into unsuitable premises. In addition to some of the measures mentioned which focus largely on emergency measures and initial action, I hope the House may also address the crucial medium-term housing issues which must be considered. Another Senator
spoke about leasing. An over-reliance on the use of leases at local level which results in a block on the opportunity for local authorities to purchase sustainable housing means that children who are enrolled in schools have no guarantee that in three or five years time a landlord will not move them out of their current accommodation. A short-term solution offering five or ten-year leases would leave many children disturbed in the middle of their schooling. Such an approach would affect jobs, etc., and would require families to reroute and reorient themselves after a period of homelessness. Such families will again be thrown into vulnerable circumstances. We have seen this happen on a case by case basis throughout the country. In terms of medium-term measures, I urge the State to build or buy rather than lease housing units. Another medium-term danger is the capital gains tax waiver which was in place in 2013 and 2014. In effect, it was an invitation to vulture funds to enter Ireland. We must address the concerns of those who are renting properties from vulture funds. We have seen the need for such people to be given urgent protection. In three or four years time, when the vulture funds are able to withdraw from Ireland without paying tax thanks to the seven-year condition that was applied to their purchases, we may face a further crisis. Another speaker said that this matter was not about money. It is about money. We need to say we value direct investment in housing and are willing to put it on the books - it does not need to be off-balance sheet. A cost-benefit analysis of the recent reduction in inheritance tax might be a more worthy exercise than considering the comparable cost and benefit of investing in secure homes for families across Ireland in the long term. I urge us to move past the no-cost approach to a more dynamic long-term investment approach.
#LynnRuane	unknown-#LynnRuane-party	unknown-#LynnRuane-dob	unknown-#LynnRuane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	177	A couple of Senators referred to the hidden homeless. Last year I was with a young man in hospital when he died. We tried to encourage him to undergo treatment for cirrhosis of the liver. The man was aged in his early 30s and lived in a hostel. He chose to die in a hospital bed rather than have to live on the streets again. His fear was that if he went into treatment he would lose his place in a hostel and instead chose to die. I assured him that I would work with him until we secured accommodation for him in order to ensure he could receive treatment. His view was that it did not matter because he was part of the forgotten homeless. That experience stayed with me. It is part of the new wave of homelessness that is happening and that affects families and local authorities. Another cohort of homelessness comprises those with high levels of need. In the hostels I have worked in there are men who require nursing home care. The staff in hostels are not nurses, but they act as medical professionals. The current levels of primary care and safety nets for homeless people are increasing their life expectancy. Investment is not being provided to ensure hostels keep up with the men and women - mostly men - who are reaching an age at which they should be in nursing homes. Some of them have high levels of care needs, but they are being cared for by project workers who are not suitably qualified. They are not being allowed to die with dignity. The hostels are of a low standard. Street drinkers live in them. Even when people die in hostels, they do not do so in the comfort of a bed where they should be at their age. I recently visited Brú Aimsir hostel to carry out a survey. It is welcome that the process will continue and the hostel will increase to full capacity. I call on the Minister and anyone else who is dealing with the homelessness issue not to forget that a cohort of homeless people are not acknowledged in any legislation. Council housing is not appropriate for such persons. Rather, they need supportive and traditional housing with structures that allow those with high levels of needs to be cared for.

It is clear from the CSO figures that children have borne the brunt of the mistakes we, as a nation and as politicians, have made. We now have an opportunity to reverse this and need to start with the 2,000 children who are homeless. I ask the Minister of State to enable us to be the eyes and ears of and watchdog for those 2,000 children. The Combat Poverty Agency is no longer in existence, but the Minister of State's Department has the ability to provide us with the monitoring information required. There are probably more than 2,000 children who are homeless.We should be able to see what progress is being made on behalf of those 2,000 children to remove them from the unsuitable accommodation in which they currently live. It is robbing children of their here and now, childhood and future. It is wasting money which is being spent on hotels and hostels and the money that will be spent on mental health services for those children in the future. These are the very people who could end up in homeless hostels further down the line. There is going to be a cost to all this, but irrespective of the cost we are talking about human beings and lives. I would like the Minister of State to come back to us regularly to monitor the information about those 2,000 children and see if progress is being made. I do not care about the difficulties in local authorities or in his Departments. We need to be overcoming them and getting on with it.

#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2016-06-15 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	190	It might help if I was as brief as possible because in many ways this is groundhog day. I was elected to Dublin City Council in 1999. One of the very early arguments we had was about housing in the city and the provision of social housing, in particular. At that stage the city management, to a great extent, had made the decision, with many other local authorities, to move away from the social housing model and allow the private sector to provide social housing, that is, rented, and that the voluntary housing groups would move to provide that housing. I found that situation unsatisfactory at the time and argued wholeheartedly against it. Unfortunately, I won the argument and lost the war because in principle it was accepted that local authorities would stay involved in the provision of social housing but they never furthered its implementation. Part V has been discussed in the House on many occasions. It was a very progressive idea that 20% of housing built would be affordable and social housing. That idea came from public representatives and community groups in the north and south docklands in Dublin city. In fairness, we had a very enlightened Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government at the time, former Deputy Noel Dempsey, who took the idea on board and legislated for it. If that legislation had stayed as intended right through the boom years when we saw massive building in the city, we would have reached that figure of 20% for social and affordable housing. Unfortunately, the then Minister was not there long enough to see it grow and flourish and the succeeding Minister, former Deputy Martin Cullen, changed the legislation which allowed the huge building spree within the city without provision for social housing. He granted exemptions in the planning permissions granted compared with those provided for by the preceding Minister. It is great to have this debate and discussion and there are many elements of the Sinn Féin amendment which I would support, especially that relating to the consumer. Linking rents with the consumer price index is one of the things for which we fought within the Government, but, unfortunately, we were not able to deliver. I commend Sinn Féin for taking it on board. I hope that when the Minister returns with his response, he may be able to update us on the provision of the 500 modular housing units. It is very important that they be delivered on time in order that people can start moving from the unsatisfactory situation where they are living in hotel rooms. I put it to the Minister of State that there are many dangers facing us. In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, met councillors from Dublin City Council on Monday night to listen to their concerns about housing issues in Dublin. It is very important that the Minister visit as many local authorities as possible. Councillors are working on the ground; they have solutions that can be implemented and can often be pragmatic. However, we must also watch out for new dangers. Independent Councillor Mannix Flynn and Sinn Féin Councillor Daithí Doolan, chairpersons of the city council's strategic policy committee on housing, are highlighting issues that affect not just Dublin but also other European capital cities, as well as American cities. There is a phenomenon of renting homes, for example, through Airbnb and other such companies. There are approximately 1,700 units for rent in Dublin. I am concentrating on Dublin in referring to this issue because while the issue is also very urgent in Cork, County Mayo and other counties and cities, the major crisis in homelessness is in Dublin. There are 1,700 units advertised between various websites, from apartments to homes for rent, and I believe this is a high percentage of the rental units available to families. These units can make a lot more money if the Airbnb model is followed. One two-bedroom apartment in the centre of Dublin city was able to make €79,000 per annum. Why would a landlord who owns a one or two-bedroom apartment not place that unit on one of the Internet rental sites? There may be a few extra service and management charges, but the profits to be made in renting to tourists are vastly greater than in renting to families who live here. We need to keep a eye on that issue. Seattle in Washington state has already moved to bring forward legislation; the matter is being reviewed in San Francisco, while Amsterdam has brought forward legislation. There is a major housing crisis in Berlin which is moving very quickly to bring in controls and legislation for the tourism rental market. When there is such a scarcity of units in the capital city, we have to be aware that this phenomenon could have a negative effect, even though there are many positives such as increasing accommodation for tourists and investment. However, while we are experiencing a particular danger, we need to be acutely aware of the issue. We cannot afford to lose 1,700 units from the market in such a very fast-moving sector. During the formation of the Government and the negotiations between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, one of the matters on which there was agreement was that rent supplement would be increased by 15%. I urge necessary caution with regard to that increase because the figures I have seen in the Department show that a 15% increase in rent supplement would cost approximately €56 million and generate slightly in excess of 100 units. Most of that money would go straight to landlords. It would be better spent in providing built accommodation. The uplift from the current protocols is between 20% and 30%, or €220. I fear that the Minister's negotiating team from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil was misguided. Its intentions may have been correct to suggest additional funding for rent supplement, but the Minister must be very cautious that he is not just providing a subsidy for landlords instead of increasing the number of additional units. A blanket increase of 15% would just go to landlords and not create the additional units we all want to see. There is a real and urgent need to ensure the protocol continues. Reference was made to its operation in County Mayo up to two months ago; it is, in fact, in operation in that county and it is being accessed. The protocol is operational throughout the country, unless the position has changed since. I would be concerned if that was the case. I would be very grateful if the Minister of State updated us.

The time limits are an issue that will probably be resolved at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. What is happening under the new arrangement is that two thirds of the Members of the Seanad have 50% of speaking time. That cannot stand and something will have to be done about it. The matter will have to be resolved by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I cannot resolve it. It is a pressure point.For the past five years the mover of a motion had ten minutes and the seconder six minutes. Now the time limits are 12 minutes and eight minutes. Fewer Members are allowed to speak and because of the make-up of the Seanad, two thirds of the Members of the Seanad have 50% of speaking time. This issue will have to be addressed either by extending the time allowed or by some other means, but the current position is unfair. I did not create the system, but the pressure is being exerted on me. The matter will have to be brought up at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.

Therefore, if someone can find him, he might get here before 6 p.m. to extend the time allocated. I am pleased that the allocation of time crisis can be resolved more quickly than the housing crisis. It is important that we have this debate and I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling the motion, with which we agree and accept. However, I do not agree with all of Sinn Féin's amendment. It is important that this House have the chance to discuss the housing crisis and its effects on children and their families in emergency accommodation and solutions to the problem. I am conscious that the Seanad was not formed in time for Senators to be part of the committee that has been debating the issue in recent weeks and which will produce its much awaited report on Friday that will feed into the action plan for housing. In addition to this debate, perhaps the Seanad might find a mechanism to discuss the issue further before we finalise the action plan for housing. As I said this morning when I spoke at a conference, the only way to resolve the housing crisis is by all of us working together and coming up with ideas. We might not agree with all of the ideas expressed, but we need to put all of them on the table, talk through them and pick out the best. That is what we will do with the action plan for housing which will be published in July. It will set out our stall for what we hope to do in the next six months, 12 months and two years to tackle the emergency and bring about the changes we need to make to fast-track planning and social housing provision. The Seanad might find more time to debate the issue. I will meet anybody who has ideas and solutions to tackle the issue and talk through them as best I can. I was involved in the Action Plan for Jobs and the success of that plan was based on stakeholder engagement and everyone having a chance to bring forward actions and following through with implementation. The same logic will work in the case of housing if we all work together, step by step and action by action, to implement the changes we need to make to solve the problem. Many of the problems stem from the lack of housing, to which reference was made by various speakers. One speaker referred to the need to zone more land. I accept that might be required in some areas, but the country has the potential to develop 400,000 housing units on land which has already been zoned. In Dublin alone enough land has been zoned to provide 88,000 housing units and enough planning permissions have already been granted to build 25,000 units.

It is not just a question of social housing; we also need more private housing. There is a considerable under-supply of housing and that is what we must address. The housing action plan will do this. For those who are new to the House, we used the same process to address the jobs crisis through the creation of an Action Plan for Jobs. When it was first published in 2012, everyone laughed at it and said it could not possibly achieve what it set out to do. The target was to create 100,000 jobs. It exceeded the target and when the private sector is included, more than 135,000 jobs were created. I was nervous about the plan when it was first put together, but it did work; therefore, I have every confidence that a similar process and action plan for housing will address the problem with the lack of housing. All debates such as the one we are having will feed into the process. Seanad Members did not get a chance to become part of the housing committee because the new Seanad had not been constituted at the time, but now they will have a chance to discuss the matter in the Seanad, other meetings and through the Department. We will engage with everyone and plenty of good ideas have been mooted today. I cannot answer all of the questions asked, but I will get the information Members need and we will work together on the issues involved. We will tease out all of the good ideas offered. I told the House that the Leader could run fast and I invite him to conduct his business. The motion gives us an opportunity to outline the Government's commitment to robustly tackling the significant challenges faced. I pledge that housing provision is the number one priority for the Government. It is the first item on the agenda. We must address the issue as the current position is not acceptable. We will address the issue and fix it. As the Minister of State working with the senior Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, it is number one on our agenda. The Department is now called the Department for housing and planning and that is what we are about. That is what we will try to fix with the help of the ideas suggested by Members, with whom we will work closely. We are preparing an action plan for housing that will be published in July at the latest. It should be ready before then. It will build on the considerable work already carried out and under way. It will also draw on the important work carried out by the special Committee on Housing and Homelessness which is due to submit its report to the Dáil shortly. I hope many of its recommendations will feed into the action plan. The plan will include actions to expedite and boost the supply of all types of housing, including social housing, rental accommodation, student accommodation and transient accommodation, to tackle the issue in the short term, medium term and long term. It will focus, in particular, on those experiencing most difficulty in accessing the housing and rental market. Many such persons are living in emergency accommodation, which is not acceptable. Emergency accommodation is not suitable in the long term and that is one issue we are trying to address. Both the Minister, Deputy simon Coveney, and I have initiated early engagement with those who have been working in the housing and homelessness area for many years to discuss the broad approach to be taken in the action plan. The Minister is on record as describing it as an "emergency", particularly in urban centres. I agree with him. We must and will tackle the emergency. The housing of families and children in unsuitable emergency accommodation is not right. It is not sustainable and certainly not a solution. The Government is, therefore, firm in its determination to take action urgently. In Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the Government set out a child-specific poverty target to reduce the level of consistent child poverty by at least two thirds by 2020. It is clear that only by adopting a whole-of-government approach can we hope to address the serious challenges posed in meeting that target. My Department, for its part, is working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to deliver on the commitment that every child should be safe and protected from harm, with a place to call home. We can all agree that is a target we must achieve as quickly as we possibly can. The fact of the matter is that the house building sector is struggling to get back on its feet. With the downturn in the economy, it came to a virtual standstill. That lasted for the best part of a decade both in private housing supply and also in the provision of local authority housing. We are trying to ramp up capacity again through the local authorities in order that they can have their own housing stock and not just lease or rent them. Their capacity to do this was completely and utterly removed and we must rebuild it as quickly as we possibly can. It has taken longer than we would have liked, but it is happening and we must expedite the process as quickly as possible. There is also under capacity in the private sector which is not delivering either. When I addressed the conference this morning, I said everybody had to play his or her part to increase the amount of housing stock. We must build at least 25,000 houses a year. In the next couple of years we will probably need 30,000 houses a year. Last year 12,500 houses were built, more than half of which were one-off houses outside Dublin. They were no addition in solving the crisis in Dublin. The target we must reach is building at least 25,000 houses a year and we must reach that target as quickly as we possibly can. After we deal with the emergency in housing provision, we must have a sustainable construction sector that will always be in the range of 12% to 14% of GNP, not in excess of 26% which is where it was or at a figure of 6% where it stands today. I addressed the issue of the availability of land for house building. Affordability must also be tackled. We must try to build houses at a price people can afford because there is no point in building houses such as some of the 4,000 under construction that are way out of the price range of most people and that will not help us to solve the problem.If people are spending most of their income on mortgages, they have a lot less money to meet the many other demands of life. This affects the real economy and people's quality of life and their ability to raise families. It also puts many working families in more precarious financial positions and at risk of homelessness, something we cannot allow to continue. The housing crisis is, therefore, affecting every sector of Irish society and putting at risk our hard-won gains in terms of employment, recovery of competitiveness and the attractiveness of Ireland as a placein which to work, live and grow a business.  It is important to recognise that we have made a start in addressing the problem. A €3.8 billion social housing strategy has been put in place. The problem is not the non-availability of funding but our inability to spend that funding quick enough to address the crisis. While additional funding will be required into the future, for now money is being made available to address the problem. We are also reforming Part V to make delivery of social housing possible and viable, many of which changes Senator Paudie Coffey, when Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, was involved in making. We are implementing a range of actions to tackle homelessness and putting in place rent certainty measures, thereby giving hard-pressed tenants greater stability pending an increased supply coming on-stream. We are lowering development contributions and putting in place a rebate scheme for housing at more affordable prices, from which Dublin and Cork will benefit. A vacant site levy is being introduced, although for legal reasons this cannot kick-in until 2019. However, the threat of its application will progress site development at a quicker pace. Revision of the departmental guidelines will also help in terms of the Department's work with NAMA and its plan to provide 20,000 new homes. These are all useful efforts to try to stimulate the housing market. The Government accepts that this is not enough and that it has not thus far helped to solve the problem. Simply providing money is not sufficient. We must drive the spend of that money, work with the local authorities and reform the planning system. The Part VIII system has been reformed, but it needs to be driven further with, perhaps, more changes required.

Reference was made to the local authorities being allowed to operate a one-stage system. Such a system is now in place in respect of a spend of under €2 million in the development of 12 houses. We need to encourage councillors to utilise that process. If that system is not enough and needs to be tweaked, we will tweak it. The previous eight-stage planning process under Part VIII has been reduced to a four-stage process. Again, if it needs to be reduced further, we will look at that issue. These issues are being addressed through the housing action plan.  I could go on and set out many of the other targets we hope to achieve, but that would only take up more time. I am happy to conclude at this point and allow Senators to continue the debate. We are open to all ideas.

As I said, we are unable to spend the funding currently available quick enough. I am unable to accept the amendment. The Government has an issue with linking rent with the consumer price index. We addressed that issue last night. The Government does not believe that proposal would bring the solution Sinn Féin believes it would bring. We need to have landlords involved. Public housing will not be sufficient to address the problem; we also need private housing and public and private landlords. What is proposed in the Sinn Féin amendment could damage thais. As I said, this issue was discussed last night. I am not interested in engaging in a row with the Senator or in forcing him to push the amendment to a vote. All of these ideas can be teased out in the weeks ahead.

This must be a new type of Sinn Féin-love. During his contribution the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, attacked Fianna Fáil which has not been in power for the past five years. At the same time, the Government is seeking the support of Fianna Fáil. Life does not work that way with me but perhaps it does in Sinn Féin circles. I congratulate the Minister of State on coming to the House with an open mind. He does not live far from me and I know that he is a hardworking Minister of State. He has listened to the proposals brought forward today, for which I commend him. However, there are a number of points with which I take issue, including one made by Senator Paudie Coffey. Having been Minister of State with responsibility for housing for some time, Senator Paudie Coffey will be aware that many of the problems that have arisen have nothing to do with money or the position in which the then Government found itself. The perfect storm was created. The spatial strategy which was fully implemented deals with only 20% of need indiscriminately across Ireland. The increase in the cost of building also occurred during the watch of the previous Government, 30% of which increase was due to increased regulation and oversight.

There was also no PRSI net available to builders if they got caught out badly, as many of them did. These measures and others such as the need for a 20% deposit have fed into the housing crisis. It is not sufficient for us to put our heads in our hands and say the crisis arose because of a lack of money and so on. All of the measures I have just mentioned have played a part in the development of the crisis. That is the reality. Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, referred on radio to the provision of a €200 million fund for infrastructure and the building of between 15,000 and 20,000 houses over three years. He then went on to say this money would not be available until 2017, which was a little confusing. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, would update the House on the matter. Perhaps I misunderstood what the Minister said, much of which is reported in today's newspapers. As mentioned by Senator Kevin Humphreys, it feels a little like groundhog day in Punxatawney, with the Government caught in recurring groundhog nightmares.  During the election of 2011 we were promised that the lack of social housing would be immediately addressed by the incoming Government. In 2014 the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, promised that 35,000 social houses would be built or leased long-term and that an additional 75,000 house rentals would be provided for. They are the facts, which is crazy. We were also told that 13,000 new builds would be delivered in 2015. These figures were off the wall. What did we get? How many new social houses were built by 2015? The answer is 75, although I may be one or two off the mark.

I will not be lectured by any party in power which does nothing to address an issue. I welcome the Minister of State's statement that rent caps will be reviewed. As has been admitted by several Ministers, manipulation of applications for rent supplement and so on is the norm. I appreciate that the Minister of State proposes to examine the issue.That is a step forward. At least if we address this issue, we can see where they are instead of merely going back to the welfare officer to make a decision on it, give additional rent support or whatever else. It is something that must be addressed. I appreciate the presence of the Minister of State. I appreciate his openness with us and listening to our different bits and pieces and recommendations.

We are looking at a multifaceted approach and there are just a couple of points I would like to make. My first point is about the local authorities. We expect them to provide all possible incentives to engage in development, both residential and commercial. There is a need for this to happen. However, I understand that in 2013, when Phil Hogan was Minister, guidelines were sent to every local authority with a request that they revise their development contribution schemes. Approximately one third of the 31 local authorities have failed to do so. In some areas in County Mayo where there had been, say, additional investment in water and sewage infrastructure one could pay up to €5,000 just for that aspect of one's planning contributions on top of the regular price in other parts of the county. The Minister of State referred to dealing with the issue of development contributions. If this circular was sent to the local authorities and the county manager failed to bring it before councillors for a democratic debate, bearing in mind that these development schemes were set up at the peak of the Celtic tiger era and that, in the case of County Mayo, it comes back to the discretion of the manager, that is no way to do business. Especially in the likes of County Mayo, the cost of development contributions is a deterrent to development and one should not have to go cap in hand to a county manager to ask him or her to do this or that. It should be done in a democratic fashion and those who are interested in developing should know where they stand, which, in turn, would encourage them. It is poor that this is the rate. I ask that this matter be taken up with the local authorities that have failed to deal with it to date. The other issue is the number of empty premises, particularly in town centres throughout the country. Much of the emphasis has been on the main housing crisis in the big urban centres, but there are housing problems throughout. Now that we are addressing them in an ambitious fashion, as the Minister of State described, similar to the Action Plan for Jobs, we must look at empty buildings in the middle of market towns. It is something about which I have spoken previously. Instead of leaving houses with a lot of architectural value empty when the last person on a street passes away - in rural areas, the problem is that people are building further and further out - we need to revitalise, repopulate and give a boost to small independent traders. The latter matter must be brought into it, because in talking about sustainable housing one is also talking about sustainable communities. The whole package must be brought to bear. There is a problem in that regard the length and breadth of the country and no matter how much we move towards full employment, in going into these towns many of which are market towns one will get depressed. I can well see how people would be because that is what one sees. When going around knocking on doors, I see it myself. It is something that must tackle and for which we must have a vision. I suggest that, rather than having developer-led initiatives as in the past, when sometimes there were incentives for development for which there was no clear market demand, we have a scheme to provide for an area in the centre of a town to be zoned in conjunction with the local authority in an holistic approach such that either an owner-occupier or a first-time buyer would receive either a grant or a tax incentive to buy such a property. We would be going back to having places where people would be prepared to live. When I travel to continental Europe and see lovely towns and villages, I often think they are not lovely by accident. They are lovely because they have had a lot of TLC. We should follow with amenities for these towns and villages - a playground or whatever else is needed. In the case of rural areas, we should have a vision whereby within a certain radius one can be assured that one will find an ATM and a GP. Not all of these facilities will be implemented overnight because there are other factors, including the difficulty in retaining GPs for various reasons. We have this vision, both urban and rural. That would be a way to go. We must also support independent businesses by helping them, as opposed to the large multiples such as Tesco and Lidl, with commercial rates breaks. The large multiples are a different animal altogether, yet they are all being charged rates pretty much with the same formula. When one thinks about it, they are a different animal altogether in terms of the market they control compared to the small independent traders which give vitality. Of course, the vision must mean that we no longer look at small towns and say we must have corner shops everywhere. We also must acknowledge that the retail sector has changed. I am going back to the point I made about communities. Housing and communities go together. Consumers are buying online. We create a different image and vision. This is the challenge, through debate, that we face. One of the objectives the Minister of State cited is having people stay in their own homes. From my experience, the practice of mortgage to rent and intervention by the local authority have not been the success one would have imagined. Much more attention could be given to that aspect. Then one would see benefits, with people being able to stay in their own homes. One issue raised this morning on the Order of Business - the problems linked with pyrite and mica - comes within the remit of the Minister of State. For those affected - both in County Mayo and County Donegal, although I would be more familiar with the position in County Mayo, especially pyrite in blocks - we all would like to think we know where this is heading - that people will get assistance. I understand the complexities involved, but they were overcome in the local authorities in Dublin and further afield. I heard about a case a fortnight ago in which the person concerned could not sell their house. It was only when they came to sell their house that the survey revealed the problem. I have heard of a couple of cases in which people could not afford to retain structural engineers to carry out the tests. The expert group needs to get out on the ground sooner rather than later. It was indicated that would not happen, perhaps, until September. It must happen sooner in County Mayo. The drum has been beating for a long time. Things have been looked after on the east coast; they need to be looked after on the west coast. We are talking about people's homes. In fact, if it is not sorted, they will be out of their homes and we will have another problem to deal with, aside from the stress they are suffering.  I ask the Minister of State whether he will be in a position, either now or at another point, to get back to me on some of the points made.

I am disappointed to say my local authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which would be considered to be one of the most affluent parts of the country, built six houses last year. There are 5,500 people on the housing list, many of whom are families. That is not a crisis; it is an emergency. Why are we all skirting? Everyone has used the word "crisis". Somehow, people cannot use the word "emergency". There seems to be a terrible fear that if we se the word "emergency", we will be opening up the floodgates. The reality is that local authorities have got away with it because they have not had a Minister on their case. I was first elected in 1999. I am aware of the frustration of councillors where county managers effectively run certain local authorities or where they are being told they cannot seek cash or sell other assets to deliver houses and where there are people, to use that horrible expression, "sofa-surfing".They are dragging their kids from house to house, sleeping on sofas rather than going into hostels in which, quite frankly, I would not put anybody. They have to walk from the suburbs to the city every day, being humiliated as they are asked to register as homeless. It is an insensitive and inhumane way of treating people. The local authorities have got away with it because the staff in the Custom House should have been on to them every week and month asking why they were not delivering. I will be brief as I am conscious of the time, but I want to make a few points. I want the Minister of State, if he has not already done so, to secure an audit of zoned local authority lands in every county and within them the lands zoned for critical infrastructure. He should ask why there is no housing on that land. Why is there resistance to the direct building of social housing as we saw built in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, of which we are so proud today?

Forget about the principle of selling or not selling. We will be forced to sell more houses than we are building. What guarantee is there that when houses are sold, new houses will be built? I am not sure I want local authorities buying affordable accommodation in the market as I want first-time buyers to buy affordable properties. My local authority spent €500,000 on a house that needed to be done up in Blackrock, County Dublin. People cannot buy these houses and we must get back to the principle of direct provision, building and maintaining quality houses while having pride in them. Will the Minister of State explain about the 500 modular houses? There was great fanfare last year about them, but where are they? There is none in my constituency. Councillors and members of the great political parties have consistently opposed social housing; therefore, why have the party hierarchies not hauled them in? They have taken the Whip and are members of these organisations; therefore, it should be indicated that it is unacceptable not to support the provision of social housing in communities. We do not divorce ourselves as a political body because we are in the Seanad, the Dáil or the council. If members are representing a party on the ground in the community, they must be held to account as to why they would not support the provision of social housing, in line with party policy and what is being espoused by the Government in the Houses of the Oireachtas. With the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, billions of euro of property has been sold at a knock-down price. At a time when we have a national housing emergency, we have allowed such properties to go to vulture funds. We tried to ask the Department how many houses were offered by NAMA, but talk about trying to get an answer. We asked how many apartments were made available and where. We were told NAMA had sold them. Why is there no pressure on it to have an audit of properties? It is ridiculous. There are major social consequences when people are not provided with a home and the dignity and comfort associated with it. There are social implications for children and there is exposure and vulnerability for families. There are also issues of child protection and safety, as they are hauled around the streets and into hostels before going back to councils, humiliated. We need to support people with other difficulties such as a disability and adult literacy problems who come to housing agencies. A woman came to my home two weeks ago saying she had approached a local housing authority three times, speaking through a plate glass about her social issues. She was asked to complete a form and it was an ordeal to complete that application. When she was asked to fill in the form, she went away - it was her third time to do so - as she did not know how to say she had numeracy and literacy difficulties. Nobody offered support or assistance in filling in the form. This is an issue about training and care. I do not want anybody to have to stand in front of plate glass speaking about their personal issues and circumstances. We need a more humane, understanding and compassionate system to deal with people. That is the reality. There are key issues that must be answered. We must do something. The really important point is that the Minister of State is newly responsible for housing. He and his staff must be on the case of all chief executives in councils every week, asking what is happening. We need to know, as this is more than a crisis. This is an emergency and must be treated as much.

This a society beyond crisis and in an emergency that is only growing. We have had an emergency for at least two years and it seems we have done nothing but grind to a halt. As public representatives, we have a moral responsibility to demand adequate resources to guarantee the provision of homes for people. Previous Governments failed miserably and ignored what was coming down the road. I have put this to both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, as they ignored an issue that was not rocket science, the lack of homes being built in the face of the growing needs of the population, especially in the Dublin region. Homelessness has hit thousands of ordinary families and our mindset has changed from the single man spoken about. The count was 109 last night. Our image has changed to ordinary families who have lived precariously but have had jobs, with children being comfortable and looked after. When jobs were lost in the downturn, they lost their homes because of greed, increased rents and a lack of social housing. Many people will have to wait at least ten years for such housing. As another Senator mentioned yesterday, I am concerned about the mental health and well-being of the 2,000 children in emergency accommodation. As an experienced councillor engaged in a mental health profession, I see people come to my clinics every week. Children who are seven, eight or nine years old are beginning to suck their thumbs again. They are beginning to be incontinent and doubly incontinent again. Most tellingly, they have gone dumb and cannot speak about their distress and anxiety. They are reverting to infantile behaviour and refusing to continue to walk, jump and play. They are sitting in a corner, dumb. Day in and day out they are being reared in prams. They have to get out of accommodation during the day, roam the streets and be accepted, quietly, at night, as if they are an embarrassment to the owners of these hotels. There are thousands of so-called hidden homeless who are unaccounted for in box rooms throughout the State. Every family with a spare room have offered their daughter, son, friends or other family members the space of box rooms. This cannot go on as it is an emergency and we must treat it as such. Let us stop using the word "crisis". We are public representatives and accountable to those in dire need. Let us stand up to the plate. Fianna Fáil had a good discussion about women's refuges and we must take the issue in the context of the Women's Aid report. It contained horrific findings of the damage and destruction - physical, emotional and mental - caused to women and children. We must ensure there is adequate financing and resources for people caring for women and children in such cases. I ask Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to stop shouting from the rooftops, as they so eloquently do in some of their speeches, and support the amendment moved by Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, with the motion on rent certainty to prevent homelessness. It would go some way towards mitigating the increase in rents by linking them with the consumer price index. I do not have much more to say.The democracy of local authorities, promised by the former Minister, Phil Hogan, in Putting People First, An Action Programme for Local Government, is not evident in the mandate of councillors, especially when it comes to housing. Local authorities have been starved of finance and personnel in recent years and that has made things difficult. In the local authority for which I worked there is a 12-week turnaround time for housing, which is quite good. I think it is similar throughout the country. My suspicion is that because this is coming from Fine Gael it is a question of disinvesting in public services, whereas I want to invest in them. I do not want the disinvestment that will lead eventually to privatisation which is the ideology of those to my right.

It is as if our colleagues in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael woke up this morning as born again social democrats with a lifelong commitment to investment in housing. The reality, however, was not a dream, it was a nightmare born out of an ideology of the hard right, that the State does not need to invest in housing any more, that it can leave it to the marketplace. That is what Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael did and the result was social catastrophe. Let us remember how we got here. Having said that, if we are serious about endorsing new politics, this is the first test: is this an exercise in rhetoric or are we serious? If we are serious, we should all be able to agree not just on the motion, for I commend Fianna Fáil and which is well worded, but also on the amendment. If we are not serious about tackling the issue of rent certainty, we cannot say we want to tackle the housing crisis. If we can endorse the motion and the amendment, we can speak with a united voice and be serious about bringing about real change and challenging the Government on housing. Otherwise, it is an exercise in rhetoric.

Much good has come out of this debate. We can all look back with hindsight, but it is a case of looking forward, although we have to learn from the mistakes made by all concerned. Who in this room can say they have not made mistakes or done things they might regret today? I agree with Senator Máire Devine that this is an emergency. We throw out statistics: tonight 2,121 children will sleep in emergency accommodation, 1,700 in this city alone, but, as the Senator said, behind each of them is a family. We can only look in horror at what the repercussions will be in years to come. There are two ways to tackle the emergency. First, we could introduce emergency measures such as increasing rent allowance, which is all we can do. There is no silver bullet solution to the housing crisis. We need a strategy and a vision. In my county we talk about the number of hectares zoned for housing. How much of that zoned land could be built on tomorrow? How much infrastructure is in place? In my county there is a serious shortfall. Without the required infrastructure, zoning land is a waste of time.  Second, we must explore what type of housing we need. Families today are much smaller than they were 20 or 30 years ago. There are more separations and cases of divorce; partners move out and need accommodation. These are all factors. We need to consider long-term leases for property. For a long time the mentality was that renting a house was a short-term measure, for six months or a year. Now people can end up renting for 20 years. Families need to be protected. Perhaps we need legislation to give them long-term security in order that they will know where they will be and will not receive a letter one day telling them they have two or three months to vacate the property.  I was at a conference last weekend at which a gentleman quoted a statistic from the Central Statistics Office that every week 200 houses were put out of commission. That is a frightening statistic., of which I was not aware before then. What do we do about it? Do we tax those properties or do we give the owners an incentive to bring them back into commission? We need to consider all of these issues. The tenant purchase scheme is back in vogue, whether we like it, and we can argue about its economics. Those in Part V housing are precluded from purchasing their houses. The Minister of State might consider this.

I thank Fine Gael for supporting the motion. It means a lot that this House is passing the motion on an agreed basis. As Senator David Norris said, this sends a very clear signal that this House is prioritising housing and homelessness. In her very eloquent contribution Senator Máire Devine said how important the issue of homeless children was. In my work I have come across the infantile behaviour to which children are reverting. I have seen children who live in buggies and have not developed their core strength and cannot walk at the correct time. This lack of development will work against them later in life and we should take this into consideration, too. It is an emergency. Senator Paudie Coffey referred to the timing between the granting of funding and delivering housing units. The children referred to do not have that time. We should seriously consider some system to take care of them. I think it was Senator Collete Kelleher who referred to a system for tracking them. That is a very good suggestion and we in Fianna Fáil would support it to monitor them as they move through the system. Senator Paudie Coffey referred to the Part V requirement. He mentioned the provision of cash in lieu of abiding by the requirement. I admit that it was perhaps a mistake and we hold our hands up. However, I put it to him that moving the requirement from 20% to 10% will have the same effect as accepting cash in lieu. The Minister of State might reconsider this.  Senators Paudie Coffey, Michelle Mulherin and Frank Feighan referred to urban regeneration. Senator Frank Feighan reflected on his experience of growing up over a shop. Many generations in Ireland were reared on main streets, above shops. I support what Senator Michelle Mulherin said, that perhaps we might consider a tax incentive for first-time buyers and owner-occupiers to come back into towns and villages and live over shops or take over terraced houses. There could be a grant for them to upgrade these properties to bring them up to modern living standards. Senator David Norris referred to how vulture funds had put people out of their homes, which is something at which the Government should look. It was mentioned by another speaker that a four-year window would close rapidly. That will present its own problems in a few years time. Senator Michelle Mulherin referred to the pyrite problem in the west. The matter has not been completely resolved on the east coast. In my constituency of Dublin Fingal there is a serious pyrite problem. I have met families who bought starter homes but who cannot move owing to the pyrite problem. Some families want to remain in their starter homes, but they want to carry out home renovations and add extensions to accommodate their growing families. Unfortunately, they are unable to carry out such works until the pyrite problem is solved. People have put their lives on hold for ten or 11 years at this stage. I urge the Minister of State to look at the matter and make sure people will no longer have to keep their lives on hold. Senator Trevir Ó Clochartaigh said Fianna Fáil had a brass neck to table the motion. The only brass neck in this Chamber belongs to Sinn Féin. As my colleague, Senator Aidan Davitt, has pointed out, Sinn Féin is in power in local authorities in Dublin, yet the party has done nothing.

Now that more families are falling into the homeless cycle, the focus has moved from rough sleepers who have high needs and are highly dependent. I ask the Minister of State to address the matter. Senator Rose Conway-Walsh referred to Fianna Fáil and its lack of investment in families. I point out to the House and the Senator, in particular, that Fianna Fáil introduced special needs assistants and increased child benefit. We also introduced a free pre-school year that levelled the playing field for children from low-income families, something of which we are very proud.
