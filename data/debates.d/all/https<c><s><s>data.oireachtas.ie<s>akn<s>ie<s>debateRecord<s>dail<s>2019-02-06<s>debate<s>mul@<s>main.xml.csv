#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, Deputies and staff as we begin another day's work on behalf of our people. I remind all speakers that there is a six-and-a-half minute time span for each question with 30 seconds for a Deputy to introduce a question, two minutes for a ministerial reply, one minute for a supplementary question, one minute for a ministerial reply, one minute for a final supplementary and one minute for a final response from the Minister. I ask all Members to stick rigidly to the time in order that we can get through as many questions as possible.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	In light of Brexit being only six weeks away, what contingencies and supports are being put in place by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to safeguard farmers and the agrifood sector in all scenarios including, and in particular, a hard Brexit?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I have been addressing the immediate Brexit challenges through a range of budgetary measures aimed at improving competitiveness and developing market and product diversification.  These measures include a €150 million low-cost loan scheme in 2017 to help reduce farm gate business costs and a dedicated €50 million Brexit package in budget 2018, which included further additional funding to Bord Bia and Teagasc, as well as a contribution to a €300 million Brexit loan scheme, at least 40% of which is available to food businesses. In budget 2019, I announced a €78 million Brexit package for farmers, fishermen and food SMEs to cover additional costs related to Brexit. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, also announced the future growth loan scheme, which will be rolled out in 2019 and for which I had made provision of €25 million in 2018. The scheme will provide long-term unsecured investment finance for farmers and small-scale companies in the food and seafood sectors. On market and product diversification, the additional funding I have provided to Bord Bia has been used, inter alia, to provide targeted advice to individual companies, as well as to conduct a market prioritisation exercise that is now informing our approach to market diversification activities, including the choice of destinations for trade missions. Product diversification also has been supported through additional funding of €8.8 million to Teagasc to develop its national food innovation hub and funding to support investment in the prepared consumer foods sector.  I, and my officials, have been working hard for some time to sensitise other member states and the European Commission to the potentially highly severe impacts of Brexit on the Irish agrifood and fisheries sectors and to the likelihood of specific supports being required to deal with these impacts. Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan last week to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agrifood and fisheries sectors. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU's readiness to respond and support Ireland and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves.  As regards contingency planning, my Department has been actively participating in the whole-of-Government approach to preparedness and contingency planning. We have fed into the overall Government contingency action plan, which was published on 19 December, and we have been working closely with colleagues in other Departments and agencies to address, in particular, the requirements that will arise in relation to the implementation at ports and airports of import controls on agrifood products coming from the UK. These requirements are significant and arise in respect of the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. Work in this regard has been focused on three key areas, namely, infrastructure, staffing and information technology and in three key locations: Dublin Port, Rosslare Port and Dublin Airport. Throughout all of this work, the focus of the Department will continue to be on the need to discharge its legal responsibilities while ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trade.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	Most of the Minister's response to my question is old news in the sense that it is the same response we have been getting for two years, particularly with regard to market diversification and the loan schemes that have been put in place but which, in many ways, have not been delivered up until now. The response does not give any sense of the urgency associated with the fact that we are six weeks away from a potential hard Brexit or set out the measures being taken to ensure that the agrifood and farming sectors are protected in the event of a hard Brexit. As things stand, businesses do not know what the arrangements will be in six weeks' time. They are being left to try to prepare as best they can but without clarity from the Minister or his Department in regard to the financial supports that might be available. In the beef sector, for example, €750 million worth of tariffs could potentially be placed on our beef exports to the UK, which would amount to, on average, €400 of tariffs per animal. That is a scary vista for the agrifood sector. We need clarity from the Minister on what preparations are being made and what we can expect in six weeks if no deal is reached in the interim period.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	Our endeavours to date have been to build resilience within the sector. We have invested in measures such as the environmental efficiency programme in the beef sector announced this week and restoring cuts to the areas of natural constraints scheme while working with the industry on the food innovation hub, the prepared consumer foods initiative, the meat technology centre and low-interest loans. That is building resilience within the sector here. The premise of the Deputy's question seems to be that preparedness can mitigate all of the impacts of a hard Brexit; it cannot. The situation will change irreversibly once the UK leaves the EU. We hope that it leaves with a transition agreement and future trading relationship in place. However, even if we get to that optimum position for its departure, the situation will never be as good as it currently is. In addition to building resilience inside and outside the farm gate, we have engaged with all of our EU partners to create awareness of our exposure, which is unique in terms of its extent relative to other member states, and to prepare them to respond. The Deputy mentioned the issue of tariffs. Unfortunately, we do not currently know what the response of the UK will be - tariffs, no tariffs or something in between - and that limits our ability to protect the value of the market. Until that becomes clear, it will not be possible to respond in a meaningful way. I am satisfied that we have prepared the groundwork in terms of latitude to the State and EU awareness in terms of the common organisation of the markets regulation and exceptional aid measures in order to be able to respond as needed.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	Of course, preparedness cannot mitigate all of the massive disturbances that Brexit will bring but that is no excuse for not being fully prepared. Unfortunately, it seems that although the national message has been that we must prepare for the worst but hope for the best, the approach of the Government over the past two years has been to spend far more time hoping for the best than preparing for what might happen in six weeks' time. There has been minimal engagement by the Government with the agrifood sector in terms of giving any clarity on what to expect in six weeks' time in the event of a hard Brexit. That has simply been absent from the Government's preparations on this issue. Last September, following a Cabinet meeting in County Kerry, the Minister and the Taoiseach announced that 300 sanitary and phytosanitary inspectors would be employed in order to be prepared for Brexit. That was later downgraded by the Minister to 116. As of today, we do not know how many will be in place by the end of March. That is another reflection of the fact that we are not particularly prepared for Brexit. Over the coming days, we need absolute clarity on what the agrifood sector is facing and how it will operate in terms of revenue and standards after 29 March in the case of a hard Brexit. We also need a clear plan on how we will respond in terms of market supports and maintaining our trade to the UK market in the event of a hard Brexit.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	The accusation that there has been no engagement with the industry is entirely wrong. I understand why the Deputy might make that charge but it is entirely wrong and the industry would not support such a contention. There has been extensive and ongoing engagement and consultation on an almost daily basis with various aspects of the industry. The Deputy is seeking clarity in respect of what the impact will be but, unfortunately, no such clarity exists. It entirely depends on how the UK responds when it leaves the EU. We have prepared insofar as we can for all eventualities, including action on exceptional aid measures, State aid flexibility etc. On contingency planning and preparedness, if the UK leaves without a deal we will be in a position to meet all our obligations in terms of treating the UK as a third country and how we deal with imports from there. One must bear in mind that we are the biggest trading partner of the UK agrifood industry. All of the staffing arrangements needed to meet our obligations in regard to the necessary portal inspections for agrifood products, animal products and by-products of plant and animal origin, including portal inspectors, veterinary supervision and so on, will be in place by the required date at the aforementioned locations of Rosslare, Dublin Port and Dublin Airport.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	It took almost nine minutes to deal with that question. Even for Priority Questions, six and a half minutes is the maximum allowed. As Brexit is a very serious issue, I was reluctant to intervene. However, I appeal to Members to stick to the time limit of six and a half minutes.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	One issue on which there is certainty is that there will be a new Common Agricultural Policy. Farmers need details of what that will involve and what new schemes are being developed to look after them into the future. That is particularly the case in regard to Pillar 1 because we know there will be changes involving a new environmental section to replace the greening measures. We need details of how that will work, particularly in the context of the current GLAS schemes. I ask the Minister to provide details of the plan. We need to address the nuts and bolts of the policy at this stage.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	Under the draft CAP 2021-2027 proposals, each member state is required to submit a CAP strategic plan by 1 January 2020. The new delivery model proposed by the European Commission is performance-based. All schemes under Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 are to be delivered under a single plan. In recognition of the climate change challenges facing the EU and its international commitments in regard to climate action, the new CAP proposals outline a greater environmental ambition post 2020. The development of the draft CAP strategic plan will be a complex process involving a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis, a needs assessment, scheme design, an ex ante evaluation including a strategic environmental assessment and an appropriate assessment. My Department is currently tendering for the ex ante evaluation of the draft plan, which is an integral part of the process. Another key element is stakeholder and public consultation. My Department has concluded a series of external stakeholder events and sought public submissions on the draft CAP regulations in January 2018. I hosted a series of public meetings in February 2018 and a national consultative conference was held on 4 July with all key stakeholders following the publication of the Commission’s legislative proposals. The Department also held a series of meetings with key stakeholders. The next stage of formal consultation is under consideration and its timing will be related to the progress of discussions on the proposals. This consultation may involve requests for written submissions, stakeholder forums and meetings with individual stakeholders. We expect to hold formal public consultation at several stages of the process. In the meantime, the Department will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders and interest groups through existing forums and structures to update them on the progress of discussions and to hear their views. Most recently, on 22 January my officials updated Oireachtas colleagues at a joint meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Rural and Community Development. My Department will continue to work towards meeting the 1 January 2020 deadline in tandem with continuing discussions between member states and the European institutions regarding the funding of the next CAP and the detail of the current draft CAP regulations, including in regard to the CAP strategic plan. 
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	The Minister is basically telling us that a tendering process is in place to appoint a consultancy firm to develop the plan and that it will be the subject of consultation. There is less than a year to get the contingency plan ready and we need to act quickly to get something in place. I ask the Minister to provide detail on what is envisaged, particularly in regard to Pillar 1. Many farmers have concerns about whether regard will continue to be had to reference years that date from 20 years ago. Will that continue to be the case? Will payments be based on the level of activity engaged in almost a quarter of a century previously? A greater level of certainty is required. What will be done in regard to convergence and how quickly will that be progressed? As the Minister is aware, many farmers currently receive a very low basic payment based on what they were doing in the year 2000. Those payments must be increased in order to allow farmers to protect the family farm. On biodiversity, the Minister mentioned the issue of greening and environmental concerns. Some farm organisations have raised, for instance, the issue of the keeping of bees as a livestock unit. Has that been considered?
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	The Deputy will have a further minute to respond.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	Are there matters such as that which need to be considered under the CAP?The Minister may smile but we need to consider how we move things forward because many farmers are concerned.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I have not heard of bees as a livestock unit, but biodiversity and environmental sustainability will be a much more central element of the next Common Agricultural Policy. The regulations as published require us, in getting to a strategic plan, to do a SWOT analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for Irish agriculture. This analysis also places an obligation to carry out a needs assessment for Irish agriculture into the future and to have an external evaluation of that process and of those two steps. That is why we are going to have a consultant look at what we have done, which itself is as a consequence of engagement with stakeholders. It is a complex process involving external oversight, with a consultant looking at what we are doing, but ultimately it is an issue that will be signed off by the Department, in consultation with stakeholders. I have heard that criticism of the reference years, but looking at agriculture and entitlements today relative to 20 years ago, they bear little or no resemblance. Bearing in mind that, under the CAP, more than €100 million will have moved from farmers with high per hectare entitlements to farmers below the average level of entitlements, it is my view, which is contained within the document as published, that that journey of convergence will continue. It will be external, in that other member states will be looking for a greater share of the cake, and internal, in that, whatever the size of cake we get, there will be greater convergence. I have heard some people mention upward-only convergence, which baffles me to an extent as something of an oxymoron. There will be a continuation of the journey of convergence, however, which represents a greater equalisation and sharing out the spoils of the Common Agricultural Policy between all farmers.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	What plans are there for Pillar 2? GLAS has been a successful scheme, to some extent, but many farmers want certainty into the future. They are concerned that in Pillar 1 there is an element of environmental measures and actions in that regard. What actions are going to be left when a person enters GLAS? We need to be at the stage of getting some certainty on this and on the level of payments that will be available. One of the big criticisms of GLAS is that the level of payments, compared with the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and other schemes in the past, was significantly less for the actions that the farmers had to take.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	I accept that the continuation of that environmental ambition that GLAS has will be part of the next CAP, whether it is a GLAS 2 or a different structure. The Commission says the new CAP will be performance-based with payments approved on the basis of quantifiable outcomes. In terms of the journey of continuing greater sustainability and climate-friendly policies in agriculture, it appears the Commission is looking for quantifiable outcomes upon which payments will be based. The Deputy would be equally critical of me if I were to be overly prescriptive now when we are doing a SWOT analysis and a needs assessment, and if I were to say this is how it was going to be. We will do the SWOT analysis and needs assessment, we will have that oversight by the external consultant, and we will engage with stakeholders. We need successors to GLAS-type schemes and beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, type schemes so that we can continue the journey. It will be an accelerated journey in the new CAP.

Since that time, which is 253 days ago, there has been no political engagement whatsoever by the Minister, despite the fact that, on that evening, he was presented with an alternative which I believe would have been acceptable to the European Union. There has been no engagement with the sector or with the spokespersons in this House, with only an interview with a national newspaper trying to apportion blame.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	As the Deputy is aware, on 20 March 2018, I signed into force the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2018, SI 89 of 2018. However, SI 89 was annulled by Dáil Eireann on 29 May 2018. SI 89 would appear to be the first SI to be annulled in the history of the State. Given this complex situation and combined with the infringement proceedings taken against Ireland by the European Commission, I requested legal advice from the Attorney General on the matter. This advice has been received and I am considering the next steps with my legal advisers. The EU Fisheries Control Regulation 1224/2009 and the European Commission Implementing Regulation 404/2011 introduced points systems for serious infringements of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, committed by the licenceholder of a fishing vessel and, separately, the master. These are intended to complement sanctions and promote compliance and were required to be in place on 1 January 2012. Both regulations went through the ordinary legislative procedures at EU level, which would have included widespread consultation with interested parties, including the member states, advisory councils, NGOs and the fishing industry. The matter has also been discussed at industry liaison meetings over the years. The EU regulations are highly prescriptive in relation to licenceholders, leaving little room for further negotiation. Ireland is facing EU infringement proceedings for non-implementation of the required EU points system. In addition, the European Commission has formally notified that all or part of the EU interim payments related to control and enforcement, worth €37.2 million in EU funding, may have to be suspended indefinitely until Ireland complies with the requirements of the control regulation and implements the required EU points systems. I am fully committed to delivering on Ireland's legal obligations in this regard at the earliest possible date.
#PatTheCopeGallagher	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-party	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-dob	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	Will the Minister state in his reply when he got advice from the Attorney General? There has been no consultation, despite what he is saying. The Minister must show respect for the Members of this House whose support he needs to ensure we get a statutory instrument. He made no response in his reply, despite the fact that in his interview with a national newspaper he said he was going to introduce primary legislation. Threats from the European Union or from the Minister do not work. The fact is that he and his predecessor had to go to the Supreme Court, and we know what happens there. We do not have enough time to discuss that. We want to ensure that the case is proven beyond reasonable doubt and that the individual has a right of appeal. That was not allowed for, despite what the Minister may say. I ask him to consult the spokespersons and other Members of this House. I wish to make it very clear that there is no Member of this House, in particular in my party, who does not want to put either the 2009 or the 2011 regulation into effect, but we must ensure that it is fair and equitable and that there is a right of appeal. It cannot be bulldozed through this House. We hear that there is a problem with €37 million. That is the very money that the European Union and the Commission want to put into an emergency fund and to suck it out of it. The Minister has to protect the industry and the fishermen. He should let us know when he got the advice from the Attorney General and should not hide behind him.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	I do not hide behind anybody. The purpose of this statutory instrument is to deal with serious infringement. It is not an issue, as the Deputy knows, that should be a concern to the industry as a whole. As he undoubtedly also knows, serious infringements are not widespread in the industry. We are working with the Attorney General's advice, which was received in late 2018, and it is under consideration. The Deputy will also be aware that the choices are to activate the 2016 statutory instrument, which has been approved by this House, or a variation of the 2018 statutory instrument. They are the matters that are under consideration.
#PatTheCopeGallagher	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-party	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-dob	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I point out to the Minister that we have no difficulty with a penalty points system. There is the issue of common courtesy, and I was first elected to this House in 1981. Not once did the Minister's office even acknowledge that it had received what we describe as the amended statutory instrument which would be acceptable. This failure to provide an acknowledgement is a total insult to me and to other Members of this House. In saying that this was the first time a statutory instrument was annulled, does that mean it was wrong, that we did not go along with the common statutory instruments being placed before the House for 21 days? We are in new politics and we are representing the interests of those, but the Minister is prepared to bring in legislation that does not give a right of appeal to the individuals and does not go to prove an issue beyond reasonable doubt.I have asked the Minister to state the date on which he received the advice and the position on the primary legislation he was going to introduce.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	The points system is for serious infringements. I received the Attorney General's advice in late 2018 and it is under consideration. We have consulted extensively. The Deputy knows, although it may not suit his purpose in the Chamber, that there has been considerable engagement with him and the Fianna Fáil Party leader on this matter.
#PatTheCopeGallagher	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-party	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-dob	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	The Minister has not consulted. He should not try to suggest to the House that he did. I came with the facts.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	Has the Minister seen and read Veterinary Ireland's Policy Document on Fur Farming 2018? It is extremely significant because it recommends clearly that there be an immediate ban on the farming of mink and similar wild animals for the production of fur. Veterinary Ireland joins a chorus of opposition. I am sure the Minister hears this every Tuesday when there is a protest outside the Department calling for an end to fur farming. According to a poll conducted by RED C Research, those concerned are in line with the 80% of the population in Ireland who believe there should be a ban on fur farming.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	My Department has statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of farmed animals under the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2010 (Statutory Instrument No. 311/2010) and the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. In that regard, Irish fur farmers are subject to the same animal welfare legislation as other livestock farmers. A review of all aspects of fur farming in Ireland was commissioned in November 2011. The terms of reference of the review group were: to review fur farming in Ireland, taking into account existing legislative provisions for the licensing of mink farming; to comment on the economic benefits of the sector; to consider the effectiveness of existing welfare controls; and to make appropriate recommendations. The review group invited submissions from the public and interested parties and considered over 400 submissions. The group concluded that it did not find the arguments in favour of banning the farming of fur animals in Ireland compelling and recommended that instead, fur farming be allowed continue under licence and subject to official control. I accept the findings of the review group and its recommendations. On foot of its deliberations, my Department introduced more rigorous controls on licence-holders in the areas of animal welfare, animal accommodation, security and nutrient management. Licensees are subject to regular inspections, including unannounced inspections by departmental officials. Notwithstanding the position in a number of other European countries, given the recommendations of the review group, there are no plans to introduce a ban on fur farming in Ireland. My Department has drafted new codes of practice for fur farming, the requirements of which include that each fur farm must have its husbandry plans signed off on by its private veterinary practitioner.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	I could have told the Minister that he would say that because, unfortunately, that is what he has said repeatedly, word for word, in response to every question on this issue for a long period. Will he take into account the policy of the expert, Veterinary Ireland? It states it is not possible to farm mink in a way that is not incredibly cruel. It has a very useful table outlining the conditions of mink in the wild: they are solitary animals; have territories ranging between 1 sq. km and 3 sq. km; are semi-aquatic; and stereotypes do not occur in nature. By comparison, farmed mink live in close proximity to other mink and cannot avoid abnormal social contact. They spend their entire lives in wire-mesh battery cages, typically measuring 90 cm by 30 cm by 45 cm, and cannot run, swim, dive or hunt, preventing them from exhibiting basic natural behaviours. Depriving them of swimming water is the equivalent to the stress caused in being deprived of food. There are 200,000 mink at any one time in Ireland. Some 150,000 are killed per year. There is no way this can be done in a way that is not barbaric to produce what is only a luxury product made for profit. Does the Minister accept that he should change the position he has held from 2011 and accept that fur farming should be banned?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I am aware of the report from Veterinary Ireland to which the Deputy alludes. I am aware of the review that took place and the improved regulations the Department has introduced in this area. I am also aware of the employment in the industry, a fact that is rarely commented on. I do not have any imprimatur by virtue of the programme for Government or a mandate from the people to proceed by way of closing down what is a legitimate, highly regulated and inspected industry. I take account of the points made by the Deputy and the view expressed by Veterinary Ireland and a host of others, but, ultimately, I have to take into account the regulations and rules, including domestic and EU law. I must adjudicate, based on the enhanced regulations we have introduced, on what is, on balance, the most appropriate way to proceed. Neither on the basis of the programme for Government nor the Government's election do we have a mandate to proceed along the lines advocated by the Deputy.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	Studies such as the ISPCA's Fur Free Ireland indicate that there is no substantial permanent employment associated with fur farming. If there was to be an impact of a ban on fur farming, I would be in favour of measures to ensure it was counterbalanced and offering opportunities to those affected. While it is not in the programme for Government and the Minister might not want to ban fur farming, he is not going to be able to escape this issue for long. We have a Bill which seeks a ban on fur farming and which is listed as being at First Stage. We will be taking it on Second Stage before the summer recess and there will be significant public campaigning on it. It has been designed to make it absolutely clear that fur farming is illegal. An EU directive states no animal shall be kept for farming purposes, unless it can reasonably be expected that, on the basis of its genotype or phenotype, it will be kept without a detrimental effect on its health or welfare. Under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, mink farming is arguably already illegal. Our legislation will simply aim to clarify the position.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	As the Deputy is aware, we are obliged to operate within EU legislation and our own animal welfare legislation of 2013. Since the review was conducted, we have, in fact, strengthened the legal framework within which fur farmers operate. According to figures I have seen, about which I cannot be definitive, there are in excess of 100 people working in the industry in Ireland. That cannot simply be disregarded as an irrelevance in the context of what the Deputy is asking for. Other countries have paid substantial compensation to close down fur farms. Other countries have banned fur farming, although they never had it. Such a measure is used to prove or maintain momentum in this area, but it is not as simple or straightforward as the Deputy suggests.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	The meat and dairy herds are to Ireland what the coal industry is to Poland and the fracking gas industry is to the United States, namely, a short-sighted cash generator, the expansion of which is undermining the chances of survival of the planet and the people of the global south and in less than a generation the people of the global north. We are food insecure in Ireland. We have been a net importer of food since 2000. The climate is changing as a result of our agricultural policy. What is worse is that we are not preparing for the change. Why is the Minister not moving away from the monoculture that threatens agriculture?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	The analogy between Irish agriculture and the coal industry is rather unfortunate. Ireland has a comparative advantage in grass-based, carbon-efficient livestock production. The European Commission Joint Research Centre report of 2010 found Ireland was the most carbon-efficient producer in the European Union per unit of dairy production and the fifth most carbon-efficient producer of beef per kilogram. Notwithstanding this, inherent challenges remain for the sector in contributing to Ireland's climate change and renewable energy targets. It should also be noted that policy development regarding the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has seen the decoupling of CAP direct payments from livestock numbers since 2005. The Government's current policy position for the agriculture sector is an approach to carbon neutrality that does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. There are three strands to my Department's approach to carbon neutrality: reducing agricultural emissions; increasing carbon sequestration; and displacing and substituting fossil fuels and energy-intensive materials. An example of my continued focus on ensuring the lowering of the carbon footprint of the agriculture sector is my recent launch of a beef environmental efficiency pilot scheme specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of the beef sector. Sequestration has a key role to play in reducing the carbon footprint of the sector. My Department has made a significant investment under the forestry programme. In 2018, €106 million was made available by my Department to support afforestation and other forest initiatives.The sector also has a key role to play in the supply of biomass materials, adopting energy efficiency measures and renewable technologies on farm, as well as on-site energy generation, all of which can provide profitability gains which underpin the sustainable production system. My Department continues to review options that will enable farmers to transition to a low-carbon economy. The recently published Teagasc report, An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030, is key to informing the type of measures on which we need to focus into the future to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of the sector. While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland's climate change and energy targets in the years ahead.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	The report dating from 2010 on the green credentials of the dairy sector which has been cited by the Minister for years was rated only satisfactory in terms of the reliability of its data. Saying we produce beef and dairy products better is like saying we frack gas better. Both the beef and dairy sectors and the gas fracking sector are disastrously carbon emitting and must be significantly scaled back if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally. In terms of being climate or environmentally friendly, the Origin Green farm sustainability and quality assurance scheme is starting to look like a joke. Origin Green certifies companies which routinely show up on the Environmental Protection Agency's worst offenders list for regulatory compliance issues such as pollution and wastewater offences. I have not seen any scientific evidence which shows that the beef data and genomics scheme has anything to do with reducing emissions significantly. If the Minister has any empirical evidence to that effect, I would like to see it.

This morning I spoke to a farmer and meat producer from Limerick. His name is Noel O'Connor and he told me that beef farming was on the brink. That is a direct by-product of the Government's decision to increase the size of the dairy herd.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	If the Irish agriculture sector was transposed lock, stock and barrel to the United Kingdom, France, Germany or any other industrialised country where the average profile of emissions is about 10% of its total, it would halve the equivalent of what the United Kingdom and other countries are at. We are leaders on our journey to sustainability. Deputy Wallace argues that the livestock sector and the dairy industry are akin to fracking or the coal industry and that we should dismantle the herd. What would be the purpose of dismantling a carbon-efficient system that can and must do more when we would only see product displacing it on supermarket shelves with a far higher carbon intensity? What we must do in our production systems is become more and more efficient. We must drive down the carbon intensity per unit of output and maximise sequestration through afforestation and appropriate soil management. As the third leg of the three-legged stool, we must ensure the displacement of non-renewable energy sources in the agriculture sector.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	Even the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and the Taoiseach are coming around and seeing sense in terms of the fact that we must deal with our emissions problem.

I am not talking about doing it overnight, no more than the Poles are going to stop taking coal out of the ground overnight, or the Americans will stop fracking gas. We must move to a better place and change how we do agriculture. The agriculture sector is worth saving. It is the only strong, indigenous industry, but the Minister is going down a cul-de-sac with it, unless he starts to take remedial measures and move in a different direction. It just does not make sense. He can deny it until the cows come home, but the way we are going is just not sustainable.

However, I acknowledge the limited potential in the agriculture sector. We will squeeze out every piece of potential to drive down the carbon footprint and make the industry more efficient. The Deputy comes from the constituency of Wexford where the agriculture industry thrives in the dairy, beef and tillage sectors. His vision would see the rural economy of County Wexford become a wasteland.

#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	I wish to ask the Minister about the commencement of the beef environmental economic pilot scheme. Have the terms and conditions of the scheme already been drawn up and issued to suckler cow farmers? Has agreement been reached with the mart co-ops on the weighing of animals for the scheme and will he make a statement on the matter?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	I launched the beef environmental efficiency pilot scheme on 30 January. The launch was covered in the agriculture media. Applications for participation in the pilot scheme will be accepted from Monday, 4 February to 22 February. The terms and conditions and information on the process and application procedure are available on my Department's website. The procurement process for the field service provider is ongoing. The necessary infrastructure will be in place prior to the opening of the timeframe for the submission of weights on 8 March. The beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, scheme is a targeted support for suckler cow farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the economic and environmental efficiency of beef production. This is done by measuring the weaning efficiency of suckler cows. Building on the success of the beef data and genomics programme, the data collected will also be a valuable addition to Ireland's already impressive cattle breeding database. The beef environmental efficiency pilot scheme was announced in budget 2019 as part of the €78 million package for the agrifood industry. As well as clear environmental and climate benefits, the scheme will provide for farm gate investment at a time of market volatility and uncertainty related to Brexit. I am conscious that 2018 was a very difficult year for beef farmers in terms of weather conditions, fodder issues and market volatility. This is the sector most exposed to Brexit, given its reliance on the UK market. The initiative has been designed to provide an injection of investment at a critical time for farmers in navigating the challenges ahead, while delivering in real terms on our climate objectives. The funding of €20 million available will allow for payment up to a maximum of €40 per calf, based on costs incurred and income forgone. If the scheme is oversubscribed, a linear cut may be applied. It is a pilot scheme for 2019 only, Exchequer funded and operated under state aid de minimis provisions. The pilot scheme has been designed to be as straightforward as possible and ensure the majority of the payment can be retained by the farmer. Application will be open to all beef suckler herdowners. The terms and conditions and information on the process and application procedure are available on my Department's website or the beef schemes section of my Department.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I thank the Minister for his statement and clarification. He knows as well as I do and Deputy McConalogue, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and others that beef farmers are under enormous pressure. While I welcome the opening up of the scheme which was something Fianna Fáil pushed for in the confidence and supply agreement, it does not go far enough. The sum of €40 per calf is a start, but it is way down on our bottom line of €200 per calf. In terms of implementation of the scheme, what will the arrangements be for access to the weighing scales? That seems to be an issue for many farmers. Has an arrangement been made and has the position been clarified? We must consider the reintroduction of the beef suckler cow welfare scheme.That is a very important issue for beef farmers and it should be looked at again in the context of the difficulties facing that sector currently.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	The infrastructure will be in place, including the weighing scales. We will have a nationwide network of scales to be provided by the successful tenderer. That process will commence on 8 March. The ambition, about which I am confident, is that the hiring out of those weighing scales or the use of approved weighing scales by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, if they are owned or available elsewhere, will enable the scheme to deliver the maximum amount of funding to the farmers who apply. We expect that the fee for hiring the scales will be in region of €50 or less. Farmers can pick up the scales, bring them home, run their cattle through the crush and weigh them as they step on the scales, record the data and send them in to the Department. Payment will then issue before the end of the calendar year. We expect to be making payments in December 2019. I note the Deputy's point about it not being enough but this must be taken in the round, in the context of the improved funding for the ANC scheme over two years. The Deputy will appreciate that funding for that scheme had been reduced but I will not go into the history of that now. I also note the Deputy's continuing support for the concept of €200 per cow but I did not see that in his party's alternative budget.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	We must ensure that this is a simple scheme. If farmers are going to be tied up in red tape and facing issues with regard to scales and so forth, that will be a turn off. Given that the figure involved - €40 - is deemed to be very low by the farming community, many farmers will opt out. Another issue of concern in my area is the fact that the application process is online. Unfortunately, in my part of the country access to broadband is very poor. Roscommon is one of the worst counties in terms of broadband access and we need to see the urgent roll-out of the national broadband plan. Has the Department put something in place to ensure that all farmers, including those who do not have broadband access, will be able to get details of the scheme, including the closing date for applications? It is crucial that we address those issues. What are the Minister's plans for the scheme if it is over-subscribed?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	On the last point, if the scheme is over-subscribed it will require a linear cut. We expect the participation rate to be similar to that for the BDGP which, at 500,000, would allow for the payment as envisaged under the scheme. If it is over-subscribed, it will require a linear cut across the board. On the issue of simplicity, the scheme is very user-friendly. All that farmers need to do to apply is send their name, address and herd number to the Department. That can be done online or by paper application. That deals with the issue of online access. I would point out that with a lot of co-operation and effort on the part of individual farmers and farming organisations and a lot of work by my Department, last year we achieved 100% online applications for the basic payment scheme. Farmers are seeing the benefits of applying online. In the context of this scheme, there is a paper option for applying to the scheme and for submitting the data. It can also be done online or by way of an app.

Under the current CAP, the BPS payments were limited somewhat but the greening payments were not limited. What is the Minister's policy on capping and will it include greening payments this time, as well as BPS payments?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	The new legislative proposals for the CAP for the period 2021 to 2027 were launched on Friday, 1 June 2018 by the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan. The proposals as drafted involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. There will be some additional discretion for member states in configuring the measures available within parameters laid down in the draft proposals. The proposals are complex and we are now in the middle of intensive and challenging negotiations for the next CAP to run from 2021 to 2027. I am working with the European Commission and other member states to shape these proposals into an effective new CAP. The new proposals allow for subsidiarity for member states but with an overall commitment by the European Commission to protect the common policy and avoid distorting the Single Market.  I have already indicated that I am open to considering some level of capping. Ireland has already applied the maximum level of degressivity allowable under the current regulations for payments over €150,000. The new proposals include a number of measures designed to move further in this direction including an overall mandatory cap of €100,000, degressivity for payments above €60,000, a complementary redistributive income support and the convergence of payments towards a minimum of 75% of the average payment per hectare nationally. These are currently draft proposals only and my Department is examining them carefully to assess their potential impact on applicants and to ensure that any such mechanisms can be implemented without undue complexity. The new CAP proposals point to a more significant environmental ambition than the current CAP schemes, including in Pillar 1. It is a new departure for member states to be required to design a specific climate and environment scheme in Pillar 1 but this is something I support. It is consistent with my Department's long-term strategy for the agriculture sector, which recognises the critical importance of environmental sustainability. Protecting the environment and the sustainable development of agriculture are two sides of the same coin. There are also proposals for new conditionality requirements with an increased number of good agricultural and environmental conditions and statutory management requirements included in the draft proposals. It is essential that the new environmental conditionality is implemented effectively with common standards that are relevant and effective.  Farmers play a vital role in the provision of public goods and need to be adequately recognised and recompensed for this role. It is important that the overall level of the budget acknowledges the public goods being delivered by farmers. This places a particular focus on environmental aspects of CAP.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Negotiations on the CAP proposals are continuing under the Romanian Presidency. The Presidency has outlined its ambition to achieve a partial general approach at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council of Ministers meeting in June. I will continue to work closely with my European colleagues on these issues with a view to achieving the best possible outcome for Ireland's farmers and agriculture sector.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	A lot was said but nothing was said by the Minister. Let us go back to basics here. Originally there was no cap under the single farm payment scheme. Then the single farm payment was broken down into two payments, with 70% under the BPS and the remaining 30% under greening. As the Minister said, in the very complicated language of the reply, there was a limit placed on that of €150,000 that applied only to the 70% but not to the 30%. I have a simple question for the Minister to which I seek a simple and straightforward answer. Is the Minister in favour of capping both the basic farm payment and the greening payment? If so, what cap does he propose for the combined single farm payment and greening payment? If not, is the Minister in favour of continuing with the situation as it stands, where all of these payments are based on something that happened in 2001 that might have no relevance to the current situation of the farmer?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	I appreciate that Deputy Ó Cuív may have had other business to attend to earlier but I already had a discussion with Deputy Martin Kenny on the reference years issue. It is not fair to say that the reference years are an anachronism because the system has moved so much in terms of convergence. In fact, in the period of the current CAP, more than €100 million will have moved from farmers with a higher than average per hectare payment to farmers with a lower than average per hectare payment. There is a requirement in the current draft proposals to get to a situation where every farmer has at least 75% of the average per hectare payment in the lifetime of the next CAP. We are on a journey that is going to see greater convergence and equalisation and I do not have any difficulty with that in principle. The Deputy asked a very simple question as to whether I am in favour of capping, which I am. I do not have a difficulty with the new proposals on that. However, I am engaged in a process of consultation and in that context, it would be unfair to be overly prescriptive about my own views on this. We are doing a SWOT analysis now and we will be doing a needs assessment of what would be best for us in the future. We will have an ex ante evaluation of both of those processes before we complete our CAP strategic plan. As a general principle, I do not have a problem with convergence and capping. That said, we need to be careful about unintended consequences. There was an issue during the term of the last CAP in the context of convergence, whereby some people had a high per hectare payment but a low gross payment. Some farmers found that their payment of €12,000 or €13,000 went down while payments to others with a big gross payment of €20,000, €30,000 or €40,000 went up because they had a low per hectare payment. We need to avoid unintended consequences in our quest to have a fairer CAP.

On average, nobody should have been getting more than €400 per hectare. That is what the Minister's own nitrates information, which he gets every year, tells him. Can we go back to the question I want the Minister to answer? In the context of capping, is he talking about the BPS only or the BPS and the greening payment because the greening payment was excluded from the capping on the last occasion?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	There is no greening in the current proposal.

Can he confirm that there will be no greening payment and that it will all revert back into a single BPS? If we are talking about capping, will it include the total payment?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	My understanding of the regulations as currently drafted, and the Deputy will appreciate that there is political engagement around all of this detail so it is impossible to be definitive about what the final outcome will look like from this juncture, is that in terms of the CAP generally, there will be far greater environmental ambition. Part of the CAP strategic plan will have to outline our proposals in respect of Pillar 1. A specific cohort of the payment under Pillar 1 will depend on environmental obligations but it is not the same as the greening provision as currently contained. I have said that I have no difficulty in terms of convergence and capping. What I am anxious to avoid are unintended consequences where there are casualties and there were casualties the last time around. What I am anxious to do is minimise those casualties in the context of the journey with capping and convergence continuing.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	With the agreement of Members, I will revert to Question No. 8 in the name of Deputy Heydon.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	The estimated impact of Brexit on the movement of horses and the equine industry in general is a significant source of concern. What protections can be provided to the industry? As the Minister is aware, the tripartite agreement between Ireland, the UK and France allows for the movement of and trade in horses between countries without the need for veterinary inspections or-and health certificates. This could be greatly challenged by a no-deal Brexit. Are there any contingency plans?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I appreciate the Deputy's ongoing interest in this issue. Ireland has a strong reputation for the quality of its horses and the quality of its horsemanship. The current EU rules on the movement of horses between EU member states require that the animals being moved are inspected by an official veterinarian and accompanied by a veterinary health certificate issued under the EU TRACES system and that a horse passport is issued by an approved horse passport issuing body. However, these rules also allow member states that have implemented alternative but equivalent health control systems in their respective territories to grant one another derogations from the standard movement rules. The derogation provided for under Community rules on the movement of horses is applicable to movements between EU member states only. It is not inclusive of movements between the EU and third countries. Currently, Ireland is part of a tripartite agreement with the UK and France that allows for the movement and trade of horses between the three countries without undergoing veterinary inspections and without health certificates. As the agreement is based on EU legislation on the movement of horses within the EU, the UK cannot be part of the agreement once it becomes a third country. The current focus of our no-deal contingency planning is on the arrangements that will be necessary for the Department to fulfil its legal obligations with respect to import controls on live animals and agrifood products as efficiently as possible while also ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trading arrangements. As part of this planning we are upgrading existing border inspection posts and developing additional border inspection posts to cater for the increased volume of inspections necessary, including in respect of equines being imported from the UK, and making arrangements to facilitate the certification of horses to the UK as necessary.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	I thank the Minister for his response. As he outlined, the concern involves what happens when the UK becomes a third country and the impact of that, be it a no-deal scenario or a more managed way. The impact on the equine industry in Ireland could be akin to the effect on the beef sector because the Irish and UK markets for the breeding and racing of horses are so interlinked. If there was no deal at the end of March, it would be far more difficult for Irish horses to travel to Aintree the following week for the Grand National festival. Later that month, we want the best of the English horses who have been successful in Cheltenham to come and contest in Punchestown. A couple of weeks later, we are into the height of the breeding season. Some of the top stallions in the world are found in this country and mares will be travelling to and from this country so that concern is there. Our racing and breeding industry is worth well in excess of €1 billion to this country and jobs in this sector are core economic jobs across rural Ireland. Might we need to look at the relaxation of state aid rules to support the industry? We need reassurance that the Department stands ready to help the industry in every way possible.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	The Department has had extensive and ongoing negotiations with the industry and the Commission on this matter. I raised the subject with Commissioner Hogan on Monday of last week in Brussels. It does not just affect the thoroughbred sector because the horse sport sector also sees very considerable volume. I saw figures recently suggesting that anything up to 30,000 sport horses outside of the thoroughbred sector move east to west on an annual basis. The issue with regard to the thoroughbred sector is complicated by the fact that there is all-island administration of racing through the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board and there is an all-island stud book for the thoroughbred sector. It is complex. We are looking at ways to facilitate that. There will be some additional administrative obligations but we are trying to make the matter as simple as possible to ensure that movement can continue because that is critical to the industry here. I am very conscious that it is a highly mobile industry and that anything that is perceived as an impediment could be to our disadvantage if it is not resolved. We are looking for clarity in many respects on a range of issues where none is immediately available because we do not know what the UK's response is but we are committed to working with the industry to make the new arrangements relating to when the UK becomes a third country as user-friendly and efficient as possible.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	I am delighted to hear that the Minister is open to working with the industry across the board whether it is the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association or racehorse trainers through Horse Racing Ireland. I ask that the Minister and Department work with all key stakeholders in the industry to look at initiatives that could help those who will be impacted both in the short term and long term so that we safeguard an industry that is crucially important and provides thousands of jobs across rural Ireland in many areas that do not have a significant amount of other economic activity. That is what our racing and breeding industry is worth to us and we need to make sure it is protected in every way possible. I thank the Minister for his response.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	I acknowledge the Deputy's ongoing interest in this area. Given where he is from, it is a critical issue. We have had extensive engagement. It is an issue of which we are very aware. It will involve change to the current arrangements but we are endeavouring to make those as user-friendly and efficient as possible.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	We spoke earlier about the beef and dairy sectors and the many indirect forms of emissions, pollution and damage to the environment they may cause. The carbon sequestration through afforestation programme, which has expanded alongside the expansion of the dairy herd in an ill-thought-out attempt to promote another short-term cash crop, is supposed to help dig us out of our emissions problem. Can the Minister explain how this might help?
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	Government policy on forestry is to incentivise private planting of forests given the many economic, environmental and social benefits that forests are proven to deliver. More recently, we have amended this policy to increase species diversity within the national forest estate and increasing afforestation levels across all planting categories supported with higher rates reserved for broadleaf species. Under the current forestry programme, new species have been added to the mix to create more diversity and to target climate change mitigation. Sitka spruce occupies 343,311 hectares or 51.1% of Ireland's total forested area.As one of our fastest growing tree species, clearfell typically takes place between 35 and 40 years. It has been grown successfully for over 80 years and it has proven itself to be one of the most productive coniferous species grown in Ireland and, as such, has become the industry’s mainstay in terms of timber processing and end markets. In terms of end use of trees, roundwood harvesting, including firewood, in 2017 was 3.54 million cu. m, the highest level since records began. The majority of this timber was harvested from Sitka spruce plantations. Of this total, 42% was used for energy purposes, making an important contribution to our renewable energy targets. The balance was used to produce 1.05 million cu. m of sawn softwood, mostly for construction, 0.14 million cu. m of round stakes for fencing and 0.84 cu. m of wood-based panels. In 2017, exports of forest products from the Republic of Ireland were €423 million, an increase of 11.3% on 2016. Wood-based panels accounted for €224 million with the balance comprising paper and sawn timber exports.  As regards the use of pesticides, insecticides and fungicides, there is a relatively low use of these products in the forestry sector. Chemicals may only be used that are statutorily approved as safe to use in forestry by the regulator.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	The evidence coming my way is different. Forest management in Ireland is in crisis and we are creating another environmental disaster by doing what is immediately, financially and politically expedient rather than what is good for the people of our country, the Irish environment and the future of the planet. We have the second-lowest tree cover in the EU after Malta, which means we need to dramatically increase our forest cover but over-reliance on conifer-dominated forestry plantations, in particular Sitka spruce, is unsustainable. These are dark, dead forest plantations designed to be felled for profit. It is not safe to enter a forest because of the dependence on chemicals, despite what the Minister said. One would not want to anyway, as they do not support any flora or fauna, they destroy water quality and they acidify soils. Why does the Department not support more sustainable native tree cover initiatives, which are better at absorbing pollution and converting it to carbon? They do not require fertilisers or pesticides, unlike current commercial non-native tree plantations.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	The Deputy has made a lot of assertions and claims that are completely unfounded. It is wrong to say that spruce does not sequester carbon and a life-cycle analysis of spruce conifers, as compared with hardwoods and broadleaf trees, shows that they are the same in this regard. The mid-term review was approved last year. The Directorates General responsible for the environment and agriculture scrutinised the proposals and approved them. They include a requirement that all plantations contain a species mix, including up to 15% broadleafs. There needs to be up to 15% biodiversity with setback areas away from streams, rivers, roads and houses. In acid-sensitive areas, water has to be tested for four months before any plantation can be approved. The Deputy should check out his facts before he makes assertions such as he has made. Does he not accept that this has been a major contributor to the rural economy? Trees sequester carbon. Moreover, we have acceptance from the main farming bodies that growing trees are an essential part of their overall effort.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	92	We are probably reading different research. The Minister of State should send his to me and I will send mine to him. John Murray of the Murray Timber Group has gone on record to say:Sitka spruce, while there seems to be an awful lot of talk about monoculture, is the equivalent of a Friesian cow - that's what it does for the industry. The nearest performer, as a native Irish cow, produces one third of what a Friesian produces - I know the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA ) would be up in arms if they were told to change all of their cows to that.Mr. Murray may not have intended to do so but he actually nailed what is going on. He is saying that Sitka spruce is a monoculture. It is destructive but it is currently profitable, much the same as in the monoculture of dairy farming, which is destructive but profitable for the time being. The IFA and the timber industry have both told the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine what is what. Any consideration of what is not profitable but which may be good for the future of farming, and any consideration of the value of our surroundings or the world we live in, is completely off the table as long as the agribusiness giants are telling the Department what do.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	I am not sure if the Deputy has heard of the efforts to promote the bioeconomy to replace the fossil economy. I visited Finland last year, where 73% of land cover is in three species of forestry. We sometimes forget that conifers include native Scots pine and Douglas fir. The three species in Finland are birch - which is a broadleaf hardwood - Scots pine and Norway spruce. They have developed a circular bioeconomy and are replacing all sorts of fossil-based product with bio-based products.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	Are those species native to that region?
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	No. Norway spruce is, but Scots pine is native to this country. Birch is one of the bigger broadleaf species.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	Are we planting Douglas fir?

This could be vitally important in providing employment in the off season and in the angling season. In order for it to develop, we would need a quota. There is a catch and release programme but there has to be a quota to develop, yet the Department is dragging its heels when it comes to making that happen.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	100	Ireland has not made a specific application to Europe for a commercial bluefin tuna quota. The available bluefin tuna quota is allocated each year to member states on the basis of relative stability as established in the late 1990s. At the time, Ireland had no track record of commercial fishing for bluefin and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.  The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve reducing the shares of those EU member states which do have quota and for whom bluefin is an important commercial fishery. A small bluefin by-catch quota is available to Ireland, primarily for use in our important northern albacore tuna fishery and the Celtic Sea herring fishery, where there can be bluefin tuna by-catch. This by-catch quota is also available to other member states of the European Union.  While obtaining a viable commercial quota is unlikely in the short to medium term, I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that during the negotiations for the new management plan for bluefin tuna in the east Atlantic, Ireland was successful in introducing a clause allowing countries without a commercial quota to set up a catch-tag-release fishery. This will allow for the gathering of scientific data by trained tagging operators. My Department is currently working with the Marine Institute and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, as well as the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which has policy responsibility for recreational angling, to establish a pilot project for such a fishery in 2019. I believe that this fishery will be most beneficial to Ireland, as it will increase our knowledge of the behaviour and abundance of bluefin tuna in north-western waters, while also providing a small but valuable tourism benefit to peripheral coastal communities such as those in Donegal Bay.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	101	There is no doubt that the tagging quota gets over the short-term problem of not having a quota but that is all it does. The quota is for tagging and scientific research but not for the tourism industry, which is vitally important. The by-catch quota is something like 100 tonnes.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	102	It is 60 tonnes.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	103	This is in comparison with a European total of up to 8,000 tonnes. One would think that, given the value we give to Europe in terms of fishing rights, Europe would be able to reciprocate with a quota of 50 tonnes or 60 tonnes to allow fishermen to work in the off-season and to allow the development of an important industry in coastal regions, standing alone rather than related to scientific research.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	104	For clarification, we are putting in place a catch-tag-release fishery, which will facilitate the angling tourism product to which the Deputy referred.The allocation of a permanent quota is made through the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, ICAT. The European Union is one of, I think, nearly 50 participating bodies in the negotiations for the allocation of a tuna quota. We do not have a European Union allocation of a bluefin tuna quota because we do not have a track record in that regard. If we were to seek to open up relative stability, the basis on which quotas are allocated, it would undermine, in the first instance, our approach to the Brexit negotiations, which has been to leave the Common Fisheries Policy and relative stability as issues to be negotiated in the next round of negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy and remain focused on our core interests. Seeking a quota would be akin to a member state with no mackerel quota at present seeking one and looking to open up relative stability on that basis. The Deputy will appreciate the analogy. I am sure he would hear a lot from his constituents about it if Ireland was to be seen to accede to such a request. Effort is a critical issue and relative stability a key policy plank, but we do not intend to open up negotiations at this point. What we are doing is facilitating the recreational angling industry which I know the Deputy is interested in promoting in his area but which also has potential in other areas along the western seaboard.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	The Minister's example of the mackerel quota might have relevance if mackerel were swimming up to piers in countries that did not already have quotas. This brings us back to the situation in Iceland, where it is dealing with mackerel it already has, but the fact is that people can sit and look out their windows and see where the bluefin tuna are. The reality is that if we are to allow our fishing, costal and rural communities to develop, we must have a dynamic system that can accommodate it. I do not believe the Minister would open up the relative stability issue for the sake of a quota of 40 tonnes of tuna because that would be a way of kicking to touch so as to ensure nothing could happen. That is the real problem.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	We do have a by-catch quota which is necessary for those who fish for albacore tuna and those involved in herring fisheries. We have a by-catch quota of 60 tonnes, but we do not have a designated bluefin tuna quota.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	I was delighted to receive a presentation on the strategy for the inshore fisheries sector, 2019 to 2023, from the chairperson of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum at our meeting last week. I welcome the first industry-led strategy as it marks a major milestone in the work of the Inshore Fisheries Forum. Since its inception in 2014, the forum has developed initiatives which seek to protect the future of a sector which is extremely important for coastal communities. I understand the strategy was developed through an extensive and inclusive process which included both industry-focused and wider public consultation. The strategy identifies a vision for the inshore sector, that it "will have a prosperous and sustainable future delivered through a united industry with a strong influential voice". The strategy also sets out 14 objectives for the sector which are grouped under four themes. The objectives cover many issues, ranging from improving the management of fish stocks to strengthening the sector's representative structures, to improving the attractiveness of the sector as a career path to attract new entrants and retain current talent. Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, will lead implementation of the strategy in partnership with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, particularly to target financial support available under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund to where it can be used most effectively. I look forward to launching the strategy with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum in the coming weeks and, in the medium term, to seeing the output achieved through implementation of the strategy.

The fleet is a significant employer, not just in fisheries but also in marine tourism, processing and transport. What plans does the Minister have to conserve the resources that are available and attract new entrants into the industry?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	110	I appreciate the scale of the industry to which the Deputy refers because when I meet representatives of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, they come with all of its constituent members in the north-east, north-west, south-west and south-east regional forums who all bring a unique perspective to the work of the national forum. The Deputy will be aware of the potential. We recently took a decision to prohibit larger vessels from fishing in inshore waters. I think this is the first time there has been a recognition of the potential and the opportunity now available for the sector to reclaim these waters as their exclusive territory. They generally fish in smaller boats which are not equipped to move out beyond them for safety reasons. There is a real opportunity for the sector, in all of the regional forums but also at the national forum, to present a product of the inshore that is marketed as sustainable in working with all other State agencies on how it can be progressed to deliver maximum value and in also working with Departments and local authorities on the infrastructural investment required to improve port and landing facilities. There is real potential in that regard.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	111	I welcome the Minister's comments and his exclusion of larger boats from the six-mile zone. It makes a significant difference. In County Louth the razor clam, lobster and crab and cockerel fisheries in Dundalk Bay are all of huge importance locally. I look forward to the Minister's launching the report and his visit to County Louth in the near future.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	112	I appreciate that it is a significant opportunity. It is now for the industry to grab it by the scruff of the neck. For many years it has been in the shadow of the larger fishing industries and the established producer organisations which do great work for the larger sectors, but this is a unique sector which has potential to create employment in local communities. The establishment of the strategy is key to driving the sector's potential.

Half of them are earning less than €10,000 a year and three quarters less than €20,000. In the past year alone they have seen prices go down by 20 or 25 cent a kilogram, or nearly €100 a head. There is phenomenal pressure, on top of which is Brexit which also exerts huge pressure. Beef farmers believe their needs are not being met. Will the Minister outline how he will address them?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	114	I am fully committed to supporting the beef sector. I am conscious that 2018 was a difficult year for the suckler beef sector, particularly in terms of unprecedented weather events which resulted in increased input costs owing to fodder shortages. We must also acknowledge the exposure of the sector to Brexit impacts. One of the unique strengths of the agrifood sector has been the shared vision in Food Wise 2025 for its sustainable development. I hope this positive engagement will continue. I have used the beef round table to highlight the need for stakeholders to recognise their interdependency and support the sector through an examination of mechanisms to add value along the supply chain and increase the strength of all links in the supply chain. For example, officials from my Department are engaging extensively with stakeholders in promoting the establishment of beef producer organisations. In budget 2019 I secured €20 million for a new beef environmental efficiency pilot scheme targeted at suckler cow farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production. I launched the scheme on 30 January. The scheme is open for applications until 22 February and I urge suckler cow farmers to apply for it. Further details are available on my Department's website. My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler beef sector, in preparation for the next iteration of the Common Agricultural Policy. I am committed to ensuring suckler cow farmers will continue to receive strong support under the CAP. My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler cow farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system. The new beef environmental efficiency pilot scheme complements the existing beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, an agri-environmental measure which is specifically targeted at improving the genetic merit of the suckler cow herd which provides beef farmers with some €300 million in funding during the current rural development programme period. It is also envisaged that suckler cow farmers will be the primary beneficiaries of the €23 million ANC increase which I secured in budget 2019. Other supports available for suckler cow farmers under the rural development programme include GLAS, ANCs and knowledge transfer groups. Suckler cow farmers also benefit from the basic payment scheme and greening payments under Pillar 1 of the CAP. National farm survey data suggest suckler cow farmers receive support equivalent to approximately €500 per suckler cow on average, taking all of the schemes mentioned into account. I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler cow farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, is appropriate for the continued development of the sector.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	116	I do not think the Government should underestimate the level of public anger at the spectacular cost overrun in the development of the national children's hospital. We learned today from The
Irish Times that senior officials from the HSE and the Department of Health discussed potential cost overruns almost a year before the date on which the Minister, Deputy Harris, says he was informed of rising costs, in August 2018. The bottom line is that we need to know where was the political oversight of this project. This is the Government's flagship capital project. It is the largest ever project in the history of the Department of Health and the HSE. Are we really being asked to believe that the Minister, Deputy Harris, was not kept informed that costs were rising dramatically? What information was flowing to the Minister in respect of this project between the autumn of 2017 and the autumn of 2018, when he acknowledges that he learned of the issue? If he did not know, why did he not ask? Why was he not insisting on regular updates from his own officials who were directly involved in the process? We are told that the Minister became aware of the significance of the issue, if not the final figure, in late August 2018, yet this information was not passed to the Minister for Finance until 9 November 2018. This is a scenario that I just cannot get my head around. The Minister for Finance, namely, the person in charge of the purse strings of the State, as part of a collective Cabinet decision signed off in April 2017 on a project at a cost of €983 million. We are being led to believe that the next he heard of any change was in November 2018, over a year and a half later, when he was given the news that the direct build cost of this hospital had increased by €450 million, on top of the other costs involved, bringing the overall bill to €1.7 billion. This begs the obvious question as to what supervision did the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and his Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have over this massive capital project. In the meantime, a budget was being negotiated between September and mid-October. Expenditure allocations for 2019 were agreed and published on budget day. Allocations for current and capital spending were published without this massive overrun being factored in, despite at least one Cabinet Minister being aware of it. Throughout September and early October, there was intense engagement between officials from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and directly between the two Ministers, Deputies Harris and Donohoe. Not only were they discussing the budget for the Department of Health for 2019, both current and capital; they were also discussing the massive overrun on the current side in the Department of Health in 2018 which, as we know, ended up at €655 million. I cannot envisage a scenario in any company in this country where a senior manager in charge of a capital project, on becoming aware of a massive overrun, would not inform the finance director of the company. We need to know the consequences for other projects. This will go far beyond some projects being delayed by a few weeks or months. The €100 million that has to be found this year is only the beginning. Multiples of that will have to be found over the next four years. I ask the Minister to inform the House of those consequences and to tell us when we will know the facts. What is being done to reduce the cost of this project now? What does this say about the competence and capacity of the Government to deliver on other major capital projects, not least the national broadband plan, for which half a million homes and businesses are waiting?

That was the right decision to make.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	154	The Minister has not dealt with the elephant in the room, which is the lack of any political oversight over the single largest capital project in the history of the Department of Health and the HSE. Why is it that officials representing the Minister, Deputy Harris, knew for up to a year that the cost of this project was spiralling through the roof before it was even brought to his attention? That is what we are led to believe. Why is it that the Minister for Health himself, on learning that this was a major issue in late August 2018, allowed a budget to be brought into the House and prepared against a backdrop of not knowing that this was going to manifest itself by way of hundreds of millions of euro of an overrun? We have a Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who was represented on the board but who also happened not to be told. The Minister, Deputy Harris, says his officials told the officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in October yet the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, was not told. Does anyone talk to anyone in this Government? This is all over the place and meanwhile, there is no certainty that the costs associated with the project will not climb further and further. What reassurance can the Minister give to the House and to the people that the costs are going to be reined in and that efforts will be made to reduce the cost of delivering this project?

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	157	I thank the Deputy for his follow-on question. The political oversight here is clear. It is not correct to state that officials knew that costs were spiralling out of control for a year before this. The issue of the costs in 2017 - the increase in costs of approximately €60 million to €62 million - is a separate issue to what we are dealing with here. We must be very clear to separate these issues in order that we can actually understand what has happened here and what led to the decision the Cabinet had to take in December of last year.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	158	The Minister, Deputy Harris, did not inform the House.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	As soon as the Minister, Deputy Harris, was informed at the end of August or beginning of September that there was the potential for a significant overrun here compared with the outline figure in 2017, intensive work was done, while the gross maximum price, GMP, process was happening, to crystallise what those costs might be before the process came to an end. When that information was understood at the beginning of November, it was given to the Minister, Deputy Harris, who immediately made sure that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was informed. From then until December, when the Cabinet made its decision, work had to be done to make sure we knew exactly what had happened in terms of the scale of the costs and how it would be managed by future budgets. The issue was brought to the Cabinet in December for decision as to where to go from there. The decision was taken to proceed with the hospital and to then have an intensive investigation into how this happened

This afternoon will see hundreds of general practitioners, GPs, protesting outside the gates of Leinster House due to the lack of investment in primary care and the Government's failure to reverse past cuts to GP fees. The Psychiatric Nurses Association is today stepping up its industrial action through an overtime ban in advance of a three-day strike by those nurses next week. At the same time, we have the worst hospital waiting lists in Europe and last month, more than 10,000 patients spent time on trolleys in hospitals right across this State. To top it all off, we have the national children's hospital fiasco; a project that is now €450 million over budget. This all adds up to a health system in a state of absolute and utter chaos. The situation in respect of the national children's hospital has descended into the realm of farce. This morning we learned from The Irish Times that senior officials from the HSE and the Department of Health who sat on the steering group for the hospital were flagging the soaring costs in respect of the children's hospital from October 2017 and almost every month after that. The Minister still maintains he was not informed or made aware of the costs overrun until August 2018. That time lapse does not sound credible but even if we do take the Minister, Deputy Harris, at face value, that does not explain why it took until November for the Minister to bring it to the attention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe. Not once was the issue of an overrun mentioned and even in November, he did not personally tell the Minister of the €500 million overrun in that area. Can that be explained to us? The Minister, Deputy Harris, did not open his mouth about this project's cost overrun of €500 million for three months. It is utter madness, and shows the dysfunctionality in those Departments and at the heart of the Government.  The Taoiseach tweeted this morning: "We can get this project back on track." While we know that the Taoiseach is very much a man of spin rather than substance, what does that tweet mean? Is he suggesting that the figure he announced when he was Minister for Health, that of €637 million, would represent the project getting back on track? Alternatively, does he mean the figure of €982 million we were expected to believe would be the cost of this hospital or is it the €1.43 billion that is now suggested? Will that figure increase further? Is he suggesting that we are going to rein back costs on this project? The public does not have confidence in the Minister or the Government in this area and there must be accountability.  Any of the myriad of issues I raised at the beginning is bad enough in itself but combined, they are an illustration that there is something seriously and fundamentally wrong when it comes to health. The fact is there is incompetence and dysfunction at the top of the health service. It is crying out for direction and leadership and has been for many years. When will the penny drop with the Government that the Minister for Health is simply not up to the job? 
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	165	It is true to say that we face many challenges in our health sector today but we have a fantastic health service. It is fantastic because of the people, doctors and nurses up and down the country who work on it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	166	They are all on strike.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	167	The first issue the Deputy raised was that of the strike action happening at the moment. It is a very serious disruption for patients up and down the country. Tomorrow will see the second full-day strike of this week. Psychiatric nurses are also reducing their hours, and there is also an issue about GPs. We know that nurses are not taking this position lightly because we know how much they care about the patients they look after. In situations such as Storm Emma, we saw that they went above and beyond the call of duty to look after their patients. However, the Government does not take its position lightly either. We have to think about the potential outcomes that might arise if this cannot be resolved in an appropriate way. Contingencies have been put in place, which is important for people in the health system today. We have to think about how we can catch up on time that has been lost but we have done that before. We must bear in mind our responsibility to the public finances. We cannot jeopardise the current public service pay agreement. We cannot risk other strikes in other parts of the public sector and cannot endanger the important agreement we have at present, which is essential to the security of our public finances. It is true to say that it is important in the context of Brexit being on the near horizon; we are still working on contingency plans to deal with that issue. The belief of the Government is that we can find a resolution to this issue. It is very important that we do so quickly because of the escalation in action that is happening over the course of this week. On the issue of the children's hospital, between the end of August or the beginning of September, when the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, was made aware that there was the potential for significant overrun with the capital costs of this project and November, when the figures finally crystalised, he was getting to the facts of the matter. He was not working on innuendo or what he might believe but sought to understand the scale of the problem. When he understood the scale of the problem, the situation was relayed on the same day to Cabinet colleagues, including the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Work then began on what decision had to be made, how it would be made, and what the consequences of the decision might be. Since that decision was taken by Cabinet in December, we have discussed this issue publically. There has been full transparency and accountability around that, but there is also a process in place, including the work of the Joint Committee on Health, where the Minister is answering questions by Deputy Pearse Doherty's colleagues on this topic in detail.

Where was its responsibility or that of the Minister when it came to the overrun on the national children's hospital, running to €500 million of taxpayers' money? Where was the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when it came to one of those major capital projects that has now been beset by massive overruns? The Minister has spoken about the Government's responsibility when it comes to nurses but when it comes to a capital project such as this, it is clear that both Ministers were out of their depth, asleep at the wheel and kept in the dark by senior officials within their own Departments. We learned in The Irish Times that the assistant Secretary General told the board in May that it had to go to the Government. It is incredible that the assistant secretary general would not have told his own Minister that there was a serious overrun. It is worse that the Minister, Deputy Harris, did not once, over August, September or October, a time when he was in direct negotiations with the Minister for Finance around a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Health worth hundreds of millions of euro and a budget for 2019, tell the Minister for Finance that there was an overrun on this project. This Minister is out of his depth and not just on this issue. It is the fact that he has forced tens of thousands of nurses to take to the streets. It is the fact that people cannot go to their GPs today because they are on strike and are protesting outside these gates. It is the fact that people cannot get beds in our hospitals. It is the fact that we have hundreds of thousands of people-----

At the time in question, the GMP process was still under way, so the full facts of the matter were not established.The responsibility of the Minister when he was informed that there was going to be the potential for this significant over-run - it was only in the August-September period last year - was to establish the full facts.

When he had the information, he brought it to the Minister and the relevant Department. The Taoiseach was then informed. A detailed memorandum was prepared for the Cabinet, on which we would then have had to make a serious decision. At the same time, the public was informed of that decision and we have since been having a public and transparent debate and bringing as much information to light as we can. Again, the Minister for Health was before the Joint Committee on Health this morning answering many of these questions, but we also have a PwC process and the terms of reference for that process. I know that those in Sinn Féin struggle sometimes with the idea of due process and getting to the actual facts before they pull the trigger.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	179	Fine Gael has been in charge of the Department of Health since March 2011. We have come out of the austerity years and are now, I hope, in a position where we can bring the health system forward. Funding for the Department of Health and the HSE has grown from €14.2 billion in 2011 to €17 billion this year. As others have made clear, the Government has serious questions to answer about how there was an explosion in costs for the national children's hospital. It has serious questions to answer about how other hospital investments will be delayed or perhaps cancelled throughout the country as a result. It also has to fix the terrible problems stemming from the CervicalCheck scandal, not least the waiting times for checks to be processed that are inexcusably long. I want to focus on the Government's record in managing negotiations. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation is on strike. Those involved will be going on strike for a third day tomorrow. Where is the Government's ability to handle this situation? Why can it not sit down and engage in a serious process of negotiations well in advance of an actual strike? After nearly eight years in the Department of Health, I would have thought Fine Gael would have developed working relationships with all the major stakeholders, yet it seems years have slipped by and it has been unable to get to grips with these issues. We are now hearing concerns about the awareness of cost over-runs for the national children's hospital dating back to August 2017, one year before the Minister for Health was informed, apparently, and 15 months before the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was informed. It is his job, as set up by statute, to monitor public expenditure. The notion that the Minister for Health would know that he had to get all of the facts and that it took him three months to tell the Minister whose job it was to mind the money that there was a problem is startling. The Government has been negotiating a new contract with general practitioners for at least four years with no outcome. In order for the programme for Government commitments to roll out more primary care centres to be achieved, we need to have the GP contract agreed to. In order for the Government's own commitments to provide free GP care for all children and young people under 18 years to be realised, we need to have the new GP contract agreed to. The latest report is that the Minister for Health began a new round of negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation in October last year. I have two direct and simple questions for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. What progress has been achieved in the negotiations on the new GP contract? When, in his estimate, will the GP contract be signed off on and delivered in order that the programme for Government commitment signed off on by the Government will be brought to fruition?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	180	It is important to acknowledge the increase in spending that has happened in the health service in recent years. The increase in spending has happened because we place such a priority on improving the health benefits and results for people going into the health system. Of course, we have challenges in the health system - every country does - because of the types of service we are trying to deliver. Over the course of that period we have increased the budget and seen more doctors, nurses, healthcare centres, as well as community supports and improvements in health outcomes, but challenges still remain. Action is under way by the INMO. The mechanisms of the State are in place - the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. Both the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, have said they are open to the engagements that could happen through that process as it comes to a resolution. However, this has to happen within the parameters of the public service pay agreement. This is because the agreement has been agreed to across the public sector and that is what we are working towards in getting public sector workers back to the position where they were before the crisis happened in their pay and benefits. That was an important negotiation and it has been agreed to. We want to and have to continue with it. We have a responsibility beyond the nurses. It applies to them, of course, but it goes beyond them to all public sector workers and the wider economy in terms of the public finances. Deputy Howlin referred to the GP contract. An important engagement between the State and the IMO resumed in October, as the Deputy said, and there were intensive engagements at the time, especially in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Some progress was made, but there are outstanding issues. We need to ensure that, as we benefit patients, we also provide value for money for the taxpayer. The State's negotiating team is keen to bring a renewed focus to the engagement with the IMO in the coming weeks in an effort to bring matters to a conclusion. We believe we can bring matters to a conclusion because it is so important in terms of what we want to deliver through GPs. The ability to deliver the service through them and do so in a cost-effective way not only for the taxpayer but also in such a way as to avoid adding a financial burden to the individual, family or parent who wants to bring a child to the GP is crucial. We need to find money through savings in other parts of the healthcare sector because we are doing it with GPs.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	183	What is the point in vastly increasing the health budget if the Government is so spendthrift that it has no control over the escalating costs? A total of €500 million can go without being noticed. It seems that industrial relations and Fine Gael do not work well together. I again ask the Minister my questions, specifically about the GP contract. The doctors are outside. It is the next national crisis. There are vacancies in GP practices in every county. I can list the areas in my county of Wexford where we cannot get GPs to take up contracts. This is going to be crippling for the health service, unless we get a contract in place. Four years of negotiations should bear fruit, rather than the generalisms the Minister has provided for the House today. I will repeat my question. When does he expect a concrete result from the ongoing negotiations on a new GP contract? When will the Government be in a position to deliver on the programme for Government commitments to roll out GP services?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	184	To categorise the additional money that will be spent on the children's hospital as just disappearing without notice is completely incorrect.

It is incorrect to say it was. As we address these serious issues about which people are angry – we are angry too – it is vital that we get to the actual facts of the matter.

The cost was to be managed within the existing budget. That is separate from the information brought to the attention of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, at the end of August or the beginning of September on the potential for a significant over-run. It was only crystallised at the beginning of November, at which time the other Ministers were then informed of the seriousness of the issue and the Cabinet took its decision in December.

Of course, we have to get the facts of the matter. The Deputy should know as a former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that we cannot make up figures or pull them out of the air. We have to drill down and get to the actual numbers and then bring them to the Minister and the Cabinet. We need to get to the facts. As I said in my previous answer, intensive engagement began in October and continued right up until the weeks before Christmas. There are a number of outstanding issues. The engagement will resume shortly and we hope conclude shortly thereafter because of the important role GPs are playing in terms of the future delivery of health services.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	193	I suggest there really is something surreal about the way the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is trying to explain away what can best be described as an existential crisis across the public health service. Those in Fine Gael pride themselves on their management skills, efficiency and financial prudence, yet they are trying to justify what has been, in the period Fine Gael has been in office with three different Ministers for Health, namely, James Reilly, Leo Varadkar and Simon Harris, an absolutely extraordinary tale of failure and crisis.GPs are protesting outside Leinster House as we speak over the crisis in general practice. There is a national nurses' strike and an ambulance strike. There is a persistent and unprecedented trolley crisis and there are hundreds of thousands of people on hospital waiting lists. There is a crisis in our mental health service where the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, is 50% understaffed, there has been the scandal around CervicalCheck, and there are persistent overruns in the health budget running to hundreds of millions of euro. The cherry on top of all of this is the absolute disaster of the national children's hospital. When it was first touted, the national children's hospital was going to cost just over €400 million, but now the bill has reached €1.4 billion or €1.7 billion all in. Even by the Government's estimate, it is a €1 billion increase in the cost of the national children's hospital. Are we seriously supposed to believe the Government when it says that this is not really its fault and it will get to the bottom of the matter, that it is in charge of things? To add insult to injury, much of this is being batted off to PwC to find answers. This is PwC which worked for BAM, the contractor at the centre of this controversy, auditing its accounts for nine years, for which BAM paid it at least €34 million. BAM is a contractor with a history of massive overruns in Holland, Britain and Ireland. Now the company which audited them are apparently the people who will get to the bottom of the scandal of the national children's hospital. It beggars belief. Why does the Minister try to explain away this €1 billion cost overrun, that is, €1 billion which will go into the hands of building contractors, but the Government digs in its heels against the nurses and says the nurses will not get a cent? The Government says it is okay, that it can explain away an extra €1 billion to building contractors but it cannot pay the nurses, the people who hold together what is left of the health service. It digs in its heels and refuses to engage with them seriously. The Government has made a mess of the health service under three successive Ministers. Why does the Government not just give it up and accept that it failed?

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	Each year we have sought to increase the budget for health, both current and capital funding, and where additional resources have been made available, health has been prioritised. I have been part of the negotiations where we have discussed increases in budgets. The cost overrun here is €450 million above what was profiled in the initial outline in 2017. About €320 million of that is for construction and €50 million is towards VAT. The rest is for equipment leasing, design teams and those types of things. That money must be spent to deliver this hospital. It is wrong to conflate this with the issue of the nurses for several reasons. It is not true to say that nurses are not getting pay increases under the public service pay agreement. Changes are happening as a result of last year's review into issues around recruitment and retention. The challenges in the public sector go beyond nurses. The public service pay agreement is in place across the unions to ensure that we can restore losses in salary that were inflicted as a result of the crisis in a way that we do not step back into another crisis and have to cut salaries again. We must do everything in a sustainable way. Let me be clear about the importance of the delivery of this hospital. That will cost money. We will get to the root of how these costs went from the initial outline for phase 2 announced in 2017-----

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has also taken questions on the matter, as has the Taoiseach in the Dáil. Officials were before joint committees last week where they took questions. A process is in place where questions about what happened are being answered, but we also have to do a deeper dive, and PwC will do that.

It is the nurses and the midwives, the ambulance drivers, and the GPs. The Government will not speak to the INMO about the issues that have brought its members out on strike, it will not recognise the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, the representative group of the general practitioners, and it refused to talk to the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, branch of the Psychiatric Nurses Association which is involved in an industrial dispute in the ambulance service. It will not speak to them. It will not give a cent to the people who hold the health service together but it will pay €1 billion over and above the original estimate announced by the then Minister, Deputy Reilly, at St. James's which was €485 million. It is now €1.4 billion under this Government's watch, and we will fork it out, and it will probably go higher. According to a meme I saw recently, the tallest building in the world cost €1.7 billion, which is about the cost of the national children's hospital. It is shocking, but while the Government is willing to give money to these builders, it will not even talk to the people who hold the health service together, the nurses and midwives, GPs and ambulance drivers. It is shocking double standards, typical of Fine Gael. Its last little claim for credibility, that it could manage things in a prudent financial way, has now been exposed. It has made an absolute dog's dinner of this key infrastructural project and no apologising or explaining can justify it.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	205	I thank the Deputy for his supplementary question. There are nurses at work today. I know that the nurses who will strike tomorrow do not take that action lightly, given their commitment to and care for the patients they look after. However, we as a Government must bear in mind the potential consequences were we not to stick to the public service pay agreement. Within that agreement, there will be changes and improvements in conditions and increases in salaries for people in the health sector. Additional increases will kick in from 1 March. It is not true that things are not being done to help improve the position of public sector workers, because they are. That is why we are seeing an increase in the number of people working in the public sector in recent years. The Deputy referred to figures from six years ago when we first started speaking of this children's hospital. That it was six years speaks to the delay which has taken place and why we do not want to delay further. The economy has radically transformed in the past six years, no thanks to Deputy Boyd Barrett, of course, or any position that he has taken on any budgetary decision that this Government had to make to restore the public finances. In relation to the public service pay agreement we are trying to keep public finances on a sustainable footing, not least because of potential dangers relating to Brexit. In this significant cost overrun, it is important that we get to the actual facts of the matter. The €1 billion overrun is not a fact. The Deputy can jump up and down about it but we need to get to the actual facts, then understand what lessons are to be learned and what decisions the Government can take on accountability and the additional cost savings that can be found between now and the completion of the hospital in 2022.

These two women are suspended without pay, despite the university having undertaken to restore them to full employment and, to facilitate them in returning to work, giving them an assurance that they would not be returned to the university's finance department.Mr. Kieran Mulvey was appointed to undertake mediation. Unfortunately, there has not been engagement. I understand that the university is attempting to put the two women back into the finance department having previously agreed not to do same.

We heard in recent days that the Government had taken a different position and flip-flopped on the issue and would block the Bill in the Seanad. We have since learned that that is not the approach, but that the Government has instead decided to water down the Bill by extending its implementation period and introducing amendments on Report Stage. For people relying on the Bill, that is not acceptable. It had unanimous support in this House and on Second Stage in the Seanad and it needs to be passed and implemented without delay to ensure there is an extension of unpaid parental leave of eight weeks to parents of children under eight years of age. The Bill is essential, which is why everyone in this House approved it. Will the Minister outline the Government's position on trying to water down the Bill as it goes through the Seanad?

The Government is not trying to water down the Bill at all. Rather, we are trying to make progress, working with the Bill's sponsors, on getting it through. It underwent no pre-legislative scrutiny, which caused problems in terms of ensuring that all of the appropriate bodies were engaged with to understand all of its consequences, for example, cost implications and the resourcing of essential areas. We fully support the principles of the Bill. It is before the Seanad this afternoon and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is leading on behalf of the Government. We are trying to find amendments that will have the agreement of all sides of the Upper House.

Therefore, it is possible for Departments to have more than one Bill before a House at the same time. I have previously asked about the Judicial Council Bill 2017, which is long-promised and long-awaited legislation to ensure uniformity across the Judiciary, which is very important. I was told that, since the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill was before the Seanad, another Bill could not be progressed. When will the Judicial Council Bill be presented to this House and when will it be enacted?

We all thought that was the Gospel. Last Friday, however, Tipperary County Council received an email to say that a decision had subsequently been made by the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, or someone else in the Minister's Department to put the Cahir area into the Tipperary town and Cashel district. This is of major concern to all council management, staff, including outdoor workers, and members and to people in the area. What kind of gerrymandering is going on? We had enough of that back in the Tully Government. The commission deliberated and reported, and that was accepted by the county council, but now the Minister of State, who accused Senator Coffey of being Crotty the Robber, is interfering with Tipperary and its destiny. We will not put up with this. I do not know what the Government has against Tipperary and Tipperary town, but it is interfering with it a lot.

Nearly a year on and we are still waiting. The Minister met me once with two of my colleagues and a second time to show me a piece of paper with a wording that he believed might work, but there has been no real engagement. I have offered for my legal team to meet his legal team or the Attorney General's legal team to try to tease this out, but that has not happened. This morning, the committee agreed to continue Committee Stage of my Bill in April, and I hope that the Minister will be able to say when he will engage with me as its sponsor in a meaningful way.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	222	I thank the Deputy for the question. This is an important issue to me. That is why I brought it to the Cabinet before Christmas for a decision on sending what we believed could be a successful wording to the Attorney General's office. It is with the Attorney General at the moment. It is important that, when we hold a referendum on this issue, we have agreement on all sides of the House that the wording is robust enough not to have unintended consequences. The Attorney General is working on that at the moment. In one of our previous engagements, I outlined for the Deputy the various barriers that had to be tested or jumped to get to a suitable wording. If the Deputy believes that she has a wording that crosses those thresholds sufficiently so as not to have unintended consequences, I would be interested in sitting down and talking with her about them. As for meeting with the Attorney General, that would be a matter for him.

What plans has the Minister to access State lands, for example, Cathal Brugha Barracks and the Broadstone garage, to ensure that we do not create a Millionaire's Row ghetto in the centre of Dublin and, instead, we have a mix of people in our city centres? As the Minister knows, this is a major problem in our own part of Dublin city in particular. What plans has the Government to address the issues that Mr. Kenny outlined?

I do not believe that Mr. Kenny made that clear. What was intended for the site was to use prefabricated technology to deliver social housing. Given the complexity of the site itself for social housing, however, doing so did not represent value for money. It was the right decision not to progress with the site, but that does not mean that Dublin City Council is in any way taking its foot off the pedal in terms of delivering new social housing within its administrative area. Regarding State sites that are not local authority owned, that is why I established the Land Development Agency, LDA, last September. It has identified eight initial sites, but it is in discussions with Departments and agencies regarding a further tranche of 15. Through those sites, we will be able to use public land to deliver housing for all of our people in areas of high demand like the city centre. That is progressing. We do that work with the Departments. The LDA had its first board meeting last week - an interim board is in place - and we will have legislation to place it on a statutory footing and capitalise it to the tune of €1.25 billion once we are through with the rent Bill, which is awaiting Committee Stage.

I wish to ask about a commitment in the programme for Government that could provide a flexibility that is now needed to overcome the impasse in the dispute without undermining the national pay agreement. Page 61 of A Programme for a Partnership Government reads:We will review the roles and responsibilities of various healthcare professionals working in our hospitals. This will include further transfer of tasks between doctors and nurses...Can this review be brought forward in order to avert the three-day strike that is planned for next week and will have a devastating impact on patients awaiting appointments?

I am not surprised. First-time nurses must be paid the same as other university graduates. The conditions that our nurses work under are unacceptable, with overcrowding and poor support from management. Nurses are rightly angry. Tomorrow, nurses from the Schull, Castletownbere, Bandon, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Kinsale and Skibbereen community hospitals will strike outside their hospitals with their fellow nurses in Bantry General Hospital, fighting for their rights and the rights of the patients for whom they care. There are five senior and junior health Ministers. Can the Government sit down and do what it has to do to find an immediate solution to nurses' pay and conditions before it forces these nurses out on strike again tomorrow?

Irish nurses working across the globe are sending messages of solidarity to their striking colleagues and encouraging them to stand up for themselves, remain strong and stay out. Irish nurses working abroad will never come home to work in the profession they love because of the poor pay and conditions on offer and gross understaffing. Newly qualified teachers are getting on the first plane out of this place. The problem of staffing cannot be addressed until the issue of poor pay and conditions is addressed. That is why the Government's recruitment drive has fallen flat on its face and on deaf ears. Nurses are striking for that good reason and the public is behind them. When will the Government get its head out of the sand and deal with the reality that until it addresses the issue of poor pay and conditions, the recruitment and retention crisis is set to continue indefinitely?

We have a national wage agreement that prioritises those on low and middle incomes in wage restoration and wage growth. We have a national wage agreement which, on the new entrant issue alone, makes provision for a needed and recognised wage increase of €3,000 to deal with an issue that has been raised in this House. I hear Deputy after Deputy say that while we need to pay nurses more, we do not want to undermine what is a collective wage agreement. These are the same Deputies who, when we were dealing with the issue of An Garda Síochána in 2016, accused the Government of undermining the national wage agreement. Deputy Naughten made a constructive suggestion on how the issue could be moved forward. In terms of the engagement that has happened to date, an attempt was made to deal with this issue inside the current national wage agreement. We then had a period of engagement for over a year at the Public Service Pay Commission that produced a report that was welcomed by many Deputies who are now criticising it. The Government is open to and trying to use proposals such as those identified by Deputy Naughten to find a way through this most difficult issue. Of course, the Opposition Deputies who are raising the issue of the plight and work of nurses today, something that is recognised fully on this side of the House also, are the same Opposition Deputies who the next day will be raising the issue of why workers in every other part of the public service are not receiving the same wage increases.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	230	The December homeless figures show that there were 9,753 people in homeless accommodation. In an accompanying statement issued at the time the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, stated there was sufficient bed capacity to provide a bed for anyone who wanted one. That is simply not the case. Two weeks' ago, I personally brought a case in Wicklow to the attention of the Minister. It involves a ludicrous policy in Wicklow County Council under which part-time emergency homeless accommodation is provided for individuals. I brought to attention the case of a young woman with three children who was pregnant and who had been in bed and breakfast accommodation provided by the local authority. The local authority had cut the number of nights a week it was provided from seven to four. That is the policy and it not an isolated case. It is the policy of Wicklow County Council under which we see families having to share accommodation. It has got to the stage where the woman in question has to make a choice to put herself and her children out on the street or stay in the accommodation. She did the right thing. She chose to stay in it.

I entirely disagree. The example given by Deputy Brady outlines the position. To give the Minister an insight, the Cork Simon emergency shelter has been full every night for the past two months. Last week all 47 beds were full, with nine additional persons on the floor and in sofa spaces and 17 on mattresses on the floor of the day service next door. In a particular week in December there were 373 adults in emergency accommodation. Cork Simon states there has been no let up. The emergency accommodation crisis is getting worse and worse. I believe it is time the Minister reconsidered the Government's position on confining social housing provision to small-scale projects. That is part of the solution.

Of course, we all know that there is a crisis of homelessness in the country. That is why this year we will spend more money on housing than any Government ever has in one year. That is why we are continuing to build thousands and thousands of social housing homes. The Deputy's colleague stated Rebuilding Ireland was failing. Since the year before it, we have increased the number of social housing homes by eight times.

Balanced regional development, while it may be occurring in some areas, is certainly not happening in my constituency of Roscommon-Galway. In terms of job creation, it is the area is most neglected. Recently my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, tabled a question about vacant IDA Ireland sites. The reply showed that, nationally, 64% of IDA Ireland properties were vacant. Let me outline to the House the list in Roscommon-Galway. In Roscommon town there was 4.8 ha of land vacant; in Castlerea, 1.2 ha; in Ballinasloe, 8.8 ha; and in Ballygar, 3.4 ha. In small areas in Mountbellew and Glenamaddy and the Tuam business park which straddles the constituency there are 2.17 ha vacant. There is no attempt by the Government, no matter what notes come from the Chief Whip to the Minister, to create jobs in my constituency of Roscommon-Galway. I ask the Minister to seize the opportunity when thousands of jobs are being created in Galway. The fact of the matter, as I pointed out previously, is that 900 people leave my constituency daily to travel to work in Dublin. What will the Government do about it?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	I thank the Deputy for the question. We are seeing jobs growth in every region of the country because of the measures the Government has implemented under the Action Plan for Jobs. Today the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, is launching one of the first of her regional action plans for jobs with a more detailed focus on regions of the country that are not doing as well as others to help increase job creation. It is important to note that, with the urban and rural regeneration funds, hundreds of millions of euro will be spent and investment has been granted in the Deputy's own area to regenerate towns and areas in order that more people will come to live and work in them. Over the course of the next 20 years, of the additional 1 million people who will be living in the country, 75% will be living outside Dublin. That is why we have the regional spatial economic strategies being finalised to plan and manage that growth-----

It is the plight of 25 children who are suffering from SMA. Their condition deteriorates but there is hope in a drug called Spinraza. We have raised the issue time and again and the Minister has rightly stated that there is an assessment process. However, the families involved feel helpless and believe they are voiceless and have been left behind while the process is ongoing.They had hoped there would be a resolution to this before Christmas and there has not been. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who replied to me previously indicating that a proposal would be brought to the HSE leadership team in February. I need the Minister of State to assure us that this will happen and that a conclusion will be brought to this. Every day one of the few parents contacts me, desperate for a solution to this. It is a small group of people and they genuinely feel voiceless and helpless. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure the recommendation is brought forward, and perhaps he could indicate when that team is due to meet.

There are parents in my constituency in Kilkenny who consistently make representations to me on this issue. It is time for the Government to give us an answer on when this drug will be available.

I can confirm that the HSE leadership management team will meet on 14 February at which it is hoped it will to come to a final decision on this.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	259	The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, referred to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. It is not three weddings and a funeral. It is three Ministers and a planner in my constituency today launching the enterprise plan for the midlands region across Portlaoise, Mountmellick and Birr. A commitment was given during the Topical Issue debate on 25 October 2018 by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, when he confirmed the Government would make an application to the EU globalisation fund on foot of Bord na Móna's decision to accelerate decarbonisation, which will result in up to 430 job losses. That plan would be great if it had adequate funding to deliver upon what is contained within it. Our region and our county deserve funding over and above existing programmes to deal with the issue of decarbonisation and to deal with the region maintaining its place as an initiator and instigator of the provision of energy in the midlands and in the State. It is rich for the Ministers to be there launching that plan when they could not honour the commitment they gave me in good faith. It will take more than a visit from the "Six One" news to Tullamore on one night of the year to make progress on this matter.

People throughout the country are outraged at the escalation in the cost of the children's hospital. People in Kerry are concerned about our new community hospital in Killarney and how far that will be pushed back. When the Minister is finished talking to his colleagues, I will ask him a question. People want to know about the contracts. Someone signed a contract on behalf of the client, the client being the people of Ireland, to build the children's hospital. Who signed the contract with the contractors? Was it the Minister for Finance? Was it the Taoiseach? Was it the Minister for Health? Which of them signed the contract? The Government is now commissioning a report that will cost €500,000. I put it to the Minister that whoever signed that contract knows who is responsible for the escalation in the price.

#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	272	The costs overrun on the national children's hospital will have a knock-on effect for many capital projects. Clarity is needed as a matter of priority as to which projects will be delayed or deferred. I refer to the second permanent cath lab at University Hospital Waterford that was signed off on by the Minister for Health at a meeting with all south east Oireachtas Members last October. The Minister has reiterated that this project will not be delayed, but clarity is needed on the 2019 health service plan. Unfortunately, at a committee meeting last Thursday, the Department said differently. When will we have this clarity once and for all?

That is a fact. Each and every member of the Government knows this. This is serious. It is true that every Deputy in this House is now wondering what knock-on effects this will have to HSE budgets in their constituencies. The way the Government has handled it has been catastrophic. I will repeat, and it is my fourth time to say this in the House today, that the best that the Minister for Health could come up with to describe the situation is "the least worst option". Those words will come back to haunt each and every member of the Government when they come to face the electorate again. This is a disgrace and they are not taking it seriously enough. They had better wake up to this. The Minister for Finance must definitely wake up to this.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	278	On the same issue, this situation has exposed the politics by press release and announcements rather than the politics of governing. Deputy Cowen's intervention also summed up this type of politics with regard to the other Departments. The effects of the massive cost overruns may not be felt immediately this year but will be felt next year and the year after. I want to know which school projects and third level projects are planned to be affected by this cost overrun? This will have a massive impact. Schools throughout the State are badly in need of works. There was a big announcement made last year by the Minister for Education and Skills with regard to demographic pressures. We need new schools. Will the Minister indicate what the effect will be?

A cursory look in the Companies Registration Office shows that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been the auditor of the Royal BAM Group, and not just its subsidiary in Ireland. This is a billion euro plus company. PricewaterhouseCoopers is the auditor and accountant for this company. Is the Minister satisfied that the House can accept this as an independent assessment by a company that has consistently been the auditor of the Royal BAM Group's accounts for the past number of years? Does he honestly believe that we can accept this as an independent review, bearing in mind that the contract we are referring to with BAM is a €1.7 billion potential contract? Is the Minister satisfied that the review will be fully independent? Is he satisfied that every Member in the House can accept the review as independent? The Minister has grave questions to answer around the independence of such a review. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has to be satisfied that it is fully independent. I certainly am not.

There have been promises on two major projects in my area with more than €13 million to be invested between Midleton and Youghal community hospitals, which are due to be completed by 2021. We have not seen this yet and I fear these projects may be affected by the massive overrun of costs at the national children's hospital. I would like some update on this investment.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	282	There was a commitment by the Government, and a top priority of the HSE, to build a primary care centre in Finglas. Dublin City Council entered into an agreement with the HSE to provide the land. The council recently purchased a local site - the Church of the Annunciation site - from the diocese. Money and a commitment to building the new centre is urgently needed. Will the Minister allay the concerns of the community that the overspend on the new children's hospital will not impact on this vital project? The people of Finglas are angry. We have waited for this primary care centre as a top priority. Will the Minister allay the people's fears and let us know if the project can and will go ahead?

We are well aware of the grave concerns people have on the cost escalation. We made the decision, and I take responsibility for the decision, to move ahead with the hospital and ensure that it is built.The reason for that is my commitment to the site and seeing the project delivered to provide transformative care to young children throughout our country. Equally, I am aware of the anger in the House and concern nationally on the cost escalation. I answered questions about it for the afternoon yesterday, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is doing so today. To deal with Deputy Kelleher's question, the Deputy knows well that I cannot speak on behalf of other Members. I know the variety and strength of feeling in the House on the matter. I am confident that whatever work PwC does will be independent.

It also includes commitments on afforestation and recognising its carbon sink value. However, people in the Toon Valley near Macroom are struggling to come to terms with how those commitments fit with the issuing by the Department of a licence for the removal of parts of Silvergrove Wood. While it is not part of the Gearagh special area of conservation, it is just upstream from it and is subject to an application for SAC status. One would have expected the application to raise a red flag in the Department in relation to the issuing of a licence. How does the licensing fit with the commitments in the programme for Government referred to? Should a red flag not have been raised?

I was given a commitment by An Post that it would be kept open for a reasonable period while alternative premises were being located.

I confirm to Deputy McConalogue that my officials and representatives from Donegal County Council are very engaged on acquiring a site. I was in Crana College last Monday week and had the opportunity to meet the principal and other staff. Their sense of urgency is a focus, and I will have an opportunity on Friday, when the Deputy will no doubt also be in attendance, to meet the education and training board in Letterkenny to ensure this stays live on the agenda. There is a local solution, but it will require intense focus at local level, county council level and on the part of the Department. It is a focus in my contact and communication with the schools and the education and training board. We have to find a solution. People are getting frustrated. The Deputy and I want to see this progress, as do the politicians on the ground. It is to be hoped the engagement on Friday will help us to keep this firmly on the agenda.

#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	312	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 to provide for the establishment of thermal efficiency standards for rented accommodation, for the testing of rented accommodation for radon, for the remediation of rented accommodation with high concentrations of radon; and to provide for related matters.The Green Party's Healthy Homes Bill 2019 is vital step to ensure homes are safer and warmer for those who rent. The Bill proposes to require the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to make regulations to require private landlords to test their properties for the presence of radon and remediate them if necessary. It proposes also to require the Minister to make regulations to impose thermal comfort and efficiency standards such as a minimum building energy rating. Currently, there is no obligation on landlords to take either of these steps, and as the measures only benefit the tenant, there is little incentive for them to undertake the work either. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which is colourless and odourless and can only be detected using specialised equipment. It is linked to between 280 and 300 lung cancer cases in Ireland every year. That represents 10% of lung cancer cases. Testing for radon costs just €50 and involves simply leaving a monitoring device in a home for three months before returning it to a laboratory. Remediation, where necessary, generally costs under €1,000. In many of the areas in which radon levels are high, the rental market is such that €1,000 is no more than one month's rent. All that happens at the moment is that local authorities ask landlords whether they have tested for radon. Fingal County Council, for example, reported that in the previous five years in respect of 559 properties, not one landlord replied to say radon levels had been tested. Quentin Crowley of Trinity College Dublin estimates that more than 30% of the national building stock is in high radon risk areas and that more than 460,000 people, or 10% of the population, may be living in homes with high radon gas concentrations. The Bill seeks to oblige the Minister to implement an action which the Government itself adopted in the national radon control strategy of 2014 but failed to include when reviewing standards for rented houses in 2017. This is a vital measure to strengthen the right of tenants to live in safe homes. The second aspect of the Bill will ensure that tenants can live in warm, energy-efficient homes. Everyone agrees that we need to upgrade the vast proportion of our housing stock to improve living conditions, save on fuel bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.While Government policies include some measure of State-sponsored retrofit of social housing and incentives for homeowners to insulate their houses, there has been almost no retrofitting of private rented accommodation. This is due to the split incentive whereby the landlord would pay for the installation but the tenant would be the person to benefit. If we do not introduce minimum standards, many households and tenants will continue to live in substandard accommodation and some will end up in fuel poverty due to the energy inefficiency of their houses and apartments. The Bill requires the Minister to create regulations by the end of this year, but as the cost of retrofitting can vary greatly from property to property, we envisage a transition period prior to the minimum thermal efficiency standards becoming applicable to all rental properties. These are two issues we need to start tackling as soon as possible, and I urge everyone to support the Bill in order that we can guarantee safer and warmer homes for renters.

#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	I am thankful this Topical Issue matter has been selected for discussion because this issue has been ongoing for a while in international foreign affairs. It has not, however, been aired at all in this House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will be aware that the disgraced President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, was re-elected for a six-year term in May 2018. The opposition parties boycotted the election. At the time the European Union described the presidential and regional polls as having gone ahead without a national agreement on an electoral calendar and complying with the minimum international standards for a credible process, in not respecting political pluralism, democracy, transparency and the rule of law. It reiterated recently that the presidential elections in Venezuela last May had not been free, fair or credible and lacked democratic legitimacy. It also stated the country urgently needed a government that truly represented the will of the Venezuelan people. My party and I subscribe to that statement. Mr. Maduro's socialist policies and those of his predecessors are supported by the Sinn Féin Party. Many Irish people were completely disgusted by the stance taken by that party when it sent representatives to the recent presidential inauguration in Venezuela to cheer on and fete the now discredited Nicolás Maduro. The muzzling of parliamentary democracy and the economic policies introduced have brought the once middle income country to the brink of collapse. There is hyper inflation and shortages of medicines and food. Venezuela is also now a security basket case, with rioting on the streets. The country is disintegrating before the eyes of the international community. There is, however, a viable alternative in Juan Guaidó who has now been subjected to sanctions. It is only right and proper that the international community has responded with an expression of support and solidarity for him. It is notable which countries have declared their positions on the situation in Venezuela. The countries supporting Nicolás Maduro include Russia, China, Cuba and Bolivia. We have, unfortunately, seen a pretty slow response from the European Union and the Government. We only received the Government's response at 12.30 p.m. today. Why did it take it so long to take a definitive position on the situation in Venezuela? I ask because we have seen what is clearly an abject breakdown of law and order and any form of decent rule by civil society. The Government should be called out for being so slow in its response. It is particularly the case given that some of our major partners in the European Union, including France and Germany, have taken the lead in stating a position on Venezuela. Others within the European Union, of course, have sat on the fence. I am referring to Belgium, Finland and Sweden. As a result, there has been a disjointed and disconnected approach by the European Union. I ask the Minister of State to address the reason the Government took so long to come to a stated position on such a corrupt regime. If fresh elections are not forthcoming, what further action will the European Union take? What position will Ireland take within the European Union in advocating for and seeking fresh open, free and transparent elections? That is the key to resolving the issue. Has the Government taken any decision or had any discussion on providing humanitarian aid for the people of Venezuela?Germany recently pledged €5 million when Angela Merkel announced Germany's position in support of Juan Guaidó. Will the Government definitively outline its position on humanitarian aid? In summary, why did it take the Government so long to arrive at its position? What will we do to ensure that there will be fair, free and transparent elections? What is the position on humanitarian aid?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	319	I should address some of the points that Deputy Niall Collins raised. Elections in Venezuela are normally held in December but in December 2017 and January 2018 there were talks between the government and the opposition in Venezuela. The opposition insisted on the election being held in early summer and the government caved in and agreed. The opposition was warned by the Americans that it should boycott the election, that it should not stand and that it had other plans. The opposition boycotted the elections. That is their idea of democracy. I would not blame Deputy Collins for not knowing Mr. Guaidó's name, given that 80% of Venezuelans did not know him either six months ago. It is not "Gwee-doh" but "Gwy-doh". We should put matters in perspective. Since 1904, when Theodore Roosevelt declared the US's right to exercise an international police power in Latin America, the US has successfully intervened more than 40 times in Latin American elections. That is 40 times in 100 years of elections. We should acknowledge the role that a century of US-backed military coups, corporate plundering and neoliberal sapping of resources has played in the poverty, instability and violence that drive people in Latin America towards Mexico and the United States border. For decades, US policies of military intervention and economic neoliberalism have undermined democracy and stability in the region. What the US has done to those lands is horrific. In the Caribbean alone, the US physically intervened 30 times in the first three decades of the 20th century. It has wreaked havoc on the place. It is gas to think that today there is serious instability in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador because they are experiencing a growing militarisation and neoliberal policies through various initiatives, mostly sponsored by the US Government and the US private sector. They have stolen much of the land to use as banana plantations by American-owned companies and run millions of people out of their land in the region, many of whom end up on the Mexican-US border, trying to make new lives somewhere else after their lives have been destroyed. Do people realise that Mike Pence phoned Juan Guaidó on 22 January? The next day, Guaidó appointed himself President of Venezuela. The US, which advised the opposition to boycott the election, wants a coup to be organised to get rid of Maduro. What does that have to do with democracy? I do not think Maduro is a wonderful fella who is doing a great job in Venezuela, but I would leave it to the Venezuelans to get rid of him. It is clear he is only a shadow of the man that Chávez was. It should be up to the Venezuelans. We should stop meddling and we should not promote other people meddling. People talk about democracy but they ignore the number of countries, leaders and dictators that the Americans prop up. The US supplies military assistance to 73% of the world's dictators, yet it is worried about Maduro. It is worried about him because it does not like that he does not have an open-door policy to American capitalism and financial imperialism.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. It has an abundance of other natural resources, such as gold, bauxite and coltan, but many of the resources in the hands of the Maduro government are not easily accessible to US and transnational corporations. Much of the oil industry was nationalised in 1973 and it is quite obvious that the latest coup attempt - let us remember it is not the first or the only one - has been done to get the US's hands on Venezuelan oil. I felt sick listening to the points that Deputy Niall Collins made. It is not true that none of the opposition took part in the elections. Some did and some recognised its fairness after all. One cannot whinge about elections not being fair while supporting as an alternative somebody who assumed a position and who could not be bothered standing in an election but came along at the behest of the US puppet masters and decided he would be president. For the recent Irish presidential election of Michael D. Higgins, the turnout was 43% whereas in Venezuela, it was 46%. If I say Michael D. does not have a mandate and I will be the President, do we want Donald Trump to support that over the heads of the Irish people? Where are the Venezuelan people? They are on the streets in their millions saying, "Yankees, go home" and "Hands off Venezuela". They have seen it before in Chile and in the interventions in Syria and so on. I am sickened to the pit of my being by the issue. It will be a game-changer if it is allowed to go ahead. When we were first elected, I remember the former Deputy, Ms Lucinda Creighton, standing in the Chamber and telling us to support the initiative of our European pals in the bombing of Libya. She said it was for democracy and that it would make matters better for Libyans. Look at the state of that country now. Many people have been killed and the society is a basket case in utter disarray. We have visited Iraq and seen the aftermath of the slaughter during the intervention there. We have visited Syria twice in the past number of years and seen the outcome of the intervention there. Will we please stop meddling in the business of other countries? I note that Deputy Collins did not say anything about the Italians, the Greeks or the people who have stood by the elected Government of Venezuela and said, "back off." They will not recognise the imposter Guaidó. There are significant problems with the Venezuelan economy - there are significant problems with our economy - but Venezuela managed to build 2 million social houses last year and, therefore, it is doing some things right. The cause of those problems, however, is the sanctions imposed by the West. A recent report by the UN special rapporteur, who is the first person to undertake such a project in Venezuela in 21 years, was very clear about what he saw in Venezuela last year. He said the sanctions are illegal and that they could amount to crimes against humanity under international law. This is the former Secretary General of the United Nations Human Rights Council and an expert in international law. The orchestrated sanctions are killing people and have put pressure on the economy, forced people to emigrate, caused a run on medicines, caused all the economic problems and interfered with the currency, and they were orchestrated to weaken the leadership, which the US attempted and failed to do under Chávez and which it is now attempting to do under Maduro. If we were truly neutral, we would stand in Europe and tell the US to back off and keep out. We should take a leaf from the Greeks and the Italians, rather than slavishly following the rest of Europe. It is an appalling situation.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	321	I apologise on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, who is unable to attend because he is abroad. The Government continues to be deeply concerned by the political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. The crisis continues to have a grave impact on the Venezuelan people and has resulted in mass migration, affecting countries in the region and overall regional stability. The human impact of the crisis is particularly distressing. The UN estimates that more than 3 million people, approximately one tenth of the entire population, have left the country and the acute humanitarian needs within the country are well known, particularly in respect of the shortages in access to medicine and significant increases in malaria, infant and maternal mortality and acute malnutrition.  On 10 January, President Maduro started a new mandate on the basis of non-democratic elections held in May 2018.Ireland was not represented at the inauguration and fully supported the related declaration by European Union High Representative Federica Mogherini which urged President Maduro to release all political prisoners; to uphold the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to urgently address the needs of the population. Ireland, alongside our EU partners, has repeatedly called on the Venezuelan Government to engage in dialogue with the opposition, respect the electoral calendar and fully restore the country’s democratic institutions. It is regrettable that the Venezuelan Government has not heeded the calls for fresh presidential elections in accordance with internationally recognised democratic standards and the Venezuelan constitutional order. Ireland fully supports the most recent EU 28 statement made by High Representative Federica Mogherini on 26 January which reiterates that a peaceful and inclusive democratic solution is the only sustainable way from the current crisis. It reaffirms the full support of the European Union of the democratically elected national assembly. It indicated that if no announcement of fresh elections was made in the intervening days, the European Union would take further actions, including on the issue of recognition of the country’s leadership. In the absence of such an announcement, Ireland has joined other EU member states in acknowledging and supporting Mr. Juan Guaidó, President of the democratically elected national assembly, as President ad interim of Venezuela in order for him to call for free, fair and democratic presidential elections. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has today announced that he intends to speak to Mr. Guaidó to communicate our position. Ireland is committed to finding ways to foster shared democratic solutions that can bring political stability and address the pressing needs of the Venezuelan people, including by increasing EU humanitarian support. A credible, meaningful dialogue leading to an inclusive democratic solution is the most effective way of achieving a peaceful and sustainable resolution of the current crisis in Venezuela. Ireland also supports the remarks made by High Representative Federica Mogherini following the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Bucharest on 31 January, including those regarding further EU actions to increase humanitarian support and consider additional targeted sanctions. High Representative Mogherini also took the opportunity to announce the establishment by the European Union of an international contact group, ICG, for Venezuela. Ireland, while not seeking membership, welcomes its establishment and believes it will be a useful vehicle for facilitating dialogue in working towards a democratic solution. I look forward to the report on the first meeting of the ICG to be held in Montevideo this Thursday. I welcome the high priority given to the issue by the European Union and the regular consultations at the highest levels on developments on the ground. Ireland will remain in close contact with our EU partners to consider next steps for co-ordinated EU action.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	322	As the Minister of State did not really address the questions I raised, I would appreciate it if he addressed them in his supplementary reply. What a load of balderdash we heard from Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly. They want to have it every way. They want to be against everybody and for nobody. We stand for the Venezuelan people. The Deputies are happy to see the political and civil chaos and upheaval, while saying we are hypocrites and they are right. However, they are as bad as Sinn Féin. Law, order and civil society are breaking down in Venezuela. We have stated we should support the interim presidency of Mr. Juan Guaidó, while calling for fresh elections in order that the Venezuelan people can make a decision. The elections should be fair, open and transparent. One cannot be against everybody and everything, while being for nothing. I have not heard any credible solution coming from Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly; they just want to bring forward competing agendas, which is fine. Why did it take the Government so long to come to this position? What will the European Union do and what will Ireland's position be if we do not see open and transparent elections in the foreseeable future, which is what the Venezuelan people want? Will the Minister of State give some commitment to provide humanitarian aid?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	323	I am sorry that the Tánaiste eventually gave in to pressure from the Americans, but we will see how it develops. In 2015 the former American President, Barack Obama, introduced sanctions against the Maduro Government. They were designed to make the people suffer by depriving them of food and medicine, as well as the Venezuelan Government of money to run the country. It is an ongoing process. If Venezuela is in a difficult position today, it can thank the UN sanctions for it. What do we want and are we against everything? No, we are not. We are in favour of democracy. The people of Venezuela should be able to decide their own destiny. They should pick a president and not have him or her picked for them by the Americans. If the French President, Mr. Macron, had a row with the US President, Donald Trump, and decided to nominate Mr. Bernie Sanders as President, seeking support for such recognition and calling for immediate elections, it would be unbelievable. The notion that Americans can pull somebody out of a hat as the new President of Venezuela and that Fianna Fáil would go along with it is unbelievable. I do not understand where these people come from. Are they living under a rock?

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	330	There is something incredibly hypocritical about speaking about undemocratic elections when the same people have no problem at all in having dealings with those who do not even bother masquerading about going through an election. I am speaking about the likes of Mohammed bin Salman and some of the other friends with whom the West has no problem engaging. What are the criteria for democracy, according to the Government? Is it whatever the Americans decide on a certain morning and whoever they decide to back? It is a case of all right Jack; it is good enough for us. The Venezuelan economy is in a very difficult place. The recent visit by the UN special rapporteur made it clear that modern economic sanctions and blockades were comparable to mediaeval sieges of towns, with the intention of forcing them to surrender. This is about bringing a sovereign country to its knees and the Venezuelan people are suffering as a result. The poorest are out on the streets in their millions standing by their government, despite the existence of major difficulties. What is the solution and what are we for? Venezuelan society is incredibly divided and the opposition, in the main but not exclusively, is a revolt of the rich. As society is divided, there must be negotiations. In order to achieve this properly, the sanctions must be called off. The Venezuelans must be allowed to develop their economy without the blackmail continuing. For us to take part in the undermining of a sovereign nation is a terrible indictment of us, given that, almost in the same breath, we have recently recognised 100 years of parliamentary democracy in Ireland. It is absolutely shocking. Have we learned anything from all the coup attempts in South America and Latin America in recent years? I really hope we will change tack.

We have also urged Mr. Maduro to fully respect and restore the independence and powers of the national assembly.Ireland is committed to finding ways to foster shared democratic solutions that bring political stability and address the pressing needs of the Venezuelan people, including by increasing EU humanitarian support. A credible, meaningful dialogue leading to an inclusive democratic solution is the most effective way of achieving a peaceful and sustainable resolution of the current crisis in Venezuela. As I outlined in my original reply, the people of Venezuela are living through this crisis. The recent protests are a demonstration of their demand for a proper democracy. It is imperative that the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are respected. I wholly condemn the use of violence against these protesters by the Venezuelan authorities. I offer my condolences to the families of the victims and call on the authorities to refrain from the inappropriate use of violence against peaceful protesters. Ireland supports urgent measures to address the humanitarian crisis and reiterates calls for humanitarian actors to be allowed to operate without interference to ensure the utmost is done to mitigate against the grave effects of the crisis and alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people to the greatest extent possible. We will continue to consult closely our EU partners at the highest level on this issue. The days and weeks ahead are crucial for the future of the people of Venezuela, and Ireland, in step with our EU partners, has emphasised the right of the Venezuelan people to choose their future freely. The Tánaiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will remain in close contact with their EU counterparts to follow this extraordinary issue.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	332	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, for coming to the Chamber to listen to me. I hope he might have some good news for me. There are 55,000 people in Ireland living with dementia. It might be hard to believe but 5,500 of those reside in the counties of Roscommon, Mayo and Galway. That is 10% of the overall figure. It is an extraordinarily high figure, I am sure the Minister of State would agree. The figure for Roscommon alone is 2,000 in a population of 65,000. I do not have the figures for east Galway but they are fairly large too. There is no budget for Alzheimer's sufferers in County Roscommon. I am looking for a commitment that the HSE, and the Government will assist us in this because I am sure the Minister of State would accept that it is of utmost importance. Dementia sufferers enter expensive long-term care when they could continue to live in their community, and we all want that, where possible, with proper supports in place such as day care and home support. There is a unit that could be used at the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon. The management of the hospital has said it could allow the unit to be used. The fact that we are not in receipt of funds to provide care for Alzheimer's sufferers means that we cannot use that premises. The Western Alzheimers foundation is committed to staffing the service once the funds are allocated. The estimated cost of putting two days' care into the unit at the Sacred Heart Hospital is €40,000 per annum. That is not a big figure. We have co-operation all round. There is the Roscommon-Mayo Alzheimer's group, the management of the Sacred Heart Hospital, and I am sure the HSE would make a goodwill gesture towards this if it can. Will the Minister of State facilitate us and assist the people of County Roscommon, an extraordinarily high number of whom suffer from Alzheimer's? The strategy was put in place in 2014 for dementia and dementia care. We are five years on from that and it is very hard to accept that there is one county that has no funding for Alzheimer's care. I hope that in his response the Minister of State will tell us that he is able to come on board to assist us and leave us in such a position that we will be able to use that unit at the Sacred Heart Hospital. If that was available for a day care service two days a week, it would be of great benefit and help to the many families throughout the county who have to deal with members of their families who suffer from Alzheimer's. It is a genuine case and cause. In fairness to the Minister of State, when he addresses these issues he does try to assist. I think he will agree that the allocation of money is quite small, at €40,000 per annum, but it would make a massive difference. It would send a clear signal to the people of Roscommon that the Government and the HSE are united behind them and trying to assist them in dealing with this big challenge.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	333	I thank Deputy Eugene Murphy for raising this issue. Many people with dementia are able to live long, fulfilling lives after their diagnosis, and fostering compassionate and inclusive communities can greatly improve the quality of life for persons with dementia and their families. It is Government policy that people should live and receive care in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. To support future development of services and supports for people with dementia, the National Dementia Office and the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland undertook a joint project in 2016 and 2017 to map dementia-specific community-based services throughout the country. Information from the project is included in an online service finder on the Understand Together website so that people can find out what services are available in each county. In County Roscommon, the HSE provides a psychiatrist of later life, a memory clinic for diagnosis and clinical care, and a memory technology resource room which offers opportunities to learn about and be assessed for assistive technologies, while funding has also been allocated to the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and Western Alzheimers for a community dementia support nurse and a dementia carers support group. While there are gaps in access to services and a variation in what services are provided, efforts are ongoing to address this. The National Dementia Office has met senior HSE officials in each community healthcare organisation, CHO, area to highlight service gaps in each area and to provide guidance and support on dementia service planning and development throughout the country. A dementia needs framework has been developed to support existing services. On a national level, as part of the national dementia strategy implementation programme, a range of supports have been introduced to assist people with dementia and their families and carers. Dementia-specific intensive home care packages offer tailored home care to people with dementia with complex needs. The primary care education, pathways and research project is training general practitioners, GPs, and primary care teams, giving them the skills to diagnose and manage dementia. In excess of €6.26 million has been secured from the Dormant Accounts Fund to offer a range of additional supports. These include diagnostic and post-diagnostic supports, a national dementia training programme for HSE home care staff, and a nationwide network of memory technology resource rooms. A carers' needs assessment will be rolled out in community healthcare west during 2019 and 2020. In response to Deputy Murphy's specific query, community healthcare west recently met the voluntary provider seeking to provide this additional respite in Roscommon town to discuss the proposal of part of the annual service level agreement, SLA, process. All applications for section 39 grant aid funding will be considered and prioritised based on their application in accordance with the agreed community healthcare west criteria. This prioritisation will determine the allocation of available funding. Community healthcare west has advised that the SLA process is ongoing and will conclude by the end of the month.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	334	I thank the Minister of State for his reply which contains much information. There is limited care afforded to Roscommon people, and this funding is coming from the funding allocated to Mayo, which I think is €90,000 per annum. The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong. The bit of funding for Roscommon comes out of that. There is a one-day centre in Four Mile House, four or five miles outside Roscommon town. I acknowledge the work done there.There is now a standing voluntary committee in the area that is committed to setting up a centre. In the interim, this €40,000 is being requested to provide two days' respite, perhaps over weekends, at the day-care centre at Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon town. That centre is available and its management is willing to co-operate and assist in the running of this respite service. I acknowledge, as was mentioned in the Minister of State's reply, that negotiations are going on. We hope they will come to a conclusion and will not go on indefinitely. The most important thing for now is to secure that €40,000 per annum. This would be highly significant and a really good gesture to the people in the county. The Minister of State will know, from meeting groups and perhaps from family experience, that it is a massive challenge for people to have a family member suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Many such people can be looked after but the day-care centres are extremely important. Respite is also a comfort and gives families some time and a break from constantly looking after a family member who has Alzheimer's disease 24-7. I hope the Minister of State will be able to use his good offices to see that we get that €40,000 in order to get these two days' respite going, particularly at the weekend, and to help those families.

These will conclude by the end of the month. I certainly will be happy to pass on the Deputy's representations to the HSE on that front but as the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot prejudge the outcome of the discussion. I know the Deputy is not looking for that but rather is simply requesting my support for the application. He will be updated on the outcome of those negotiations at the end of the month.

I am very disappointed that no Minister or Minister of State from the Department of Justice and Equality is here, given the significance of this issue for hundreds of families and the implications it could have, which could include people being put out of their homes. The phrase "equality of arms" is occasionally used in the context of court cases. It is a central part of a fair trial that there be a fair balance in the opportunities afforded to each of the parties involved in litigation. The changes to the legal aid rules brought in last Friday have absolutely destroyed that balance for families making insolvency applications and who may be facing repossession of their homes. They will make it much easier for banks and vulture funds to repossess homes. People will be left completely to the wolves.  Up until now, people applying for a personal insolvency arrangement, or appealing a bank's refusal to grant one after the veto was removed, could avail of the advice of a solicitor and a barrister. As of last Friday, the Government has removed the debtor's right to have a barrister in court other than in exceptional circumstances and has halved the fees paid to solicitors and personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs. I ask the Minister of State to bear in mind that these are people who, if they are not granted a personal insolvency arrangement, could be on the verge of losing their home. They are people who, by definition, cannot afford their own legal representation. On the other hand, they are taking on banks that have the very best of legal representation available and they are dealing with very complex legislation. The banks will spend €5,000 to €10,000 on each interlocking case. Even in the exceptional circumstances in which a barrister will be given, the fee of €1,200 represents a loss for a barrister. Therefore a person will not be able to get a barrister to take on his or her case.  I will give a brief example before I pause. Just yesterday, the case of Ms Lisa Parkin was decided. The judge approved a personal insolvency arrangement and accepted that the bank had been making a different case on entering the case from that upon which it ended up relying. Had Ms Parkin not had a barrister capable of responding to the bank, which was changing the goalposts in the case, there is every likelihood that she would have lost her home. To that could be added countless more cases which could result in people being out on the street. This is an attempt to disarm the debtor, who may well be fighting repossession.

We need to call a spade a spade. This is an attack on vulnerable people - people who find themselves insolvent, people who are going through the insolvency process, and people in respect of whose arrangements a PIP has recommended restructuring, which has been blocked by the bank. The Government has now restricted the fees available in such a way as to prevent those individuals enlisting the services of a barrister to fight the banks that are trying to block the arrangements suggested by the PIPs. When these reviews under section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 do come before the courts, 65% of debtors are successful. They actually beat the banks. That is probably the core of this change because the Government is in the pockets of the banks, it is on the side of the banks and it is always against the struggling debtors. We see that in a number of the initiatives this Government has brought in. This is scandalous and needs to be reversed. We need a level playing field. We cannot have a situation in which banks march in with teams of barristers and solicitors and in which vulnerable debtors - who, as I have said, usually win in these cases - are allowed to be left in vulnerable positions. I call on the Government to reverse this decision, even at this late stage, and to make sure that there is equality of representation in our courts.

The Legal Aid Board recently notified some changes to professional fees payable to lawyers and personal insolvency practitioners in cases that are legally aided under Abhaile. I should emphasise these measures do not reduce the protections afforded to borrowers under Abhaile, as has been claimed by the Deputy. Under section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, if creditors refuse a reasonable personal insolvency proposal by a borrower to resolve his or her mortgage arrears, the borrower’s PIP can apply to the court for review. The court has power to impose the proposal on creditors if satisfied that it is fair and reasonable to all parties.  Where legal aid is approved for a court review under Abhaile, the Legal Aid Board pays set fees to the PIP, the solicitor, the junior counsel and, where needed, the senior counsel representing the borrower. Under Abhaile, the Legal Aid Board has already approved legal aid for more than 1,000 court review applications. Some 64% of these were decided in favour of the borrower in the year ending June 2018. Two reasonable changes have been introduced to the fees for all professionals. First, the full fee will not be payable in undefended cases, that is, where no creditor opposes the court review. Second, personal insolvency cases often involve parallel applications by both partners where a couple has the same home mortgage. In practice, the vast majority of parallel applications are treated by the courts as single cases. There is no reason for taxpayers to cover two full fees in such cases. A full fee will be paid for one spouse and a reduced fee, equal to 10% of the full fee, will be paid for the second spouse in order to represent the actual extra work involved. There is no change to the legal aid fees payable to the PIP and the solicitor for a defended personal insolvency court review.  Barristers’ fixed fees are being reduced, but only to bring them into line with fees payable to them in other areas of civil legal aid where complex legal or procedural issues arise. It is not correct that borrowers will be left without barristers to argue their case.Barristers will not be approved automatically. In undefended cases, for example, there may be no need for a barrister, but the Legal Aid Board has expressly underlined that counsel will be approved where a creditor is raising legal issues that need to be argued by a barrister or in exceptional circumstances.

The specific example I gave was based on the case of a husband and wife with interlocking cases, in which the reality is that banks will spend €5,000 to €10,000. What is now being allowed, even in those exceptional circumstances where someone can get a barrister, is €1,200. That is not going to be enough to pay for a barrister. Nobody is going to take that job given the complexity of what is involved. To give the Minister of State an insight into that complexity, section 115 processes are complex. The brief would run from 300 to 500 pages, four or five affidavits and substantial exhibits. There is a substantial body of jurisprudence and one cannot expect a solicitor to do this alone. It should not be only in exceptional cases but as of right. This needs to be reversed.

It has done so in such a way that no barrister is going to take instructions from a solicitor knowing that the maximum amount payable to him or her is €1,200. Barristers know, because they see it in the courts, that the banks and vulture funds are losing these cases on the basis of the numbers and figures. What the banks and vulture funds are doing now is raising legal technical issues and homeowners will not be represented for that. The Government is literally throwing these debtors to the vultures, which is absolutely no surprise. It is not acceptable. The Minister of State talks about the principle of the Government being to keep families in their homes wherever possible. This is exactly the reverse of that. This is taking away the safety net of legal representation to fight the army of solicitors and barristers who walk into the courts with the banks and vulture funds. They know they are on the wrong side of the argument as has been proven in the past, when 65% of cases were ruled in favour of the borrowers, who have been able to remain in their homes. There is no reason for this to be cancelled. This comes in the same week as the Government was proclaiming the success of Abhaile. Within a number of days, it pulled the safety net from those using the Abhaile service and has seriously undermined the service as a result.

I emphasise that these changes do not undermine the free legal protection afforded to borrowers under Abhaile. Borrowers can still access full financial and legal aid services and help, including legal aid for a personal insolvency court review, without any charge. The Minister has already outlined, when launching the recent Abhaile reports, the priority that he attaches to the good work being done under Abhaile and to ensuring that the personal insolvency review will function effectively. It is emphatically not the case that borrowers will be left without a barrister to argue their case. Most will benefit from a PIP, a solicitor, a junior counsel and, wherever needed, a senior counsel. The Legal Aid Board expressly indicates that counsel will be approved if a creditor is raising legal points that need to be argued by a barrister. The question was raised that Abhaile does not also provide legal aid for contesting repossession proceedings. This criticism misses the point. Abhaile does not focus on contesting repossession proceedings because in most cases doing so will not help the borrower. As the lender still has an enforceable mortgage contract, it can reissue repossession proceedings as long as there are mortgage arrears. Instead, Abhaile focuses on getting into place an integrated solution to the arrears themselves in order that the borrower can remain in his or her home and return to solvency. This is a far more effective focus for public intervention. It is better for borrowers and for taxpayers. Meanwhile, Abhaile provides court mentors and duty solicitors to assist in ensuring that the repossession proceedings can be adjourned while the borrower is working with Abhaile to get a solution in place. I do not accept the assertions of the Deputies that we are throwing these people to the vultures. In my constituency of Wexford, I am aware of the important work Abhaile has done, which it will continue to do going into the future.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	343	I move:"That Dáil Éireann, in this the Centenary Year of its first meeting, re-committing itself to the imperative of the Democratic Programme and the principles of justice and equality, to support the development of all children, and in order to ensure a fair start for every child, declares that:— it is the first duty of Government to provide for the wellbeing, education and development of children, regardless of their origins, and to provide them all with an equal opportunity to contribute, to the extent of their abilities, to the economic, social and cultural life of the nation;— the accommodation of homeless families with children must be the immediate and urgent priority of housing policy;— all children born and raised in Ireland should be entitled to Irish citizenship, regardless of the nationality or migration status of their parents;— all children who are adopted should have access to information about their birth parents;— same-sex couples who are parents should have equal parenting rights to those afforded to opposite-sex couples;— the Government should ensure that quality childcare is genuinely available to all and is affordable;— all children should be entitled to a prompt assessment of any special needs and the provision of whatever support services they may need; and— the Government should ensure that primary education is genuinely free-of-charge, including through public funding of the cost of school books and uniforms and by outlawing mandatory contributions by parents to national schools; andcalls on the Government to:— immediately implement actions to ensure no children remain in homelessness;— immediately implement the Affordable Childcare Scheme announced in Budget 2019;— immediately implement its commitment to providing free-of-charge general practitioner care to all children under the age of 18;— prepare and implement a comprehensive strategy to eliminate consistent child poverty and material deprivation, with clear timeframes for its implementation; and— report to the Dáil no less than quarterly upon the implementation of this strategy and in particular to report on current numbers of children in consistent poverty or deprivation."  I propose to share time with my colleague, Deputy Sherlock. Decency, justice and equality are the Labour Party’s core values. Today we are talking about those values insofar as they apply to children and young people. When the Labour Party’s leader, Tom Johnson, wrote the 1919 Democratic Programme for the First Dáil 100 years ago, he stressed that the first duty of Government was towards the education, development and welfare of children. They are important words for us to listen to today. In the Labour Party’s new democratic programme for 2019, we restated this pledge as follows: "The first duty of Government is to provide for the wellbeing, education and development of the children, regardless of origins, and to give them all an equal chance to fulfil their potential." Statements of principle are important. They give people a clear signal of what we as a people, a Parliament and a party stand for. In fairness, if this motion just asked the Dáil to support giving all children an equal chance to fulfil their potential, I am sure everyone in the Chamber from all political persuasions would vote to support it. However, our motion is not merely about fine words or statements of exhortation. We have set out in real terms the measures that are needed for the Government to fulfil its duty towards all children in this country. The Government must end homelessness for families with children. Legal changes are needed to grant citizenship to all children born and raised in Ireland. These are real issues affecting children in this nation today. Legislation is needed to give information about birth parents to adopted children. They have been denied such information for decades. Legislation is needed to ensure complete equal parenting rights for same-sex couples. I know all of these matters will be close to the heart of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. However, we need to act upon them. Public spending is needed to make affordable, quality childcare available to all who need it. Public spending is needed to ensure prompt assessment of any special needs that a child might have, such as autism, and the provision of support services to address those needs once identified. Public spending is needed to provide genuinely free-of-charge primary education. We have all talked for years about free primary education but there are real unmet costs that are barriers to full participation for some of our children. I could point out the inequalities and injustices that continue to occur in each of these areas. My colleagues will address some of these areas in more detail. I just want to concentrate on two points. First, there is a reason we talk about childhood as a person’s formative years. It is that experience that is a person's best teacher. However, experience can also be the worst teacher. If a child’s experience of family life is cramped bed and breakfast accommodation, a hotel room or emergency homeless accommodation, if that is the early childhood experience, the outcomes will not be good. If a child’s experience of family life is stressed parents, it will be no surprise if that child does not thrive in school afterwards or if he or she develops other problems in later life.If we fail in our duty towards a child, we do not just leave the person worse off: as a society we are all the poorer. We lose the contribution that individual could have made to the development of the nation and our society if we had given him or her the capacity to reach his or her full potential. Of course, some children come through the most harrowing and difficult of backgrounds and go on to achieve great things, despite, not because of, the adversity. We know that many other children are held back by their early formative years and it can be so hard, if not impossible, for schools and support services to undo or reverse the harm done in the early years of a child's formation. It is, therefore, incumbent on us, as a Parliament, to redouble our efforts, refocus and commit to provide the best possible chance we can for our youngest citizens. My second point is on the issue of citizenship. If a child is born and reared in Ireland, he or she has never lived elsewhere and has no deep connection to another country, he or she should, by right, be entitled to Irish citizenship. The issue is about the residency status of parents. In the United States the children of illegal migrants are known as "dreamers", a phrase of which I am sure the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, is well aware. There is a generation of "dreamers" in Ireland, too. They are children and young adults whose parents perhaps overstayed their work visa or came here as tourists and subsequently took up work, just as countless numbers of Irish people have done in the United States. We have to enforce our migration laws, but we do not have to blame innocent children for the mistakes or decisions made by their parents. That is why it is so important that we do not leave any of Ireland’s children in this legal limbo. It is not good enough that some children get a special deal because they happen to live in a constituency that is represented by a member of the Government, while at the same time unknown others are deported or living restricted lives because they do not have access to citizenship.  The Labour Party’s motion is about providing a fair start for every child in Ireland. The Labour Party has participated in eight Governments since the foundation of the State, in every one of which we have delivered better quality public services. This Fine Gael-led Government which includes the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has not delivered on the promises it made to children in the programme for Government. The motion specifically calls on the Government to deliver on its commitments to ensure no children will remain homeless; implement the affordable childcare scheme announced in budget 2019; implement the commitment to provide free GP care for all those under 18 years; and implement the commitment to lift at least 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by next year. These are important objectives which were freely entered into by the parties who entered government and should be delivered on. The Minister said in the programme for Government that she would achieve these things. We have survived the economic crash and money is now available. The Government has the money and the opportunity to make the necessary investments to deliver on its promises to the children of the nation. Instead, the Taoiseach has repeatedly offered tax cuts to higher earners, rather than investing to address these fundamental issues. That is at the heart of the question. The Labour Party wants the State to invest public funds for the benefit of children. It is not about cash payments but about investment in a national system of affordable childcare, special needs services for all children and comprehensive free primary education. It is about legislation to address the injustices that I have outlined and preparing and implementing a comprehensive strategy to eliminate consistent child poverty and material deprivation.  The Government’s amendment to the motion does show some progress. I do not deny that there has been some, but the Government is not delivering on its commitments. I regret that it has tabled such an amendment because it distracts from the core failings of its own policies. If it continues with its current policies, we will not eliminate child homelessness, the affordable childcare scheme will not be implemented, parents will still pay for GP visits for children aged seven and 18 years and far too many children will remain in poverty. This is Labour Party's wake up call for the Government. If the Government is sincere in its commitments to Ireland’s children, in this the centenary year of the inaugural sitting of the First Dáil, it needs to address these real matters. Let us, as the national Parliament, across all benches, give that commitment, without reservation or a vote, to the children of the nation.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16863	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	As a signatory to the motion, I support it. I will speak specifically about the early years sector and quote from the most recent Pobal report, The Early Years Sector Profile Report 2017-2018, because it paints a particular picture of the state of the sector. I will also speak specifically for the workers within the sector, in the first instance, because there are clear issues with wages and the high level of qualifications required, combined with the lack of commensurate pay structures to reflect them. There is also an issue in retaining staff. I will quote from the early years sector profile report, with which the the Minister, Deputy Zappone, will be very familiar, as she wrote the foreword. The report shows that the average wage of an early years assistant is €11.20 per hour across 48% of all staff within the sector. That figure is 70 cent lower than the so-called living wage. The average rate of pay for all staff working directly with children is approximately €12.17 per hour. The report is very interesting. It also addresses those who have high qualifications but earn low wages. For instance, 60% of those working directly with children earn less than the living wage. The report also shows that job title has the biggest influence on wages, followed by length of time in the sector and length of time in a particular service. Qualifications was the fourth most important factor, accounting for a figure of 10% when it comes to exerting influence on how wages are calculated. This shows that there is a certain degree of informality in the sector which is not, as we know, recognised as a sector in its own right. There are disparate wage rates across it. The issue of qualifications is important. Staff in the sector are becoming more qualified, with 94% having level 5 qualifications or higher. The figure was 92% in 2016-17 and 88% in 2015-16. For level 6 qualifications, the figure is 65%. It was 63% last year and 56% in 2015-16. We are seeing a gradual rise in the level of educational attainment. Despite this, 57%, or 2,256 services, report having problems in finding suitably qualified staff to fill vacancies. That figure has increased by 10% since last year. Some of the figures I am quoting are taken directly from the report. The Minister has acknowledged that skilled and highly qualified staff are a vital component of childcare provision.She said that the report also highlighted the ongoing issue of staff wages and that she was fully aware that retaining qualified staff remained a concern for many services. What we need to see is a commitment from Government, or at least a greater degree of energy from Government, to address the issue of the retention rates within the sector. What we are clearly seeing from the evidence of campaigns like the Big Start campaign by SIPTU, for example, is that the rate of attrition from the sector is too high. There is no formal sectoral employment order. It is increasingly difficult to organise workers within the sector. It is quite challenging because of the disparate nature of the sector. I trust I am not misquoting the Minister on the matter but she has acknowledged the potential impact of a sectoral employment order, something to which she has given words of support in the past. If it was put in a formal setting, then we could at least address the retention rates, recognise the qualifications of workers and prevent the high rate of attrition. People are going off to other sectors to become special needs assistants or teachers or even emigrating and working in the same sector abroad. Those of us in the House need to recognise the issues around that. The Government should come to the table or at least be more proactive in recognising the need. The Minister is talking about expanding services. The Minister has referred to increasing her budget line year-on-year on a cumulative basis for this sector. She will tell us how her budget line is increasing, I imagine, when she is on her feet presently. There is no point in increasing the budget line, although it is necessary, if the rate of attrition of staff is increasing year on year. The early years sector profile report is showing us clear evidence of that. We cannot ask services to take on more additionality or children if the capability or capacity is not there because of a lack of staffing and that is a major issue. I wish to acknowledge the work of the Big Start campaign. Those of us across the political divide have given our support to the campaign. Politically, everyone in the House has acknowledged the validity of the campaign and the need to organise workers across the sector. We can start that process with the sectoral employment order. That would address issues like pay, pensions and sick pay. It would build a strong coherent voice for the sector. Individual Deputies should not be coming into the House, at this late stage in 2019, when we do not even have a formal structured affordable childcare scheme up and running. There should be no need for the workers to have to continue to organise themselves in order that they can get a sectoral employment order. This should have been achieved a long time ago. Perhaps now is the time for Government to address this. Given the Minister's commitment or support for the idea of the workers being organised, perhaps she could intervene to try to influence matters by being as proactive as she possibly can. I put down a question for the Minister on the affordable childcare scheme last year. I wanted to know when the affordable childcare scheme would be formally up and running. An announcement was made in budget 2019. Yet, if I am interpreting the Minister correctly we will not see the roll-out of the affordable childcare scheme until the end of this year. By any rational analysis, it is fair to assume that it may not actually take place until 2020. I asked the Minister when the affordable childcare scheme would be up and running or put in place. She replied that work was currently ongoing on the secondary legislation and the formal policy guidelines. She said work was currently ongoing on the development of the regulations and that the regulations would be introduced in advance of the affordable childcare scheme to allow school-age childcare services to register and thereby participate in the scheme from its inception. The Minister went on to say that the scheme's information and communications technology system had concluded the full public procurement process and that the contract was awarded. She said work was under way on the governance, administrative and communication elements of the scheme. She continued:Consultation and engagement with stakeholders is ongoing and, in the new year, a comprehensive awareness campaign will be launched for parents and the public, alongside training and information supports for childcare providers and other key stakeholders. Finally, Budget 2019 provided for enhancements to the scheme which will ensure that an even greater number of families will now benefit from the scheme once launched. In the few seconds remaining to me I want to get a sense from the Minister of where the architecture of the affordable childcare scheme is at this point. That is one of the key questions we have on this side of the House. I also want to ask the Minister about the recent Pobal and ESRI report on the link between the cost of childcare and the fact that there are lower rates of access to childcare among those who are lone parents. The issue is one this society needs to deal with and I hope the Minister will respond to that. Thank you for your latitude with time, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

With this in mind I welcome the tabling of this motion by the members, the gentlemen of the Labour Party. The Government's actions and commitment are reflected in the countermotion. We must invest if we want to deliver for our children. In the case of my Department, the gross funding being made available in 2019 is a little over €1.5 billion. The Deputy suggested I would refer to that. Many Deputies will be aware of our radical new approach to childcare. A 117% increase in investment since 2015 has seen the families of 84,000 children getting extra supports. This year's €574 million investment brings us to a new milestone, that is, the affordable childcare scheme, to which one of the Deputies referred at length. We are using the opportunity to deliver more benefits. Changes in thresholds will see an estimated 7,500 more children benefit from the scheme, while over 40,000 other children who are already eligible will get extra. Getting us to this point has been a major task. New laws were needed as well as one of the most complex information technology projects undertaken by Government in recent years. We are building a childcare infrastructure that will last for generations. I will directly answer the Deputy's question. During my last set of meetings with my officials, we discussed how we are on target in respect of the 2019 hoped-for full implementation. As Minister, I am honoured to have been able to bring the budget for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, past €750 million for the first time ever. This supports care and social workers who are transforming lives in our communities every day. I have seen this work at first hand. It also allowed us to end the 20 years of debate across five Governments to make mandatory reporting a reality, something demanded by children's rights experts and campaigners. Of course the demands are big and must be responded to. Only two weeks ago I was delighted to join Tusla and the HSE to launch a new training resource that gives front-line teams the skills to identify hidden harm. This important initiative will ensure care, social and addiction workers can respond when the behaviour of addicted parents impacts on children. An estimated 600,000 children are at risk in our country. The spirit and specifics of the Labour Party motion are responded to comprehensively in the recent publication of the First 5 strategy.For the first time ever there is a ten-year plan to improve the lives of babies, very young children and their families. The Department of Health will develop a dedicated child health workforce. The Departments of Justice and Equality and of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will have initiatives to support parents to balance working and caring responsibilities. This is an exciting time and I look forward to giving an update and an implementation plan after Easter.  Where children are homeless, my Department works closely with Tusla to provide supports. Tusla provides spaces where homeless children and families can avail of services in a safe, warm, welcoming space and where they feel comfortable and respected, and therefore mitigates some of the impact of being in the settings to which the Deputy referred. Funding is now available to approved housing bodies to acquire accommodation for young people leaving State care under the capital assistance scheme, CAS, operated by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. At the end of December 2018, a total of 50 properties had been acquired under CAS. Thirty units have been sold, 20 units are at sale agreed and ten young people have been housed. These figures will increase in 2019. The Government is determined to increase the stock of social housing by 50,000 homes by 2021 under Rebuilding Ireland, with money ring-fenced to achieve this. There is a 25% increase in the current spending budget for the provision of homeless services, bringing the total for 2019 to €146 million. In addition, €60 million in capital funding was provided in 2018 to allow for development of further homeless facilities including family hubs. The Government already has a strategy in place to deal with child poverty. Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures includes a target that the number of children in consistent poverty in 2011 be reduced by two thirds by 2020. At a meeting with the advisory council this morning, we discussed how we can continue to move towards that goal in an increasingly ambitious manner. A whole-of-Government approach to tackling child poverty is being adopted, building on the lifecycle approach in the national action plan for social inclusion and informed by the European Commission's recommendation on investing in children and breaking the cycle of disadvantage. I am committed to progressing the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 to Committee Stage in Seanad Éireann as quickly as possible. This legislation provides adopted people and other relevant people with statutory rights to information and to a tracing service. It also protects relevant records by bringing them into the custody of the Adoption Authority of Ireland. The Bill seeks to balance the rights to identity and to privacy. I continue to actively explore all options to facilitate the release of as much information as possible to adopted and other relevant persons and will introduce any necessary amendments on Committee Stage. In light of my very intensive negotiations with the Attorney General and his office, I anticipate that I will table improved recommendations and amendments on Committee Stage. Parents need support. The increasing focus on parenting has developed in a somewhat fragmented way across Departments and State agencies. This is why in November 2018, my Department established a dedicated parenting support policy unit, to help realise the State’s duty in supporting parents by leading out on the important work of co-ordinating policy direction and activity relating to parenting support. The new parenting support policy unit will collaborate with others to streamline and improve existing parenting supports to ensure that all parents are supported to parent confidently and positively. The Adoptive Leave Act 1995 provides for an entitlement to 24 weeks adoptive leave for an employed adopting mother or a sole male adopter. The Department of Justice and Equality identified a lacuna in the Act that prevents male same-sex married couples from availing of adoptive leave and benefits. It has prepared draft legislative proposals to amend the Act to afford the same entitlements to adoptive leave and benefits to all couples who are married, co-habiting or who are in a civil partnership, irrespective of gender. These amendments will be included alongside legislative provisions to introduce a new paid parental leave scheme announced as part of budget 2019. It is expected the legislation will be progressed this year. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, is also concerned that the issue of parenting rights for same-sex couples should be addressed speedily, as am I. To this end, the Government has approved the preparation of the civil registration Bill 2019. Commencement of these amendments is also dependent on commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. The Minister for Health intends that these provisions will be commenced as soon as possible. Deputy Howlin raised the matter of citizenship. The motion seeks to introduce new rules to provide for citizenship by naturalisation of all children born and raised in Ireland irrespective of the nationality or migration status of their parents. This proposes to change existing citizenship legislation including the changes introduced following the 27th amendment to the Constitution. Existing citizenship laws have been carefully calibrated. Ireland, in most cases, adopts less onerous requirements than many other member states. Ireland confers citizenship to a child born on the island of Ireland if one or other of its parents has been lawfully resident on the island of Ireland for three out of the last four years. Any changes, as outlined in this motion, to citizenship laws must be carefully considered. Since 2010, just over 27,000 children, the vast majority of whom were born to non-EEA nationals, have become citizens of Ireland through naturalisation. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, wants to give parents a strong voice in ensuring school costs are kept to a minimum. He intends to ask schools to develop a parent and student charter. It is intended that every school will be required to set out a financial statement. The Deputy has mentioned the many changes that have been made to GP care. I hope it is clear to the House that the Government is pursuing a broad-based, ambitious and necessary strategy, underpinned by actions, to ensure that our children receive the very best of services and the very best start in life; a fair start that they deserve and nothing less.

#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	361	We are all learning here this evening; that is good. We all agree there should be a fair start for children. The motion is very welcome and timely. It encapsulates everything from well-being to education and health, social welfare, disabilities, childcare, citizenship and child and family relationships. Deputy Howlin spoke of life experiences, which is something I believe in. I believe it does not matter whether one comes from Dublin or Galway, from a single-parent family, a family with two parents whether same-sex or not, from a four-parent family or raised by one's grandparents; factors such as parents or geography should not define a person in any way. It has fallen on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to come before us but many other Ministers are missing who might be sitting beside her, namely, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputies Flanagan and Stanton, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputies Harris and Jim Daly, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, because what is needed is a whole-of-Government and a whole-of-Department approach. While the motion is very broad, it is really good and if we want to be serious about moving on after 100 years, we should return here in a few months and discuss this motion with all of the Minister's colleagues in government. Let them all talk to us about the various aspects which we are discussing tonight. The Fianna Fáil amendment makes a number of calls on the Government. They include facilitating the swift passage of the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2017, allowing for the swift passage of the Shared Maternity Benefit and Leave Bill 2018, immediately commencing Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015; immediately implementing actions to ensure no child remains homeless and implementing the affordable childcare scheme, as announced in budget 2019. I acknowledge the Minister has addressed this point eloquently. They also include addressing the extremely lengthy waiting periods that are faced by children awaiting a disability assessment, a subject into which my colleagues undoubtedly will go in depth, increasing the availability of vital disability services for children, including occupational therapy and speech and language therapy and increasing capitation funding to schools around the country, thus reducing the need for parental contributions. This is a point to which Deputy Howlin already has referred. The amendment also calls on the Government to immediately establish a register in order to facilitate adopted persons' access to information surrounding their birth and to enable mutually agreed upon exchanges, in the form of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016, the arrival of which in this House would be welcome. It also calls on the Government to prepare and implement a comprehensive strategy to eliminate consistent child poverty and material deprivation, with clear timeframes for its implementation and to report to the Dáil on this strategy on a quarterly basis. The Minister and I are used to taking Question Time on a monthly basis. The motion brings it all together well. Some 100 years on, the gaps are shocking. What my party is looking for is not to be critical. I do not want to wait for the future but to deal with the issues in the here and now - the thousands of children who are trying to access services; the number who need to have special needs assistants appointed; and the number who need classroom provision that is properly equipped to deal with them. No child should have to leave his or her community to receive an education. It should be provided within the school. If we need to establish an ASD unit, so be it. Capitation grants must be provided to allow it to happen. Capacity will be a significant issue in the early years sector in the future. We must ensure we will have the ability to cater for all children, regardless of location. In modern Ireland it is unacceptable that almost one in four children is experiencing ongoing deprivation and that 105,000 children are living in consistent poverty. The experience of poverty and deprivation has a profound impact on a child's ability to develop well and flourish. It also has a profound impact on how a child's life is shaped, how he or she views the future and how he or she is pitched within it. It has a major impact on a child's well-being and mental health and how he or she engages with friends in the school yard. When the Minister discusses the DEIS model with her Government colleagues, it must be the case that every child will receive a good lunch at school. I have seen advertisements about this recently. A little boy opens a lunchbox and feels guilty about not having a proper lunch. He makes an excuse to go and wash his hands. When he comes back, his lunchbox has been filled by his friends. It was a meaningful advertisement. Children are very aware of the position of others, but we should not put responsibility for sorting out adults' problems on the shoulders of young people. We should try to sort out some of them. My colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, speaks about his school where certain parents bring extra lunches to provide for children who might not have any. The Government should consider this matter.
#FionaOLoughlin	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-party	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-dob	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	362	I thank my colleagues on the Labour Party benches for tabling the motion. Although we have tabled an amendment to it, we are behind its principle and vision. No matter what we hear from the other side of the House, there is no doubt that the health system is failing too many young people. It is not just me or any other member of an Opposition party who is saying this. In his report last year the Ombudsman for Children spoke about having received almost 2,000 complaints highlighting the stark failure of the HSE and Tusla to act in children's best interests. The number grows every year. The issue is not just one of health but also education. It is about every Department working together to ensure young people will have the best start in life in order that they can become the best they can be.  The Ombudsman for Children also spoke about his serious concerns about how suicidal young people accessed emergency services. As a member of the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care, some of the most stocking statistics and stories we heard were related to young people who desperately needed the intervention of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the lack of a response from the system. The final figures we received for November showed that 2,568 children were still awaiting assessments and that 295 had been left waiting for longer than one year. These are particularly shameful figures. In modern Ireland it is unacceptable that almost one in four children experiences ongoing deprivation and that 105,000 children are living in consistent poverty. This experience of poverty and deprivation has a profound impact on every child's ability, immediately giving a child a disadvantaged start in life. It is important that children with disabilities, for example, undergo appropriate assessments and interventions within the first five years of their lives to help them to navigate what will be a difficult world. At the end of October, 36,531 people were waiting for speech and language therapy, most of whom were children, while 6,531 children had been waiting for longer than one year for their first assessment for occupational therapy. In the light of these shocking figures, much more needs to be done, including providing greater support for parents in their caring roles.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	363	I show my support for the amendment which is timely and important. Considering that this is 2019, many children are getting a raw deal. Let us take homelessness, for example. There is not a night that I go to bed that I do not think about the appalling situation of children sleeping in hotel rooms. It behoves all of us to sort out this matter as quickly as possible. There are 6,251 children on outpatient lists. Some of them have been on them for more than two years. A further 1,000 have been waiting since 2016. These appalling statistics affect young people and their parents. Enduring the trauma of having a sick child is bad enough; enduring the trauma of having to wait years to avail of badly needed services is another major challenge. We should take seriously the issue of extended parental leave. The Minister might listen to me a little better than other Ministers who have not listened to me at all. I am a strong advocate and supporter of extended parental leave. The reality of the world in which we live is that many parents in my part of the country get out of their bed at 4.30 a.m. to travel to Dublin to work and get home at 9 p.m. or 9.30 p.m. They tell me that their kids are still in bed in the morning when they leave and have gone to bed by the time they get home at night. That is not acceptable. Last November saw the launch of the First 5 strategy. Unless I am mistaken, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Health and one other Minister were present and the Taoiseach stated he would support the call for extended parental leave. It appears that, although the Government will support the call, it will extend the leave entitlement over a period of two and a half years. This issue should be tackled, given the great strain and stress placed on many families.
#JackieCahill	unknown-#JackieCahill-party	unknown-#JackieCahill-dob	unknown-#JackieCahill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	364	Like my colleagues, I will focus on the HSE and the way the health service is failing young people. They have cited figures for the numbers of children on waiting lists.I am conscious of the anxiety of parents who are waiting for their child's assessment. Those parents are gravely concerned that the waiting will make the resolution of their child's problems more difficult. The waiting lists for children with suspected learning difficulties are frightening. Here, too, we have parents concerned that the difficulties are worsening while they cannot get a proper diagnosis. An answer to a parliamentary question that I tabled recently stated there were 337 children in my county of Tipperary under 13 years of age waiting for orthodontic treatment - 102 waiting up to one year, 107 waiting up to two years, and 66 waiting up to three years or more. This is shocking. While these children are languishing on a waiting list, the damage that can be done to them for future years is impossible to comprehend. Dental experts explain that the longer they are left waiting, the harder it will be to put things right. The HSE should be far more active in the treatment abroad scheme. These children should be sent to Northern Ireland, if necessary, to get this treatment. I have been fighting hard for a Jigsaw project in Tipperary. All the work has been done, including representatives of the local authority, and all that is missing is the funding. We have been promised this since I was elected to this House in 2016. A Jigsaw project would play a significant part in trying to deal with mental health issues for young people in my county. There is no mental health bed in my county, but to be refused the resources for a Jigsaw scheme is intolerable. If we got these resources, it would help to prevent some of the common tragedies within our community. I am looking for the Minister's support in calling for that funding for Tipperary.
#MargaretMurphyOMahony	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-party	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-dob	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	My colleagues have highlighted the wide-ranging consequences that have come to pass as a result of the Government's failings when it comes to the children of our country. As my party's spokesperson for disabilities, I will concentrate on the issues that pertain especially to my brief. I am also aware from my constituency work in Cork South-West of the many families affected by having their children waiting on lists. It is not only the child but the whole family unit that is affected. The number of children who languish on waiting lists is simply incredible. I have been highlighting this matter consistently since 2017, and yet at the end of October 2018, more than 36,500 people were awaiting speech and language therapy and a further 23,000 were awaiting occupational therapy. The majority of these were children. The HSE service plans over a number of consecutive years provided for 129 children's disability network teams to be put in place by the end of last year. To date, 56 teams are in place. This is hardly a resounding success. Worse still, even with the significant numbers waiting more than a year for first assessments for occupational therapy, OT, there are no additional occupational therapists put in place to address the situation. This makes a mockery of the statutory six months turnaround from when a child enters the system. It is well documented that if children are to stand any chance, early intervention is vital. As for speech and language therapy, sadly, the number of therapists employed has reduced rather than increased. Budget 2019 provides for the recruitment of 100 additional therapists. With the number of therapists falling, the Government is, unfortunately, on the back foot from the start. When will reality set in?
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	366	Nelson Mandela said, "There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children." Indeed, Aristotle said, "Give me a child until he is seven and I will give you the man". These both ring true in this motion by the Labour Party, but particularly in the wording of it which refers to "every child". In my conversation with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, when she was appointed to the position, I congratulated her but referred to the need for education for life. I also said that while the Minister's work and the focus on her work would be laudable, she would not be judged by her success, which had been laudable to that date, but by the failure of those children who were slipping through the gaps, of which there were and are many. My colleagues have referred to homelessness and people, especially children, living in temporary unsuitable accommodation. That in itself tells me that we are failing every child. Others have referred to healthcare - children on waiting lists, children suffering with autism and, indeed, the need for early intervention. My colleague, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, referred to the issue of disability and respite. While strides have been made there, we are still failing the families of those with a disability. There is a daily crisis in many of these sectors. The Minister referred to the pathway for citizenship. In my constituency there are asylum seekers in Mosney. The pathway for those children's education, while laudable at primary level and secondary level, is often made difficult by the failure to be able to achieve success at third level despite the fact that many of their parents have third level education. There is a need to rectify that. That day I spoke to the Minister, I spoke about the prescriptive curriculum we have for the modern age and the need to impart those skills for learning for life. That leads me to the issue of the capitation grant. As a primary school principal of 35 years' standing, to suggest that we have free education, and particularly where capitation grants and such like are barely paying the heating and insurance bills in school, speaks for itself in terms of the Minister's need to get real in that Department. I welcome her statement where she indicated about schools having to set out a financial statement, but that will not solve the problem. On the issue of the affordable childcare scheme, will the Minister clearly outline the timeframe for introducing the measures that she announced in 2017? Many families are struggling to afford childcare and those thresholds need to be increased for those families. I thank the Minister for her work but she will be rated on the basis of those we are failing.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	367	I support the motion put forward by the Labour Party. It quite correctly calls for a fair start for every child in Ireland. All young people should be able to reach their potential regardless of family background and of how much money their parents have in their pockets. Unfortunately, many young people in this city and island grow up in poverty and homeless. One judges a society by how it treats its most vulnerable, and children who are homeless, children with disabilities, children in State care, and children in direct provision centres all need to be prioritised because they are our most vulnerable citizens. The motion speaks about childcare. It has been shown time and again that investment in early years education has a positive effect on children's development and ends up benefiting both society and the economy in the long run. Parents should not have to pay the equivalent of a second mortgage for childcare, but neither should childcare workers, who are skilled workers, be paid so little. The motion speaks about the rights of adopted persons to their family history. With everything we have learned in recent years of the illegal adoption scandal, this is very important. We saw protests outside the Dáil last week by same-sex parents demanding that the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 be implemented. Same-sex parents are still being discriminated against when it comes to parental rights, and this has a major impact on their children in terms of their legal and guardianship rights. The delay in sorting this out has been unacceptable. We have a lot more to do. The Proclamation of 1916 spoke about "cherishing all the children of the nation equally", and that is as relevant today as it was when it was written.

Unfortunately this is the case. Ireland has failed many children. We are aware that children are living in consistent poverty all over the world. Ireland, however, is a wealthy country and no child in Ireland should be living in poverty. There is no doubt that Government policy is contributing to this disgraceful situation. The recovery in the economy still has not reached those who need it most and consistent poverty remains intergenerational in the most deprived areas of the country and in the most deprived minority communities. This cannot ever be acceptable. Consistent well-being, fair access to education and balanced development of children is of vital importance in allowing every child the opportunity to succeed in life from an economic, social and cultural perspective. This is not happening. I listened to a radio interview yesterday about delivering hot meals to DEIS schools around the State on a pilot basis. This service is funded through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. It was heartening to hear the little children's voices and their welcome for these hearty and nutritious meals. Credit where credit is due and bualadh bos. Homelessness, however, and children living in emergency accommodation is on a scale that is quite simply unforgivable, and will live long in the memory of this generation of Irish people. Child homelessness did not just happen. It was caused by a fundamental failure in Government policy. It was caused in the first instance by the previous administration of Fianna Fáil and deepened by Fine Gael and the proponents of this motion, the Labour Party. I am happy to give my full support to the motion. Child homelessness is a shameful consequence of the blinkered and uncaring policies pursued by these parties then, and continuing in the case of some. Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, Barnardos, the Children's Rights Alliance and many others have consistently said that the policies employed by the Government are not working. These groups have warned about the impact the policies are having and will have on children's development and psychological well-being into the future. Will the Minister, Deputy Zappone, indicate if anybody is listening? Is the Minister being listened to? I wish her well.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	I welcome the motion put forward by the Labour Party. I agree with the sentiments expressed, the motion and the proposals. I cannot emphasise enough how much I agree with the motion when it says "it is the first duty of Government to provide for the wellbeing, education and development of children". I am at a loss, however, as to why the Labour Party did not come to the same conclusions when it was in government not that long ago. Everything the Labour Party has said in the motion makes sense. Labour was in government with Fine Gael and had the Ministers who could have implemented many of these proposals. Not only did the Labour Party not do that, it did the opposite. The Labour Party in particular brought in some of the cruellest and most vicious cuts specifically targeted at the most vulnerable in society. Far from giving children a fair start Labour crippled their chances to rise out of disadvantage and poverty.

I shall just focus on two points that I have raised previously with the Minister. First is the category of young people who are leaving care, an issue that is very often forgotten. It is my firm and long-held view that there is not adequate support for young people leaving care. There is a statutory entitlement to an aftercare plan but that is just a plan on a piece of paper. I believe there needs to be a statutory right to aftercare. I realise there are recruitment and retention issues for workers in this regard, but it is badly needed. These young people have already been failed on several occasions in their lives and the least they deserve is a good, well-supported transition into adulthood. I am afraid this is not happening currently. My second point is on childcare. I believe we have come at it in a very piecemeal way in recent years. We need to have a vision of where we are going to get to a place where childcare is provided as a right, where it is a public service provided by a well-remunerated and well-supported workforce providing quality, early years education and care. To achieve that we have to get away from the constant approach of providing piecemeal subsidies on different bits and pieces of schemes. I am aware that they are being rolled into one as part of the affordable childcare scheme but I do not believe that this is the right route ultimately. We need to work towards the way education is provided in schools through the Department of Education and Skills. We need to provide childcare as a public service. It cannot be done in the unsustainable way that we have been doing it. The Minister said that childcare workers can organise and try to get a sectoral employment order, SEO, but I do not think that is good enough. The childcare schemes devised by the Department are based on calculations that acknowledge that the wages paid to childcare workers are inadequate and unsustainable. If we are to build a reasonable childcare system worthy of the supposed prosperous country that Ireland is, we need to invest in the wages of childcare workers, develop sustainable community and publicly funded services that can provide a quality service to all. We will not achieve that if we keep pursuing the approach of providing subsidies to private providers in the community. While the subsidies are good they will not, ultimately, give us the sustainable basis.
#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	382	We could not argue with any of the content of the Labour Party motion. In the 100 years since the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil child inequality is now, as it was then, compounded by social class. This is a "C" word we should use more often. Disadvantage is determined by political policy and postal address. Class or location should never define a person’s ability to thrive but class is an economic reality. The consequences of class-based society mean that 130,000 children still live in consistent poverty. This disproportionately affects single parents and Traveller families. This was compounded by the policy of the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, on the one-parent family payment in 2012. Many lone parents will never forgive or forget the Labour Party for those cuts. Those deep cuts were social vandalism by the Labour Party, which is supposed to represent working people. The party stabbed people in the back. Those who live and work in the low-wage economy are the working poor, which also affects children. Other consequences of the class-based society are the nearly 3,500 children who live in emergency accommodation. Anybody would find it quite extraordinary and shocking that 3,500 children have no home but a hotel to live in. This is completely unacceptable. The trauma of this for those children is incalculable. I do not know how the Government Deputies can sleep at night when they know that 3,500 children do not have a home. There are also waiting times for essential services such as the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and for speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.In relation to the scandal of CAMHS, some children have to wait for up to two years for assessment. It is incredible vandalism to visit on children in a society. Incredibly, parents are now bringing the State to court on foot of the Disability Act which this House passed in 2005. The Act provides that children must be assessed within a certain period, but the Government cannot meet its six-month deadline. The Government is actually breaking its own laws. That is where children are at today. What does it say about Ireland and the political establishment? What about child poverty and its effect on every individual? Revolutionary socialists must act on the political upheaval in society. Child poverty, homelessness and long waiting times cannot be allowed to be normalised. Tackling child poverty is a task for revolutionary socialists and the people out there who can address this crisis.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	383	I support the motion and will vote for it. It is correct to draw attention to the absence of a fair chance at equality and a fair start for children. One of the most difficult things we deal with in our case work is when we meet children who live in hotels and the like night after night. It is an incredible disruption in people's lives and it will continue to impact on them in the long run. As such, I support the motion. However, it would be hypocritical of those of us who protested against the policies of the Labour Party in government and the attacks on children it implemented to voice support for the motion while forgetting about everything that happened. It is fair and reasonable to expect there to be a relationship between words and deeds in politics. People find it disgusting that there is not and that when in opposition, people say all the right things whereas in government, they do all the wrong things, unfortunately. It is not a question of having nothing positive to say. I will say some positive things at the end regarding what I think needs to happen.

Social Justice Ireland said families with children were among the greatest casualties of that budget. It described as "draconian" cuts to child benefit for the third child and subsequent children as well as to the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance when almost one in five children was at risk of poverty. Social Justice Ireland said the cumulative effect of the cuts would make life unbearable for many individuals and families. St. Vincent de Paul said of Deputy Burton's second budget that a lone parent with three children who had returned to third level education would lose a minimum of €906 a year as a result of the then Minister's welfare cuts.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	390	Child benefit cuts were made in every budget from 2012 to 2014 and the total cuts for a family with four children came to €104 a month. There were cuts to the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance in every budget. The cumulative loss in payments to a lone parent with two children working part-time and earning €200 per week as a result of Deputy Burton's cuts from 2011 to 2016 was €1,430 a year, which was an income loss of 12%. The Labour Party is absolutely correct to highlight the figures for child homelessness, but those figures were not even counted before that party was in government because it was such a negligible factor.

Some people got a lot of money in that time. Childcare costs are obviously astronomical but the answer is not to outsource the State's responsibility to provide it by subsidising private childcare. The answer is to invest in a massive State-run and publicly-owned childcare system like the systems which already exist in several EU member states, including Spain and Italy, while ensuring the workers in that system are well-paid as opposed to the current condition of poverty wages.

It is far from a fair start they are getting. From the number of homeless children to the long waiting lists for children's hospital and consultant appointments and the lack of adequate special needs assistants, SNAs, and resources, how can the Government think it is doing well by children living here? Homelessness is a serious issue and the number of homeless families is unacceptable. More than one in three people in emergency accommodation are children. We need the Government to provide more affordable housing. I have listened enough to the plans and various reports the Government has on the matter. I want to see real results on the ground. My offices in west Cork are inundated with constituents who have waited for years on the housing list. Some are living with their children in awful, substandard accommodation. Many are living in houses with damp, mould and funguses growing on the walls and ceilings. No child should have to endure such living conditions in this day and age. Does the Government comprehend the crisis facing children who are waiting for hospital and consultant appointments? Last year, Barnardos reported that more than 37,000 children were waiting for mental health, disability and speech and language treatment nationally. Adding insult to injury, the report highlighted that some children had yet to receive an initial assessment while 78% with a disability or suspected disability were overdue an assessment. This is outrageous and the Government cannot allow it to continue. In talking about a fair start for every child, we cannot forget this evening the local voluntary groups which provide excellent supports and services to families and children in their areas. In my own area of west Cork, the Jack & Friends support centre, formally known as Bandon Autism Parent Support, is an excellent resource for children and their families. The group is holding its official opening on Saturday week and I wish them every success. They have worked very hard and moved to a beautiful premises in Bandon which will bring much joy to the children of the town and its surrounding areas. I welcomed the Government's announcement last May that there will be an overhaul of the special needs assessment scheme in schools. SNAs do amazing work and must be supported. We must ensure that all children who require resource hours will get all the hours they need. Having spoken to people on the ground, it is clear to me that we still have an issue with the time it takes to assess a child and put in place resources. The Government must recognise the problem and tackle the waiting list for once and for all.

Children should not have to be put in places such as this. I appeal to the Minister to rectify this anomaly. The homeless centres we have are not adequate. When people are evicted from their houses or when their tenancies are taken from them, families find themselves in these very unfortunate situations. It is very wrong and hurtful for children at the start of their days. It was an ideology of de Valera that all the children of the country should be cherished equally. I also regret what the Labour Party did in the previous Government to families throughout the country-----

I am going to speak about the motion first. Two weeks ago, we were all in the Mansion House at a very dignified and moving ceremony commemorating the First Dáil. Very much central to the first Dáil was the Democratic Programme, written by Tom Johnson, the leader of the Labour Party. It was adopted by the first Dáil 100 years ago. It stated the first duty of a parliament or government was to look after its children. This is the central tenet of the motion. I very much respect most of the people who have contributed in good faith to the debate on this very important issue. We are now a relatively wealthy country. We have recovered from the worst economic crisis that has ever befallen the country, when budgets were reduced by one third. In the worst of times, the Labour Party, in government with Fine Gael, protected some of the most vulnerable of our citizens and we will not take the type of attacks that have come from other people. There was absolute stone wall abuse in the House.

Of course, they did not refer to the fact the Labour Party in government presided over the introduction of free GP care for children aged under six, special needs assistants and extra resource teachers in schools and the second free preschool year in the absolute worst of times. Just for the record, it was the Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government prior to the Labour Party coming into power that cut €8 from every single social welfare recipient because the economy had collapsed, because the bank guarantee, which we voted against, had been implemented and because there was no money. Any Minister who had to cut his or her budget did so because he or she was in an impossible situation with not enough money.

I do not know whether the Acting Chairman, Deputy Connolly, intends to do so, but it should certainly be done. We have brought forward the motion in good faith. We want to see a focus on child poverty now that we have recovered financially from the economic crash. Most people did not expect the country to recover from it. There were much more serious cuts in other countries. We protected budgets as far as we could and are proud to be members of the Labour Party with our values and ideals.

Its most important element is probably we want child poverty to be measured. We want timeframes and quarterly reports to ensure we will gradually move toward a situation where the incidence of consistent poverty will be steadily reduced. I have to give credit to the Government because it is reducing the incidence of consistent child poverty. It was reducing when we were in government also but not fast enough. The reduction was very slight. We need to reduce the incidence of consistent child poverty and the way to do it is to measure it with timeframes and trace it to ensure it will happen. All Departments must be involved. Deputy Rabbitte referred to other Departments being involved, not just the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. That is the main thing we want to achieve with the motion and we seek support for it from across the Dáil. It is about reducing the incidence of consistent child poverty, not throwing names at others.  I want to address the particular issue of child homelessness. There are nearly 4,000 children who do not have a roof over their head. Incidentally, in respect of the statistics, there has been a 14% increase in child homelessness in the past year. It has increased consistently in the past three years. There should be a basic right to a home, particularly for children.  While we did insert children's rights into the Constitution, we did not put in place the kind of legislation necessary to implement them. One concerns child homelessness. We presented the Housing (Homeless Families) Bill 2017, which was passed through the House. It is now on Committee Stage and a Government response is awaited on a money message. I strongly urge that the Bill be implemented because it will mandate housing authorities and the Government to ensure the needs of children within a family are prioritised. That will ensure children will not be taken to Garda stations when they become homeless. The Bill needs to be implemented. More importantly, we can actually address the shortage of housing. Last week I attended the Raise the Roof conference, at which Mr. Mel Reynolds, a respected architect, indicated that there was enough land owned by local authorities and zoned for housing to build 50,000 units of accommodation nationally, 30,000 of them in Dublin. We could, therefore, address the housing problem if we used State-owned land to have publicly led social and affordable housing built, for which the Labour Party is calling. We have costed proposals to have 80,000 social and affordable homes built over five years. We need that scale of delivery, but we also need the will to do it. We can do it, which is the important message today. We can and need to address the issue of child homelessness, but we also need to prevent homelessness. This morning I attended another conference on youth homelessness, at which a gentleman from Wales spoke about how there was an obligation in Wales and England to inform local authorities well in advance of people becoming homeless. We can also prevent homelessness by ensuring people will not be kicked out of their homes because of unreasonable hikes in rent. We must also ensure a landlord will no longer be able to state he or she is selling the property, that it is needed for a fairly distant relative or it is going to be done up. We need to close all of these loopholes to keep people in their home.  The other day I spoke to a woman who was living in a hotel with her two children. She told me that she was really concerned about her children in school. Her son who is older is trying to pretend to his friends that he does not live in a hotel because he is ashamed. The behaviour of her daughter who is much younger has completely changed in school. She was a quiet child but is now disruptive. These are the terrible changes that come on children when they do not have a secure home. These are the issues that we want to highlight.  We also want to highlight the issue of children with special needs. Others have done so in the context of the gaps in services. There is also the issue of children with mental health issues. The child and adult mental health service, CAMHS, teams are not fully staffed. There are many other children in particularly difficult situations, including those in direct provision centres or Traveller accommodation, all of whom have particular problems and do not have an opportunity to reach their full potential. They need the supports we are advocating in the motion. We are also concerned about helping children who cannot even access knowledge on their parents, an area in which Deputy Burton has published a Bill. There is the issue of same-sex couples who equally do not have full rights in seeking knowledge of their parenthood.  These are the various areas covered in the motion, which is about fulfilling the aims of the First Dáil and its Democratic Programme. We owe it to people in our Republic to ensure we will focus on these issues to fulfil the vision and intentions contained in the Democratic Programme. There have been many difficulties throughout our history since. There are many reasons we have not fulfilled that vision, including because of conservative Ireland and sometimes, as was the case in more recent history, when there simply was not enough money available because of the economic collapse. However, we are now in a position where we can address these issues and focus on all of the children of the nation in having the opportunity to develop to their full potential. We need a whole-of-government approach in achieving this in the areas of education and health, as well as in the children's Ministry and, particularly, the housing Ministry. In many ways, the worst deprivation a child can endure is not having a secure home of his or her own, but we could address that issue if there was the will and the funding was provided. That is what the motion is about.  I welcome the positive contributions made by many Members. It is very unfortunate that the entire intention and spirit of the motion were thwarted by some Members who chose-----

We are reminded that 100 years ago Dáil Éireann committed to the imperatives of the Democratic Programme and the principles of justice and equality to support the development of all children and in order to ensure a fair start in early childhood.We were asked to reiterate that commitment in a range of actions and initiatives across government. The Labour Party motion, as tabled, spans a number of areas of government activity, including the well-being, education and development of children, child homelessness, citizenship, access to information for adopted people on their birth parents, equal parenting rights for same-sex couples, access to high-quality and affordable childcare, access to a special needs assistant and support services and access to a primary education free of charge. The Opposition party motion calls on the Government to ensure no children will remain in homelessness, implement the affordable childcare scheme, provide free general practitioner, GP, care for all children under the age of 18 years, prepare and implement a comprehensive strategy to eliminate consistent child poverty and maternal deprivation and report to the Dáil on the implementation of the strategy. My colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, set out the Government's response on each of these issues. She asked the House to commit strongly to the principle of ensuring a fair start for every child, underpinned by the principles of justice and equality. She called on us to endorse the objectives of the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil by supporting the development of all children and making provision for their physical, mental and spiritual well-being to alleviate poverty. I ask the House to do likewise. The Government is investing widely in services for children, particularly for those who are most vulnerable. This is evident, for example, in the increase of €107 million, or 8%, on the figure for 2018, in the 2019 Vote for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, a Department that was established on the initiative of the Government to put in place a unified framework for policy legislation and service provision across government for children and young people. In the area of early learning the budget has been increased by 117% in the past four years. We recently published First 5, a whole-of-government strategy to improve the lives of babies and young children up to the age of five years and the lives of their families, which speaks directly to the aspirations set out in the Democratic Programme. We have committed to the introduction of the affordable childcare scheme as soon as the scheme's regulatory, administrative and ICT infrastructure is in place in October 2019. We have also committed to the establishment of a statutory scheme to facilitate all children who have been adopted to access as much information on their birth parents as possible. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs reiterated, as do I, the need for a continued focus on reducing the rate of child poverty through a co-ordinated approach by Departments through the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures implementation infrastructure. This forms part of the overall work being co-ordinated by the Minister through the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures process. The Government is already committed to reporting regularly on the efforts made across government to tackle child poverty, based on the six priority actions contained in the whole-of-government paper Tackling Child Poverty published by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in 2017. It is also committed to reporting on the forthcoming poverty and social inclusion strategy which will be implemented by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The Civil Registration Bill 2019 makes technical amendments that will facilitate the commencement of existing legislation to allow both partners in a same-sex female relationship who have undergone a donor-assisted birth process to have their details printed on birth certificates. The provisions of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, as well as the general scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017, uphold the principle of equal recognition of same-sex and opposite-sex parents. Amendments approved by the Government to the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 will be included alongside the legislative provisions to introduce a new paid parental leave scheme which was announced as part of budget 2019. The proposed amendments will afford the same entitlements to adoptive leave and benefits to all couples who are married, cohabiting or in a civil partnership, irrespective of gender. In the area of healthcare, the Government remains committed to the extension, in phases and subject to negotiations with GPs, of free GP care to those under the age of 18 years. Ireland currently confers citizenship on any child born on the island of Ireland if one or both parents have been lawfully resident on the island of Ireland for three of the past four years. In general, we have less onerous requirements for the acquisition of citizenship when compared to fellow EU member states. The Disability Act 2005 provides that any child suspected of having a disability and born on or after 1 June 2002 is entitled to an assessment of need to be conducted within a specific timeframe. Timely access to assessments and services for children with additional needs is of the utmost importance. The HSE has a number of initiatives in place to improve services for these children. Budget 2019 provides for 100 additional posts specifically to improve access to assessments of need and ensuing therapies. The Department of Education and Skills' policy initiative, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, is aimed at tackling educational disadvantage in primary and post-primary schools. The 2017 DEIS plan sets out the vision for future interventions in the critical area of educational disadvantage policy. A lot of good work is being done by the Department in supporting a range of interventions across the education spectrum, with the objective of achieving its vision for education to become a proven pathway to better opportunities for those in communities at risk of disadvantage and social exclusion. The Government is also putting in place measures and supports to reduce school costs for parents. All schools must be sensitive to the financial pressures on parents in making decisions, not only on fees but on any matter that will have cost implications for parents such as uniforms and books. In that context, the Minister for Education and Skills has issued specific guidance to schools on the issue of costs and the need for schools to do everything possible to keep costs down for parents. Under the draft legislation on a parent and student charter, the Minister also intends that schools will be required to consult students and parents regularly on school costs and work to prevent costs from acting as a barrier to participation. The Government's commitments in Rebuilding Ireland, its action plan for housing and homelessness, are designed to increase the overall supply of new homes to 25,000 per annum by 2020, deliver an additional 50,000 social housing units in 2021 and meet the housing needs of an additional 87,000 households through the housing assistance payment scheme and the rental accommodation scheme. Supporting households which experience homelessness is a priority for the Government. Budget 2019 increased the funding available to local authorities for the provision of homelessness services by more than 25% to €146 million. It is clear from the debate that Deputies share a commitment to improving the lives of children, particularly those who are most vulnerable. While there may be some differences between us on the approach to be taken, that does not dilute in any way our shared determination to pursue an ambitious, integrated, cross-government strategy to effect change. The breadth and depth of the actions outlined span numerous Departments and indicate that we are making progress. We must continue the work and in so doing honour the ambitions of the First Dáil.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	547	I support this important motion. I am somewhat taken aback by the rancour that it has generated. As the eldest of ten children who grew up in the 1960s when times were tough, I am acutely aware of how difficult circumstances are. I will focus on the substance of the motion. It appears that some are peeved by the fact that the motion is both comprehensive and important in the context of ensuring every child in the Republic will be given a fair start. The motion emphasises the objectives set out by the first parliamentary leader of the Labour Party, Thomas Johnson, in 1913, the centenary of which we celebrated just a few years ago.It further appears that some in this House would, with attempts at bullying, intimidation or something else, try to circumscribe our rights to pursue political actions or policies. My grandmother stood at the 1913 Lock-out and we will not be bullied or intimidated by anybody. We will bring forward policies on the floor of the House that are legitimate and correctly mandated by the people we represent. We will take people to one side if they try to bully, intimidate or call us names as we have had enough of it. It is not good enough and name-calling should not be allowed. We will pursue this as what has happened is not appropriate to this House. I am going on 27 years in this House and I have never seen such rancour or name-calling. The question of the Labour Party's record and its effect on people has been raised. Allow me to put a few facts on the record. Has anybody forgotten that the economy crashed in Fianna Fáil's term and before the Labour Party came into government in 2011? The other day I heard somebody say houses were not built from 2008 onwards and that the Labour Party was responsible for that. That is the type of misleading statement and fake news that is out there. I went into the Department at the time and tried to save the €36 million for the disabled persons' grant. I recall it clearly. I fought my guts out and only €2 million was taken when the troika wanted to take everything.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	551	You did not apply those rules a few minutes ago. Does anybody deny a wide range of cuts to public spending were introduced before the Labour Party came to government? When the Labour Party came into government, the unemployment rate was 15% and it was 8.8% and falling fast when we left. There was €500 million per year available for a jobs fund and 40,000 training places were made available annually to get people back to work. We reversed cuts to the minimum wage. I know because I was delegated by the Labour Party to ensure it happened. It meant a further €3,000 per year went to every full-time worker because of the reversal of the cuts to the minimum wage and it being raised afterwards. That was real help for families and children, and it amounted to more help than protest marches. Household income rose while the Labour Party was in government and inequality fell. Material deprivation decreased by a third in our time in office, and at the same time we managed to reduce the national deficit so we could exit the troika programme earlier. As somebody who sat at the table, I can bet that the troika would have cut far more severely and savagely if the Labour Party had not been in office to protect people. I was there and I know it. What about the free GP service for children under six? It was the first tranche in a commitment to universality in the area, which is very important. I know what it is like to meet families who do not have €50 or €60 to pay a GP. People welcomed that initiative at the time but it was cut from this debate and there has been no mention of it happening at all. More than 2,200 estates were unfinished when I was given the portfolio I held for nine months before I resigned. Many people, including Deputies in this House, told me to knock the houses because they were built in the wrong place at the wrong time. There were perhaps four estates that were demolished but I set up a programme to ensure others were finished over a period by providing a few million euro here and there to local authorities. Anybody can check the record as those estates were finished. I admit that some houses were built in the wrong places and this came from bad planning etc. We had to carry that can as a legacy of the Celtic tiger. I could say more, but people should make up their own minds in a fair and objective way about the parties or politicians that did their best for people in dire circumstances and for the country at a difficult time. The Labour Party has moved the motion tonight on providing a fair start for every child to send a clear message to the Government that its policies are simply not adequate to achieve what has been promised. There have been some achievements, which we acknowledge, as we are not churlish. If the Government does some good, we should be clear, honest and say the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and others have done well. Now we are in a better place, we need to accelerate the delivery of the objectives. As I stated, Labour brought forward this motion in part to remember the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil and the spirit of 1919, when the people of Ireland for the first time democratically elected representatives who they hoped would deliver a people's Government and address the pressing needs of the people arising from the dire poverty that was common at the time. We have a vision and it is outlined in the motion. Others may have a different vision. I am sure Fianna Fáil has a vision, and fair play to it, we compliment the party on that. We do not think we have a divine right, as some believe, and that our view is the only valid one. This is our contribution in trying to make improvements, and if somebody comes forward with adequate or positive amendments, whether it is Sinn Féin, Deputy Gino Kenny or anybody else, we will be on board. We are in a new era and we cannot always hark back to the past. By looking in the rear-view mirror the only thing we get is a crick in our necks. We must look forward and consider how we can help young people get a fair start from the cradle all the way through. The first ten years of life are very important and I know all about that. No matter where they come from and what background they have, young people should have the opportunity to participate in second level education. In fairness, Fianna Fáil did this with the actions of Donogh O'Malley in the 1960s. I salute that work. Does Deputy Rabbitte believe I will argue it was a bad policy? It was a brilliant policy and Mr. O'Malley did it off his own bat. Fair play to him, and we need more Ministers with such initiative now. He was not circumscribed by the bureaucrats and he acted on that policy. Fair play to him, he has left an enduring legacy. I personally gained from it and I am very thankful for that. I will remember it. If somebody comes up with a policy, it should not mean others have to decry it. I am surprised we are not pulling the rope one way with this. I was surprised by the level of rancour in the debate as I have never seen such bitterness before.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	553	Perhaps Deputies were nettled because they did not formulate the idea in the motion. There is always a reason. The Labour Party's vision as outlined in the motion is for all children in Ireland to have an equal chance to fulfil their potential. That was the promise in 1919 but it has not been delivered. We must all hold up our hands, but now is the time to try to achieve that objective. It is 2019 but we still have not achieved so many of the basic gains. Focusing on a fair start is a fundamental challenge for the Government. We all talk about helping ourselves. Most of my family had to go to England in the 1950s. I was over there recently as an uncle who was 92 died a few months back. The health service is good enough there, but some of the family were ill, and every time they got medicine they had to pay a prescription charge. The man in question worked with Murphy, McAlpine and the whole shebang. He was a hard-working man. He used to say the old home sod was a great country. He got 10p or something for a fare every week and £100 for fuel allowance if the temperature fell. That is what he got after spending 60 years working. We should not always decry what we have. We might not have achieved everything we want but we are on the road to improvement, I hope. It is not good enough for nine in ten children to be securely housed. It is not good enough for nine in ten children to get a good education. Our goal as a Parliament and people should be to examine why some people have been left behind. If one in ten is left behind, we must consider why it has happened. That means we must understand the reason for homelessness and address its root cause, as outlined by my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. It means we must remove legal impediments to equality, and nobody can say we were not at the vanguard of such efforts. We did it at great personal cost and at a cost to our party.

That will require major planning and investment. The Labour Party in government has an impressive track record of delivering improvements. We saw the country through an appalling period of economic collapse but now money is available. The challenge now is for the Government to deliver on this properly for all the children of this State.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	562	I thank the House for providing the opportunity to provide an update on matters relating to CervicalCheck, to speak about the progress that has been made to respond to the issues raised while driving continued improvement in the service, and to respond to questions Deputies may have. Crucially, the screening service has continued to focus on continuation of a programme which, despite the failings which emerged, has reduced the burden of cervical cancer for women in Ireland. Cervical screening saves lives, and we must and will keep that at the forefront of our minds. Members will be very conscious of the impact of this disease and of non-disclosure on the 221 women and families affected. Supporting these women and families has been a priority for me, and the Government decided to ensure that a package of primary and social care supports would be made available to this group. The HSE now has an established and stable process in place to ensure that these supports are being provided. In December, the Government agreed to establish an independent statutory tribunal, chaired by Ms Justice Mary Irvine, to deal with claims arising from CervicalCheck. My Department is working on drafting heads of a Bill, and this is a Government priority and therefore is included in the spring legislative programme. I will also shortly seek Government approval for the establishment of a non-statutory scheme to provide ex gratia payments for the women affected by the non-disclosure of the audit. This will be an important development where the State will accept its responsibility in respect of non-disclosure and make ex gratia payments to the women and families affected. Separately, the independent expert panel review, which is being carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, will provide much-needed clarity and independent clinical assurance to the women involved. More than 1,000 women have consented to be included in the review, or approximately 63% of those eligible to participate. This is a very welcome level of participation and allows for a robust and comprehensive aggregate report to be provided. There will be an individual report for each woman. I am pleased to say that the transfer of slides for the cytology phase of the review has begun. When the issues first arose in connection with CervicalCheck, the Government acted quickly and worked with the Opposition to establish a scoping inquiry led by Dr. Gabriel Scally, a renowned expert in public health. I must acknowledge that it was with the input of Oireachtas Members that the scoping inquiry and its terms of reference were established. With his report, Dr. Scally brought much-needed clarity to the CervicalCheck issues and also to the limitations of screening and audit. This clarity and understanding is crucial if we are to address effectively what went wrong. In September, when I brought the report to Government, I committed to returning to Government within three months with an implementation plan for all of Dr. Scally's recommendations. In December, following Government approval and Dr. Scally's consideration and analysis of the implementation plan, I published it with 126 actions for all 50 of these recommendations. These actions cut across a wide range of relevant areas: women's health, the issue of organisation and governance, laboratory services and procurement, open disclosure, cancer registration, other screening programmes, and resolution. My Department, the HSE and the National Cancer Registry of Ireland, in particular, all have important work to do on implementing these actions. I am very pleased to report that Dr. Scally has reviewed the plan and commended the commitment it shows as well as the work done to date. This level of independent scrutiny provides very welcome assurance about the plan, which sets out an ambitious programme of work and a necessary one. Dr. Scally said to me last week that this is the first time he has been asked to oversee the implementation of recommendations from a report he has done on something that went wrong. He very much welcomes that involvement and I am very grateful for it. I intend to publish updates regularly on progress on implementing these actions, and in fact implementation of many of these recommendations is under way. The establishment of a new independent patient safety council is a key action in the Scally implementation plan. Its first priority will be to undertake a review of all open disclosure policies, so that one approach is consistently applied across the whole health landscape, and that we put in place an optimum environment for the operation of open disclosure. The proposed membership and terms of reference of the independent patient safety council are being progressed as a matter of priority. It will include strong patient and public representation and international patient safety expertise. In addition, there can be absolutely no ambiguity about informing patients of serious adverse events. That is why, in bringing forward the patient safety Bill, we are providing for mandatory open disclosure and mandatory reporting of serious incidents. This Bill was approved by the Government in July, and in September underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health. It is currently undergoing drafting, and I want to be in a position to introduce it into the Oireachtas as soon as possible. A further key priority is the establishment of a national screening committee this year, and my Department is actively engaging with the UK National Screening Committee as part of informing the process of establishing this committee. Dr. Scally has committed to providing a supplementary report into certain further aspects of the laboratories such as procurement, quality and accreditation arrangements, and governance structures. I expect to receive Dr. Scally's further report in the coming weeks, and it is my intention to give full and detailed consideration to any further recommendations it provides. Members will recall that Dr. Scally provided valuable assurance on the quality management processes in our existing labs, and the HSE negotiated tirelessly in complex circumstances to ensure extension of laboratory contracts to allow for continuation, which was crucial for Irish women. We could not have had a situation where the screening programme stopped. In tandem, the HSE has been working to address the significant capacity issues we have following on from the much greater levels of screening in 2018. This is an issue that will take time to resolve, and I have always been clear on that. It is not a question of additional resources. If that were the solution, we would not have a problem. There is a global challenge in cytology capacity which impedes the HSE's ability to source additional capacity easily. The key priority now is to address the backlog and stabilise the programme, and the HSE is developing a capacity plan which I hope to receive in the very near future. I want to take a moment to contradict assertions made in this House with regard to my decision to offer women the opportunity of a free repeat smear test where their GPs felt it was appropriate. It is not the case that I was advised against this decision; quite the contrary. I have set out the rationale for and context of this decision many times. Many thousands of women contacted the CervicalCheck helpline. Requests for additional supports and reassurance were considered in this context, including the provision of an opportunity for a GP consultation for women who wished to discuss their request for a repeat smear. GPs also contacted me about this, and the offer was welcomed at the time by Deputies on both sides of the Oireachtas. A fee to provide for this free repeat smear was agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation. This was discussed with and agreed by my senior officials, including the Chief Medical Officer, at the end of April and was followed by a Government decision on 1 May. To those who persist in saying that I acted against official advice, that is incorrect. They have misled the Dáil and stated incorrect information on the record of the Dáil. They need to stop doing that because it is not helpful in assuring women of the decision-making process that we all took in good faith. The level of uptake shows that many women were seeking this reassurance. However, the backlog which has arisen is not solely due to the repeat smears but also - and this is a welcome development - because of an increased uptake in the programme generally. I have acknowledged many times, including in this House, the difficulty of the backlog, of which there is no doubt, and the priority with which this is being treated. It has also been asserted that I ended the provision of free repeat smear tests in December because of issues related to the expiry of tests. This was said on the record of this House. This is also untrue. I approved the cessation of the free out-of-cycle smears in October, at which point the HSE, as it was responsible for the operation of the system, proposed that as tests would at that stage be scheduled into December, the arrangements would run to the end of the year. I followed official advice on the cessation of the programme post the publication of the Scally report. I followed that advice in October with a programme of repeat smears ending in December. I want to clarify again that the backlog is separate to the issue which has arisen with Quest and secondary HPV testing. It relates to cervical smear tests where secondary HPV testing is required and the timeframe within which that secondary test should take place. Of the approximately 500,000 samples tested by Quest since 2015, the HSE has advised that some HPV tests have been performed outside of the recommended 30 day timeframe in that laboratory. The HSE advises that, subject to final confirmation, approximately 4,600 women are being called for a retest, and that the vast majority of letters to these women have now issued. The director general of the HSE put information on the record of the Joint Committee on Health this morning. The HSE has advised that clinical research shows that HPV tests remain effective even when they are performed outside the recommended timeframe and that there is little risk of inaccuracy due to the issue that Quest has identified. Indeed Dr. Peter McKenna has said on the record and in the media many a time that the clinical risk was exceedingly low. These tests will be processed by the laboratory as a priority. Last week I had the honour and privilege of spending much of the afternoon and evening with the wider 221+ patient advocacy group.I was very glad to have an opportunity to meet with the group face-to-face and to listen to its members. I sincerely thank them for taking the time to attend in large numbers, for telling me their stories and experiences and for sharing information about their personal lives in order that they can be sure that my officials and I have the best possible understanding of the impact of this awful disease and of non-disclosure on their lives. This meeting and all of my interactions with affected women and families underlined for me the need to keep the interests and health of the women of Ireland to the forefront of all our minds. I know that is a goal we share. This is why my focus is, and will firmly remain, on supporting these women and families and on the continuation and improvement of the cervical screening programme. We can and must make it our aim to effectively eradicate this awful disease. We can do that through the measures we are taking here and the measures we will take together.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	563	I will be sharing time with Deputy O'Loughlin. I will focus my attention on the latest developments concerning the CervicalCheck screening programme and, more particularly, on the long delays that are being experienced by women all over Ireland. I would first like to take the opportunity, however, to acknowledge the women and families who came forward last year. Putting themselves into the public domain to champion this cause was not an easy thing to do. Actions like this come at a cost. They require bravery and perseverance. I would particularly like to acknowledge Ms Emma Mhic Mhathúna, who tragically passed away in October. We all hoped that the issues surrounding the CervicalCheck screening programme would be resolved last year, and I acknowledge that genuine progress has been made on the issue of non-disclosure. We are, however, now facing another serious issue. Today women in every corner of this country are waiting for the results of their own smear tests. While just last year it took a few weeks to get these, it now takes many months. There are four questions I would like to ask on this issue. Just how long are the delays women are facing? Do these delays pose any clinical risks? What is causing these delays? Could these delays have been avoided? Let us start with what we know about the delays. Up to last year, women typically waited two to four weeks for the results of a smear test. The HSE tells us that the waiting time is currently 22 weeks, which is almost six months, from the time of testing. My understanding is that there is variance around the country and that some women are waiting more than six months. Late last year my colleague, Deputy Lisa Chambers, uncovered that approximately 1,000 women needed to be retested because their samples had expired. They had not been put onto the slides quickly enough. We then found out that an additional 4,600 women would have to be retested. These women have what are called low-grade abnormalities and therefore have to receive HPV testing. The HSE advises that, due to the delays, these samples were not tested within the required time and that retesting is required. Added to this is an as yet unknown number of women who may have more serious diagnoses and who are potentially waiting longer than six months to get the results of their tests.  In light of all of these delays, we need to know if there are risks to patient safety. When the CervicalCheck scandal broke last year, loose language, some of which unfortunately originated from Leinster House, caused very serious and unfounded fears about the clinical impacts of non-disclosure. I therefore want to be very careful in what I say here this evening. I am making no assertions about clinical links between the delays and treatment or any other issues for the women affected. Rather, I would like to pose my questions to the Minister and ask him to provide a detailed response not for me, but for the many tens of thousands of women around the country currently waiting, many of whom are genuinely concerned about these delays.  The Minister stated yesterday that there was an exceedingly low clinical risk for the 4,600 women who need a recheck. Will he expand on that? How many of the women who are found to have more serious diagnoses, including high-grade abnormalities or worse, have been waiting many months to receive these diagnoses? If they are diagnosed with high-grade abnormalities or worse, does a delay of four, five, six or seven months matter clinically? If so, to what extent does it matter? I will leave the clinical issues at that. I just want to ask the questions, but the women involved need some very detailed responses to them. The third issue I would like to address is the cause of these delays. In April of last year the Minister announced that any woman who had concerns about cervical screening could avail of a free repeat smear test with a registered CervicalCheck GP. This was done, as the Minister said, as part of efforts to reassure patients. The free rechecks started on 1 May and finished on 31 December. I want to be very clear; I welcomed this, as did many people in the House, as a part of reassurance efforts. However, I welcomed it with the understanding that resources would be put in place to deal with the additional demand. It would appear to be the case that such resources were not made available or could not be found. CervicalCheck usually processes approximately 250,000 screening tests a year. In 2018 there were an additional 84,000 tests. The HSE has referred to this as unprecedented demand and it led to a total of approximately 350,000 tests last year. The mid-west region saw an increase of 300% in referrals for further examination by October. Sufficient additional resources were not put in place.  While I accept that had the Minister not made the offer, it is highly likely that the demand for testing would have increased anyway based on concerns, the amount of coverage cervical screening had received and on women finding out the information on the leaflets was misleading. These leaflets said that the test was not 100% accurate when describing its accuracy as 70% would have been more accurate. It is, however, reasonable to conclude that at least a portion of the additional demand was due to the offer of free testing. It is also reasonable to conclude that the additional material demand on the system contributed, at least partly and probably very materially, to the delays experienced. This link has been backed up numerous sources including the laboratories, the clinicians, and the CervicalCheck team itself.  This brings us to the final issue. Should the offer of retests have been ended more quickly, thereby addressing the lengthening delays and any potential related clinical issues? As the Minister said, it has been alleged that he acted against official advice and that he was advised repeatedly to stop the tests as they offered no clinical benefit and were overloading the system. Yesterday the Minister strongly refuted those claims, and has done so again today. He said:The charge was that I offered free repeat smear tests to women against official advice. That is false.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	565	I will be sharing one minute at the end. I thank the Acting Chair. The Minister went on to say, "That decision was made in conjunction with my officials, including the Chief Medical Officer, and it was supported by Opposition politicians". As an Opposition politician, I will accept that it was. The Minister also said that he accepts that this "has caused a backlog, which cannot be easily fixed merely by resources," and stated: "It is not true for Members to state in this House that the repeat smear test was offered against official advice." That is the Minister's position. I would like to put a point to the Minister to get his response. These charges were made based on documentary evidence seen. In the interests of full transparency, I will put the evidence to the Minister and then he might respond. On 15 June the chief executive officer of Sonic Healthcare, which runs the laboratory in Sandyford that deals with approximately half of the testing in the country, wrote to the Minister saying that urgent intervention was needed to cope with the increased demand after the announcement of the free rechecks. Dr. Colin Goldschmidt wrote that there had been a fivefold increase in requests for smear tests which was resulting in "increasing delays in the delivery of results to CervicalCheck". That is the chief executive officer essentially asking the Minister to stop the smear test rechecks. I believe he offered to fly to Dublin to meet the Minister in order to talk that through. In August 2018, GPs wrote a letter to the National Screening Service, which was copied to the Minister and the Taoiseach. The GPs warned that a chronic backlog is cervical cancer smear tests was putting the quality and accuracy of the checks at risk. On 15 October a gynaecologist located in the mid-west region warned the Minister that his announcement of free repeat smear tests was "dangerous" and put the CervicalCheck screening programme at risk.On 21 October, the CervicalCheck project team wrote to the Minister asking him to end the offer of the free smear rechecks as it was putting pressure on the healthcare system. On 24 January, the Taoiseach admitted in the Dáil that a significant number of women taking the repeat smear as well as the regular test had led to immense pressure on lab capacity. I believe we will have time for responses from the Minister in this debate. That is the evidence and the basis of the allegations made.

No one in this House can underestimate the trauma, hurt and anxiety that was caused to women last year because of the scandal of the CervicalCheck programme and the withholding of information from women and their families. We also have to note that public confidence in the CervicalCheck system has been shaken and the trust of thousands of women has been breached. We recognise the bravery of and pay tribute to Vicky Phelan, who did so much work to bring this to our attention. It is completely unacceptable that she and her family had to go through the courts to find out information that should have been provided to them in the first place.

I thank those women and their families who came forward. I remind the House that the State wanted Vicky Phelan to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Due to that non-disclosure agreement being resisted, information came into the public domain. Now everybody says we all are in favour of such information always being in the public domain but let us be under no illusions. The outcome of that court case could have been very different. It could have been a secret and we might never have had the opportunity to have the conversations we have had. It is a testament to that woman and her family that we have that information in the public domain. That women still continue to go to court is testament to the fact that not everything that was promised was delivered on. I spoke to the Minister yesterday on this matter and he elaborated on the situation in some detail. I am conscious that there may be a certain amount of crossover with this evening's debate but I do not think that will do any harm.

That was a fairly strongly worded letter that came from Maitiú Ó Tuathail of the NAGP. However, it does not appear that the Department or the Minister's office acted on the concerns that were raised therein. There are four months between when the NAGP wrote to the Minister and when he advised that he had this matter in hand. What work did the Minister and his Department do to proactively ensure that a backlog did not build up? We know that on average, the service tests 230,000 smears each year. The extra tests amounted to between 90,000 and 100,000, which is about a 43% increase. Did the Minister speak to the labs at any stage? Did he find out if the additional capacity was going to be there? The Minister referred yesterday to the "Jade Goody effect".
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	572	Yes.

That was already known, yet it does appear that no work was done to ensure that the capacity existed. It was very easy to see that there was going to be an increase in demand yet it seems no work was done to ensure that the extra capacity was added. Extra capacity was going to be needed. It is not good enough for the Minister to say there is a worldwide shortage of cytology practitioners. Realistically speaking, that is information he could and should have had before he made the promise and commitment. We agreed that guaranteeing free smear tests for all women was a good idea. However, it is not up to us in opposition to ensure that the conversations take place to make sure the capacity is there. We did agree it was a good idea; it was a good idea. Getting screened is a good idea, getting a smear test is a good idea, having confidence in a smear test is also absolutely imperative. Public confidence in the screening programme has been knocked. I said this yesterday and will continue to say it. Screening saves lives. However, what has happened has further diminished the confidence that women are entitled to have in their screening service. My belief is that this happened for no good reason. The conversation should have happened in respect of capacity. God knows, we talk enough about capacity and the lack thereof and all the rest of it all the time. The Minister must have known, with the Jade Goody effect or whatever name he wants to put on it, that demand was going to increase. However, the conversation does not appear to have taken place in terms of ensuring that capacity was put into the system. I have spoken to the Minister previously about the outsourcing of the smear tests. I want to find out how many slides have left the State. We know that some went to Honolulu when they were supposed to be going to Texas. Are there any plans or is there any work to repatriate that work and ensure the tests are done here in this State? How can we ensure that the backlog can be dealt with and women can have their smear tests in a timely way? I know we will have a chance for questions and answers later. That is the flavour of the questions I will be asking.

I hope Emma's five brave sons are today safely in the care of their family. This is my first opportunity to pay my personal tribute to Emma in this Chamber. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h-anam dílis. I would also like to commend the ongoing work of Vicky Phelan, Stephen Teap and others who continue their ardent work pressuring Government to stand over its promises and commitments that such a scandal will never happen again and that appropriate measures will be put in place to support all women who have found themselves caught up in the scandal. It is, however, most disappointing that the measures referred to earlier have not been put in place. There is still not an effective process in place to manage the fallout from this scandal. Quest laboratories, one of the companies implicated in the scandal, is still conducting smear tests outside the recommended 30-day limit. Most worryingly, this time is counted from the time the smear arrives at the lab, not even from the time at which it was taken. The backlog caused by the need for retesting required additional facilities to be put in place and this has not happened. I argued fervently in 2007 and 2008 that the cancer screening programme in this country should never have been outsourced and privatised in the first place. It was grievously irresponsible, at best, for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats back then not to listen, not to look into the facts, not to inform themselves properly. We could have expanded the capacity of laboratories here in Ireland. Very sadly, privatisation took precedence over public services and wholly misinformed, lame-duck economics ruled the day. Look now at the real cost of those decisions. Ruth Morrissey is currently in the High Court taking a case against the HSE and two laboratories over alleged misreading of her cervical smear tests. There is now a question mark over whether the slide attributed to Ms Morrissey was hers at all. This is outrageous. This woman is extremely ill and she is being forced through a legal process despite the Government and the Minister saying that would not happen.The judge in this case said that it is getting stranger and stranger. I appeal to the Minister not to put this woman through further uncompassionate and unnecessary stress and strain. He should do the right thing and take this woman out of court and meet his obligations to her. This scandal has been a very sorry episode in the contemporary story of this State's relationship with women. I encourage all women to continue with the screening process. I acknowledge that there will continue to be problems, but the best and safest way of reducing the risks of getting cervical cancer is by undertaking the screening process in the first place. This is the case with all screening programmes. I encourage all members of the public to adhere to best clinical practice in line with the advice given to them by their GPs and other clinicians. The Government has to reach out, on behalf of the people, to all of the affected women. No woman should be forced to go through the courts on this matter, and I urge the Minister to take the appropriate steps to ensure that this does not continue and that it will not occur in the future.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	575	This is a very important discussion, and I have taken a huge interest in the detail of it. I thank everybody in this House for the support provided over recent months which resulted in pembro being made available to all women with stage four cancer whose clinicians prescribed it. I acknowledge the Minister's contribution towards getting that legislation over the line. Other issues will arise, particularly around its availability for other cancer patients. The Minister knows that. It is something I am seriously concerned about. However, that is a debate for another day. I will pick up where Deputy Ó Caoláin left off. My main contribution tonight is on the topic he raised. There is a woman in the High Court at the moment called Ruth Morrissey. What is happening there is another national scandal. We have almost become immune to situations like this. What is happening in the High Court is very strange. It is not tolerable. The Government owes a debt to the women who have been affected by the CervicalCheck controversy. The Minister, Deputy Harris, knows that the Taoiseach appeared on the "Six One" news and promised something that could never be delivered. He promised that no woman affected by this issue would end up in the High Court and that the Government would go after the laboratories if necessary. He met Vicky Phelan subsequently and again said that this would not happen. However, it is happening today. It is happening before our very eyes. It is completely immoral and it is unacceptable. Those women should not be going through this. Mr. Justice Meenan's report has been completed. Frankly speaking, I do not know how many women are going to end up in the High Court in the coming months, but I do know that there will be quite a lot of them. I have spoken to those women and their representatives. There will be many Ruth Morrisseys, unfortunately, who will end up in court before Mr. Justice Meenan's recommendations are in place. The Minister knows it, and I know it. When will the legislation be brought before the House? This is complicated legislation. The Minister has admitted as much. We have to pass it so that the tribunal can be set up and so that it is ensured these women do not have to go into the High Court. That is probably the most important question the Minister is going to be asked tonight. It is intolerable that this lady and others, some of whom I have met, have to go through the High Court to tell their personal stories. Many people do not know their stories. Some members of their families may not know the full details of their stories. It is unacceptable. This legislation must be prioritised, it must be passed and it must be completed so that these women do not have to go through this. I implore the Minister to take that position. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, review will not be completed this year. I will make a bet with the Minister on that. From my information it is clear that it will not be completed this year. How can we get to the bottom of what happened if this famous review, which was supposed to be completed within months, is not going to be completed in the calendar year of 2019? That is also unacceptable. Will the Minister give me the timelines and show me how the information is going to cross over to ensure that this happens? I do not believe it will happen. It is way behind schedule. We depend greatly on the information that will come from that review. The Minister and I know that, as do those who are affected. When one gets into the detail of this, it is clear that there are a significant number of women - the total is not yet known - who are not part of the 221+ group but who come from a separate cohort which crosses over from the cancer registry. I want to make a plea to the Minister. I have spoken to and met some of the women affected who are not part of the 221+ group, but their issues and their circumstances are equally as concerning. In some cases, they are in very difficult circumstances. Indeed, I raised the case of one of those women with the Minister as recently as this morning. Those women deserve to have the same opportunities and to have access to the same package that is given to the women in the 221+ group. I implore the Minister to look at those individual cases and give them the same package and the same opportunities as the women in the 221+ group. They are not outside of this. It is an accident almost, due to the manner they came through the cancer registry. It would not take a lot to isolate the most severe cases and to treat them. Some do not have access to medical cards or various other services. In one or two cases there may not be access to pembro. Their clinicians may decide that it may or may not suit them. The Minister can deduce why I am asking that they be treated the same. I have a deep concern about the fact that so many women and their legal teams are fighting for access to their slides. Progress has been made, but the length of time it has taken women to get their own slides is inexcusable. They are entitled to access the slides. The consequences are that their cases, or the way in which they are dealing with the problem, are taking more time. The commentary to that end from some people in the HSE is not acceptable. I am totally in favour of implementing the Scally report, and I am glad that Dr. Scally is being kept on. I am a massive advocate for HPV screening and HPV vaccinations. The Minister in his response might outline timelines for both of those matters. I want to acknowledge, on the record, the work of Laura Brennan and her amazing colleagues who have advocated for the HPV vaccination and the target of achieving herd immunity. I have some specific questions about the laboratories involved. There are capacity issues in this area, but if the Minister is to have a legacy in this area, it will be established by how he can bring this screening process to Ireland and ensure that we control the screening programme ourselves. It is going to have to happen incrementally over time. I accept that. We must do that to ensure that, in the future, quality control is something we participate in, have knowledge and control of, and that the work is done close to home. We know that the contract that existed included provision for the outsourcing of contracts without the knowledge of the contracting authority, in this case the HSE. Is it true that Dr. Scally has, in the recent past, discovered extra outsourcing? I understand that he has found out about other places, such as Wyoming in the United States, where laboratories received contracts without the knowledge of the actual contractor, that is, the HSE.We still do not know about quality assurance. This is another layer. How did he not find out about that when he was doing his inquiry? What does that tell us about the contracts? What does that tell us about the legacy of what happened? What does it tell us about what was agreed? I call on the Minister to elaborate. Obviously, when it comes to the Scally report, implementation of the 50 recommendations is critical. I will support the Minister in implementing them, as will the majority of Members. The matter has been raised in the House. When the Minister made the decision to give a free smear test to all women, we supported him. Questions have been raised about whether this was the right decision. I will not criticise the Minister for this. I have said publically that I believe the Minister made the right decision for the right reasons. However, there should have been analysis of the resources and capacity available. I am not going to criticise the Minister for that, but I am going to put it on the record. There needed to be analysis. I must make this point because I am concerned following information I have received in the recent past. I asked the Minister a specific question regarding the clinical outcomes for women if they had a 24-week delay. The Minister said that it was low-risk, and I accept that, but I do not believe it is exclusive. We all know about false negatives and that some tests had errors. In a scenario where something like that happens and then women have a 24-week delay on top of that, I am afraid there is capacity for other issues for those women further down the line. I realise the Minister cannot rule out that possibility and I do not expect him to do so. I am simply pointing to the difficulty of a scenario where we know there are issues relating to the past and we have much documented evidence about that. On top of that, we have a situation whereby women were coming back for their tri-annual smears and they had a 24-week delay. That posed some form of risk. In turn, that risk came on top of the fact that it has been proven to me that on numerous occasions when I asked the question, it seems for a long period and even up to the present in the case of some exceptions, we know the HSE could not prioritise between women who needed six-monthly or yearly smears or those who were sent forward for smears versus those who were getting tri-annual smears. That is a concern to which I will return.

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	577	It is more than ten months since this scandal broke but it has been the recent tragic deaths and the ongoing court battles which have kept it in public view. We have seen the new scandal involving the expired samples, the problems with one laboratory, ongoing problems with backlogs as a result of greater demand and women seeking reassurance of a second test. Side by side with these events, we are told that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists will produce a report in six months' time on the 221 cases at the centre of the scandal. Separately, we were told the HSE has now found an expert who is analysing and examining the false negative smears, what laboratories they came from and what grade of change was involved. I am told this report is weeks away. We await new reports from Dr. Scally. In this blizzard of information and new twists it is easy to forget what lies at the heart of the scandal. I am sick of hearing the same mantra in every response from the Minister, the HSE and the self-professed experts on CervicalCheck, whether in the media or otherwise, that it is complex, that we do not understand the intricacies of testing, that it is not a diagnostic test, that every screening process has errors and that no process is 100% correct. The Minister's response and the response of many in the media and in scientific circles are laced with impatience and dismissal of our concerns and of any political implications that we may draw from this scandal. To be clear, I know screening is not a diagnostic check. I know there will be natural and unavoidable errors in screening. I know false negatives can mean really different things depending on the actual smear. I know that not all false negatives are negligent and that there are different grades of error in each individual test. I understand all of this as do other women. I also know something else. Since May 2018 I have asked in numerous different ways a simple question of the Minister and his Department. The Minister has the answer. From which laboratories did the recorded false negatives come and will the Minister provide a breakdown of how many laboratories per case contracted? I still have not got an answer. It has been ten months and counting. Instead, I get the same stock dismissive answer. It amounts to saying that I would not understand it, that I do not understand the figures and that those responsible will have to get an expert to analyse the figures and give me more information. I was told this by Mr. O'Brien when he was head of the HSE and by the Minister personally twice, as well as by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. All of these people assured me that the answer would be forthcoming but I am still waiting. It is interesting when I compare that question to a leaked report published in The Sunday Business Post. The report suggested there was an ability to do complex analysis of the patient status of the 221 women affected. This amounted to spinning the lie that they are really not so badly affected and that only 25% of them have active cancer. That sounds great until we think about these facts: 21 of them are already dead, 50 have active cancer diagnosis and many have a poor prognosis. I do not accept that it is impossible to get an answer to my question. If someone wants to spin it in certain ways, he or she will do so. I believe that when we get to the core answer to the question of which laboratories these errors came from and what grade of errors were involved, we will find a disproportionate amount came from the private for-profit laboratories that operated to different standards from those in the public service. Alongside the barely-concealed and patronising attitude of commentators on the scandal, there is the immediate defence of the decision taken in 2008 to outsource to private for-profit laboratories the cervical screening process. The decision has been confirmed since by every Minister with responsibility for health, including Mary Harney, Senator James Reilly, Deputy Leo Varadkar and the current Minister, Deputy Simon Harris. This is compounded by the decision to outsource the HPV testing. We know for certain from the Scally report what happened when the outsourcing took place: not all US laboratories were ISO accredited at the time; the work practices were different and the workload was different in those laboratories; the criteria for awarding the contracts centred on the cost; and that one of the US laboratories subcontracted work out unbeknownst to the HSE. We know that the decision to privatise meant that the capacity to conduct the screening in Ireland was lost and that cytologists trained in this country to our standards were lost to us. We know that university courses were lost and that laboratories were closed down for good. Multinational companies always insist there must be evidence. Thus, it cannot be claimed that there was no problem. Why then did they settle in big numbers with the women with whom they settled in the courts? Multinational companies do not do this out of the goodness of their hearts. There had to be evidence that they were negligent. There had to be strong evidence that they were seriously negligent. At some stage the truth will come out. What we have to realise is that at the heart of this lies the problem of outsourcing. We need to realise that at some stage we are going to have to return to a publically-funded and resourced screening programme in this State so that it can be controlled fully by the health services here.

There seems to have been a 35% increase in take-up either through that offer or through general heightened awareness if we look at the figures given. Did the Minister or the chief medical officer not realise that they would have to put extra resources in place when such an offer was made? What extra resources did the Minister put in place? Did he check with the laboratories? The fundamental question comes down to what control we have over the testing process. Did anyone check if the Minister asked Quest laboratory whether it recruited extra testers? It is striking that we even have to ask that question and that the Minister did not know. This boils down to the outsourcing and privatisation of cervical cancer testing. That is at the root of the problem, because we cannot question these laboratories.At least, for all its faults, we can get answers from the public health system. We know from the Scally report that we do not even know where many of the labs were doing their tests. Up to one third of tests were being outsourced and re-outsourced to places such as Honolulu, but Dr. Scally could not establish exactly where. The Minister has stated there is a low clinical risk - he has been asked to tell us how low - after the samples were being tested outside of recommended timeframes. Will the Minister give the House more information on that? One would think that the length of time would matter in a cytology test and there is a huge difference between 100 days and ten days.  I do not feel the Minister has given answers on particular issues raised in the Scally report. Many problems seem to emanate from Quest Diagnostics. According to chapter 6 of the Scally report, Quest said that it had a false-negative reading rate of 3.19% whereas the Scally report identified the rate as being 17.6%. We still do not know what the difference is in the assessment. We assume it may be explained by labs in different countries with different testing and definitions of abnormality being used. The different processes of accreditation were a problem identified in the Scally report. Cost is another issue. Why did it become an increasingly important consideration when contracts were being awarded to different labs? The Scally report notes that 20% of the proposal’s scoring was based on cost but it had doubled by 2012 to 40%. A bailout was under way, along with the austerity juggernaut. Costs had to be cut. Is the Minister seriously suggesting that when cost was made such a high criterion, it had no impact on those tests and their efficacy? By 2016 there were competitions where 80% could be the cost criterion. The profits of Quest Diagnostics have risen exponentially.  I will finish with a key question relating to HPV testing. The Government is fond of saying that we are cutting edge and we are one of the first countries to use the new test. Why not bring this back into public ownership and control as part of our public health system? There is no need for the number of cytologists and the upskilling of people, which was the excuse given in relation to smear tests.

I find this entire discussion utterly depressing from start to finish. It should not be necessary, but we have to start by reaffirming that our screening service is a public health initiative that saves lives. It does not guarantee that someone will not get cancer, it does not guarantee that if someone does get cancer that it will be picked up and there is no guarantee that someone's life will be saved by it but it massively improves the odds. It is not good enough for us to pay lipservice to that and then come in and eviscerate the service with non-evidence-based comments, as though the two can be tallied and we are all on the one side. Everybody in here, on all sides of the House, supported and egged on by the media, has created a situation where the trust of women across the country in our public screening system has been seriously eroded and damaged. That is an extremely serious situation when we want people to take up that programme. We must be very upfront about this from the outset. The very fact we are here tonight is indicative of that. We are here tonight because around ten days ago, this was the big scandal and everyone was looking for Dáil time. Now, CervicalCheck has moved off stage and it is the children's hospital and no one is here because no one gives a toss. They do not give a toss because the print masters in the media do not give a toss either. They are not prepared to undertake any serious scrutiny on these matters; they are just interested in a cheap headline. The latest scandal is around writing to these 4,600 women as a result of the delay in checking for HPV in one lab outside the debate. The media is asking how these women are supposed to feel. I am in the middle of the screening process and I do not feel especially great about this, nobody does when their health is in question, but what they should feel is that it is great that a retest is being done and a quality check has picked up a weakness in the system that in normal terms - and I have heard nothing to contradict this - would not have batted an eyelid because the risk is negligible. Is that not good? While I am sure that people will be sick if they get a letter telling them there has been a retest and there has been something different, is it not great that they will know and there is a chance of an intervention? To be honest, I am a bit sick at how all this has been dealt with because that issue has been conflated with the backlog and the delays in the Minister's decision to have a retest. If anyone is even half honest, they will know that if the Minister had not offered the retest, there would have been an avalanche of demands for retesting from the media and the world in general. Everyone must take responsibility for this because it is a fact that medical advice said the retest should not be done because it would cause problems for our system. That point was made earlier. That is a fact and we must take the consequences of that. The biggest consequence, I think, is that it has potentially delayed the introduction of HPV screening. The responses from departmental officials on this issue are written in real Civil Service speak. They speak of needing to stabilise the programme and the operational challenges during the year but they mean that they were dealing with this bloody crisis and could not get on with making the system better. That should be our key job and I want to hear more on that. Some 19 countries do screening, 12 of which conduct audits. Of those 12, only seven use the results and only one has a policy of telling people. We are different. It is not necessarily a bad thing, it is a better thing. It has been said that privatisation has caused this situation. Has it? Maybe it has but I have not seen any evidence that it has. We are all very fond of coming in here and quoting the Scally report. Dr. Scally did not say that we should not continue to use the labs. He did not say that and I have seen no evidence that says that the rates are any different. It is the case that the US labs operate to a different standard but it is not necessarily a lesser standard. Again, I have not seen evidence that it is a lesser standard. Honolulu is the capital of Hawaii, which is a state in America. I do not think that America is the be all and end all - which enough of my record in the Dáil will confirm - but it is not Ethiopia. I am not being derogatory in saying that but it is not a developing country. It has state-of-the-art colleges, high medical standards and so on. We must be very careful. I do not know. We know that a lot of people are suffering because of uncertainties and because of misinformation around this issue. I want to make a point about the 221 cases and litigation. These are claims at the moment. I am not saying that their situation is not traumatic - all these people have cancer and we know that - but we do not know how many of them were caused because of normal problems with false negatives or how many were the result of negligence. How many were so glaring that they should have been caught? We do not know that. We should know that. I am very concerned about why the review by the obstetricians and gynaecologists has not been done and I would like the Minister to tell us why not.We should know whether our rate differs from that in other countries. The two issues we really need to address are the ones within our control and that Dr. Scally flagged as the main problems, the first of which is open disclosure. It is all very well for the Minister to tell the House that a patient information and safety Bill will be delivered this year. I was told by the Taoiseach last May that the Bill would be delivered last year on foot of this evidence, but it would have been delivered the year before if the amendments to require mandatory open disclosure that we had succeeded in having approved at the justice committee had not subsequently been removed by the relevant Ministers at the behest of officials in the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality. If we are serious about this, that is key. The second issue is legal costs. In other countries people do not sue over delayed diagnoses caused by false negatives because they have much better systems in place than ours. We need to consider these lessons. The way in which the entire matter has been handled from start to finish is regrettable.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	585	Deputy Clare Daly covered many of the points I was going to raise, but I wish to discuss the court case of Limerick woman Ruth Morrissey who is suing the HSE and two laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and MedLab Pathology. It is a scandal that she has ended up in court. The Government gave a commitment that no woman would have to go to court over the cervical cancer scandal, yet here we see another case. This issue must be addressed quickly in order that no other woman will have to go to court and we can avoid being back here in two months' time saying "No other woman should have to go to court" again. Last May, the HSE confirmed that 208 women who had been diagnosed with cervical cancer had earlier been given the all clear incorrectly. That situation was compounded by the fact that, even though the HSE had become aware of the false negatives in 2014 when it audited its test results for women who had developed cancer after being given the all clear, it did not automatically tell all women that their smear test results had been incorrect. A number of gynaecologists and healthcare staff warned the Government a decade ago about moving testing to private companies overseas, as they feared that incidents of cancer would be missed. Dr. David Gibbons resigned his position on the quality assurance committee of the cervical screening programme after his warnings had been ignored. He made a point about the difference between checks in America and checks in Ireland. Many people shared the serious concerns raised. Dr. Scally stated in his report that, although there were shocking failures, they were not in the screening process. He went on at some length in defence of the programme and to assure people that the laboratories where the tests had been conducted were operating to the highest standards. I accept his point, although there are still questions to be answered and he is reviewing some of the tests. As the Minister stated, there will be a supplementary report on certain further aspects of the laboratories. Is the Minister proposing that cytology services be brought back into the public domain? There are question marks over the ethos of private companies and how they do their jobs, but I have seen no evidence that indicates that they are riskier or more dangerous. I will finish on my main point which has to do with mandatory open disclosure. The introduction of this requirement must happy more quickly. As Deputy Clare Daly rightly stated, there was an opportunity in 2017, but we missed it because the Government and Fianna Fáil came together. We are still waiting for that requirement to be introduced. It is crucial that there be mandatory open disclosure.

While this slightly lower figure might be spun as good news by him, it is in no way good news or a comfort for the 4,600 women who have to be retested. The Minister stated the vast majority of the 4,600 had been contacted, but the "vast majority" is not enough. Even if one person has not been contacted, it is one person too many. It is a shambles. Is the Minister forgetting that the women in question are grandmothers, mothers, daughters, sisters, nieces and much more? They are invaluable to the people in their lives. The least the Government can do is offer free repeat smear tests to every woman in the country who believe she needs a retest. In my constituency of west Cork many women are living in fear and have no confidence left in the CervicalCheck programme. They are concerned the results they have received in the past may be wrong. They deserve the right to a free retest, if that is their wish. The Minister is sidestepping the issue and saying free tests would put additional stress on the system, but how much more pressure would be put on the system if, God forbid, it turns out that some of the women in question have cancer? World Cancer Day was only two days ago, yet the Government still believes one can put a value on life. Does the Minister not believe it is in everyone's best interests for the Government to ensure women will be retested in order that no more lives will be lost unnecessarily to cancer when early detection could prevent that loss? While the average waiting time is 22 weeks, some women are waiting for more than six months. Will the Minister guarantee that women's health will not be put at risk as a result of these unacceptable waiting lists? I doubt that he can reassure me. A wise person once told me that, when a doctor gave someone medical advice and the patient needed to make a decision, the patient should ask the doctor what he or she would do if it were his or her wife or mother who was involved. Without getting personal, I ask the Minister to consider whether he would accept his mother or wife having to wait for up to six months for CervicalCheck results.

Not one backbencher in his party or member of the Independent Alliance which is keeping the Government in power is present to support him. There are five Ministers in the Department of Health. Where are the other four? I have nothing personal against the Minister. I congratulate and compliment him and his wife on their new baby and wish them well, but will he ever look in a mirror or at his conscience, if he has one, and resign? It is shocking that he is presiding over such an appalling vista of catastrophes. As Minister for Health, he should be wearing inflatable armbands, given how he is so obviously out of his depth on this and a host of other issues. He is swimming against the tide. Anyone else would be gone. If he had any conscience, he would go under and let the tide do the rest. Amid the confusion and the number of women who require retesting and despite all of the Minister's confidence and spin, it is clear that he is struggling at sea with scandals and dysfunctionality in the Department of Health and the HSE. The leader of Fianna Fáil tells us that 6,000 women need to be retested, but the Minister says the figure is 4,600. Regardless of whether the number is 420 or four, the Minister should not play with figures and say it is great that the number has decreased from 6,000 to 4,600. That is if we believe him, but I do not believe one syllable that comes out of his mouth. I came to that conclusion a long time ago. The Minister assured us that he worked "hand in glove" with his officials and that the decision was made in conjunction with them, including the Chief Medical Officer, with the support of Opposition politicians because women wanted that reassurance. My goodness, but of course they wanted that reassurance. The constituency of people in the State who believe the Minister is managing this and other crises afflicting health services is decreasing by the minute. Can he not see that? Can he not talk to his family, friends and supporters and use them as a barometer? Plenty of people in County Wicklow - he knows who they are as well as I do - have no faith whatsoever in the way he is carrying on. Almost on a daily basis, we hear claim and counterclaim that CervicalCheck is in jeopardy and that tests have overwhelmed the system. It is crazy. Twenty-two weeks is the average waiting time, but it is longer than six months for some women. The lack of clarity is a downright disgrace and I ask the Minister to, please, go. It would be good riddance to bad rubbish, as far as I am concerned.

Nothing - not all the money in the world nor all the talk inside in this House - can do anything to bring her back to her children and extended family. There are others also, but Emma put herself out there. In a way, disregarding the little bit of time she had left, she became a campaigner and an advocate for others. We would do her an awful injustice here tonight not to remember her name with respect and dignity and to say that she did so much to highlight it - more than any politician in this House, ourselves included, could ever do - in her short few months of campaigning, but are any in the Government listening? I raised here in the Dáil one day with the Taoiseach the delay in the processing of the results which meant that women were put in this awful vulnerable situation that they did not know whether they were all clear or not. We cannot allow this situation. We need confidence to be put back into the screening programme system. There is no confidence in it right now. The exact opposite is the case. To be blunt about it, and like Deputy Mattie McGrath I do not want to be personal either, they do not have confidence in the Minister either. I am here to represent people from County Kerry. Ladies from all over County Kerry have contacted me and what they are saying is they do not have confidence in the Minister or in the screening programme, and I am asking the Minister to do something about that.

As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle states, I have only two minutes. The nation has lost confidence in the health service. There are so many different issues, day after day. There is one scandal after another. Deputy Harris will remember well, when he became Minister for Health, that I stated he was a young man and I wished him well, but I honestly have to say to him that he has failed in his time so far to deliver or to change anything. In fact, things are getting worse day by day, for instance, with the children's hospital. Maybe the CervicalCheck issue did not start out with the Minister, but there are radiology tests down in Kerry involving false negatives as well. We do not know how many people have died because of those radiology tests - maybe four, five or six. We are not sure. Even one is too many. There is the trolley crisis. How many times have we highlighted it? There are the accident and emergency queues and the waiting lists. There are cataract patients going blind who have to bussed elsewhere for treatment. We took a bus up, me and Deputy Michael Collins, on Friday last, and that bus was coming down when another bus was going up on Saturday. They are making the route - that is the truth - one day after another. Michael spoke about the late Emma Mhic Mhathúna. We admired her so much. She gave her last days in Kerry. She was bubbly. She was so popular with everyone, and in a short space of time, she struck a chord with everyone. It is so sad what happened in her case, and her family so young left behind. She adored them all. It is so sad what has happened. We are appealing to the Minister in that regard to ensure that this debacle does not happen again. I do not understand why we have to do these tests abroad, why we cannot have them done in-house, as with all the other areas, and have a service that we should be proud of. We talk about Cuba. It is a dictatorship. If a person presents with a problem or a need for an operation today, I am told, whether it is a hip or whatever, he or she will have it tomorrow. What is wrong here?

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	596	It is important - we probably all have done it - to start by acknowledging the brave campaigners, such as Vicky Phelan and those who went public, but also the quite sizeable number, with whom some of us engaged, who did not go public but where information was fed back and forth. All of them should be considered as having done the State some service. Even though we are in a difficult position in terms of the screening programme, it has been essential that we know we have a screening programme with a failure in it if we are to make sure that it is robust into the future. It must be remembered that had it not been for the bravery of Vicky Phelan and her refusal to sign that confidentiality clause, we might not have known anything about this entire scandal. The priority in all of this has to be the women concerned, and we have to ensure that everything possible is done for them, and with them. The idea that the State would pursue any of these women in any kind of an aggressive manner, as we saw displayed with Vicky Phelan and in other cases, is unacceptable, and I am not sure it is entirely concluded. Despite what has been said, for example, about the slides being released, and some women looked for those slides in April and May last, some of the women who make up the 221+ group had to go to the High Court in December. I kept raising that particular issue. I was told at the Committee of Public Accounts that the matter would be turned around in 22 days, and it was not. The women went to the High Court on 20 December and the HSE committed to provide the slides in the format that was sought. That was a useable format from the point of view of some of the cases that would have to be taken. They went back to the court for mention on 18 January and still the slides had not been provided. I was talking to one of the people today. The slides were provided on Monday last, 4 February, and they had to go to the court to get that. We were told that there would be only 22 days of a turnaround. That was a less than honest approach. We were misled by the HSE in respect of some of this. In the midst of all this, we are looking at the ongoing case and reading the newspaper coverage of Ruth Morrissey's appearance in court. It is the kind of thing that undermines the rebuilding of confidence when there is a question mark, for example, about whether it was the correct slide she had. The Taoiseach made commitments here in the Dáil that no woman would have to repeat what Vicky Phelan had gone through in the courts. I wonder where the Taoiseach got the advice to make that statement because while one component of this relates to the non-disclosure, other components relate to the work of the laboratories. Whether the State would have the legal standing to have made that commitment is something that needs to be clarified here. A commitment was made and people took that at face value. It was never going to be possible. The Taoiseach must come back and put on the record exactly what advice was given allowing that to be said, which gave an assurance that may well not have been an assurance that could have been given in a fair and honest way. I welcomed the Scally report. It was an excellent and comprehensive report. It established many of the facts and the truths about CervicalCheck. It has gone a long way to answering many of the questions we all have had over the months. Most important, Dr. Scally met the women and their families and he listened to them.With regard to forms of communication, if one asks people to name seven different means of communication listening tends to be left off that list. People hear but they do not always listen. Dr. Scally definitely listened in a very meaningful way. He was quite definitive in his report and he lifted the lid on a highly paternalistic culture which he said bordered on the misogynistic with regard to many of the 30 consultants who were involved in these cases. Stephen Teap said that in some respects, there was a God complex. Since the report I have spoken with women who told me they have lost confidence in their doctor or consultant, and it was mainly due to how they had been communicated with, how they were dismissed and how they had continuously raised their concerns without getting a fair hearing; they were not listened to. When these women tried to source other doctors or consultants, some were unwilling to take the women on as patients. Despite the fine words we have heard in this House, the women were left to their own devices in sourcing alternative medical cover - that is a doctor - for themselves. When we talk about a package of care and help and all the rest, I believe that those of us on the outside who are not personally experiencing this would have expected that kind of issue to have been addressed and overcome. I have met women who had all sorts of difficulties and they tell me that they sourced some of their treatments in other jurisdictions. I put it to the Minister that apologies are very hollow when the apology is not underpinned or matched against practical assistance. Such assistance would make those who have been affected feel that they actually matter. When we consider the awful scandal in retrospect, lessons have to be learned about what was put in place and if it really met with what was expected or with what was articulated to be available. I will now turn to the issues of the compensation promised, the HSE and non-disclosure. The compensation has to happen in reality. I really want the Minister to hear this particular point: I am aware of women who cannot meet the cost of having their slides independently assessed. Some women are being asked for upfront payments by solicitors and other women are trying to pay by instalment, for example perhaps €100 per week. Some who are in that situation are struggling to make ends meet, and they are stressed and worried about their own health. They need to be given assurances about when that compensation will be paid in order that they can have their slides independently tested. That has to happen or there is no point in making apologies. That is a very practical thing that is currently an impediment. We are all aware of the number of laboratories that were used, but some labs were subcontracted. I understand that Dr. Scally discovered that this was much more extensive than was first thought. Will the Minister put on record just how many labs were there, and what were those labs? If we are to build up trust we need to know that. Let us not be finding things out by drip feed. We need to know what the situation was in that regard. What was the quality control around that subcontracting? When did that information come to light? When did the Minister find out about this information? CervicalCheck, with all its faults and failures, is an incredibly important screening programme that saves lives. It is important that we say to people they should engage with the programme, but when we say it we must make sure the trust is rebuilt on the other side in order that people can have confidence there are checks and balances. People must be assured that the level of quality control is such that their results are as robust as humanly possible. We talk a lot about open disclosure. We have been dealing with it at the Committee of Public Accounts in the context of changing the culture. There is a €2.6 billion contingent liability for the health service. If, for example, we were to strip out the legal component of that - and I do not say cases should not be defended where they should be defended - we have to put in place a system where people can put their hands up if there is a failure, and the failure is remedied rather than having to rely on people like Vicky Phelan taking a court case and not allowing herself to be gagged on the results of the court case. There has to be an honesty about it and the system must be put in place that allows for open disclosure.

If any Member notices that I have missed a question I ask that they flag it with me. I will take Deputy Joan Collins' last question first while it is fresh in my mind. When I receive Dr. Scally's report - which is phase 2 of his work - I absolutely intend to publish it. Obviously, I also intend to act upon his recommendations. Dr. Scally very kindly attended a meeting with me when I met the 221+ group in my Department last Thursday and he made it clear that he hopes to get that report to me very shortly, possibly this week or next week. I expect to receive it this month and I will certainly act upon it. I would also like to make sure the women and their families are briefed first, as would Dr. Scally. I gave him the go-ahead to make sure he briefed them in advance of anybody else, once he also gives the report to me. Dr. Scally has highlighted that some other labs had also been used and this has come up in a number of questions tonight. This is not news because from Dr. Scally's first report we already knew there were other labs. One of the terms of reference for the second report was to look at this matter and report back. There have been references in the media recently to one lab, and Wyoming was mentioned by Deputy Kelly. I understand that most of these laboratories are no longer in use, but I do not want to pre-empt what the factual situation may be.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	615	New labs have been found.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	616	Absolutely. That is my clear understanding. I want to do what I have always done along this process, which is to wait for Dr. Scally's report, publish it and then act upon it. Deputy Donnelly asked a number of questions on the backlog, the waiting times, the clinical risk, what is behind the delays and if they could and should have been avoided. I shall take those questions in sequence.I am informed that the average return time for a smear test is up to 22 weeks. I am also informed that many people get their tests earlier than that, but as with any average, some people wait longer. The HSE has apologised to patients for this and said it is doing everything possible to improve the situation. I accept genuinely and absolutely the HSE's bona fides in that regard having seen how hard it is working to identify additional capacity in a very challenging environment. I heard people accept in the House that it is not just a matter of writing a cheque. There is a global shortage in cytology and the HSE is working very hard to identify additional capacity. The HSE is due to present me with a capacity report in the next number of weeks and I will be happy to share it with the appropriate committee of the House or to set out in the Chamber, whichever is the appropriate course. Importantly, Deputy Donnelly asked what the clinical risk here was. This is what women will want to know. I will read to the House what I have been told by the HSE from a clinical point of view. The HSE has advised clinically that the natural history of cervical cancer indicates that the disease normally develops over a period of ten to 15 years. Due to this very fact, it is important that women of screening age attend for cervical screening each and every time they are invited to participate. The HSE advises clinically that in this context, the delay being experienced for the return of cervical screening results, while undesirable, is not dangerous and poses a very low risk to women. That reassurance is important. I do not suggest that delay is any way desirable. Of course, it is not and the anxiety of waiting is certainly not good either. However, that is the clinical opinion. Deputy Donnelly asked the fair question of whether the backlog could or should have been avoided. There are two parts to the answer. Not all of the backlog consists of free repeat smear tests, which we accept. I am waiting for exact figures from the HSE as to how much is made up of new women entering the screening programme but indicative figures suggest it could be up to one third. Truthfully, I must wait for that to be validated before I can fully stand over the figure. However, it means an awful lot of the backlog is made up of people availing of the repeat test, which I very much acknowledge. It was the right decision to make. The Deputy was good enough to acknowledge that if was not free, women who could afford to do so would have been tested which would have led to the bizarre, awkward and unfair situation in which women who could not afford it would not. The Deputy outlined a number of people who said the repeat smear test was not a good idea, all of them, by my calculation, did so significantly after the decision was made by me. It was not clear in some of the charges levelled in recent years, but the advice available to me within the Department, including working with the chief medical officer, was that this was an appropriate step to take as part of the reassurance process and it was welcomed, to be fair, by people here. All speakers have made the fair point that while they welcomed the decision, they would have hoped the resources would have been put in place. As I said yesterday in reply to Oral Questions, also fairly, nobody could have predicted the exact number of people who would go for this nor could anyone have predicted how long the public concern and anxiety would last. Deputy Clare Daly was very honest on the latter point. Deputy Donnelly asked also about the approximately 4,600 people who will be invited for retests. He acknowledges that it is a separate issue to the backlog and relates to HPV secondary testing. It is not an issue caused by the backlog. Dr. Peter McKenna, whose view people would much rather hear than mine, given that he is acting clinical director of the programme, described the clinical risk as exceedingly low. Again, Deputy Clare Daly was very honest in this regard. This is a programme picking up errors and acting on them by inviting retests, albeit as a precautionary measure. The director general of the HSE gave information today to the Joint Committee on Health that the majority of retest letters had been issued. My understanding is that the rest of the letters will be issued by the end of the week.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	617	Specifically on the clinical risk, it is good to hear, as we have heard previously, that it is exceedingly low. The Minister probably does not have the information now, but he might come back to us on the following. One of the cohorts involves women who have been diagnosed with more serious than low-grade abnormalities. There is an unknown number of women who have been diagnosed with high-grade abnormalities or more serious ones. The question for them is whether delays of four to seven months may be linked to delays in starting treatment. I do not know and am not asserting that they are. However, I am being asked the question by women who are waiting. I ask the Minister, therefore, to get the advice and to make a statement to the House or to the public personally or by way of a clarification from the HSE setting out whether there is any material risk to those women and how many women it might affect. As to the rest, I thank the Minister.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	618	I will ask the HSE to correspond directly with the health committee on that. I thank the Deputy for reminding me that I have been assured that women who have been referred for colposcopy are triaged. It is an important reassurance for many that I am happy to record in the House. Deputy Louise O'Reilly paid tribute to Vicky Phelan and others and I join her in doing so. The Deputy asked about the HPV secondary test and I think I have set out the position to Deputy Donnelly. Deputy O'Reilly asked the fair question as to what I was doing and what everyone else was doing proactively to deal with the backlog. It is often forgotten, which is why I state it for the record of the House, that there are weekly or near-weekly update reports on all of our activity on CervicalCheck being published on my Department's website after steering committees, which include patient representatives, meet. The reports provide a running update on all of the challenges, including in relation to the backlog. The HSE is constantly speaking with the laboratories we use and other laboratories to try to find more capacity. Of that, there is genuinely no doubt. However, it is somewhat missed, albeit not necessarily by Deputy O'Reilly, that the first priority must be to ensure we keep the screening programme going. Things came within a couple of days if not hours of not having screening continue in Ireland. As such, it was rightly the HSE's first priority. However, it has absolutely sought extra capacity. Deputy O'Reilly made the point about outsourcing which a number of Members made. She did not suggest outsourcing was dangerous or anything like that. Dr. Scally looked at the issue and while I do not have his exact words in front of me, he said it was appropriate to continue to use the laboratories. As we move towards HPV testing and the like, there will be an opportunity to look at what more we can or should be doing in Ireland. It is a decision we will have to take in due course.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	619	To clarify, I asked what exactly had been done before the offer was made to every woman and whether steps were taken to inject that capacity into the system. My point on outsourcing was that it was a political decision, albeit not made by the Minister's Government. It was a political not a clinical decision. Regardless of what is in the Scally report, therefore, we have never seen any information to suggest that clinically it is better to outsource. That is not by way of scaremongering; it is simply a fact.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	620	The decision to provide free repeat smear tests was made at a time when women were turning up to their GPs and asking for them. They wanted to know if they would have to pay or wait a number of years. I am not going to suggest an exercise was done to estimate or guesstimate how many women would come forward. I am informed by officials that it would have been almost impossible to do so, in fairness. None of us knew how long the period of concern would run or what capacity would be required. That is the truthful answer. I note that some of the organisations the Deputy referred to in the House tweeted calls or welcomes for these decisions. I am not talking about Members but also about some GPs who said it was the right decision. GPs were looking for this to be provided. It is true that well after the event, as referred to here and in news outlets, a number of people wrote to me to say I should cease the free repeat smear test cycle. When I was officially advised to do so in October, I acted immediately. I wrote to the director general of the HSE. As the HSE was operating the programme and had booked people in for tests, we agreed we would end this at the end of December.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	621	I have four main questions. The first is on the RCOG review, on which I have a bet with the Minister. The second question is to ask when legislation in relation to Mr. Justice Meenan's tribunal will be passed to set it up. The third question is whether the Minister will include some non-221 women in relation to the provision of services. The fourth question is on HPV testing and the vaccination for boys.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	622	One of those questions overlaps with questions from Deputy Ó Caoláin on Mr. Justice Meenan and the courts' process.I thank Deputy Kelly for his work and advocacy on the issue of pembro and I am glad we could advance that issue. With regard to the Meenan report, we have taken the step to appoint Ms Justice Mary Irvine, a very experienced judge in this area, to chair the tribunal. Deputy Kelly will note that at a time when the Government has basically said the only legislation it is able to do is Brexit-related, the Meenan report and tribunal have made the list. In other words, such is the seriousness of it we are making an exception and Meenan is absolutely included in the Government's legislative programme. I will get to the timeframe and answer the Deputy's question. We have also brought in external assistance for legal advice to help us prepare it because, as the Deputy has acknowledged, it is complex and something we have not done before. I am hoping to get a general scheme to the health committee in the month of March. That is the timeline I am hoping for. That is my ambition for it and everything we possibly can do to do this is happening. With regard to the RCOG review, I am not in the business of having bets on the floor of the Dáil but I do not accept the assertion the review cannot be completed this year. It is a review that will take six months from the time RCOG starts to receive the slides. It is independent and I do not want to speak for it. The slides have started to transfer so I am very hopeful it can progress. I am happy to keep the Deputy and the House informed. It is a process that is under way. With regard to the issue of what the Deputy described as the non-221 group, and I have heard this from some patient advocates, I certainly will have a look at it and reflect on it.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	624	I will not give a response on the floor of the Dáil but I will speak to the Deputy about it, reflect on it and see what can be done. With regard to the HPV vaccination, I am really pleased to hear the Deputy pay tribute to Laura Brennan because she is an inspirational woman and we all wish her well. The HPV vaccine for boys is something the Deputy has campaigned for and it will come in for the new school year in September. It is really important as we move towards herd immunity. Sadly, some of the people who have criticised my record in the House have opposed HPV vaccination-----

It is a bizarre position to hold while expressing concern for women's health. It is still the plan to introduce HPV testing in 2019. As Deputy Clare Daly said, the capacity report due from the HSE in the coming weeks will inform the specific timeline in 2019. Deputies Bríd Smith and Coppinger-----

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	628	That would be useful. I thank the Deputy.

We have seen the problems with screening. Why not just cut our losses with the smear tests and set up HPV testing publicly under the healthcare system? My understanding, and perhaps the Minister will clarify, is that it does not need the same level of cytology and is a much easier test to diagnose. Why not start this now rather than going back and trying to clear a huge backlog with laboratories over which we do not have same control? The second issue is clarification because a contribution was made earlier by Deputy Clare Daly that basically implied some of us were scaremongering and there was not really a problem with outsourcing and the laboratories. I would like to clarify this point. It is not the case the Scally report stated everything was fine with the laboratories. It stated the laboratories, and the Minister may comment on this, had local proper accreditation for the countries they were in-----
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	630	Yes.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	632	Yes.

This is a problem. Second, when they made mistakes they did not go back and review them, as is best practice. In fact, a proper mechanism was not put in place. The key problem arises if laboratories are operating purely for private profit, where cost increasingly becomes a criterion for granting those contracts. It is amazing we must make these points in the Dáil to people who are meant to be in favour of a public health system but I feel it is important to make them. More damage has been done to people getting cancer in this country by people giving succour to anti-vaccination drivel-----

I fully believe in science and national screening but there is a huge problem with issues such as this being privatised in another country. We cannot have multidisciplinary clinical team meetings because there is a time-lapse. It has nothing to do with Honolulu; it is the fact there is a distance. Of course it is problematic.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	638	Deputy Bríd Smith raised an issue on the validation report from the 221+ group and Deputy Kelly will know about this from his contact with the group. In the interest of fairness, this was a report sought by the patient advocates. They issued a statement, yesterday or the day before, very much welcoming the work. If Deputy Smith was of the view it was something the patient advocates did not want this was absolutely not the case. I agree with her that even though it does show, thankfully, that a large proportion of women in the 221+ group do not currently have an active disease, anyone reading the report will still see their treatment has been harrowing and what they have gone through has been harrowing and life-altering in many cases. I hope Deputy Bríd Smith does not get the impression that anyone is suggesting all is well. Far from it. It is important to have this information out there. It was information sought by the patients. I am really pleased with what Deputy Coppinger has said about the anti-vaccers, some of whom are, sadly, elected to the House. In a debate about women's health to have people leading the charge who oppose any form of abortion for any woman even in a crisis and who oppose a vaccination for a woman that could prevent her from getting cancer later in life-----

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	640	-----and to suggest they are now champions for women's health is utter hypocrisy. On the two issues referenced by the Deputy, the HPV testing is an important shift to make because, as Deputies will know, Dr. Scally very usefully in his report states that for every 1,000 women who are screened, 20 will have cell changes and the standard screening programme we use now will detect those cell changes in approximately 15 women but, sadly, will miss it in about five. From memory, when we moved to HPV testing the number will go from 15 to 18. There will always be false negatives but it will reduce the number of cell changes that are missed. I have not made a decision on this yet, nor have I the information I need, on how we will configure our laboratory use with regard to what we do here and in other jurisdictions. As far as I know, before we make that move we will have to procure for these matters. The Deputy is correct; it will require less cytology but it will not require no cytology. Some people will still be referred. There is an opportunity to look at all of these issues. I do not believe the Deputy is saying this, in fairness, but I do not believe outsourcing is at the heart of what happened here. Perhaps the Deputy does believe this but I do not, based on Dr. Scally's evidence. The Deputy is correct that some of the laboratories have different accreditations. There was certainly not proper oversight, and there is no doubt of this from reading Dr. Scally's report. He did find they are still safe for us to use for our screening programme. Did I leave out a question?

I know it is being dealt with by the committee but there is a need for it to come through very quickly to deal with it. I also made a point on private and public healthcare.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	644	Deputy Joan Collins raised the issue of the legal system and how we move to a better system. We are trying to do a number of things. We are reviewing tort law in general and how we deal with clinical negligence better and this body of work is still ongoing. We are introducing an ex gratia scheme and I mentioned this earlier. I first spoke directly to the 221+ group about this last Thursday whereby for the non-disclosure piece we want to make a payment to recognise the impact of the non-disclosure on women and their families. I intend to appoint someone, probably a retired judge, to start the scheme in the coming weeks. I intend to go to Cabinet for approval for the scheme this month. It will not deal with every case or situation but I hope it will deal with quite a few cases. I hope it will provide people with financial recompense to some degree for what they experienced in terms of non-disclosure. Another element is the Meenan report. I have answered questions on the timelines for this. I want to get it done this year. It is a huge priority and I hope we can get a general scheme to the health committee in the month of March. With regard to open disclosure, Deputy Joan Collins is right. Deputy Clare Daly described the missed opportunities in the past, as did Deputy Joan Collins. On reflection, this may well be right. We need to rectify it now. It is in the patient safety Bill, which has been through pre-legislative scrutiny at the health committee.It is currently being drafted. I intend to get it back here as quickly as possible - I do not have a definitive week now - with a view to enacting that law this year.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	646	No, but some of them have been answered as the other Deputies have raised similar issues. The Taoiseach made a commitment in the Dáil that no woman would have to go to court, yet we are continuously seeing court cases. It is important there is an understanding of what the State can and cannot do in respect of court cases. Does the State have the legal standing to take a court case against the labs concerned? It is important we get some understanding of why that commitment was made and why it has not been followed through. The Minister mentioned the ex gratia payments. Timing is really important for some of the women involved. They do not even have the money to have their slides tested independently. It is important those payments are put in place without a delay. On securing alternative doctors, was there a reasonable expectation that would be done if someone has lost confidence in a consultant and cannot secure access to another? That is a real issue for a woman very worried about her health. 
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	647	The Taoiseach has spoken about why he, I and everyone else said we wanted to find alternatives to the court process. Deputy Catherine Murphy is right. It did turn out to be very complex. People do have a constitutional right as well and that cannot be infringed upon. As the Deputy also pointed out, there are also parties other than the State involved. We have since brought in the very eminent Mr. Justice Charles Meenan to try to come up with an alternative. I think he did come up with a good alternative. An adjudicative tribunal has never been set up in Ireland before for an issue like this. We did have the compensation tribunal for those affected by hepatitis C. That was different, however. There was no issue of potential negligence that had to be demonstrated. The adjudicative tribunal is our response in trying to provide alternatives to the court system. Deputy Catherine Murphy is also entirely right about the ex gratia scheme. One of the reasons I am going ahead with that is a recognition it will take time to set up the Meenan tribunal, hopefully not too long. It will, however, take time to draft and pass the legislation. We have identified Ms Justice Mary Irvine as the judge who will preside. I hope I can have this scheme up and running within weeks. I expect to go to Cabinet this month to seek approval for the scheme and the appointment of the retired judge. The idea is that this scheme will not be about compensation and will not in any way interfere with any woman's right to go to court, pursue issues legally or access the tribunal in due course. It is a recognition that disclosure was not made to the women concerned and the impact of that non-disclosure is something the State, regardless of the law, has a moral liability, I believe, to address.  I am also glad Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the issue of doctor choice. People in the 221+ group raised it with me directly when I met them last Thursday. I understand the HSE will do everything it possibly can to find people an alternative consultant or doctor where trust may have broken down or been completely lost at this stage. That is often for good reason. I am informed that is being done through the liaison officers. From anecdotal conversations, I believe that it has worked very well in some cases. It may not have worked as well in other cases. If there are specific cases involved, we can escalate those to the national director overseeing this issue in the HSE. It is the liaison officers, however, that a woman should have a conversation with in the first instance.

As Deputies in this House are aware, a decision on the number of representatives to be elected to the European Parliament in each member state for the 2019 to 2024 parliamentary term was made by the European Council on 28 June 2018. That Council decision establishing the composition of the European Parliament provides for 13 members to be elected in Ireland for the 2019 to 2024 parliamentary term. That provision of seats is up from 11 seats in the current Parliament and the last few European Parliaments. The Council decision reduces and redistributes European Parliament seats following the decision by the United Kingdom to exit the European Union on 29 March 2019. The new composition will reduce the size of the European Parliament from 751 to 705 MEPs. Of the 73 seats vacated by the United Kingdom, 27 will be re-allocated to reflect better the principle of degressive proportionality. The 27 seats will be distributed to some 14 member states, including Ireland, with no member state losing a seat. This change necessitated a review of European Parliament constituencies in Ireland with the result that a European Parliament Constituency Committee was established by order under section 5(1A) of the Electoral Act 1997 on 24 July 2018. The committee was required to report to the Ceann Comhairle no later than two months after its establishment, that is, by 24 September 2018, and was required to hold a public consultation process to inform its deliberations. The public consultation was held over the month of August 2018 and a total of 20 submissions were received by the committee in advance of developing and finalising its report. In arriving at its recommendations, the committee was required to have regard to the following terms of reference: the total number of representatives to be elected in the State to the European Parliament shall be such number as may be specified for the time being pursuant to the treaties governing the European Communities, that is, 13 in this case; reasonable equality of representation as between constituencies; each constituency returning three, four or five members; the avoidance of any breach to county boundaries as far as practicable; each constituency being composed of contiguous areas; geographic considerations including significant physical features and the extent of and the density of population in each constituency; and subject to the above, continuity in relation to the arrangement of constituencies.  The committee's report was presented to the Ceann Comhairle on 24 September 2018, after which it was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The report was also circulated to Oireachtas Members and MEPs on that date. In summary, the report recommends that the State continue to be divided into three constituencies. A four-seat Dublin constituency will comprise Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, south Dublin and the city of Dublin. In effect, the existing Dublin constituency will gain one additional seat but remain geographically unchanged. A four-seat Midlands-North-West constituency will comprise counties Cavan, Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath and the city of Galway. While the number of MEPs in the Midlands-North-West constituency will not change, its geographical territory is reduced by the transfer of counties Laois and Offaly to the South constituency. A five-seat South constituency will comprise counties Carlow, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow; the cities and counties of Limerick and Waterford; and the city of Cork. In summary, this constituency will gain an additional seat, with its territory increasing to include counties Laois and Offaly to maintain reasonable equality of representation. The Bill provides for implementation, in full and without change, of the recommendations made in the report I have outlined. This approach is consistent with the established practice since the first independent Constituency Commission reported in 1980. It is a short Bill which provides for the election of 13 MEPs in Ireland across the three recommended constituencies. In addition, it provides for a number of technical amendments to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 to implement certain requirements set out in the EU Council decision of 13 July 2018. This decision which aims to modernise the European Union's electoral law, known as the Act of 1976, as well as strengthening citizens' participation in future European elections, was adopted in July 2018 under the special legislative procedure following more than two years of negotiations between the European institutions. It inserts a number of provisions into the Act of 1976, some mandatory and some voluntary, which are intended to take effect in advance of the holding of the elections to the European Parliament which are scheduled to take place in member states between 23 and 26 May 2019. The Bill has seven sections. Section 1 provides that the principal Act referred to in the Bill is the European Parliament Elections Act 1997, which is the Act that is being amended. Section 2 amends section 10 of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 to extend the minimum period within which a polling day order announcing the date for the holding of a poll for an election to the European Parliament must be made. The amendment is consequential on the amendment in section 4 of the Bill to extend the timeframe for the notice of election as set out in Rule 2 of the Second Schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997. A polling day order will be made not less than 60 days in advance of polling day for the elections to the European Parliament, up from the current 50 days. Section 3 amends section 15 of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 to provide that the counties, the cities and counties and the cities listed in the new Third Schedule to the principal Act will be those in existence on 1 September 2018. Section 4 provides for amendments to rules 2, 5 and 50 of the Second Schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997. The extension of the current timeframe for the giving of the notice of election as set in rule 2 will ensure the mandatory requirements under the Council decision of July 2018 in respect of the three-week deadline for the receipt of nominations, as well as the six-week deadline for the commencement of the exchange of information, will be achieved. A notice of election will be issued by the returning officer at least 45 days, disregarding excluded days, before polling day, up from the current 35 days. Separately, the amendments to rules 5 and 50 will allow a candidate standing for election to the European Parliament the option to include on the ballot paper the name of any European political party to which his or her national political party may be affiliated. The application of this provision will be entirely voluntary and whether the name of a European political party should be included will be a matter for prospective candidates and their national political parties, if any, to decide. Section 5 provides for the substitution of the Third Schedule to the principal Act. The new Third Schedule sets out the name of each constituency, the counties and cities each constituency will comprise and the number of members who will be elected in each constituency in the European elections to be held after 1 January 2019. The major change from the current configuration is that an additional seat will be allocated to the Dublin and South constituencies, as I have outlined. In addition, counties Laois and Offaly will move from the Midlands-North-West constituency to the South constituency to provide for a better balance of representation. In spite of these moves, there remains a considerable degree of continuity in the arrangement of the constituencies, with a three-constituency arrangement continuing to apply. In addition, the population per MEP in the three constituencies ranges from just under 337,000 to just over 380,000, which is a narrow range in the variance of population per MEP. Therefore, there is a fair balance of representation among the three constituencies. Section 6 is an amendment consequential on the changes proposed in section 4 and amends section 25 of the Electoral Act 1992 to allow national political parties the option of including in the register of political parties the name of any European political party to which they may be affiliated. Section 7 is a standard provision which provides for the Bill's Short Title, collective citation and construction. The Bill has been drafted on the basis that the United Kingdom will withdraw from the European Union on 29 March 2019. As Deputies will be aware and can appreciate, however, the timing of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union is less than clear in the light of recent decisions on the withdrawal agreement taken in the House of Commons. In the event that the withdrawal does not take place as envisaged before the start of the 2019 to 2024 parliamentary term, the provisions of Article 3(2) of the June 2018 Council decision will come into effect. In summary, it would mean that, in the case of Ireland, 13 members would be elected to the European Parliament, with 11 taking up office immediately, while the remaining two would take up office only when the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union became legally effective. Prudence dictates that we make provision for a delayed withdrawal, given the uncertainties that prevail. Accordingly and if necessary, I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to provide for such a scenario and any other such matter that may arise on foot of the Brexit process. As I stated in my introduction, this is a short Bill which has the specific purpose of providing for new constituencies, in which 13 MEPs will be elected to represent Ireland in the European Parliament for the next term. It is now a matter for the Oireachtas to revise our European constituencies. I look forward to the debate on the Bill and the contributions of Members to it.
#ShaneCassells	unknown-#ShaneCassells-party	unknown-#ShaneCassells-dob	unknown-#ShaneCassells-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	651	There may not have been much interest among Deputies in contributing to the debate, but the Bill is exceptionally important, not least because of what is happening across the water. As the Minister of State stated, it is the first item of legislation that will be affected by Brexit which will have a direct impact on this country. We all believed the impact would be straightforward, that the number of seats would increase, but, as evidenced by the hames made of the Brexit process across the water which has been botched, it is not straightforward. The proposed amendment Bill mooted by the Minister of State shows that Ireland is again in a position where it will lose out. I thought lessons had been learned from the botched Local Government Bill 2018 a couple of weeks ago, when amendments were tabled at the last minute and ultimately dropped. While I appreciate that he is contending with an emerging issue, I hope Opposition party members will be given a heads-up on possible amendments to the wording of the Bill. Given that the Government requires the agreement of Opposition parties, I expect that to happen in dealing with this important and time-sensitive Bill. We all hope a deal will be reached on Brexit with our friends across the water, but one cannot hope that will happen. In case there is an extension under Article 50 when the net effect will be that there will be a freeze on the additional seats that were supposed to come our way, there is a need for contingency planning.I presume legal advice has been provided to the Minister of State in this respect. What contingency plans have been put in place by equivalent Ministers in other countries that are in the same position? Is there a cohesive approach? Two seats would effectively be put in "deep freeze". Will the Minister of State explore the determination as it relates to the Dublin region and the Midlands-North-West region? We will have an election for 13 Irish Members of the European Parliament and it is possible that two will go into deep freeze and be left there until God knows when. For those contesting an election, it is some limbo in which to be placed. It is bad enough to lose an election but to win an election only to find the elected person cannot do the job the people voted for him or her to do would be even worse. Having expended all that energy and finance, with all the team members volunteering and people engaging in the democratic process, to end up with what would effectively be a non-result would be simply unbelievable. It is an amazing scenario that could possibly play out from the ongoing drama playing out across the water. Irish MEPs could be elected by the people only to be put on ice and left there. This comes at a time when we need a strong European Parliament. I refer specifically to the European Parliament rather than the European Commission or the European Council. In recent weeks people have been observing how small the net is when we speak of where the power lies in the European project. We have always seen in a democracy that when its executive branch rides roughshod over parliament, it is not good. In 2016, the composition of the Dáil forced the Executive to engage far more with the Parliament than it would have had before or would like to. Watching the fly-on-the-wall documentary on the BBC over the past couple of weeks examining the past ten years of chaos in Europe, leading to the disastrous exit of Britain from the European Union, one can see how just two or three people were, effectively, running the Union. Frankly, that amount of power resting in the hands of so few is not healthy. The need for a European Parliament that exercises a strong voice is needed now more than ever. When the UK's 73 MEPs head off into the sunset and there is a rebalancing within the European Parliament, there will be a need for strong representation and Irish voices there. The next election will effectively reshape the European Parliament, and it is possible the long-standing centrist majority will end. Ireland must take a stand to resist the tide of populism. Speaking of populism, I know Sinn Féin has submitted that Northern Ireland should be allocated the two seats we are discussing this evening instead of them going to the citizens in the Republic of Ireland. We know that is not legally possible. I find it hilarious that Sinn Féin is seeking more representation when its Northern Ireland members already refuse to attend two of the three parliaments to which they are elected. Why would the party want more seats when its members cannot sit on those they already have? Sinn Féin put forward a legally weak and inconsistent case to establish a new Northern Ireland-only constituency for the two additional MEPs. Case law clearly states that citizens should be treated equally and cherry-picking specific citizens outside the State above others would clearly breach that principle of equal treatment. This means the seats would have to be open to all Irish citizens, regardless of residency. Even if there was a single Northern Ireland constituency, the issue of proportionality would apply and citizens on the island would be treated with significant difference due to residency. Citizens in Cork would have a major difference in representation when compared with citizens from Northern Ireland. It is within EU law to restrict voting rights based on residential requirements. It is the practice in Ireland and it is currently being reviewed through a popular referendum that is restricted to the presidential election. I know the Minister of State is aware of our work on Seanad reform proposals and we are looking at that scenario as well. It would be dramatic for the State to shift away from the long-established practice in the area of EU parliamentary elections as our electorate has not yet made a decision in the upcoming referendum. Fianna Fáil accepts the recommendation of the independent electoral commission but as I have already stated, we need to see this process handled sensitively. Effectively, this is the first piece of Brexit-related legislation and there is a need for engagement with the amendments that will come.

In the ordinary course of events this would be one of those very dull debates where we give our comments on the constituency committee's proposals before accepting them. In the debate on the recommendations of the previous constituency committee, that was my position. I will address the missed opportunity of giving some recognition to the North of Ireland and I will respond directly to Deputy Cassells on that. Before doing so, I raise the matter of the two "deep freeze" seats, to use the term used by Deputy Cassells. It is not the Government's fault and we are all caught in a bind whereby a delayed Brexit will result in two of the successful winners of the seats, subject to this legislation, having lesser status. I would have liked to hear from the Minister of State what mechanism the Government is looking at with the amendments. I can think of only two. Either the additional seats in Dublin and Ireland South go on hold or it is determined by whoever gets the lowest number of votes. The problem with the second option is it could end up with a disproportionate lack of representation for Midlands-North-West. If the Minister of State could give some indication of where is the thinking of the Department, it would be helpful. It would also be helpful if people understood what the status means. Would it be similar to what happened with Croatia before its accession, for example, with certain entitlements for people, who would not just sit at home for the period in question? It would be very helpful for the Minister of State to provide clarity on that. I was going to deal with the political point anyway before Deputy Cassells made his remarks. From a political perspective this was a missed opportunity. I accept that the constituency committee has a certain limitation with its statutory remit, as we teased out at the private session with the officials. The Government could have seriously considered the possibility of having a designated constituency for the North of Ireland for European Parliament elections. The legal case is very strong and the Minister of State knows we submitted a detailed legal opinion on the matter that is worthy of discussion. Leaving aside the legal arguments, given that the majority of people in the North of Ireland voted to remain in the European Union and that Brexit of any kind, and particularly the chaotic Brexit presenting itself to us, will have a disproportionately negative impact on people in the North of Ireland, there was a political imperative to seriously consider this. My concern, notwithstanding rhetoric in Second Stage speeches, is that I have not seen anything other than our proposals where it has been seriously considered. I will not make a political speech but I will read some of the key conclusions from the legal opinion. I am happy to give a copy to Deputy Cassells so he can consider it more fully. While he may not agree with us, at least he would have to accept we did not make a superficial case but rather one that took quite some consideration. In the conclusions, the solicitors and barristers involved in the opinion stated: "The extension of voting rights in EP elections to EU citizens in Northern Ireland will have to be limited to Irish citizens as opposed to all residents of the jurisdiction." That is regrettable and I would have preferred it if we could have extended this to all residents in the North of Ireland. It is not legally possible so that is why it would only be extended to Irish citizens. The opinion suggests that in producing the report, the boundary commission could have looked at these broader issues and it makes the case in the context of its "promotion of values contained in Bunreacht na hÉireann and the EU treaties." The opinion further states, crucially, "Member states are granted a wide measure of discretion, albeit subject to the treaty and secondary EU legislation, in how they organise their electoral systems, including elections to the European Parliament." There is scope, legally speaking, for this to be seriously considered at least. The legal opinion goes on to state: "In its current state of development, European Union law does not require that member states provide for external voting for non-resident citizens." It imposes "no restrictions on the ability of member states to extend the franchise for EP elections to non-resident citizens." There is no impediment in European law for such a thing.Indeed the legal expert suggested that, "The extension of the franchise to non-resident citizens is consistent with the democratic principles on which the European Union is founded." That is an eminently sensible proposition. It goes on to say: "The extension of the franchise to non-resident citizens is consistent with widespread state practice in the European Union." Many other European states already have certain arrangements that are not dissimilar. "The extension of the franchise could be said to complement the requirement on the UK government to ensure no diminution of rights of citizens in Northern Ireland occurs as a result of Brexit." That is plainly self-evident.  We do have a uniquely restrictive system of external voting, without a doubt. We have discussed this, and the Minister of State is bringing forward legislation and subsequent referendums. A challenge by an Irish citizen deprived of his or her voting rights is at least a real possibility in certain circumstances.  The legal opinion continues, "The extension of voting rights to Irish citizens resident in Northern Ireland would be consistent with EU law" and that the creation of a new constituency for the North of Ireland is "primarily a matter" of policy choice for this House. It is a political matter for us to decide if it is something we want to do.  While Deputy Cassells makes a legitimate point in saying it would result in a divergence of representation I would imagine that folks in the North of Ireland would be happy with any representation in the European Parliament, even if the ratio was disadvantageous to them, which it would be in this instance, rather than having no representation at all.

I would have thought that is something Fianna Fáil would have at least liked to discuss as opposed to dismissing it in order to score political points but that is its own business. The legal opinion also states: "The Constitution imposes no restrictions on the ability of the State to extend the franchise for EP election to Irish citizens resident in Northern Ireland." It is constitutionally permissible and possible, whether we want to do it or not is a secondary issue. We would argue, and the legal opinion argues, that it would be consistent with the principles of Bunreacht na hÉireann, particularly the amendments made post the Good Friday Agreement, and that it would be consistent with the current citizenship regime. Then there is a series of more detailed points.  It is not, contrary to Deputy Cassells's suggestion, a populist move. It is a very serious and credible proposal which we think all the parties in this House should have considered. If I was an SDLP, Sinn Féin or Alliance Party voter in the North I would be a bit disappointed with the way Deputy Cassells has presented this because all of those people are telling all of us, and the Government knows this because it is engaging very extensively with Northern public opinion, that the worst case scenario for people in the North is to have no representation.

He now has a real opportunity within the scope of this Bill to act on that commitment, to ensure Irish and EU citizens in the North retain the most basic entitlement of any system, the right to elect democratic representation. More than 600,000 people in the North voted in the last European election to have their voices heard in the European Parliament and they have. The majority of people in the North voted to remain in the EU in the referendum in 2016. The very reason we are discussing this Bill, and debating the European Council decision made in June 2018, is, need we remind ourselves, Brexit. The impact of that decision on citizens in the North must not be ignored in the context of this Bill before us. Despite the fact that they will remain EU citizens post Brexit, with a right to direct representation in the European Parliament, they will be denied that right as a result of Brexit. The British Tory Government throughout the Brexit circus has given no thought to the rights of the people of this island. The right to representation in the European Parliament for citizens in the North can be protected if the Irish Government allocates the two additional MEP seats that Ireland has been given to the electorate in the North. It is vital that the people of the North have their voices heard in the European Parliament and it is within the remit of the Irish Government to facilitate this. This is legally possible. It is not impeded by any constitutional barriers. It can be done. My colleagues, Martina Anderson, MEP, and Teachta David Cullinane made a submission on behalf of Sinn Féin to the constituency commission in August 2018 which dealt with the upcoming European elections, the impact on the number of Irish seats in the European Parliament and their distribution across the island in the face of Brexit. Sinn Féin's submission proposed that the constituency commission consider the creation of an additional constituency for the North of Ireland. It would have two MEPs the two that Ireland, south of the Border, is set to receive as Britain leaves the EU, the Six Counties dragged in its wake. In November 2018 that submission was reinforced by the legal advice commissioned by the Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left, GUE-NGL, on retaining European voting rights in the North post Brexit. This independent legal opinion demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that this action is legally possible and permissible. The excellent work done by barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous, showing that with political will this can be done. While the constituency commission was unable to consider the submission as part of its work owing to its terms of reference, this does not prevent this Government from considering its content. The question of who votes in EU elections is for national governments. It is therefore a matter for Irish legislation and, as such, it is within the power of the Irish Government to do something about it. Legislative changes will be needed. This is not a reason to do nothing about it nor is it an inhibitor to actually doing something. It should be pointed out that Brexit requires not only changing the law but drawing up entirely new treaties. Sinn Féin is calling for the creation of a constituency in the North and for the two additional European Parliament seats being allocated to Ireland to go to our fellow citizens in the North, providing them with the opportunity to continue to exercise their right to vote and return representatives to that Parliament. This means that no one has to sacrifice existing representation and that the people of the North who voted to remain in the European Union continue to have a voice in Europe. Those who held, and who may continue to hold, a contrary view, and who are Irish citizens, would be equally entitled to fully participate and contest. Every person born in the North of Ireland has the right to EU citizenship and therefore the right to stand and to vote in European elections. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights.This Government could do likewise for the people of the North of Ireland, and for the people of all of Ireland by extension. Any proposal to exclude the people of the North from the future EU elections goes against the Good Friday Agreement and runs totally contrary to the Taoiseach's statement that they would never again be left behind. Citizenship must mean something. Let us not forget that the people of the North did not vote for Brexit. They see the value of EU membership and of being closer to the rest of Ireland and to the EU rather than being left at the mercies of Westminster alone. British and Irish citizens from the North of Ireland deserve representation in the European Parliament and this is what we have been proposing. I am again calling on the Government to review this decision. As my colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, has said, there is no legal impediment to its enfranchising Irish citizens who are registered in the North. In conclusion, let me recall that paragraph 52 of the joint report produced by the EU and the British Government in December 2017 specifically stated that the people of the North, "who are Irish citizens will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens, including where they reside in" the North of Ireland. The Taoiseach stated that everyone born in the North "will continue to have the right to Irish and therefore EU citizenship". He also stated the joint report was rock solid, cast-iron, and politically bulletproof. In response to a letter signed by representatives of civic nationalism - not by Sinn Féin, although some signatories may indeed support our party - the Taoiseach assured them that Government had protected their interests. He stated: "Your birthright as Irish citizens, and therefore as EU citizens, will be protected." He added: "You will never again be left behind by an Irish Government,”, which is something I have already cited here this evening. This was a very welcome and positive commitment that I, with colleagues and other voices in this House, warmly welcomed at the time. However, many now believe that this promise has been broken. The specific commitment to citizens who reside in the North is missing from the withdrawal agreement. The Government has yet to explain why the rock solid, cast-iron and politically bulletproof joint report commitment of December 2017 on the right of Irish citizens in the North to enjoy rights as citizens of the European Union is missing from the withdrawal agreement. The additional seats allocated to this State by the EU could have been - and, I contend, still should be - allocated to the North, but the Government has so far said "No". I conclude by simply asking the question, why?

Such recommendations are normally accepted. There are questions around the Bill, particularly in respect of the impact of Brexit. The fact that the boundary changes are fairly minimal, only affecting Laois and Offaly, will be welcome. There was a time when the people of Clare were quite confused about what they were doing because some people who were in my constituency for general election purposes were in County Clare for local election purposes and, although they considered themselves to be from Munster, were in the Midlands-North-West constituency for European elections, which represents Connacht and Ulster. Minimal changes to boundaries are always best. The main questions arise in the context of a possible request from the British Government for an extension to the Article 50 period. That clearly poses significant questions. The Minister of State has indicated that he will table amendments on Committee Stage if it appears that will be the case. I have some questions around that. Some questions around the two successful candidates who will not take their seats have already been raised. First, how will they be picked? What happens to those two people? Will they be able to attend and observe the European Parliament? Will they be paid? Will they be able to do some work? Will they have offices? These are practical questions and very pertinent for people who are running for the European Parliament. People elected to the European Parliament will have put considerable effort into the campaign. They may have put other things on hold. What happens? Do they have to wait and see what happens with Britain? What happens in Britain? Do 73 people take their seats only to be told halfway through that they have to go-----

I hope they will not try to hold on to the seats. There are a lot of big questions in this regard. The question of the principle of equal treatment was brought up by the previous speakers. If the two people who do not take their seats are those elected to the two extra seats, which would be one person in the Dublin constituency and one in the South constituency, then the people of those constituencies will not receive equal treatment and will not have equal representation. The boundaries will have been extended and the Minister of State has said that the constituencies will be fairly well proportioned. Those constituencies will have elected four or five people, based on their population, but will not be represented by that number of people. There is a question of equal representation in that which has to be raised in the context of this debate. I would be interested in the Minister of State's views on that. I do not have too much to say about the Sinn Féin proposal on Northern Ireland. I do not have any legal opinion or advice on it, though everyone in the room apart from me seems to. As I see it, it is too late for this to be a practical proposition. If there is an extension of Article 50 and if the seats were to be given to Northern Ireland, would the people of the North also be able to vote for British representatives? I presume it would be done on a geographical basis, so everybody in Northern Ireland would be able to vote. Again, there are serious questions around that. Could an Irish citizen living in a different part of Britain vote for those two seats, because such a person would also have been disenfranchised? There are big questions. If it is a serious proposal and if it is being given serious consideration - and I do not think it is, because time has run out - these questions have to be raised. It is easier to give votes to the diaspora for the presidency because people would be voting on the basis of one geographical entity, the Republic of Ireland, no matter where they live. That is much easier. Northern Ireland is a separate geographic entity which would have its own seats. That poses difficulties. I refer to the amendments to rules 5 and 50 of the Second Schedule to the European Parliament Election Act 1997, which will allow candidates standing for election to the European Parliament the option to include on the ballot paper the name of any European political party to which their national political party may be affiliated. I welcome that. We pay far too little attention in Ireland to the political groupings to which our European parliamentarians belong. These groupings have a significant influence on how they vote and on how they participate in the Parliament. My party is affiliated to the Party of European Socialists. We are very proud of that and, although I have not consulted with my party or the candidates, I assume we will be very happy to put that on the ballot paper. I hope that other political parties that belong to a group will not be shy about declaring the group to which they belong when their candidates are going for election. That is a positive. It has not got very much public attention. There are some other technical provisions, which relate to more time and so on, which seem to be relatively positive.That is about all I have to say. The most difficult issues are around what will happen if Brexit does not go ahead. Obviously, that would be a good thing in lots of ways but if the British look for an extension of Article 50 and then go anyway after a couple of years, it would pose very serious questions. I am not sure the Minister of State is in a position to answer them all but we would welcome clarity insofar as he can provide it. I hope the public will engage in the forthcoming European elections in a very positive way. In some places we will be voting on four or five different things. We will be voting on a plebiscite, local elections, European elections and possibly referendums. I hope the European elections will get the attention they need from the public. It is up to us as public representatives to ensure there is the kind of debate on the issues that are really going to be very significant for us now as we face Brexit. Our European parliamentarians are going to be really important in terms of how they represent our country and political parties in the European Parliament. I look forward to whatever clarification the Minister of State can give us in his reply.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	675	I have come late to the debate but have been following it. I was a little disappointed when the report came out on the European constituencies. I had made a submission to the process last year. I appreciate that on many occasions we must play the hand we are dealt. We respect the independent commission and support its findings. We are not going to get into splitting hairs on that. My own submission reflected the identity of the natural hinterland, the natural affinity and identity that already exists within the provincial system, rather than the somewhat artificial entities of Ireland South and Midlands-North-West, which we had in the last elections. Kildare, for example, is now to be in a different constituency from Laois and Offaly. I am not sure exactly where the lines fall. The commuter belt, the doughnut around Dublin, is split into two if not three constituencies. We have Dublin in the middle and Dublin deserves its own European constituency. The population numbers are there and it makes perfect sense. It is a capital city and should be a constituency in its own right. However, the commuter belt would have more of a commonality of issue, purpose and representation than either north or south of the commuter belt would have with, say, Donegal on one side or Kerry on the other. The horse has bolted to an extent, certainly in terms of respecting the independence of the report and supporting its findings. However, that was an opportunity missed. I would have liked to see it split another way. The old delineation of Connacht, Ulster, Leinster minus Dublin and Munster was much more natural than these artificial constructs. It does cause issues and splits. We see around all constituencies that there are different socioeconomic strata up and down the constituency but they blend into a whole. However, at European level, at constituency and representational levels, it can be difficult for somebody to make a case. Somebody might be very knowledgeable in one area. The coastal west Atlantic is quite different from the inner suburbs, almost, of Dublin. Places like Leixlip and Letterkenny, which are in the same constituency, are actually poles apart in many ways. That was a pity. I did make a submission along those lines and the numbers were there to do it slightly differently. However, we are where we are. On the Sinn Féin proposal, I listened with interest to the speakers. I do not dismiss it out of hand at all. There is merit and some interest to it. However, I do fear that, like much of what Sinn Féin proposes, there is more tokenism than actual thought put into it. I do not mean to disrespect Deputy Ó Broin or his colleagues but it is about beating a totem pole rather than going for a genuine, practical, real result. It is too late. I am not beholden to legal advice but apparently the legal advice is against it. I have looked at the various European Court of Justice decisions and so on. It is probably too late in the day for that. There is a degree of hypocrisy to it. We had the argy-bargy a few minutes ago. Without representatives in Stormont or Westminster, for Sinn Féin to look for representation in Europe sticks in the craw a little bit. It seem inconsistent at the very least and hypocritical at worst. It is difficult to listen to it. My understanding of the legalities is that one of the reasons it is advised that it cannot be done is that different citizens would have different representation, for example some Irish citizens in the North as opposed to Irish citizens domiciled elsewhere. There are arguments for diaspora representation. During Seanad reform we could have created seats for the diaspora that would feed into more domestic seats. However, we do not consider citizens in the North to be a diaspora: we consider them to be part of the Irish nation. That is reflected in Articles 2 and 3 as reformulated in the Good Friday Agreement. I think there is a basis there but it is too late on this occasion. I do not dismiss the idea out of hand but it is too little, too late. Maybe if Sinn Féin was at more tables in more parliaments and committees around these islands it would not be too late and maybe there would have been some progress made on it in the last two and a half years. I did knock on doors in Northern Ireland in the last election and look forward to doing so again at the next election. One thing that struck me was the amount of churn. When I was up there it was the fourth election in a few years. There have been two assembly elections, two United Kingdom general elections and the Brexit referendum. The voters in Northern Ireland have gone to the polls five times in the last two and a half years and are about to go for a sixth and seventh time with local and European elections on the horizon. I look forward to canvassing up there again. Maybe I will see Deputy Ó Broin on the doorsteps and we will pass pleasantries as we go by. Maybe Fianna Fáil will support its candidate to get the seat ahead of Sinn Féin. That will be another day's work.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	676	Most of the questions are about the issue of the two additional seats and their allocation. I gave a commitment to the Members that once the Government has approved those amendments they will be circulated. People will have enough advance notice and a chance to consider them. I have been asked directly about the direction of Government opinion. Essentially, there are two options. There is the option of a national panel or, taking on board the legal opinion to which the Sinn Féin Members referred, there might be other options with regard to that. There is also the possibility that the final seat in the Dublin constituency and the final seat in the southern constituency would be put into deep freeze. That is the phrase coined by Deputy Cassells which has been used by everyone else since. If that is the decision the Government takes, it will then be a matter for the European Union in respect of the facilities available to those who are elected. The European Council decision refers to "taking up their seats." That is a different wording from "being elected." Therefore this could have other knock-on effects in respect of dual mandate legislation, including if Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or indeed members of local authorities wished to contest. I disagree profoundly with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's suggestion that it had not been considered, although maybe I took her up wrong. This matter is like a Rubik's cube. It has been considered by me, officials and other members of the Government in every aspect. It is a bit like the Brexit question itself: there is no clear-cut solution. It is a question of trying to find a solution that would be most proportionate to the electorate, would marry with the electoral system that we have, which is a constituency-based system, and would also respect the fact that we are legislating for boundaries in advance of a final decision on Brexit. We must do so because, as everyone said, people are making decisions about who will be selected and who is going to run. Those candidates deserve certainty on the geographic extent of their constituencies. There are myriad competing issues. I was struck by Deputy Ó Caoláin saying he would finish his contribution by asking the simple question of why. In my time here there has rarely been a less simple "why" than in this whole discussion. I think Mr. Bassett was mentioned as the author of the legal opinion to which Sinn Féin referred and which it has submitted. I assure the Deputies that it was considered. There are a whole lot of competing interests when it comes to the rights of Irish citizens, whether they reside in the Twenty-six Counties, North of the Border, in another country of the European Union or further afield.As Deputy Ó Caoláin spoke, I thought about my two first cousins from south Kilkenny who live in Scotland, which also voted to remain in the European Union. They will not have a vote in the European Parliament elections. It is not for the lack of discussion or consideration, but there is nothing simple about the whole question of Brexit, nor about how we allocate our Members of the European Parliament. The best I can do for the Deputies is to state that I will circulate the amendments as soon as they are approved by Cabinet. That will happen well in advance of the forthcoming Stages of this legislation. I am sure other items of legislation have already referenced Brexit, but this is real, practical legislation that is affected directly by it. In the context of the implications for those who might be elected, the EU will have to decide whether or not those elected will be given observer status, as is the case for applicant members. Our decision concerns how we allocate the two additional seats. If a deep-freeze approach is taken, we also have to consider whether it will have implications for other legislation. The dual mandate is an obvious piece of work that comes to mind. I would also make the point, even though I never practised law, that legal opinion is not infallible. While I respect the view expressed and would share much of it, the central question is what are the implications this could have for Irish citizens residing in other parts of the United Kingdom, in other countries of the EU or in applicant countries. Ultimately, the committee was curtailed by the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 in the context of the terms of reference considered. The issue of proportionality was mentioned by several members. It is dependent on the amendments the Government seeks to table, but consideration must be given to the possible implications for proportionality for the time until Brexit becomes effective. If we were to elect on a national panel based on the new boundaries. this would have a lasting effect on proportionality for the rest of the lifetime of the next European Parliament. Proportionality swings both ways to an extent. If we move to a national list or panel system for those two seats, issues might arise. I have always had the sense that Irish people value the fact that their representatives are elected for a defined position, be it Clare in the Connacht-Ulster constituency of old or Clare in the current constituency of Ireland South. People associate their votes as being for specific or particularly identifiable geographic reasons. Moving away from that would be a huge electoral change in an Irish context and would certainly not be deliverable in advance of the European election. Deputy Lawless was not the only person to express concerns about provincial boundaries; there were several submissions on that point. The committee has stuck to provincial boundaries, save for dividing the province of Leinster down the middle.

That restriction might have to be looked at if we are looking at how those boundaries will be drawn in the future in the widest sense.

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	683	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am pleased to introduce the Greyhound Racing Bill 2018. The greyhound racing sector makes a substantial contribution to the economy in terms of jobs - estimated at 5,000 as recently as 2017 by Jim Power, economic consultant - and contributes €300 million annually to local economies. In addition, it is estimated that there are approximately 7,000 active greyhound owners, with an estimated 12,000 people deriving an economic benefit from the sector. It is further estimated that over 14 mlllion people have attended greyhound race meetings in Ireland since 2002. Bord na gCon, a commercial state body, was established under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 to control greyhound racing and improve and develop the greyhound industry. It is responsible for the regulation, control, promotion and operation of greyhound racing. Its activities include: the licensing of greyhound tracks and their officials; the authorisation of bookmakers to conduct business at tracks; the operation of totalisator betting at greyhound tracks; the regulation of public sales of greyhounds; the making of grants for prize money; the allocation of grants to improve amenities at tracks; and the collection of levies from on-course betting. Bord na gCon licences a total of 16 greyhound tracks and owns and operates a number itself, specifically Shelbourne Park, Cork, Tralee, Waterford, Youghal, Limerick and Galway. It also has a 51% share in the Mullingar track. Bord na gCon receives direct subvention from the State, through the horse and greyhound fund, to assist with the development of the sector. Funding for the greyhound industry declined significantly during the economic downturn, from a high of €15.3 million in 2008 to a low of €10.8 million in 2014. Since 2014, through a series of annual increases, funding has been restored to pre-recession levels. In 2017, and again in 2018, Bord na gCon received €16 million, accounting for approximately 39% of its total income. In 2019, it will receive a modest increase of €800,000, bringing the total Exchequer contribution for the year to €16.8 million. As I am sure the Deputies are aware, until recently, Bord na gCon was servicing a substantial burden of debt, which has acted as a financial straitjacket on the industry.The sale of Harold's Cross has lifted that burden, and the surplus of approximately €6 million from the sale will allow Bord na gCon, as set out in its strategic plan 2018-22, to make further welfare enhancements and improve basic facilities at tracks to the benefit of all those who participate in and enjoy the sport. Before I deal with the substance of the Bill, I will refer to the Indecon report, Review of Certain Matters ReIating to Bord na gCon, which was commissioned in 2014 by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney. As part of the review, advertisements were placed on the Department's website, in the farming press and in the sporting press seeking submissions from interested parties. A wide-ranging stakeholder consultation process was undertaken by lndecon consultants and a total of 17 submissions were received from a broad range of respondents. The report made a number of recommendations relating to governance, regulation and financial matters. Following publication of the Indecon report, the Minister invited and received feedback on the report. The Department also consulted directly with Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club, the Bord na gCon stakeholder forum and various representatives on the issues. The report has broadly been accepted as a roadmap for the development of the sector. A number of recommendations in the report required legislative change and these recommendations are being addressed in the Bill. Recommendations were also made in a 2016 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine as well as in a 2015 Bord na gCon-commissioned report on anti-doping and medication known as the Morris report. Elements in these reports have also been taken into account in the drafting. The general scheme was subject to thorough pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2017. I understand the committee heard from all the major players in the industry and Department officials also appeared before the committee. The appropriate observations of the joint committee identified as part of the pre-legislative process were incorporated into the general scheme on 15 May. The general scheme was then approved by Government for drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. While the Bill is now arranged differently to the draft general scheme approved by the Government, its key provisions relating to the greyhound racing industry remain the same. During the course of drafting, and on the advices of the Attorney General, a greater emphasis was placed on fair procedures, particularly with regard to the conduct of investigations by the board relating to possible breaches of racing regulations and with regard to the conduct of hearings by the control committee into suspected breaches. Bord na gCon is now required to consult with stakeholders and the Minister prior to making regulations. In addition, the consent of the Minister is required where regulation breaches lead to criminal offences. During Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad I made several minor amendments of a typographical or technical nature together with amendments regarding the membership of the board and the establishment of a fund for the rehoming of retired greyhounds. I will provide further information on these amendments as I outline the detail of the Bill. I wish to draw the attention of the House to a number of changes in the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 that were not in the general scheme. A Programme for a Partnership Government states that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 will be strengthened and enforced. The opportunity is being taken, in fulfilment of this commitment, to revise elements of the Act on the basis of legal advice and experience gained in operating the legislation and to remove some minor errors of a typographical nature. I will now return to matters relating to greyhound racing. In broad terms, the Bill addresses issues relating to governance and regulation in the greyhound racing sector. It addresses governance issues in Bord na gCon, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions, improves integrity, includes the welfare of greyhounds as one of the statutory functions of Bord na gCon and provides the board with powers to make regulations relating to integrity, anti-doping, administration and traceability to improve welfare and integrity deficits impacting the industry. I will now provide the Deputies with details of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement of the Bill. Section 2 provides the definitions for the Bill. Significantly, the section provides definitions for "racing code", "sanction breach" and "racing sanction". These definitions provide a basis for administrative sanctions for breaching the rules of greyhound racing in addition to the current criminal sanctions. In addition, the section inserts a definition of a "substance", a "veterinary practitioner", the "control committee" and the "scientific advisory committee" and also includes a definition for disqualification and exclusion orders as racing sanctions. Section 3 amends the definition of "board" and "Minister" in the Greyhound Industry Act 1958. Section 4 updates the provisions for service of documents and provides that emails may be used to serve documents. Section 5 is a general regulation-making provision and sets out the procedures to be followed by the board, including consultation with interested parties when the board proposes to make new regulations under the Act. Section 6 allows for summary prosecution by the board. Section 7 provides that existing regulations will be revoked on enactment of the measures in the Bill. Provisions similar to those in the statutory instruments are being brought into primary legislation. However, section 7(2) allows matters before the regulatory committees to continue as though the regulations have not been revoked for the smooth administration of justice. If this provision is not inserted, cases before the committees may have to be reheard by the statutory committees under the Act. Any appeal from a decision of the control committee provided for in section 7(2) shall be appealed to the appeal committee. Section 8 provides for a change of name for Bord na gCon to Rásaíocht Con Éireann. Sections 9 and 10 arise on foot of recommendations in the Indecon report and relate to the governance of Bord na gCon. They consist of the following: an increase in the number of members of the board from a chairperson and six members to a chairperson and eight members; an increase in the quorum of the board from four to six; a term of office of five years for the chairperson, as opposed to the current indeterminate period; a statutory prohibition on the re-appointment of a person to the board beyond two consecutive terms to reflect the measures in the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies; statutory powers permitting the Minister to remove a board member where the member falls ill and is unable to perform his or her duties or breaches the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, as published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; and cessation of appointment to the board in a number of circumstances, including if a member is adjudicated bankrupt or is found guilty of offences relating to the greyhound industry, welfare of animals, intimidation, assault, fraud or dishonesty. On Report Stage in the Seanad I introduced an amendment requiring that at least one veterinarian be a member of the board in view of the animal welfare and integrity role of Rásaíocht Con Éireann and at least one individual with detailed knowledge of the industry, thus maintaining the balance in favour of a skilled board in line with lndecon recommendations while allowing for some flexibility in respect of industry representation. I can expand on this further on Committee Stage. Section 11 provides for the current standard provisions relating to participation on State boards by elected representatives. This provision is standard in modern law. Section 12 provides for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. This new provision is recommended in the Indecon report. Section 13 sets out for the first time by statute an overarching statement outlining the functions of the board. It is intended to provide additional legal certainty on the functions of the board. Section 14 provides that the board is statutorily subject to the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Section 15 allows the board of Rásaíocht Con Éireann to delegate its functions to the chief executive as the board considers necessary for reasons of efficiency and effectiveness. Section 16 inserts an explicit provision permitting the board to apply funds to enhance greyhound health and welfare. Section 17 modernises the wording relating to the ability of Rásaíocht Con Éireann to borrow, but retains the requirement for the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, acting with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 17 of the principal Act is repealed. Section 18 explicitly provides for the reporting of the accounts of subsidiaries of the board. Section 19 increases the maximum fine to €250,000 on indictment for operating a greyhound racing track without a licence. This brings the 1958 Act into line with current sanction regimes. Sections 20 to 22, inclusive, replace section 25 of the principal Act.Section 20 provides for the making of regulations in relation to race tracks and provides for a sanction of a class A fine. It provides for regulations prohibiting racing officials operating unless they have permits and prohibiting individuals from having beneficial interests in aspects of the business. Section 21 extends the regulatory powers of the board to control racing officials and to ensuring the integrity of the sport. Subsection (1) deals with the control of racing, subsection (2) with the conduct of racing and the promotion of integrity and fair play in racing including the use of information technology to assist towards this end, subsection (3) deals with the administration of racing including the registration and grading of greyhounds and the promotion of racing, subsection (4) deals with charges for entry of a greyhound to a race and finally subsection (5) states that breaches of regulations provided for in this section carry racing sanctions.  Section 22 allows the board to make guidelines to control the establishment, layout, construction and maintenance of greyhound race tracks or the use of equipment at such tracks. Enforcement of guidelines in this area will be through the track licensing regime. Section 23 repeals section 25 of the principal Act. Sections 24 to 26, inclusive, are a recasting of the provisions in sections 37 to 39, inclusive, of the principal Act in relation to the training of greyhounds for reward, the public sale of greyhounds and the artificial insemination of greyhounds. The corresponding sections or subsections in the principal Act are repealed. The consent of the Minister is now required for any new regulations made under these sections. It continues to be an offence to engage in these activities without a licence, permit or approval issued by the board. However, the contravention of regulations made under these sections by a licensee, permit or approval holder now carries racing sanctions.  Section 27 details the regulation making powers of the board in the area of doping control and the administration of substances to a greyhound. Among other things it allows the board to list substances that may and may not be given to a greyhound, setting residue limits, withdrawal periods, declaring thresholds and the methodologies by which thresholds can be determined for substances. The board may make regulations requiring the keeping of records regarding the administration of substances, the controls to be operated and records to be kept by persons participating in greyhound racing in relation to doping and medication control. The advice and recommendations of the scientific advisory committee is to be used to determine the processes, methods, levels of accuracy etc. by which samples are deemed to contain a substance. It also provides that a greyhound that fails a test for prohibited substances is disqualified from racing or trialling until it passes a subsequent test etc.  Section 28 relates to regulatory powers for the traceability of greyhounds. The board may make regulations requiring the registration of greyhound owners, the registration of racing greyhounds and the notification by owners, breeders and trainers of greyhounds of many more life events than those currently captured on existing stud book and microchipping databases. The regulations will support the board in its ambition to establish and maintain a new comprehensive tracing database for racing greyhounds. Section 29 allows the board to make regulations for the health and welfare of a greyhound including requiring those involved to provide information for the sound administration of the industry and to protect the health and welfare of greyhounds. It allows the board to set down provisions for the treatment of diseased and injured greyhounds and the establishment of funds to protect the health and welfare of a greyhound, including the establishment of a fund for re-homing retired racing or breeding greyhounds. I made this latter refinement as a Report Stage amendment in the Seanad.  Sections 30 to 34, inclusive, relate to the board's right to grant or refuse licences, to attach conditions to licences, permits and approvals, make charges for the grant and renewal of licences etc. and to revoke or suspend such licences. The fair procedures to be followed, including the right to reply, where the board refuses, revokes or suspends a licence etc. is provided for. Sections 35 to 37, inclusive, and 40 relate to the appointment, investigatory powers and functions of authorised officers. This is the first time the appointment of authorised officers for the purposes of greyhound legislation has been provided for in primary legislation. It provides amplified powers for authorised officers to investigate matters including investigating the use of performance altering substances. Section 40 specifically provides that subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court authorised officers may seek a search warrant, including to search a domestic dwelling, where the authorised officer believes that there may be evidence of a breach or an intended breach of the racing code or of the commission or intended commission of an offence under the Greyhound Industry Acts.  Sections 38, 39 and 41 relate to the obligation of persons to provide assistance to and follow the directions of authorised officers when carrying out their functions, including a requirement to produce a greyhound at a specific time and place. In addition it is being made a criminal offence to obstruct, to fail to give information, to give false information or to fail to provide assistance or follow the direction of an authorised officer when carrying out his or her functions. The standard provisions regarding self-incrimination are provided for. Section 42 sets out the procedures for the conduct of investigations by the board and permits the board to notify the club where there is a possibility that matters known to it may be of concern to the club. Section 43 sets down the classes of people who are subject to the jurisdiction of the control and appeal committees. It also states that the determination of racing sanctions rests with these committees. Section 44 provides for the establishment by statute of the control committee and details its operations. The control committee will consist of a chairperson and a maximum of eight other members to ensure that there is a sufficient pool of members to deal promptly with control matters. The control committee will require a quorum of the chairperson or deputy chairperson and two other members. Appointments to the committee are by the Minister for a maximum of two terms. The chair has a term of five years with ordinary members having a term of four years. Section 45 provides for fair procedures in relation to hearings of the control committee. It specifically provides that decisions may be made in absentia in respect of persons who fail to attend the control committee.

The Bill is long overdue and the industry has sought it for a long time. Fianna Fáil is generally supportive but will table amendments on Committee Stage, including in relation to the composition of the board and stud keepers. The Bill's general purpose is going in the right direction. The reputation of the greyhound industry has taken a battering in recent years. It is essential that the Bill is sufficiently robust so that people who are found guilty of offences relating to altering the performance of greyhounds can be convicted and banned for periods. There have been highly publicised cases where dogs have been found to carry prohibited substances where unfortunately it was not possible to impose sanctions on either the dog or its trainer. It is essential that this Bill will allow Bord na gCon, or whatever its name is once the Bill passes, to take proper sanctions against people who breach the rules of racing. That is essential to rebuild the reputation of the industry.People who go greyhound racing and the owners of dogs want a level playing field, with all dogs running on their merits and everyone having a fair and equal chance. That reputation has been shaken to its foundations in recent years by a number of highly-publicised cases. It is essential that this be corrected, and we are confident that the Bill will enable that. Recently, there was a greyhound racing strike in Shelbourne Park as well as the publicised sale of the Harold's Cross greyhound stadium. The latter has allowed the industry to get on a new playing pitch and relieve itself of a debt that had been hanging over the board. It is important to point out that that debt was historical and was not incurred by the current board. For the industry to move forward, it was essential that the debt be removed. Harold's Cross was an old stadium and many Dublin greyhound owners had great sentimental attachment to it. It was their greyhound stadium. While it was a difficult decision for the board to take, it was the correct one for the industry. The barometer for the board will be the focus on prize money. With no debts to carry, increased prize money must be made available for racing. No one who keeps greyhounds expects to make a fortune, but the industry must be made attractive. If people can win a couple of races, it would pay some of the bills that come with owning greyhounds. An increase in prize money is essential if entering or staying in the business is to be attractive to syndicates and ordinary dog owners. Attendances have been falling, and we must try to reverse that trend. In that regard, it is important that facilities be kept at a modern standard. We must make greyhound racing attractive as a night out. The involvement of syndicates is essential. While the prize money will never make anyone a millionaire, if it can go some way towards defraying the cost of training greyhounds, it will help the industry and attendances. Regarding the operation of the tote, it is essential that tote pools be attractive to the ordinary punter if people are to pass through the gates. This part of the industry has slipped in recent times. Successful pick six and pick seven jackpots operated in Shelbourne Park for several years and the pools increased over a number of weeks to an attractive level. That enticed people to attend not only Shelbourne Park on a Saturday night, but also other tracks around the country where they had the opportunity to bet in the Dublin pool. We must get back to the point of people going to the dogs, investing a few euro on the tote and having a good night's entertainment because there is a good pot in Shelbourne Park. That is essential if we are to attract people back through the turnstiles. The broadcast company Sports International Services, SIS, is a new phenomenon for Irish greyhound racing. It operates at a number of tracks around the country. It can be a source of revenue for the greyhound industry. The strict regulation of greyhound racing is essential if we are to ensure that SIS keeps coming to, and expands at, tracks. It is an income stream that can benefit us. Hopefully, more tracks will get involved. It will also create a market for lower grade dogs that have become virtually worthless over a number of years by providing a good base in the price of greyhounds. A pool of dogs will have to be available at all of the tracks in question for SIS racing. At recent sales at my track, lower grade dogs have increased in value significantly. That is a welcome development for breeders. Greyhound breeders are an essential cog in the industry and we must try to give them the prospect of at least breaking even. Unfortunately, not every dog is in the open race class. The A5 and A6 dogs must be able to be sold as well. SIS and the pool of dogs available for race meetings have major roles to play. I have raised the issue of track bookmakers in horse and dog racing previously. They are an endangered species, with their numbers dropping to very low levels at greyhound meetings around the country. We must do something to ensure that they survive at our racetracks. If someone went to Shelbourne Park tonight, only one bookmaker would be operating on the rails. On a Wednesday night ten or 12 years ago, there would probably have been a dozen bookmakers. This element must be encouraged. The atmosphere that track bookmakers bring to the industry cannot be replaced. One can see that from the roar on derby final night at Shelbourne Park. We must try to protect that. It is essential that track bookmakers be encouraged to stay in business. According to the Minister of State, the industry will receive €16.8 million of Exchequer funding this year. That will protect many jobs in what is predominantly a rural-based industry. We must recognise that the welfare of greyhounds has to be catered for by the industry. There is a general acceptance by all involved that the welfare and traceability of greyhounds must improve. It will happen, and a proportion of the funding is being devoted to the welfare of greyhounds. That must continue and improve. The rehousing of greyhounds can be done, just as it is done elsewhere in the world. They make extremely good pets in later life. Much work can be done in that regard, but it will take a bit of financing. Given that the industry is getting a substantial amount of money from the Exchequer, it owes it to the taxpayer to ensure that the welfare of greyhounds is protected. We must restore the industry to its former glory. This Bill will go a long way towards restoring its reputation. If we are to get young people involved and keep breeders on side, it is essential that proper regulation be seen to be in place, that it be enforceable and that anyone who breaches it suffers its wrath. That is probably what the industry is anxiously waiting for this Bill to do. I am not a legal expert, but the Bill strengthens the position of the board. That is essential, as a number of recent cases have made it clear that the board does not have the ability to carry through on what it wants to do. Fianna Fáil is generally supportive of the Bill. We will table amendments to it on Committee Stage. I hope that, when passed, it will do what we want it to do, namely, restore the reputation of the industry and put the industry on a proper footing going forward.

I welcome the thrust of the Bill. If amendments are required to tidy parts of it up as it progresses through the Stages, I hope that they will be accepted.The main point is it is an industry in itself. As the Minister of State stated, the number of people actively involved in and making a living from the greyhound industry has to be acknowledged. It means money for the economy and a boost to local areas. In my area, for example, we have a big greyhound track at Curraheen Park in Cork and a small greyhound track in Youghal. They are trying to secure television coverage of their races from SIS, a sports television company. This would generate money for them to subsidise facilities and attract more punters because attendances are admittedly low. To be a bit parochial, the difference between the Youghal and Cork tracks is that the big track in Cork has hospitality services at the track which attracts a crowd. Regulations were required because there were some bad scandals. There was a case of alleged doping in Cork. If something is done wrong, we need to have a copperfastened and proper procedure in place so that people are either fined or exonerated and cases do not have to go to the High Court or Supreme Court for a final decision. We should have a proper regulatory system in place which can reach a final decision and ensure the greyhound racing industry's name is not tarnished. We also must facilitate the bookmakers who are an invaluable part of the industry. They ensure proper competition on the track. It is worrying to see only one bookmaker at some tracks. We need to ensure that issue is addressed. I do not know how the Minister of State will do that. Obviously, one way of doing so would be to get more people to attend greyhound races. As we make the industry more attractive, I hope we will get more people into the stands. As I said, greyhound racing is a business, with dog trainers, breeders and the owners. There is considerable interest in racing in my area. Many syndicates are formed because the cost of training dogs is as high as training horses. The Fianna Fáil Party hopes the Bill will progress as quickly as possible. As our spokesperson, Deputy Cahill, said, we support it and, as Fianna Fáil spokesman on sport, I welcome it.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	693	As the Minister of State will be aware, this Bill emerged from the Indecon report. As many have acknowledged, the report was done because of many scandals and difficulties in the industry. Unfortunately, we cannot rewind the clock and these difficulties have brought much of the industry into disrepute. However, the Bill is an attempt to deal with that. The Bill has been through pre-legislative scrutiny and work was done on it in the Seanad. It must be acknowledged that it is an attempt to move things forward and make things work. The problem in the past has been that things did not work. This was acknowledged by the need to commission the Indecon report in the first place and the Morris report of 2015 which examined the doping of dogs. All of that brought home to people the significant problem in the greyhound industry and highlighted what was happening on tracks. A company based near me does significant work on the mechanisms used on greyhound tracks and how they operate. I have been told all kinds of hair-raising stories about stuff its employees have seen over the years. While there is no evidence for these stories, when people with no axe to grind say, "God bless us, if you saw the stuff that was going on," it brings home that this is an industry that needs a hell of a lot of reform. If this Bill is to be successful, we must be firm in ensuring its provisions are complied with and work. The new board must have teeth and drive home the message that the industry needs to be cleaned up and cannot be allowed to continue with practices that have been taking place until recently. The Minister of State discussed in detail the various sections. They cover almost all aspects of the industry, from the management of the industry at board level to recommendations on how dogs are treated when they are being trained, during their racing life and where they end up afterwards. This is an issue that has concerned many people down the years. While microchipping and other tracing mechanisms are in place, unfortunately they do not seem to work in many cases. The Bill addresses the terms of membership of the new board. The chairperson's term of office will be confined to five years. Currently, the chairperson could remain for life, which shows how unworkable the position was in the past. Animal welfare is what concerns most people. We must ensure the new board and the legislation deals with this issue in a firm and constructive way. Doping and race fixing occurred in the past. Dog owners were found to be using various means of enhancing or, in some cases, inhibiting their dogs' performance. This was happening in an uncontrolled manner and even when people were caught, there was little or no sanction. We need to drive home in this Bill that this is not only about what we set down on paper but about what happens on the tracks and ensuring the control committee and others do their work properly. The increase in fines is a step in the right direction. It will provide for proper sanctions when people breach the rules. People will no longer be allowed to get away with breaching the rules. The issue of fair play comes into this. Fair play has not been a byword of the greyhound racing industry, as the House will be aware, which is the reason we are discussing this Bill. It needs to be firmly re-established, which means taking ownership of the entire process, not only by the Minister and the board but by everyone involved in the greyhound racing industry. I look forward to seeing that happening. The sale and movement of greyhounds to other countries has been raised in the past and needs to be dealt with. Brexit is coming and we are not sure how that will end up. Interestingly, the other evening I had a phone call from a lady who lives on the Border and keeps a greyhound as a pet. Her vet is in Northern Ireland and she brings the greyhound across the Border to the vet and back again. She is wondering whether she will have to get an export and import licence every time she brings the dog to the vet after April. It is such little issues that bring home the impact Brexit will have. The number of litters of pups a bitch can have is dealt with to some extent in the Bill. We need to take a closer look at this on Committee Stage. As Deputy Cahill acknowledged, the Bill may need to be tweaked and we may need to tighten it up, or perhaps loosen up a little, as appropriate. In general, however, this is a good effort to move forward and change things for the better, which is what we must do. Clearly, the investigatory powers of authorised officers needed to be brought under a new level of command and control because there seemed to be very few powers available to them. Their ability to do their job effectively and properly was lost in the past. Integrity is an issue that needs to be closely examined. We need integrity in how authorised officers do their job and we need to ensure they do their job. This has been a failure in the past. Some of the stories I have heard indicated that this was one of the critical problems in the industry. I note the provisions on the make-up of the board and the reasons a board member can be removed.It is interesting that one of the reasons for ceasing the office of a member of the board is if he or she is bankrupt or had made a compositional arrangement with a creditor. I know some of the most outstanding and honest of people who have had to make all kinds of arrangements with creditors. It is strange to include that provision in the Bill. I know it was there previously but in the context of where the country is right now, every second person has had to make some kind of arrangement with a creditor over recent years because of the state they found themselves in mainly due to the actions of various creditors in the past rather than anything they themselves had done. This needs to be looked at. It is an example of how we need to examine the Bill closely in this regard. In general, the legislation is an effort to make a difference and to put something real in place. It comes on the back of the Indecon and Morris reports, and on the back of an industry that has lacked integrity and had significant difficulties in the past. If we are to restore it or put some sort of shape on it, then the Bill is the first step. It would, however, have to be taken on and not seen as something that comes from on high. It would have to be embraced by everybody on the ground. The bywords of the industry from here on will have to be "fair play". That has not been the situation in the past.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	694	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute on behalf of the Labour Party to the debate. The Bill is urgently required to deal with a number of significant and relevant issues that arose over the last years. The Bill itself has been a long time in gestation. The Labour Party fully supports the speedy implementation of this important legislation. We may table amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen it in sections relating to sanctions, appeals structures and so on. We will certainly consider that. The greyhound industry will be strengthened by the passage of the Bill. If the industry does not take it on board, it will be in the last chance saloon. It is an important opportunity for the industry to put an appropriate regime in place and to remove any cloud that hangs over it. As Deputy O'Keeffe has said, it is an important rural industry that is spread right throughout the regions. People were taken aback that virtually no sanctions were in place, and where there were, people may just have walked free. That removes the element of fairness and people competing on a level paying pitch. All people want is that if a poor person runs a greyhound on its merits, it is not running against a greyhound whose owner has pepped it. That is not running on merits and that is not fair play. It is not a level playing pitch and it undermines people's belief in the industry. We must also remember that the industry gets €17 million from the taxpayer. Money is scarce and the industry has to appreciate that. I am also glad that an appropriate fund is being provided for rehoming retired greyhounds. This issue was the subject of one of the larger submissions we had during the detailed examination that was carried out. When the Bill was in the Seanad, the Minister inserted such a provision into section 29(1)(c) and we welcome that. As far back as April 2017, the Bill was subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine when that committee examined the general scheme. That was almost two years ago. The committee, including Deputies Martin Kenny, Cahill and O'Keeffe, devoted considerable time to reviewing same in a diligent fashion, and made submissions with the aim of improving the overall objective of the Bill. There is nothing there that cannot be improved further or refined. It has always been difficult to ascertain precisely the numbers of people employed in jobs in the greyhound industry. In 2017, the economist, Jim Power, estimated it as 5,000, with 300 people directly employed. That was a charitable guesstimate. Let us be clear that there is nothing proven about that figure but there are 12,000 or 13,000 people spread throughout the State, some of whom generate an economic benefit here and there. There are at least 7,000 greyhound owners throughout the country because anybody can have a greyhound. I used to have a greyhound many years ago but I would not be such a great person to be known as a greyhound owner. A few of us lads had him from the trainer Francie Murray, who is a top class trainer, but I knew very little and our greyhound was not very successful anyhow.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	697	I never walked in my life. I come from a constituency that has two good greyhound racing tracks in Mullingar and Longford. They have survived through recessions and downturns over the years with great resilience. We need to make it attractive for people to visit those tracks. An allocation of funds is supposed to come from the IGB to Mullingar, and it is needed. The tracks offer family outings but we need to get this message out there and get away from it being office based. There are 18 greyhound tracks in the State and we need to sell the idea that they are attractive for a night out. The 2014 Indecon report and the 2015 report into the greyhound industry by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine were part of a number of precipitating calls to action that have served as the genesis for significant change in the governance, integrity and welfare of greyhounds. The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, was the chairman of that committee at the time. I served under him and he was an excellent chairman. There was also the Morris Review of Anti-Doping and Medication Control in Ireland. It took a while to get that report out of the bag as it was slow to come out from the Department. The review was commissioned by Bord na gCon and published in July 2016. It made sobering reading. The necessity for proper sanctions in cases of transgressions was well documented and set out. The legislation deletes a number of the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 and replaces them with strengthened provisions, which is important. Clearly, and correctly, they aim to strengthen the sanction regime for breaches of the greyhound regulations. There is no place for illegal activity in any sport, not least the greyhound industry. All that is wanted is a fair and sporting chance for every dog owner who owns a dog, who pays the fees and enters it in a race. It is about the level playing pitch. I refer to the substantial taxpayer's funding provided directly by the State to allow the sector to develop. This is done through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, and it is €16.8 million this year. I supported that funding, but it is incumbent on all stakeholders to get maximum value for the significant State investment, and, at a minimum, to comply with strict governance procedures and ensure the integrity of the industry is never again subject to compromise in any shape or form. The taxpayers could, rightly, start to ask questions. We are all aware of the sale of the Harold's Cross stadium, and that the greater portion of the sale proceeds were used to alleviate a significant debt that Bord na gCon had accumulated over the years. One hopes that such a state of affairs will never arise again given the new governance procedure and structure that has been put in place. That period certainly left a sour taste in the mouths of many people. I also hope that the €6 million left over from the sale will be used for necessary infrastructure improvements and refurbishment of stadium facilities across the State. Perhaps the Minister of State could find out when funding is coming to Mullingar and Longford. These are two well established tracks in the midlands that serve Meath, Roscommon and all around that area. They are very fine tracks. The pre-legislative scrutiny permitted the committee to hear submissions from a wide array of stakeholders and interested parties, and the senior officials in the Department who are dealing with the Bill. As a result we put forward a number of amendments, some of which have been incorporated into the Bill. The recommendation pertaining to the export of greyhounds appears, however, to have been excluded. This is regrettable because we had a detailed submission in that regard. The committee also heard compelling arguments and proposals from the Irish Dog's Trust, the ISPCA and others, which struck us as valuable and cogent. We were taken by the force of same. I would like a detailed explanation from the Minister of State on why those recommendations have been excluded and if they could be re-evaluated to strengthen the Bill. I sincerely hope that the change of name provided for under section 8, from Bord na gCon to Rásaíocht Con Éireann, is more than cosmetic window dressing. It should represent a new beginning: more transparency at all levels, a greater emphasis on the welfare of the animals, and improved board governance and structures and regulations. The board size will increase from six to eight members and each member will come from an appropriate discipline. An accountant is needed on the board while a member to represent the owners is also needed. Owners are a diverse group but somebody needs to represent them as well. We also need to have somebody representing the trainers. We need the people who are on the ground, but we also need people from various disciplines, including animal welfare. I do not mind if animal welfare people are there: they should be in there and there is no reason they cannot be there. Everybody has something to contribute. I hope that they will represent the dog owners. I would say fair play to the Minister of State for the provision of a maximum term for board membership. It is about time. Some people got in there and it was harder to get off the board than it was to get onto it. The board will be refreshed. It should not be allowed to go stale. These provisions are all being laid down in primary legislation so it can brook no argument or entertain any ambiguity from here on. It is consistent with the much vaunted code of practice and governance, and I anticipate that it will add significant improvement. Clearly, any board member who has any interest, however remote, on any matter being discussed or considered should disclose that interest and then go out the door at 150 mph and not even look back. The board member should have no further part or participate in any voting and should be out of it. Before the meeting, he or she should know if anything is to be discussed that might offer a conflict of interest, in which case the board member should send apologies and not attend that meeting. I note the legal framework provided for in the Bill to ensure that resources are provided for the welfare of greyhounds. That is important. We received submissions from the various organisations that deal with greyhounds and I am delighted to see the framework incorporated. The Bill also incorporates many of the recommendations of the Indecon report pertaining to the functions of the chief executive, day-to-day operations and the functions of the board. That is all set out now so no one can come to the Minister and say he or she thought something was all right. It is only all right if the legislation says so. As such, I will brook no excuses or listen to any nonsense from here on. The Bill will ultimately improve the reputation of the industry, which is not confined to these shores. The export industry is very important. Most of the greyhounds that run in England originate in Ireland. Sanctions are widely accepted as fundamental to restoring and maintaining the reputation of the greyhound industry. Overall participation and support for the industry is predicated on the involvement of the general public. That includes the taxpaying public, who are providing an invaluable subvention, being certain that greyhound racing is a fair and competitive sport. Integrity and probity are fundamental and appropriate in a sport such as this and there must be appropriate sanctions which can be implemented immediately at administrative and criminal level. A robust system of sanctions is vital and necessary in order to protect the welfare of the participating dogs and the credibility and integrity of the sport . I recall the appearance of representatives from Greyhound Racing Integrity Ireland before the joint committee to support the idea of graduated sanctions linked to the severity of offences. Implementing criminal sanctions, with all that requires, is not readily done. To prove a breach in a criminal case involves a lot of preparation and represents a significant challenge. Nevertheless, such sanctions should be in place as deterrence is critical. The message must be sent that there will be no more tolerance of illegal activity. I do not have time to outline my views on each section. The Minister has done so in any event. As such, I will focus on a particular few. Sections 9 and 10 provide for the governance structure and time periods for the new board. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may terminate appointments to the board, including where a board member is adjudicated a bankrupt or is found guilty of offences related to the greyhound industry, animal welfare, fraud or dishonesty. I wonder about bankruptcy, given that a bankrupt may now stand for election to the Dáil. Is that fair? I am sure the Minister has an answer. Section 7 curtails the board’s ability to borrow unless it has the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform acting with the approval of the Minister for Finance. It can borrow €25,000. We must ensure the board can borrow enough without having to run up and down to the Department. The approval of the Minister is vital in terms of oversight. Sections 20 to 22, inclusive, are important and provide for the making of regulations in respect of racetracks and sanctions for class A fines. Prohibitions on certain beneficial interests in the business are important too. Section 21 is important in the context of the extension of regulatory powers to promote integrity and fair play. Section 27 provides for the regulation-making powers of the board in the areas of doping control and the administration of substances to greyhounds. The board may list prohibited or permitted substances, set out residue limits, withdrawal periods and thresholds of tolerance, require records for the administration of substances, medication control, provide for the use of advice and recommendations from the scientific advisory committee and outline the processes to be followed at all steps. Section 28 provides for regulatory powers in respect of the traceability of greyhounds, which is of great importance for owners, breeders, trainers and when it comes to the registration of racing greyhounds. A traceability system captures all of the many life events of greyhounds. A comprehensive training database is to be established. Sections 35 to 40, inclusive, deal with the appointment and investigative powers and functions of the authorised officers. This is being done for the first time and outlines the powers in full regarding the specified functions. I am of the view that the Attorney General had a fair look at this. It is now a statutory framework, clearly established, with control committees and a requirement to ensure fair procedures at every step in committee hearings. Provision is also made in respect of the sanctions committees can apply. Appeals committees are likewise bound by fair procedures. Section 54 relates to certificates to be issued by testing laboratories in the case of adverse analytical findings. I see elements tantamount to the provisions in drink-driving legislation where a certificate is also conclusive proof. Section 59 was debated at the committee and is important in respect of the application of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011. It provides that only progeny produced in compliance with sections 11(2) and 11(3) of the 2011 Act may be registered. The first to the seventh litters - and the eighth following certification - are permitted to be registered in the Irish greyhound stud book. It will be an offence to attempt to register litters not in compliance with the Act, which is important. This matter was also raised with the joint committee and the Government has taken note. As Deputy O’Keeffe stated, most owners and trainers love their greyhounds and care for them. It is like everything in life; only a small few commit significant transgressions. Most owners are based in rural areas and provide their animals with wonderful care. It is a very small number who have led to the identified deficiencies in the governance of the industry and in greyhound welfare and general standards. The Bill deals with the issues that have been highlighted. There is a necessity to ensure that greyhounds are cared for as they reach the end of life, including by way of rehoming. The Minister has dealt with that and fair play to him. Resources are important for the organisations which provide that necessary care. As Deputy Cahill stated, greyhounds make lovely family pets. Dogs of all types are extremely faithful. The new CEO appears to have hit the ground running and is prepared to interact with Members of the Oireachtas to discuss relevant issues. That is important. There can be no more ivory towers. He must maintain that stance and the board should be ready to come to the Houses to make its case. The members should not have the CEO at their hind ear the whole time. He should come in on his own to make his case and the members should be coming before the joint committee also. At €16.8 million, this year's money from the horse and greyhound racing fund could be up to 40% of the total income of the greyhound industry. That level of dependence on State subvention is not sustainable. We all know that it will not last. That is why I talk about the last chance saloon. As Deputy Cahill noted, the industry must make its product more attractive. The people must be brought through the turnstiles. The old way will not do. New ideas and new attractions are needed to make it worthwhile and the integrity and probity of the sport are critical in that regard. People will go when they are convinced. The sooner the industry is as financially independent as possible, the better it will be for all concerned. There will always be a requirement for some State input, but efforts must be made to improve the financial situation of this important industry. The central objective of the Bill is to root out neglect and cruelty in the industry through a significant focus on welfare. The Bill seeks to eradicate the misuse of drugs and will be an important step forward. There is a significant focus on testing facilities and analysis. A new strategic plan is envisaged. The current strategy extends to 2021 but it might be prudent to have an interim review in the next 12 months to see how it is progressing. We need a white list of appropriate countries for exports which have proper animal welfare regimes. This area remains somewhat grey as we do not have precise figures on the number of dogs being exported. We were informed during committee deliberations that some destinations for dogs exported from here have questionable records and even proven deficiencies. That is not something we can support. The need to ensure the welfare of greyhounds is fully protected in destination countries is not adequately addressed in the Bill, which is a worrying shortcoming. A very strong case was made to the joint committee in this regard. In broad terms, however, the Labour Party welcomes the legislation. Legacy issues, such as the scandals we have seen in the industry, should now be eliminated. There is an opportunity now to turn over a whole new leaf by ensuring that penalties for offences fit the crimes. The Minister said there would be a power to appoint members to the board. The opportunity should be taken to ensure that there are representatives of owners, trainers and other relevant stakeholders. There should also be a member who is qualified in respect of welfare issues such as a veterinary practitioner or representative of the industry. A great deal of promotional work falls to be done. When the Bill is enacted, the opportunity will arise for the new board and CEO to travel with a roadshow to advertise the attractions of a well-run industry. The Bill is a good start and it has been a long time in gestation.Our minds were sharpened. Some of us, such as Deputy Cahill, are very experienced in this area. We had the same process with the Horse Racing Ireland Bill. It was very slow, tedious and arduous down in the bunker and everybody looking at the Dáil thought we are away from the place altogether and that we were dodging but we were down there giving a lot of valuable time and input and we were learning, which is important. None of us is so intelligent that we cannot learn something new and we have learned a lot, but various areas, to which I have referred, need sharpening and tightening. If we have to address them with more severe sanctions, we will have to look at that. I know they will have to be subject to overview by the Attorney General, and I appreciate that more than anybody else. Nevertheless, we owe it to the people who pay their taxes to make sure the industry is above reproach with regard to its integrity, probity, governance and sanctions and, of course, with regard to the welfare of the animals. This is why the places to which we export our animals must be examined and scrutinised to ensure appropriate standards are implemented there. The Labour Party is very supportive of the Bill.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	698	What is central to the Bill is the welfare of greyhounds and there are considerable welfare issues relating to greyhounds. This is part of a bigger picture in Ireland of wanton, deliberate and sustained abuse of animals in spite of the many individuals and organisations dedicated to animal welfare, some of them without any State funding and relying on their own resources and fundraising. They are picking up the pieces from the mistreatment, abuse and cruelty that has been allowed to continue. I am looking at the Bill in the context of our other animal welfare legislation, which we know has not seen an end to cruelty. We also know the sanctions have not really been a deterrent. I am looking at this as part of the bigger picture. Looking at particular abuses where sanctions did not work, there was a recent case involving digging out foxes and a terrible example of a hunt chasing a fox into a housing estate. There was a court case and the hunt was fined the maximum allowed under the Control of Dogs Act but because at least 15 people took part in the hunt each person probably paid less than €100. The sanction in the Act was not sufficient. There are also questions about the welfare of the dogs and hounds, how they are bred and how they are kept. We are one of the few countries where fur farming continues and we know the appalling conditions in which minks are kept and the dangers to the environment when they escape. We know about the cruelty in badger baiting and that of so-called puppy farming establishments. We know about battery hens and now we have battery pups. These are some examples of the wider picture and the shameful way in which animals are treated in Ireland. With regard to the Bill we have greyhound racing, hare coursing and the export of greyhounds. Beneath all these the guiding rule will have to be the welfare of the greyhound in all situations. I am struck by the irony that we have a ban on the use of wild animals for entertainment purposes in circuses, which is a total hypocrisy when we see it is okay to use a hare for so-called entertainment at coursing meetings. There is also cruelty to the greyhounds. We know about the blooding of greyhounds, which goes on and is ignored. It involves the illegal netting of hares. While greyhounds are used for racing or coursing there is also the question of the welfare of those greyhounds that do not make it, either through injury, a lack of speed or stamina or whatever.

We have well documented cases of the appalling treatment of greyhounds there and in other places in China and Pakistan. The owners first export to Spain or France so they are not seen to be going to Macau but the trade is there. These owners should not be allowed to register or reregister as the case may be. The reality is that since last November four more Irish greyhounds have ended up in China and 37 Irish greyhounds are on a Chinese dog breeding establishment post. We know the appalling conditions of our puppy farms. One can only imagine the horrific conditions in these Chinese breeding establishments where there is no animal welfare regulation. Clon Eagle, a greyhound that competed in Clonmel in 2018, is now coursing in Pakistan. I saw a post where it was offered for £5,000 by an infamous sales agent transporter who had his greyhounds seized at Kinsley track in the UK such were the horrific conditions his greyhounds were in. I would love to know what has happened that particular owner and what the Bill will do to prevent this. Up to now there has been no follow-up on these issues except by the rescue organisations. Information was given to me by the Minister, Deputy Creed, on the export of greyhounds to countries lacking animal welfare regulations where we know there is documented proof. We know about the regulations when dogs go to an EU country. There are pet passports, micro chips, valid rabies vaccinations and they are examined by authorised vets. Seemingly, the board can only advise greyhound owners not to send their greyhounds to other countries but that is it. This is not enough. We have owners who continue to send their greyhounds to countries with appalling records when it comes to animal welfare. Deputy Broughan will probably discuss the Bill he has tabled on this. The question on the Bill comes back to how effective it will be. When owners abandon their greyhounds it is left to the ISPCA and the rescue groups to look after them. This is where we need a comprehensive paper trail, micro chipping and tracking so that abandoned greyhounds, whether in Ireland or shipped off to Macau, can be traced back to the owners and their owners will pay for it. Another point I raised is something I have been looking for in the Bill and perhaps I have missed it. It is with regard to the fact that all greyhound owners pay their registration fee to the coursing club. I am not sure if this will be changed in the Bill. There are greyhound owners who do not agree with coursing. Bord na gCon, or Rásaíocht Con Éireann, which will be its new name, should have the book to register greyhounds. Then we will see exactly how many greyhounds are racing and how many are coursing. Bord na gCon has the Retired Greyhound Trust to rehome greyhounds but I want to refer to a particular situation of which I was made aware recently with regard to rescued greyhounds. Irish greyhounds were rescued from Macau and taken to a number of countries, including the UK. A number of them were to be returned to Ireland but because of opposition from animal welfare groups to them coming back to Ireland they have been rehomed in England and this is an absolute scandal. If the welfare of greyhounds is central to the Bill we will see real action when it comes to their welfare. The maximum fine for conviction on indictment for operating a greyhound racing track without a licence is €250,000. I would like to see similar very harsh fines for those owners who are found guilty of deliberate cruelty to their greyhounds. The sanctions are advice, admonishment, censure, disqualification of the greyhound, exclusion of individuals and revoking licences but they need to be hit harder where it really hurts, which is in their pockets. Some of the examples I have mentioned also involve breaking the law. Prior to Christmas, I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality the number of times the Garda Síochána has invoked the Animal Health and Welfare Act when dealing with reports of animal neglect and cruelty. I would have included the greyhound Bill had it been passed. The specific information is not recorded on PULSE; some information is recorded but it is not specific enough. It is good there have been training seminars to familiarise gardaí with the Animal Health and Welfare Act and I hope it will apply to the greyhound Bill also. If there are breaches of the greyhound Bill I want to know it will not just be Bord na gCon that will be involved but also the Garda. Bills must be enforced, which means resources are put in place and they are implemented, and that action is taken when they are not implemented. I was a bit bemused by section 27, under which a greyhound that fails a test for prohibited substances is disqualified from racing or trialling. I had to go to section 46 to find the sanction for the owner, which is a fine not exceeding €12,500. I feel sorry for the dog in this situation because it has no choice regarding what the owner does with it but it seems the dog gets the more severe penalty.To summarise, I find it difficult to isolate greyhounds from other animals. We need comprehensive enforceable and enforced legislation when it comes to the neglect, cruelty and abuse of animals. The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, the Control of Horses Act 1996 and the Dog Breeding Establishment Act 2010 are good on paper, or at least aspects of them are. They are not, however, being enforced so the abuse, neglect and cruelty continues. It does not help that there are three Departments involved in animal issues. It does not help that there is no consistency in the way councils apply the Acts and the guidelines. Again, I refer to the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, the Control of Horses Act 1996 and the Dog Breeding Establishment Act 2010. It also does not help that there are refusals by certain councils to release inspection records. I also refer to the levels of secrecy and difficulties that animal welfare supporters have in getting information, including through freedom of information requests, on inspections that have been carried out by various groups. When that information in secured it can be very heavily redacted. It is also unhelpful that there are authorities that choose to do nothing when cases of animal neglect and abuse are brought to their attention by individuals and groups. Those authorities then spend their time justifying inaction and close ranks to protect their own. There are also vets who are not enforcing the animal welfare legislation. This Bill will go some way towards addressing those issues but there is a long way to go before we will really see action on animal welfare. I know Bord na gCon is trying to improve things. I have met its representatives. One of its pamphlets states that it loves and respects its athletes, which are the greyhounds. We have to go further than nice booklets. The reality is that there are gaps in the legislation and in enforcement.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	702	I am delighted to be able to contribute briefly on the Greyhound Racing Bill 2018. This Bill has been a long time coming before us. As other Deputies said, in 2014 we had the Indecon report which highlighted many severe deficiencies within the industry, in 2015 we had the report by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in July 2016 we had the Morris review of anti-doping and medication in Ireland commissioned by Bord na gCon. All three reports, sadly, found major issues with governance and regulation in dog racing. I commend my colleagues in the Seanad, in particular Senator Ruane and her staff and the Civic Engagement Group, on the amendments they put forward in trying to improve the Bill. There are still opportunities to greatly strengthen areas of the Bill, especially on animal welfare. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, that it is in the whole area of sanctions that we need to be taking action in respect of the well-intentioned provisions of this Bill. I refer specifically to the export of greyhounds. I was pleased to see that the amendment concerning the gathering of export data was accepted by the Minister of State and included in this amended version of the Bill. It seems like an attempt to have a comprehensive look at the major elements of the dog racing industry. I notice that in section 13 the four aims are governance, development and promotion as well as the health and welfare of the animals. Throughout the Bill references to health and welfare are fairly minimal and that is the big weakness that jumps out of the Bill. In Part 3, for example, which deals with racing and racetracks in sections 20 and 21, all the strengthened regulation that is being brought in concerning permits for people who work in the industry is welcome. Part 4 is also welcome in respect of training and public sale and the similar issue of licensing and permits. That is all welcome, as are sections 27 and 28 regarding substances and traceability. In all that, however, the role of the Minister of State and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the enforcement of these provisions is important. Perhaps the Minister of State might respond to us on how exactly he is going to request the board of the new rásaíocht con Éireann to implement those sections to which I have referred. That is what people who love dog racing and the industry and who want to protect the dogs - I accept that includes many owners and followers - will all be studying in particular.  That is why Part 6 providing for authorised officers is very important. A wide range of functions has been given to those officers as well as powers to protect them from anyone who tries to interfere with their business of inspections and the power of using search warrants with the support of An Garda Síochána. Part 7 and Part 8 relate to investigations and the system of enforcement which could, ultimately, lead to the District Court. Elements of all that are meritorious. All of it depends, however, on the Bill being actually implemented. Almost two years ago, I introduced the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill 2017 to amend the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and to provide for the control of export of greyhounds and for the publication of a white list of countries to which the export of greyhounds under licence would only be permissible. The white list was to be drafted by the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum in conjunction with Bord na gCon, which will become Rásaíocht Con Éireann as determined by this legislation. The countries on the white list are those which "meet minimum standards with regard to the welfare of greyhounds" and the past records of relevant countries, including enforceable welfare protections for greyhounds equivalent to protections available in Ireland, would have to been taken into account. The horror stories we hear from China, Pakistan and various other countries concerning how our dogs are treated in a savage manner after export bring home to us the essential nature of the provisions to which I referred. I, my colleague Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, and others will try to amend the Bill to reflect such provisions. My Private Members’ Bill would also make it an offence for persons to export greyhounds to countries not on the white list and would provide for related matters. That Bill still remains on the clár of the Dáil. Of course, the Minister of State has said that Bord na gCon is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in Ireland. That would include all the elements in respect of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and Bord na gCon's own code of practice. That code of practice, however, is not on a statutory footing and we have had to deal with that. The problem of secondary exports has also been mentioned. Of the seven or eight million dogs on the island of Britain, 80% of the racing dogs are Irish. A great number of the other dogs are also Irish. It now seems that on the morning of 30 March Britain will be a third country. Is the Minister of State taking any steps, with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to negotiate with the British Government on all our agrifood exports but also in respect of our dogs, in particular, and their good treatment and protection? In fairness, most people who buy Irish dogs are dog lovers. They have that tradition on our neighbouring island just as we have. It important, however, that the issues of protection and treatment are addressed. I also received the support of Ms Nessa Childers, MEP, in Europe on this issue. Ms Childers was very helpful at the time and informed me of the maltreatment of galgos españoles, Spanish greyhounds, in Spain. This not just an issue pertaining to Ireland. She informed me that the European Court of Auditors was to audit the implementation of the EU Animal Welfare Strategy 2012 to 2015. That is another area through which we can approach this issue as well. It is important to note that the Irish Greyhound Board has welcomed the Bill before us today. It stated that the Bill will offer further opportunities to grow the industry and extend its appeal to a wider audience. It also stated that welfare of greyhounds continues its number one priority. If that was the case, however, we would not be here with this legislation today. It cannot possibly be the number one priority of the Irish Greyhound Board. I commend Dogs Trust, the ISPCA, PAWS and the other animal welfare groups on the work they have done on this issue. I know they have liaised closely with the Minister of State. From working with my colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, other Opposition Deputies and Senators, liaising with the Minister, Deputy Creed, and submitting reports to the agriculture committee, the determination of those civic society groups to improve welfare standards for greyhounds is to be applauded. Dogs Trust, of course, is a member of the International Greyhound Forum, along with the ISPCA, PAWS and the Irish Blue Cross. Last April, Dogs Trust launched the campaign "Greywatch" to highlight what great pets greyhounds and lurchers make. The very helpful Oireachtas Library and Research highlighted that over the last ten years more than €116 million from the Horse and Greyhound Fund, including the 2019 allocation, has been transferred to Bord na gCon. Admittedly, Exchequer income from the fund declined. We were informed that last year, as mentioned by the Minister and others, there were just over 5,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the sector with an estimated 7,313 greyhound owners.We were told the multiplier effect creates approximately €300 million. These statistics are all the more reason to establish definitively and maintain the highest possible welfare standards in the breeding, racing and export of these wonderful animals, which have in some ways become symbolic of our nation. Other countries recognise the Irish greyhound, as well as the Irish wolfhound, as a dog par excellence.  Other statistics quoted in the research document on the Bill produced by our excellent Oireachtas Library and Research Service give a deep but worrying insight into the industry. Figures provided by the Irish Coursing Club show registered litters declining from approximately 3,000 per annum in 2010 and 2011 to just over 2,500 in 2016, with more than 18,000 greyhounds born in 2010 declining to 15,000 in 2016. In the same period, nearly 3,000 greyhounds were surrendered to dog pounds with just under 2,500 dogs put to sleep. The Greyhound Rescue Association has stated that approximately 10,000 dogs are missing from official statistics for 2010 to 2015. It is disappointing that although such high ambitions have been outlined in reports by Bord na gCon, the Department and so on, the reality can be different. The Minister of State has indicated that there will be another Indecon strategic review of the infrastructure services and the standard of facilities at Shelbourne Park and the remaining 15 stadiums. In 2017, there was the controversial sale of the five-acre Harold's Cross greyhound stadium to the Department of Education and Skills for €23 million, or was it €26 million, which gave a surplus to Bord na gCon to address its financial crisis. It was such a successful stadium that many people in the south inner city considered its sale a strange decision. I have other points to make but we will have another chance on Committee and Report Stages. While the Bill is comprehensive, its application will be the key, particularly in respect of the welfare of these lovely dogs. I hope this long-delayed and belated Bill will greatly improve the governance and administration of the new Bord na gCon. It will go some way to stamping out the quite serious abuses in the industry. The continuing dangers of dreadful abuse and death for animals through export to secondary countries remain a serious problem. Will the Government work with the UK to ensure that secondary exports to the UK will operate on a white-list basis?
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	703	I should begin by declaring that I have no interests in the greyhound industry and I am not related to the famous greyhound, Master McGrath, of which there is a statue in Dungarvan. There is no bloodline between us. As the Minister of State made clear on Second Stage in the Seanad, the greyhound racing sector contributes a substantial number of jobs to the economy, estimated at 5,000 by Mr. Jim Power, an economic consultant, in 2017. It also contributes €300 million annually to local economies. In addition, it is estimated that there are approximately 7,000 greyhound owners, with an estimated 12,000 people deriving economic benefit from the sector. That is not small change in rural Ireland. It is further estimated that more than 14 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings since 2002, which is a lot of people who enjoy themselves and contribute. On a positive note, I welcome the Minister of State's clarification that during the course of drafting the Bill, a number of changes were made. One such change places a greater emphasis on fair procedures, particularly with regard to the conduct of investigations by the board in respect of possible breaches of racing regulations and of the conduct of hearings by the control committee into suspected breaches. It is important that the sector is above board, open and transparent, with animals being 100% looked after. At all times we should try to improve fair procedures. I welcome section 12, which provides for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest, which is why I disclosed that I was not related to the great Master McGrath. I understand it is a new provision which was recommended in the Indecon report. Nevertheless, we have debated the issue for some time. In April 2017, when the matter was very much in the public sphere following the sale of the Harold's Cross track, which was done in a strange fashion, I called on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to engage immediately with the members of the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation in an attempt to resolve the ongoing crisis in the greyhound sector. At the time there were many calls for the removal of the entire Irish Greyhound Board, IGB. The crisis was made worse by the refusal of the board, which was appointed by a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, to listen to the frustrations and concerns of the ordinary members. I will not now attack members of the Labour Party because my colleagues chastised them enough earlier, but Deputy Kelly told us all what to do, appointing the board and he wanted to get them sacked. We are not defenders of the board, unlike Deputy Michael Lowry, who attempted to shift the blame onto members and to insist that problems are simply down to misunderstandings over the role of the Irish Greyhound Board. That was utterly nonsensical and its condescending attitude can now be seen. The rank-and-file greyhound breeders and owners know their industry just as well as the apparent experts on the board. They can see what needs to be done and should be listened to. We should always listen to na daoine beaga, daoine na tíre, the people on the ground. A change of the existing governance arrangements will go some way towards addressing these concerns as it will be the first indication that the priority is not simply to maintain the status quo and the interests of the board but rather to put the good of the industry first. We cannot allow the situation to deteriorate further. I am glad the Minister of State, the board and its defenders are coming to their senses and are willing to take account of the unanimous vote of no confidence that occurred at a meeting in the Horse and Jockey on this issue in March 2017. Bhí mé ann and it was comprehensive. On the greyhound racing sector in County Tipperary, I was delighted that a successful meeting, which I attended, was held last Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. I am pleased that it went off well. I have not yet received the figures on whether there were accidents or incidents of hares being injured or hurt but I hope there were not. It is well policed by Bord na gCon and independent arbitrators. Naturally, there was the usual cabal of protestors, which I sadly missed because I entered through a different gate. I did not know they were at the next gate because I would not have avoided them but instead I would have welcomed them to let them see what goes on. I ask them to concentrate on another ongoing practice. There are excellent coursing clubs in County Tipperary, such as Knockgraffon and Clogheen; Cappoquin in County Waterford; in east Cork, in Deputy O'Keeffe's area; and in Cashel and Galbooly in north County Tipperary. We have been unable, however, to hold coursing meetings for the past number of years because a certain protected species of people goes out with lurchers and terriers and set five, six or eight of them on a little hare or rabbit and tear it asunder. No one says a word about it. These people go out lamping at night, terrorising farmers, but if a farmer tries to stop them because they are frightening cattle and intimidating the public, they will threaten the farmer. They will then cut the farmer's water pipe and there will be a massive water bill when the cattle are put out in spring time, and the leak will not be noticed until then. They will also cut the electric-fence wires. It is terrorism by a band of protected species that no one can deal with. No one wants to deal with them, yet we complain about muzzled greyhounds. I raised the issue in the Chamber when Mr. John Gormley was in government, and I spent two hours one night at a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting with the then Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen, and the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. Gormley, discussing when a breeding bitch is a breeding bitch. I gave up that night on what we were listening to. There were 70 or 80 of us in attendance. The country was going down the tubes before the crash and we were talking about when a breeding bitch is a breeding bitch. I said the next thing they would stop was the cat chasing the mouse, and that is the folly of it. Our rural pursuits must be protected. We do not come up to Dublin saying its people cannot have this or that. They have enough to hear about the number of people who are being shot and murdered every night, and they do not have time or interest to concern themselves with what we do in County Tipperary. We are working alright. The Minister of State should do his best. We want our country practices and our sport protected. It is not a sadistic sport. The hares are well nurtured and the coursing clubs look after and nurture them. A few years ago, hares were ready for the coursing, and - hey presto - animal rights activists came along, cut the wire and left them on the M8 motorway to be crushed by trucks. Another time, quite a few years ago, activists broke glass and put it on the tracks. Imagine the injury that would do the greyhounds' or hares' feet. We must have a balance. Ordinary country people are trying to have a bit of fun in the industry but everyone who has a greyhound must have a box and a kennel and must pay veterinary fees. It is an industry and we can see that. We do not try to shut down what goes on in Dublin, where Deputy Broughan and others live. We respect them. We do not interfere or stop people in Dublin having their pursuits. We must stop the marauding gangs who are terrorising the people and looking for places that they can use. They terrorise the community in County Tipperary and it is not good enough. Why are the animal rights activists not focused on that? They post on Facebook that so many hares have been torn asunder by lurchers, terriers and everything else. They say there is no muzzle or anything else - only slaughter - and that there is a considerable betting industry behind it.Gangs of men are in fields frightening housewives, farmers and everybody else.

When addressing this type of matter, I like to speak about our own County Kerry and the proud tradition of greyhound racing and pursuits there. We are very fortunate as we have the great Kingdom greyhound stadium located in Tralee under the great stewardship of Mr. Declan Dowling, who runs a very efficient show every week. It is very well attended each weekend by people young, old and middle-aged. Everybody enjoys a night at the races in the Tralee stadium. It is a great way of fundraising, and fundraising has been carried out there for years for the likes of Kerry University Hospital. Much equipment has been procured because of great nights that were had in the stadium in Tralee. I will speak about the people who breed and race greyhounds, and specifically those in County Kerry because I know them. These are people who absolutely adore their dogs. They appreciate them fully every day and they work with them in hail, rain and shine. They are the people I support. These are not the odd few people who have brought this area of racing into disrepute by trying to pep up or pep down dogs for races. The people I speak about are genuine about dogs. They bring up their children to respect dogs, they work with them until late at night, they walk them early in the morning and they train and nurture them. They look after them when they are ill. When the dogs come to retirement, as we might call it, these people take great care of them, along with our vets. I compliment our vets in Kerry too; whether they tend to small or big animals, they are very experienced and take great care of them. The issue of what happens to greyhounds when their time at the track is finished has been mentioned. The people I know take excellent care in ensuring good homes are procured for those dogs, or they might keep them if required. It is very important to recognise that the true people working with dogs would never want to see a hair harmed on a dog's head. They want to mind their dogs at all times. I compliment the people who work in the dog shelters in County Kerry, whether they are in the pound run by Kerry County Council or the volunteers who take care of all types of animals. There are examples in Kenmare and Killarney. A group called KLAWS, also made up of volunteers, does excellent work in our community. It was always said one could judge a man or woman by the way he or she took care of a dog. If anybody mistreats a dog, he or she would not care much about anybody else either. We were always very fond of dogs because they were always around at home, and we could always judge people by the way they treated all types of animals. It is very important that this Bill strengthens the welfare of animals and protects the reputation of the industry because it means so much. Deputy Mattie McGrath put the argument very passionately that we in the country want to continue with our pursuits. We do not need people telling us what to do because we can regulate it ourselves. That said, I welcome any regulation that strengthens the welfare of animals and ensures they can be protected at all stages. We must nevertheless keep this sport going. It is great to see buses full of tourists coming to the Kingdom stadium on a Friday or Saturday night. They are delighted to come and have the best of entertainment and food at the track while they watch the dogs running in a very well-organised and professional fashion. The people who bring their dogs come from Tarbert and all over the county. Many of them are located around Tralee, south Kerry and Dingle. These people have put so much effort into the work. If they did a profit and loss analysis, as the Minister of State knows, they would probably not make money from it. They do it for the love of it. They love going out and meeting other people. Over the years I have met so many nice people and made friends at that stadium on a Friday or Saturday night. The regular attendees sit in the same seats and they can watch racing from tracks around the rest of the country as well as what goes on in Tralee. We are very fortunate as we have a very proud tradition of taking care of our greyhounds in Kerry. We could not say anything bad about any type of legislation that would strengthen the protection of animals. We are all for that. We want to ensure the industry will remain in Kerry as it creates much needed employment in different sectors. People work in stadiums and there are ancillary workers in the bars, kitchens and restaurants. It is a great team and we are all looking for the one thing, which is a bit of sport and enjoyment. We also want to see the dogs being looked after.

Some people think it is a good idea to put glass in front of dogs as a form of protest but that is surely outrageous behaviour. It shows that some people will stop at nothing to get their way. We will not allow that.

Anything that helps to strengthen and ensure the continuation of this valuable industry must be welcomed. There are many issues we hope the legislation will address. It must first strengthen the industry and eliminate illegal activities, of which there have been a few examples. There is a need to regulate the sale of greyhounds both here and abroad. There should be guidelines for the keeping and training of greyhounds for reward. All of this seems to be in the Bill and we hope it will bring about a constructive process, with people being rewarded by the legislation's fair enactment. The setting up of the new board will be very important. We recognise the change of the name to Rásaíocht Con Éireann; it has been changed from Bord na gCon because of the problems with the old board. Many people were up here a year or so ago complaining about doping and illegal activities, so we hope the Bill will help eliminate all those activities and give people who love the industry and their dogs the chance to be treated fairly, whether it is in racing, training or whatever side of the industry in which they are involved. This activity is taken very seriously in most of our county. We could start in Castleisland and Tralee in north Kerry before going back around Ardfert and Ballyheigue and coming to Scartaglin, Cordal and Gneeveguilla. Mr. Tim Kelly lives in Headford and gives every free minute he has to the industry, despite rearing a big family. He works so hard, even with a day job and his big family, and he really lives for his dogs. He may not have many neighbours at it where he lives but it does not make a difference to him.He is just an example of someone who treats his dogs and takes his business so seriously. We hope that this new set-up will help fellows like him. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, we are so lucky to have the Kingdom racetrack in Tralee where so many people raising funds for important things have race nights and raise up to €30,000 or €40,000. It provides money for communities that need it, whether for sports halls or all kinds of different things or for people who are in trouble with their health or whatever. This racetrack is a place for them to make money and people go to support these race nights and at the same time get enjoyment out of them. Even in the heart of south Kerry into Cahirciveen, through Killorglin, we remember people like Chubb O'Connor who was a Member of the Dáil for 20 or 21 years. He made history with great dogs. David Cahill was very famous in Chicago. He was known as "Red David". He won fierce races in America and in Ireland. Indeed the great Noel Browne, who carries on the great tradition and works so hard in Castleisland, is a mighty operator and has won the biggest of races in Clonmel in the past year or two.  There are people who have given their lives to their dogs, to be honest about it. It is good that we are recognising the need for proper regulation and assistance for these people who provide a great sport – and it is a sport for people to enjoy. I am very proud to be involved with so many of those people around the county because they are great people. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, we can judge a person by how they treat their dogs and these people do treat their dogs very well. Hopefully there will be no place for the rogue operators. There were only a few but the investigators and authorised officers will have the powers to deal with those rogues and villains. I take this opportunity to wish all the greyhound owners in Kerry all the very best for the future. 
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	708	I was very surprised when I heard Deputy Danny Healy-Rae saying no dog owner would want to hurt a hair on a dog's head but I realised he was talking about a "hair" not a "hare" because hares unfortunately are regularly injured by the activity of some dog owners and the barbaric practice of hare coursing, which continues in this State. This is not a debate about rural versus urban because increasingly many farmers and land owners are objecting to mobs coming onto their land trying to gather hares or engage in that type of activity. There is a certain irony in our discussing this Bill when Deputy O'Sullivan and I came from a court case in Carlow this morning, which was unfortunately adjourned, the Kavanagh case where the accused has pleaded guilty to 120 counts of appalling animal cruelty in puppy farming. There are huge issues around animal welfare in this State which need to be addressed. This Bill before us is another attempt to update the legislation by regulating the greyhound industry. There have been numerous attempts to clean it up over the years, there was the Act in 1993, two more in 2007 and the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, and the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. There have been three reports on the industry in the past five years: Indecon; the 2015 report on the greyhound industry and the Morris Review of Anti Doping and Medication Control in Ireland, all of which serve to highlight how defective and how desperately in need of robust legislation the so-called industry is. To talk about "rogue operators", as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae did, flies in the face of the evidence of those reports. Regulation is urgently needed. While I welcome the fact that the Government is bringing forward the Bill, it is not enough. Some aspects are of course to be welcomed but there is much that has not been addressed and we would be failing in our responsibility if we did not concentrate our remarks on that. The Bill is weighted towards administrative powers, such as the make-up of the board membership and its expertise. The legislation seems to be more about the marketing, rather than the welfare, of greyhounds, without which there is no industry. I object to the term "industry" when we are talking about the welfare of animals. It gives us an insight into the thinking behind the Bill that it took an amendment from Senator Ruane, which thankfully was included, to get a veterinary surgeon on the board. If the Bill was to deal with animal and dog welfare one would think a vet would have been put on the board without somebody in here having to propose an amendment to do that. Issues such as governance, animal welfare and the export of dogs, which has been left out of the Bill entirely, need a legislative framework that is not provided in the Bill. I do not know how much we will be able to amend it on Committee Stage but it does need considerable work. We have to be honest and say this industry has been surrounded by scandal, illegality, doping and animal cruelty. It is an established fact that thousands of dogs are surrendered or abandoned to pounds every year and hundreds are put down as a result of injuries received at racetracks, including fractures, spinal injuries, ligament and muscle damage and head trauma. There have also been the very high profile incidents of doping with cocaine and other products that can be bought on the Internet. That was absolutely shocking and brought this State into serious disrepute internationally. I am very disappointed with the governance proposals in the Bill. They do not go far enough. To suggest, as the Bill does, that it is enough to hand over the administrative powers of sanction to a board that has no real powers of enforcement indicates how seriously regulation is being taken, not very seriously at all. It is akin to lip service. There is no attempt to enhance enforcement or to introduce criminal sanctions of a serious character. The Bill is proposing some form of self-policing. We all know where self-policing gets us. Self-regulation is no regulation. This State has learned nothing if it does not provide for outside oversight and scrutiny. Many of the animal welfare organisations have highlighted some of these points in previous discussions on this Bill. The Irish Society for the Protection of Animals, ISPCA, has questioned the limited powers of sanction and highlighted that the Bill needs to be altered to provide for serious deterrents. It points out that the stewards of the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, are not authorised under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 to investigate possession of illegal substances, an evolving issue which has featured prominently in the industry.Let us be honest: people are very creative in finding ways around doping controls in order to have it continue under different guises, all at the expense of the dogs. The Irish Council Against Blood Sports has stated that the sampling strategy currently in place is far too routine. The council has serious concerns about the ability of the Irish Greyhound Board to keep up with the rapid pace of development in doping in the industry. As stated, this is a national scandal. Apart from the reputational damage caused by this appalling conduct, there is a serious welfare issue at its heart. The welfare of greyhounds and the deployment of funds in respect of welfare-related issues were identified as being key during pre-legislative scrutiny but they not been addressed in the Bill. Why is that? Will the Minister of State address that point? This aspect of the Bill has to be substantially strengthened. I would really like to know why these issues did not find their way into the Bill in its latter stages. The greyhound racing industry relies on a massive subsidy from taxpayers. This subsidy rose rapidly and steadily during the period from 2010 to 2016. During that time, 2,896 greyhounds were surrendered to dog pounds. Of those, 2,497 were put down. There was no increase in funding from the industry in the same period in order to provide for retired greyhounds. Why is that? The organisations at the coalface, including the Irish Council Against Blood Sports, the ISPCA, the Dogs Trust, and Greyhound Rescue Association Ireland, have all highlighted the need for the industry to increase its contribution in the context of animal welfare. Funds are badly needed to cover the cost of additional inspectors and to ensure that welfare issues, medical treatment, and the rehoming of retired greyhounds are all addressed. It is interesting that the Greyhound Trust receives substantial funding from the industry in Britain each year. Why are we so far behind? Why have we not adopted that practice if we are serious about assisting these dogs? Greyhound Rescue Association Ireland has reported that in the period 2014 to 2015 there was a decline in the number of dogs being destroyed which corresponded with a rise in the number of greyhounds being transferred to welfare groups. In other words, the volunteer-based rescue and animal welfare groups such as Dogs Trust and Homes for Unwanted Greyhounds, HUG, intervened and stepped in to provide the protection and welfare needed and to home greyhounds abandoned by the greyhound racing industry, which is not paying its way despite being the source of the problem. The Minister of State will be aware that the ISPCA has called for an additional €500,000 per year just to hire additional inspectors. As far as I am concerned, the industry needs to be made to cough up substantially more than that in order to address the welfare of retired greyhounds. We also need to take note of the figures regarding greyhounds being killed in pounds, which represent only a small proportion of the number falling victim to this industry. As stated previously, thousands of greyhounds suffer injuries at racetracks every year and are destroyed by track veterinarians. As my colleagues stated earlier, there is also the shame of greyhounds that go missing and are presumably killed. Despite the remarks suggesting that every dog owner is a dog lover - and many of them are - not all of them are. The existence of cruelty and bad practice is undisputed. One Irish trainer remarked online, "I’ve seen dogs being shot. It has to be done as there’s too many of them to rehome." A former chairman of the Irish Greyhound Board admitted on radio in 2016 his belief that it is absolutely okay for thousands of dogs to be killed and that racing could not exist without the destruction of dogs. Again, this is an industry that is given State funds. It is responsible for catastrophic injury, death and abandonment of greyhounds and gives dogs over to hard-pressed volunteers. I point this out because some of the language is misleading and not really believable. In reply to a question from Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan last year, the Minister, Deputy Creed, stated that Bord na gCon's strategic plan is to put animal welfare at the centre of the industry. Let us be honest; profit is at the centre of the industry, not animal welfare. Animal welfare is only involved if the asset is jeopardised and if it will be worth the effort. That does not always tally. It is handled within very narrow perimeters. The language really demonstrates that we are not serious, because we are not putting in the supports in respect of welfare. The other key issue which is not dealt with in the Bill - this is a matter of great concern in itself - is that relating to the export of Irish greyhounds. My colleague, Deputy Broughan, has tabled a Private Members' Bill on this issue and he addressed some of these points earlier. Could this matter not have been dealt with in the Bill? Why are the issues the Deputy spoke about not dealt with? The Minister of State and everyone else knows that this is a hugely controversial issue because of our appalling record in facilitating exports to China and other countries that have few or no regulations to protect the welfare of dogs. We know of the very high-profile cases in the media, some of which were cited earlier. We know of the treatment of dogs in places such as Macau where there are no regulations at all to protect dogs during their careers. They live the majority of their lives in cages and face certain death at the end. They are boiled, skinned, and sold off for food, which is, quite frankly, horrific. I see a contradiction in the remarks of some people who would find it abhorrent to eat dog but who have no problem with eating the meat of cows, sheep or pigs. That is probably not a debate for today, but it is linked. We have also seen the embarrassing situation whereby animal welfare volunteers in the UK had to stop the export of Irish greyhounds through UK airports in 2017. Some airlines have since taken a principled stand on the matter and refuse to transport greyhounds to countries that do not meet animal welfare standards. Australia refuses to export greyhounds to China. This should be a fundamental part of the legislation. The Government's refusal to include it is a reflection of the fact that we do not attend to these matters sufficiently. I note the Minister of State's response to this proposal suggests that such restrictions may not be compatible with EU trade law, but that is a deflection. There have been really contradictory responses on this over the years. The previous Minister is on record as stating "Once appropriate animal health and welfare certification requirements are met, dogs, including greyhounds, may be exported internationally, including to China." This certification, however, refers only to transport conditions and does not deal with the conditions the dogs will face in the jurisdiction to which they are being transported or with the welfare standards in the state. In March last year, the Department blocked the Irish Greyhound Board from exporting dogs to China as a result of animal welfare concerns. It stated that it considered the risk contained in Bord na gCon's proposal to be unacceptably high from a range of different perspectives. The Department is more concerned about reputational damage than the damage being done to dogs. As was pointed out in the Seanad, we can also call for a derogation under Article 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which expressly provides for exceptions based on public morality and the protection of health and life of humans, animals, or plants.  There is a lot more work to be done on this Bill. We can deal with these points on Committee Stage. I welcome that the Bill is here. However, it is not good enough and there is a lot more work to be done.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-02-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	709	I thank the Deputies for their contributions. It is generally accepted that this legislation is long overdue and, while people are generally welcoming, I accept that there is a range of views, particularly in respect of welfare concerns. Deputy Daly mentioned that it was about reputation. In fairness, regardless of commercial aspects or anything else, the reputation we have as a country of caring for animals should be paramount. This legislation is primarily an industry Bill to regulate the integrity and governance of the industry. The other legislation that deals primarily with welfare, which is integrated and woven into this Bill, is the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. Deputy Daly made a specific point about the authorised officers. I repeat that sections 35, 36, 37 and 40 relate to the appointment, investigatory powers and functions of authorised officers. The Bill provides amplified powers for authorised officers to investigate matters including investigating the use of performance altering substances. Section 40 specifically provides that subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court, authorised officers may seek a search warrant, including to search a domestic dwelling, where the authorised officer believes that there may be evidence of a breach or an intended breach of the racing code or of the commission or intended commission of an offence under the Greyhound Industry Acts. There is enhanced power assigned to the authorised officers which was not there heretofore. I will try to deal with the main concerns that have been raised. One of them has been about the Bill Deputy Broughan brought in and the so-called white list. Trade within the EU is governed under specific EU law and procedures for export, particularly Council Directive 92/65/EEC, which states that dogs moved to another EU country from Ireland must be accompanied by a pet passport, be microchipped and have valid rabies vaccination. The premises exporting dogs must be registered with the Department in advance of export and before travel, dogs must undergo a clinical examination by an authorised veterinarian who must verify that the animals show no obvious signs of disease and are fit to be transported. Dogs must also have a health certificate issued by a Department veterinarian. These procedures, including vaccination, ensure that only healthy dogs over the age of 15 weeks are allowed to be exported. There are other considerations, in particular with regard to the receiving premises.  I am conscious that I would like to get Second Stage concluded this evening; I know it is in my hands. Under the retired greyhound fund, Bord na gCon in 2017 contributed just over €100,000 to the Retired Greyhound Trust. Bord na gCon contributed €11,000 towards neuter-spay and €93,000 towards the general trust. The list of countries in which animals were rehomed and the numbers amount to 529 in 2018. The majority of greyhounds are exported to the UK. About 85% is the most accurate analysis. They are the dogs that are actually registered in the stud book in the UK. Our own animal identification and movement system, AIMS, does not allow for the identification of different dog breeds, no more than in any species of animal, so it is not possible to get it any more refined than it is.  The purpose of this legislation is to improve the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions and improve integrity. The Bill goes a long way to doing that and I accept that there will be amendments which we will endeavour to address on Committee Stage. I thank all Members and my colleagues from the Department, who have worked really hard to get this legislation through. It is long overdue. Since I was appointed in May 2016, we have been endeavouring to get this legislation into the Dáil. We have successfully got it through the Seanad. I accept that amendments were made by various Members. We took them on board where we felt they were valid.  On the appointment of a vet, it is important to point out that it was recommended in the Indecon report. It was never intended that there would not be a vet included but it was accepted that we could specifically put in both a vet and somebody with industry knowledge so that we would have good cross-representation. There are other legal and financial skill sets which are also very important in terms of the overall administration of an organisation such as Bord na gCon. I will conclude at that. I hope to see this Bill concluded before Easter.
