He will not need me to remind him that the scale and nature of the housing crisis affecting not just this city, but the entire country, is the greatest social challenge of our time. The Government recognises this and many initiatives have been undertaken to address the issue. One of the proposals that have been made by the Peter McVerry Trust seems eminently sensible. It aims to utilise the amount of space that is available or vacant, particularly in Dublin city, to house people. The Minister of State knows as much as anyone the long-term damage any stint in homelessness or insecurity of housing can cause, especially to young children, for whom the damage can last the rest of their lives. Ireland has a particular understanding of that issue. The Minister of State will accept that the Peter McVerry Trust is a credible and compassionate organisation whose heart is in the right place. It has worked with a number of Ministers in recent years on trying to find practical solutions to the housing problem. It has identified approximately 10,000 units that it believes would be beneficial in addressing the housing crisis. It describes them as over-the-shop units. Added to the estimated 33,000 empty residential units across this city and further afield, this would go a long way towards addressing the issues. There are other housing projects, for example, the interesting Abhaile Project, which recently won an award for redeveloping the upper storeys of large, four-bedroom or three-bedroom occupancies that had just one person living in them in a bid to alleviate some of our issues. The over-the-shop phenomenon has been identified by the Peter McVerry Trust as a practical means through which the city council, with support from the Minister of State's Department, can address some of the housing shortages. The trust, supported by the city council, has suggested that approximately 10,000 people could be provided with accommodation in these empty or under-used spaces in the upper floors of buildings. The Peter McVerry Trust is trying to think imaginatively.It is clear from an audit of the empty spaces that are available in the city that the over-the-shop phenomenon would provide spaces and places where housing could be easily provided for families who are in need. How seriously does the Government view the submission made by the Peter McVerry Trust this month to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for a national re-use strategy? I am sure the Minister has the submission and has studied it in great depth. It makes huge sense. While the conversation is always about building new units and estates, which is understandable, that process is quite lengthy. Obviously, it is necessary to go through the planning process and that can be quite exhaustive and difficult. The case we are making here is to look at existing buildings, units and spaces that are under-utilised. We believe there are 10,000 of them in Dublin city alone and we ask the Department to take the submission from the Peter McVerry Trust seriously, engage with Dublin City Council and begin the process of utilising these units to house our people.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	3	I assure the Senator that everything from the Peter McVerry Trust is taken seriously in addressing homelessness and housing. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is very much in agreement that tackling the issue of vacant housing, derelict sites and under-utilised spaces, as advocated by the trust, is a key part of the comprehensive approach required to address our current housing challenges. It is good to see that organisations such as the trust are promoting the take-up of important schemes such as the repair and leasing and buy and renew schemes introduced by the Department to maximise their impact. In this regard, I highlight the importance the Government attaches to taking joined-up action with local authorities, property owners and organisations such as the Peter McVerry Trust on empty or under-utilised buildings to secure additional homes as early as possible. Whereas building new homes is a significant element of Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, it is clear that an effective and quick way to meet housing needs is to make the most efficient use of the housing stock we already have, across all forms of tenure, as an important source of potential housing supply. Pillar 5 of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan is specifically focused on utilising the existing housing stock and one of its key actions is to develop a national vacant housing re-use strategy to ensure the existing vacant housing stock throughout the country, in both the public and private sectors, is used to the optimum degree possible. With the 2016 census showing more than 180,000 vacant homes across the country, excluding holiday homes, representing approximately 9% of the overall national housing stock, we must assess where and how many of these empty homes can be quickly brought back into use. Almost 80,000 vacant dwellings were recorded in our cities and large towns. This level of vacancy is unacceptable when we are faced with such a severe housing shortage. In compiling a register of vacant units, especially in and around cities and larger towns where demand is greatest and where the pressure on house prices and rents is most acute, local authorities are best placed to identify these vacancy hot spots, tracking what has changed on the ground since the April 2016 census count, and to set out a range of actions, in collaboration with property owners, to bring as many of these vacant houses and buildings back into use. A working group led by the Housing Agency has done considerable research work to date. Using the more detailed localised data from the census, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is now considering developing a package of actions to increase the ambition and mobilise all the key arms of the State to work together on this crucial initiative. This analysis will feed into the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland which the Minister is now leading to focus on what further actions can be taken and what new ideas we can bring to bear. If budgetary measures are needed to reinforce the ambition, this may delay the publication of the strategy until after the summer. However, this will not delay the commencement of important work at local level in gathering more up-to-date information on where vacant properties are and who owns them in order that we can facilitate the re-use of many vacant properties, particularly in cities and towns. Ahead of finalisation of the strategy, it is worth noting that the Department has already activated a number of significant measures to incentivise the increased use of vacant housing stock to help meet the needs of those in receipt of social housing assistance. These initiatives include the repair and leasing scheme, the buy and renew scheme and the Housing Agency acquisitions fund, all of which are available to provide opportunities for owners of vacant properties to get them back into use to meet social housing need in their areas.

I get the sense that the issue of vacancy hot spots, as they were described, is being taken seriously and that the Minister is happy to engage with local authorities on it. I am a little disappointed with the suggestion that the publication of the strategy could be delayed until after the summer, but I understand these things happen occasionally. Given the nature of the crisis, many would suggest that delays of that nature would be disappointing. Perhaps the Minister of State might give me another verbal reassurance that he is aware of the submission from the Peter McVerry Trust and that he understands there are an estimated 10,000 over-the-shop units in Dublin city alone. This is part of the jigsaw of measures that can be used to solve the crisis. I hope all submissions to the Department are accepted in the spirit in which they are submitted.

I assume that it is. The Senator said that people need to act imaginatively, which is a good term. I know the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, well and I believe the Senator knows him well too. The Minister is one of the people whom I believe will act imaginatively to ensure that whatever must be done will be done. I wish to reiterate the point I made earlier. The report could be delayed if additional finance is required. That might be required following the budget. That is the only reason I am aware of for the report to be delayed.
#TimLombard	unknown-#TimLombard-party	unknown-#TimLombard-dob	unknown-#TimLombard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	6	I welcome the Minister of State. It is great to see a former Senator returning to the House in such a distinguished role. I congratulate him on his great achievement. The issue I am raising is the cost of insurance for businesses and farmers in Ireland. It is a very important matter. The cost of doing business in Ireland has dramatically increased over the past few years and the cost of insurance is a major part of that. We are trying to ensure this is a competitive nation but insurance is making us uncompetitive at present. I have been contacted by constituents in towns such as Bandon, Clonakilty and Skibberreen who have seen the cost of their insurance go through the roof. They have not been able to get flood insurance since 2009, but now the cost of their normal retail insurance has increased dramatically. In 2014, one of these people got insurance for €4,500. In 2015, it was €7,500 and in 2016, after a struggle, they got it for €10,000. It is the same premises with no major change but the cost of insurance has driven the cost of the person doing business through the roof. The knock-on effect, unfortunately, is that the consumer pays. It is a major problem. In 2017 the Minister of State's predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, produced a very positive report on the motor insurance industry. It contained 33 recommendations or objectives. They were positive recommendations. We now must see the same positive input with regard to the business and agricultural communities. There must be a similar report that will examine the needs of those sectors and the needs of the consumer to ensure we can have a competitive market.Unfortunately, as we have only two major insurance companies in that market, there is no competition owing to the fact that there are only two players. There is talk of price fixing and other issues. On 4 July the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission raided insurance companies in the course of investigating another issue. There are issues of concern in the insurance industry but, unfortunately, there is no silver bullet. This afternoon I hope we can progress the situation and move forward in order to provide stability in the market. The biggest problem those people face is what their insurance premia will be next year. Given that it has literally doubled in the past two years, the question is whether it will double again. They cannot afford to do business like that. We need to have a Government intervention in order that we can have competition and for the Government to step in and ensure people can do business. I realise there is no silver bullet to solve the issue but unless we start we will not do what is appropriate, which is hopefully to make sure the cost of insurance does not stop people from doing business.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	7	I thank the Senator for raising the matter and his good wishes. It is always nice when a good friend offers wishes of that nature and we are good friends. It should be noted that the Minister for Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. Neither he nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. However, as has been stated, it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the availability and cost of insurance. It was for that reason that the cost of insurance working group was established by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in July last year. As the Senator noted, the first phase of its work centred on motor insurance given the large increases seen in the sector in recent years. As part of the consultations during that phase, the working group received a number of submissions from businesses on the increasing cost of insurance they were facing, in particular in employer liability and public liability cover. The submissions made it very clear that there was a pressing need to examine the rising and unsustainable cost of such insurance for businesses. Reinforcing that position are the Public Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, statistics which indicate that employer liability and public liability insurance are the two largest areas, after motor insurance, where personal injury claims arise. In 2016, for example, public liability and employer liability applications represented 27% and 15%, respectively, of all applications received by the PIAB. By comparison, motor applications made up approximately 57% of applications. For those reasons, the working group decided to undertake a second phase to see what could be done to tackle the cost of employer and public liability insurance as those are the two core types of insurance which the business and agriculture sectors require. In carrying out its work, the working group is considering the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors, the impact of health and safety issues on the cost of insurance and other market issues. The working group is also building on the previous work done in the motor phase on personal injury data, the effect of legal costs on insurance costs, current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims, and the impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector to determine how it can be applied in the employer and public liability insurance claims areas. The working group has held extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders, including the Irish Farmers Association, which provided a submission for the working group. There have been two meetings with Meat Industry Ireland, one with officials and one which I held. I have also very recently received a submission from Donegal Marts Association. Consultations have also been held with, for example, IBEC, ISME, Chambers Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation and RGDATA, the Retail Grocery Dairy & Allied Trades Association. A range of issues has been raised by the business and agriculture sectors including lack of competition in the insurance market, frustration with inconsistency of awards, and huge legal and business costs associated with challenging claims through court process, among other things. It is envisaged that the final results of the second phase will take the form of an addendum to the existing report. As with the first phase, the aim is for all relevant bodies and stakeholders to work together in order to deliver fairer premiums for businesses without unnecessary delay. As it is likely that employer and public liability risks are a major factor in the cost of insurance for those involved in agriculture and business, any recommendations emerging from the review should be of relevance to those sectors.

The working group is an important initiative and I compliment him on his involvement and ensuring the working group is up and running. He mentioned that it will produce a report. When does he envisage the report will come before the committee and does he propose to bring a copy of the report to this House at some stage also? The previous report on motor insurance that was carried out by a committee under the chairmanship of the then Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, came to this House for discussion and it would be appropriate when the next report is published that the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, might bring it to the House.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	9	To clarify, the motor insurance report contained 71 recommendations. We are on target to fulfil 45 recommendations before the end of this calendar year. The hope and expectation is that all 71 recommendations will be concluded before the end of 2018. What we learn from the implementation of the report we will use in the area of personal injury in terms of employer liability and public liability so we will not need to do all the same work again. We will be able to transpose as much of that as it practicable into phase 2, namely, employer liability and public liability. We understand this is a significant business cost. If someone's business terms and conditions have not changed and there has not been a claim, there are no grounds for an alarming increase in the premium. I was insistent that each time a premium is renewed it is important to show the amount paid in the previous year. I spoke with one farmer who has 13 insurance policies ranging across machinery, stock, goods, public liability and employer liability. He said he could not remember what each one cost on each occasion. On each occasion that one gets a quote the documentation should show the amount one paid in the previous year. If there is an alarming increase and there has been no change one should contact the company and other companies. In the short term that I have been in this job I was shocked to hear the number of occasions on which people have had a large increase. They challenged that or went to other brokers or companies. On many occasions they came back to me to say that when a different broker went back to the same company there was only a modest increase in the premium. What is happening in those circumstances is that a different underwriter takes a different view and comes up with a different cost for the customer. That indicates to me that there is something very wrong with the insurance sector.

Táim an-sásta go bhfuil sé ar ais sa suíochán sin arís. Tá mé cinnte ón aithne atá agam air go ndéanfaidh sé chuile iarracht ó thaobh forbairt a dhéanamh ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht. Tabharfaidh mé chuile tacaíocht dó sa gcás sin. An dtabharfaidh an tAire Stáit imlíne dúinn ar an straitéis 20 bliain a cuireadh le chéile in 2010 ó thaobh na Gaeilge de? Feictear domsa agus do go leor daoine go bhfuil teipthe ar sin agus nach bhfuil ag éirí leis. Táimid seacht mbliana istigh ann anois. Tá roinnt staitisticí agus figiúirí ón ndaonáireamh agam. Deireann an plean go mbeidh méadú ar an líon daoine a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge ó 83,000 go dtí 250,000. Tharlaigh a mhalairt. Táimid imithe ó 83,000 in 2010 go dtí 73,800 anois. Sin laghdú de 10%. Táimid ag rá go n-ardófar líon na gcainteoirí dúchais 25% ón méid atá ann faoi láthair agus, faraor, is é a mhalairt atá ag tarlú. In 2010, bhí thart ar 20,000 cainteoir dúchais ann. De réir an daonáirimh in 2011, bhí 23,000 ann agus tá an figiúr sin íslithe go dtí 20,000 in 2016. Ní fheictear dom go bhfuil ag éirí leis an straitéis sin. Bhain mé úsáid cúpla úair as rud a dúirt John Wayne uair amháin i seanscannán. Dúirt sé, "When you are on a dead horse, the best thing to do is to get off." Tá fadhb mhór againn ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, ó thaobh labhairt na Gaeilge de agus ó thaobh na straitéise de because, dar liomsa agus dar le go leor daoine, níl ag éirí leis. Bhí comhráite agam leis an Aire Stáit le roinnt seachtainí anuas. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé ag iarraidh bheith dairíre agus é seo a fhorbairt, ach ceaptar nach bhfuil ag éirí leis an straitéis. Caithfimid tosú arís. Níl tada mícheart leis sin. Tarlaíonn sé i gcúrsaí gnó agus cúrsaí saolta an-mhinic. Is maith an rud é agus is rud ciallmhar é le rá go gcaithfimid tosú le plean nua. Bhí mé ag caint leis na comharchumainn inné. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil aithne ag an Aire Stáit orthu. Bhí mé ag caint le Cathy Ní Ghoill ó Inis Mór. Bhí mé ag rá léi go mbeidh mé ag caint leis an Aire Stáit faoi seo agus dúirt sí liom go bhfuil teipthe go glan ar an bplean Gaeilge. Is é an rud atá ag teastáil uainn sa Ghaeltacht agus ó phobal na Gaeilge ná poist agus seans a thabhairt dúinn teach a thógáil inár n-áit féin. Mar atá fhios agam, agus tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit ina cheantar féin, tá fadhbanna móra ó thaobh pleanála de. Tá an talamh againn. Ní talamh maith é ach tá talamh againn. Táimid ag iarraidh tithe a thógáil ann agus táimid ag iarraidh post. Má thugtar deis dúinn, cheapfainn go n-éireódh go geal leis an nGaeilge agus leis an gcultúr agus go mbeidh tobar todhchaí na tíre seo ann ó thaobh na staire agus an chultúir de. Tá lagdhú an-mhór tagtha ar chúrsaí infheistíochta. Tá laghdú de 70% tagtha ar infheistíocht in Údarás na Gaeltachta ó 2007 go 2016. Níl ach 30% den mhéid airgid a bhí ag an údarás sin aige anois. Tá laghdú de thart ar 40% tagtha ar bhuiséad Fhoras na Gaeilge. Tá dhá rud ann. Is rud amháin é an méid airgid a chuirtear ar fáil, ach is dóigh liom go bhfuil an dara rud níos tábhachtaí. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an tAire Stáit liom ar seo. Is í an fhadhb eile ná an chaoi ina gcaitear an t-airgead sin. Sin rud an-tábhachtach. B'fhéidir san am atá caite go bhféadfaí é a chaitheamh i bhfad níos éifeachtaí. Tabharfaidh mise chuile tacaíocht don Aire Stáit cabhrú leis sin más féidir go gcuirfí straitéis nua ar siúl a bheidh bunaithe ar an bpobal áitiúil sa chaoi gur féidir leo bheith ina gcónaí agus a bheith ag obair san áit inar rugadh agus tógadh iad in áit a bheith ag dul go Dorchester, Boston nó áiteanna eile ar fud na cruinne. Bheadh an straitéis sin bunaithe ar fhostaíocht agus comhoibriú idir na Ranna Stáit éagsúla. Dar liomsa go bhfuil na Ranna Stáit i gcineál silos dóibh féin. D'éirigh an Wild Atlantic Way, an Slí Atlantaigh Fhiáin, thar barr. Is sampla amháin é sin de rud a tháinig isteach i rith ré Rialtais an Aire Stáit agus rinne sé an-dul chun cinn. Tá go leor eile gur féidir a dhéanamh ar an gcás sin. Tá ag éirí go maith le coláistí Gaeilge. Tugann siad sin €20 milliún sa mbliain isteach don eacnamaíocht áitiúil. Sin rud an-mhór do phobail Ghaeltachta atá ar imeall na tíre seo. Is rudaí atá fíorthábhachtach freisin iad na comharchumainn. Tá laghdú mór tagtha ar thacaíocht airgid do chomharchumainn. Is bealach an-saor don Stát é sin le go leor obair a fháil déanta i gceantair áitiúla. Tá titim an-mhór ó thaobh tacaíochta do na comharchumainn de. Is coistí deonacha iad na boird comharchumann. Níl fostaithe ach cúpla duine ach tá siad ar chois leis an bpobal áitiúl agus tuigeann siad céard atá ag teastáil ó thaobh cúrsaí forbartha áitiúla de. Ba bhreá liom dá bhféadfaí glór níos láidre a thabhairt do na comharchumainn áitiúla ó thaobh forbairtí agus pleananna áitiúla de. Sin go díreach é ach-----

Chas mé le daoine a n-oibríonn ar sin i nGaillimh coicís ó shin - daoine ó Chorcaigh, ó Chiarraí, ó Phort Láirge, ó Ghaillimh agus ó Thír Chonaill fosta. Tá na daoine sin ag amharc ar an airgead agus ar an chuidiú atá de dhíth chun an phleanáil teanga a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá siadsan ag obair in achan bealach i dtreo an todhchaí. Bhí an Seanadóir ag caint faoi Shlí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin, an cultúr, an oidhreacht, an teanga ach go háirithe, agus na posit atá ag teastáil ón nGaeltacht. Tá cuid mhór obair dhearfach déanta agus tá sárobair déanta maidir leis an teanga a bhogadh chun cinn. Agus é sin ráite, fadúda na bailte seirbhíse taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, mar shampla Leitir Ceanainn agus cathair na Gaillimhe, beidh mé ag amharc chuig na coistí deonacha a luaigh an Seanadóir agus an obair a dhéanann siad ar son na teanga. Ba mhaith liom bheith ag amharc i dtreo na rudaí dearfacha atá ag tarlú amach anseo. Tá an t-údarás freagrach as na bailte taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht, mar shampla an Clochán Liath, Daingean Uí Chúis agus Béal an Mhuirthead. Beidh breis bailte ar an liosta fosta. Tá cuid mhór oibre ag dul ar aghaidh ar na líonraí Gaeilge ar son an teanga fosta, mar shampla, i mBaile Locha Riach agus i gCluain Dolcáin. Beidh sé tábhachtach go mbeidh rudaí fite fuaite idir an Ghaeltacht agus limistéir taobh amuigh di. Tá an fuinneamh sa Tuaisceart, sna Sé Chontae, tábhachtach fosta. Chas mé le suas le 100 duine i mBéal Feirste inné. Bhí siad i rang CLG Uladh. Chas mé le suas le 100 duine, ó Ard Mhacha, Aontroim, Fear Manach agus Tír Eoghain, a bhí ag foghlaim Gaeilge. Tá sé sin thar a bheith suimiúil. Dá mbeadh aon ghá mhór de dhíth fadúda na rudaí sin a bhogadh chun cinn, tá mé sásta leanúint ar aghaidh leis an díospóireacht fadúda sin.Tá an Seanadóir ceart fá dtaobh de na coláistí samhraidh. Tá sárobair déanta agus tá siad ag bogadh ar aghaidh. Mar shampla, tá Coláiste Lurgan i gcontae an tSeanadóra, agus beidh suas le 600 duine ag dul go dtí Árann Mór i mbliana. Bhí laghdú mór san airgead a bhí ar fáil do na comharchumainn thar na blianta a chuaigh thart. Tá siadsan ag obair go deonach fosta. Bíonn siad ag obair ar achan rud maidir leis an teanga chomh maith le cúrsaí forbartha agus fostaíochta. Tá mé ag amharc ar an chuidiú dóibh freisin. Tá obair bhreá ag dul ar aghaidh sna bunscoileanna sna Gaeltachtaí. Tá an clár cúntóirí teanga ann. Tá eolas maith ag an Seanadóir ar obair Muintearas. Tá an eagraíocht sin ag obair go dian dícheallach ar son na teanga sna scoileanna. Tá sé sin thar a bheith tábhachtach. Maidir le Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú), bhí cruinniú agam leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga cúpla seachtain ó shin. Bhí mé ag obair leis an gCoiste Gaeilge, Gaeltachta agus na nOileán. Tá an Seanadóir ar an gcoiste. Dá mbeadh aon chuidiú de dhíth maidir leis an mBille seo, tá mé ar thaobh an choiste. Chomh maith leis sin, tá na dréachtóirí ag obair ar an leasú faoi láthair. Thug an Rialtas tiomantas agus gealltanas mór chuig an Bhille cúpla mí ó shin. Ba mhaith liom mo aitheantas foirmiúil a ghabháil chuig an iarAire Stáit le freagracht as cúrsaí Gaeltachta, an Teachta Seán Kyne, a chur fíor-iarracht isteach sna rudaí sin. Is é mo thuairim pearsanta ná go mb'fhéidir go mbeadh deiseanna leis An Clár Éire Ildánach amach anseo. Bhí comhrá ollmhór agam leis an Taoiseach an tseachtain a chuaigh thart maidir leis seo. B'fhéidir go mbeadh bealach ann an bhliain seo chugainn fá dtaobh den teanga a chur chun cinn nó a bhogadh chun tosaigh. Tá mé ag amharc ar phlean ollmhór sa tír. B'fhéidir go mbeidh ról ann ó thaobh Bliain na Gaeilge 2018. Tá suim mhór ann. Beidh mé ag fáil tuairimí agus smaointe fá dtaobh den phlean sin amach anseo fosta. Maidir le h-iarratas an tSeanadóra fá dtaobh de a bheith ag obair le chéile, tá mé thar a bheith sásta é sin a dhéanamh. Tá sé sin de dhíth. San am a chuaigh thart, bhí an Ghaeilge mar pháirt den díospóireacht polaitíochta. Níl anois ach tá freagrachtaí agus dualgais orainn uilig fá dtaobh den teanga. Tá freagrachtaí agus dualgais ar dhaoine ón tuaisceart agus ó Chorcaigh agus ar dhaoine atá taobh amuigh den Rialtas, den chóras agus de na rannóga éagsúla. Ba mhaith liomsa obair taobh amuigh den pholaitíocht ar son na teanga. Tá sé sin de dhíth. Tá gá mór ann dó agus tá suim mhór ag daoine ar an teanga taobh amuigh de na cúrsaí sin.

Tá mé an-bhuíoch den Aire Stáit as ucht teacht isteach anseo agus an cheist a fhreagairt. Mar a thuigeann sé, is ceist an-tábhachtach í seo ó thaobh na tíre de agus ní hamháin ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de. Dúirt sé cúpla rud ar a rinne mé roinnt rudaí. Tá obair an-mhaith á dhéanamh ar fud na tíre ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit, agus tá mé breá sásta agus buíoch den Aire Stáit as ucht a léirigh sé é, tá obair an-mhaith ar siúl i dTuaisceart Éireann. Bheadh sé an-tábhachtach, dar liom, go dtabharfadh an Rialtas tacaíocht ó thaobh aitheantas na Gaeilge de sa Tuaisceart. Níl fáth ar bith nach mbeadh sé sin ann. Is cearta daonna é sin. De réir mar a thuigim, aontaíodh é sin cúpla bliain ó shin ó thaobh na páirtithe polaitiúla ar fad ansin. Tá mé breá sásta gur luaigh an tAire Stait an tAire Stáit a bhí roimhe, an Teachta Seán Kyne, mar rinne seisean go leor oibre. Ceann de na rudaí is tábhachtaí a tharla sé nó seacht mbliana ó shin ná go raibh an tAire Stáit, nuair a thosaigh sé ina Aireacht anseo an uair dheireadh, ar bheagán Gaeilge ach anois tá Gaeilge an-mhaith aige. Bhí sé in ann labhairt ansin óna intinn agus óna chroí agus ní ó nótaí. Tugann sé sin ardú croí agus inspioráid do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir na Gaeilge mar feictear dúinn go bhfuil sé lándáiríre faoi sin. Tá naíscoileanna fíorthábhactach. Tá an Roinn agus an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna ag tabhairt tacaíochta do naíscoileanna agus go fad buan é sin go mbreathnaítear ní hamháin ar bhunscoileanna agus meánscoileanna ach ar naíscoileanna freisin. Seo na gasúir bheaga idir b'fhéidir dhá bhliain agus cúig bliana sula dtéann siad ar an scoil. B'fhéidir an rud is tábhachtaí a dúirt an tAire Stáit ná go mbeidh blank page ann ó thaobh plean iomlán don tír in 2018. Dúirt sé go mbeidh sé ag lorg inputs agus tuairimí ó dhaoine éagsúla agus ní hamháin ó státseirbhísigh nó na gnáthdhaoine a thugann é ach ón phobal ina iomláine. Tá an-suim agam a bheith páirteach ansin, más féidir, agus tacú, mar an tAire Stáit, mar cheannaire, leis seo a thabhairt tríd. Gabhaim mo mhíle buíochas leis an Aire Stáit as ucht teacht isteach. Tá mé ag tnúth go mór leis an bplean iomlán don tír in 2018.

Rinne mé dearmad tagairt don Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna atá ag bogadh ar aghaidh leis an tumoideachas. Ba mhaith liom m'aitheantas a thabhairt do na hoifigigh san Roinn sin. Chonaic mé an fiúntas atá ag an Ghaeilge tríd an tír agus tríd an domhan. Labhair an Seanadóir fá dtaobh den cheangal le Bostún agus Ceanada. Faoi láthair tá daoine ag foghlaim Gaeilge i Londain agus i Sydney san Astráil. Chuir an Roinn airgead ar fáil do na tograí sin. B'fhéidir go mbeidh deiseanna móra amach anseo. Dá mbeadh aon bhealach ann a bheadh mise ábalta cuidiú leis an Seanadóir nó leis an teanga, tá mé oscailte dó sin. Fá choinne na figiúirí maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, bhí €2.4 milliún breise sa Roinn don Údarás in 2016. Tá mé ag amharc go mbeidh breis airgid ann. Rachaidh airgead díreach go dtí na comharchumainn trí Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá an t-airgead thar a bheith tábhachtach. An chéad fhocal a d'fhoghlaim mé in 2014 ná "deontas". Tá sé sin tábhachtach fosta. Feicim na buntáistí ansin.

The time allocated is only four minutes apiece although I allowed the Senator and the Minister of State to speak for nearly 18 minutes between them. It is important, however, and other Members of the Seanad might like to get involved in the debate on the future of the Irish language. The Senator might consider asking the Leader, when we come back in late September, if at some time there will be a full debate. The Minister of State could come in and other Members from various sides could have a two-hour debate, perhaps, on the issue, of which it might be more worthy.

The most obvious gap in the strategy is that many of the initiatives are aspirational, with a lack of tangible deadlines and commitments. The report is not costed and will require significant investment. Many charities, such as the Simon Community, which Senator Devine and I visited recently, are stepping into the gap. We visited a Simon Community site in Dublin 8 that specialises in detox beds for drug rehabilitation and it has plans for more beds. I hope the Government can look at supporting projects such as these, which stand into the breach when the Government has failed. Ultimately the strategy is vague on timeframes and resources. I very much welcome the aspects of the report which deal with services for pregnant women suffering from drug and alcohol addiction and the various provisions on mental health actions in the report. The report is crucial in terms of trying to deal with how addiction affects families, children and our communities. I welcome the fact we are following a public health led attack on addiction rather than a criminal justice focused approach. I also wish to raise the issue of public service recruitment and retention. I raised this issue last week and I spoke about recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces. Today I wish to raise the issue of recruitment and retention of nurses. According to the INMO, patient care in St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork is significantly compromised due to shortages of nurses, and patients are in jeopardy. This is an issue throughout the health services. Recently we saw in Cherry Orchard the closure of the Linn Dara adolescent mental health ward due to staff shortages. This is an urgent matter not only in the health service and Defence Forces but throughout the public sector. I call on the Minister to come to the House and outline his strategy on staff recruitment and, ultimately, retention.

I am aware of the fact the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, met the Minister recently and a review is in place. This morning, I received an email I want to share with the House. I will not share the name of the author or the council involved. The man explained his workload has become overwhelming. There are increased meetings, contacts by phone, emails, text messages, Facebook, letters, face to face meetings, house calls and clinic days.He talked about the particular area in which he was living and said it had lost five town councils and its county council had been revised. A total of 65 seats have been reduced to 18 seats to cover the entire county. He also talked about the number of young county councillors who have resigned. He said that their resignation letters stated that their workload on the council while trying to hold down a job had become impossible.  My brief is no more than that of any other Member of this House. We are all subject to the consideration of the city and county councillors. We are the representatives in the Oireachtas and we have to do something for them. Their travel rates have been reduced for the first 1,500 miles. Deputies and Senators do not pay rates on their offices, yet county councillors who open offices have to pay rates. Councillors cannot claim back the rental on their offices. There are no support services available to them in terms of the cost of envelopes and of mailing letters to the people they represent. The majority of the Members of this House will be calling to county councillors at the time of the next election. We have to show that we have done something to alleviate their problems. We cannot allow young people who represent the future of this country who get involved in politics to become disillusioned by virtue of the fact that they cannot afford to carry out their jobs. I have received countless emails from female councillors with children who simply cannot afford to stay on in their roles. There is no childminding facility available to them or payment for them when they attend council meetings. This is grossly unfair. Democracy works from the ground up. I know every Member of this House and I am not taking any particular stand that any other Member would not take. All Members view this issue in the way that I do and they would want to see this resolved. Surely to God, we can do a better job for those who are in the front line all day, every day. As one councillor said to me recently: "I cannot go to the toilet but somebody will stop me on the way in or the way out to tell me about a local problem." We cannot stand over this. I ask the Leader to ensure we start to address this issue as early as we can in September.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	27	I repeat my request for the Taoiseach to come into the House to outline his commitment to Seanad reform. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to provide that this item be taken immediately after the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2017. The other item I want to raise is the impact on Swinford and the surrounding area of the closure in 2013 of the Swinford district headquarters of An Garda Síochána. Prior to its closure, a superintendent and ancillary staff covered a large area in east Mayo, including Charlestown, Foxford, Kiltimagh, Kilkelly, Kilmovee right down to the Mount Falcon in Ballina. It was then amalgamated into one Garda division and the headquarters was moved to Claremorris. That happened despite my Sinn Féin colleague, Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, when he was a Deputy, asking a parliamentary question on the floor of the Dáil in January 2014 when the Government of the day denied that the plan was to reduce Swinford Garda station to part-time opening hours. The Garda management called a public meeting in Swinford in summer 2014 to inform the public that Swinford Garda station would be reduced to part-time opening hours and the hours were to be between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. and from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., Monday to Friday. On Saturday, it opens for one hour, from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. and on Sunday it opens for another hour, from 12 noon to 1 p.m. With those opening hours, it is impossible to provide a proper policing service for the area. Even those limited hours have often been denied due to lack of personnel. It should be noted that Swinford Garda station is in close proximity to two main national routes, the N17 and N5. It is also close to Ireland West Airport Knock which caters for more than 700,000 passengers per annum. From a safety strategic viewpoint, this Garda station needs to be fully operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The bottom line is that Swinford Garda station needs to be re-established as a district headquarters. I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality be invited to come into this House to discuss the strategic review on the reopening of Garda stations and for him to realise that it is not only Stepaside but areas such as Swinford that need a Garda station. Given its strategic location and the large area between Ballina and Claremorris that does not have a full-time Garda station, I ask that Swinford Garda station be reinstated and that the resources, both financial and personnel, which forced Garda management to make this decision now be made available.  In order for the force to be fit for purpose and meet the demands of community policing, the Government must increase investment in Garda personnel to bring the numbers back to pre-recession levels. In our pre-budget submission for last year we allocated €17.558 million towards the recruitment of new gardaí in addition to the €1.875 million for resources to tackle youth crime. It is very difficult for people in Swinford and the surrounding areas, and other areas that are affected, to stand back and see what has happened with respect to the way resources were used in Templemore and yet their area has been deprived of a Garda station with full-time opening hours. I ask that the Minister would come into the House to discuss this matter.

I acknowledge that a range of measures have come into place in the past year, namely, the extra funding for disability services, the approximately 10,000 children who are now getting medical cards, the launch of the Make Work Pay report earlier this year and the personalised budgets work which is to come to fruition by the end of this year. There is a range of practical commitments in that strategy. However, despite all that progressive news, I felt that I had to write to the Taoiseach yesterday. In that letter I recalled his commitment of 14 June last, on his appointment, to the ratification of the UN convention by the end of this year. I then stated that on reading the whole-of-government implementation plan for the national disability inclusion strategy 2017 to 2021, I could not find in it that timeline for ratification that he gave in the Dáil. I requested that he would confirm his commitment, as given to the Dail, regarding the ratification by the end of this year. I do not particularly want to rehash the sorry saga of commitments and recommitments made in and since the programme for Government of early last year. If that omission was in error, that is forgivable, but if it was deliberate, it is not forgivable while there are more than 600,000 people with disabilities and their families. Otherwise, it is a serious issue to make one statement in the Dáil and literally 30 days later to find that it does not appear in the Government's implementation strategy for people with disabilities. What is most notable are comments on post-ratification timelines for two actions in particular on page 11 of the strategy, related, first, to ratification of the optional protocol and, second, the work to review and advise on implementation. However, under the timeframe heading for those actions, and elsewhere in the strategy, it does not state that it will be done by the end of 2017. The Dáil is in recess from late July until late September. It went into recess last Friday and this House will rise in two days time. I call for the Taoiseach to come into this House before we rise for the summer recess to confirm the end of 2017 deadline for the ratification of the UN convention. I respectfully ask the Leader and the Members of this House to facilitate the Taoiseach in that regard.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	31	O n 30 November 2016 the European Union called for a review of the renewable energy directive of 2009. The Commission has proposed to review these targets. They range from 10% for Malta to 49% for Sweden, while our target is 16% for 2020.These are renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind. A consultation process in respect of this matter was to take place with the Minister. I have a number of concerns about such processes. We have to learn lessons from the past regarding wind energy and poor consultation with local communities. If the consultation takes place in the months of July and August, that is a time when people's minds are focused elsewhere. In rural Ireland, it may be a busy period in farming, with the harvesting of crops and other work to be done. There is a clear need for the Minister to announce when this review and the public consultation will take place. He must also ensure that communities are very much involved in the process. It is a beautiful sunny day today and many people are talking about the possibility of solar energy adding to renewable energy projects in the future. Will the Leader ensure that the consultation process takes place as soon as possible in order to ensure that people are informed and can contribute? Will he ensure that the leaders in those specific areas are consulted also, especially regarding solar energy. If he could do that as soon as possible, it would be helpful in terms of ensuring that the public can engage in a proper manner.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	32	I raise the issue of the working hours of employees in the horse racing and horse-breeding industries. There was a time when the horse racing and horse-breeding industries were linked to agriculture under 1990s legislation that dealt with employees' working hours. That legislation was amended by the 2015 Act, but for some unknown reason the horse racing and horse-breeding industries were excluded from it. As a result, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is taking action against the horse-breeding and horse racing industries for the hours worked by their employees. It is only proper that the workers' pay and conditions are regulated, but we need a debate on the industry also. This is an industry that relies on flexibility. Horses have to be fed and watered seven days a week. They have to travel distances to get to race meetings across the Irish Sea, in France and elsewhere. It is an industry that requires a large degree of flexibility on the part of its workers. All the people working in the industry realise that the pay and conditions should be regulated. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, or the relevant Minister in terms of the Workplace Relations Commission to the House for a debate on this issue. If it is necessary to do so, I ask that the existing legislation be amended. I urge the Leader to ask the relevant Minister to ensure that nothing be done in the context of actions that may be taken by the WRC until amended legislation is put in place or until the Minister comes into the House for a proper debate on this industry, which is worth millions of euro to the economy and is a major employer. As I said, flexibility is needed. Every situation is different. There are large and small trainers and breeders. Every operation is different and every situation is different. A debate is urgently needed, but no action is required until we have that debate and until amended legislation is put in place.

The Department of Education and Skills recently launched a report which gives a school by school breakdown of class sizes for the 2016-17 academic year and it makes for grim reading. A total of 120,000 primary school children are in classes of more than 30. On average, almost one in four primary pupils is in a class of more than 30. Among the worst areas in the country are Monaghan, Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Meath, to name but a few. The Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, recently accused the Government of failing in its commitments regarding this issue. It should be noted also that Ireland has the second largest class sizes in Europe. That makes modern-day teaching practices in schools almost impossible. It is not fair on the students and it is certainly not fair on the teachers. This issue needs attention. I ask that the Leader bring it to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills in order that adequate funding can be allocated to ensure this very important issue would be addressed for the benefit of our schoolchildren who will be the adults of tomorrow.

Shortages of nursing staff are, according to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation today, compromising services. We have been highlighting that for a long time. Safe care and dignity of patients is at risk. The HSE has removed provisions for agency staff in many services and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has repeatedly pointed to hospitals being decimated, patients receiving minimum care, poor hygiene standards and the administration of medicines being delayed. There are more than 3,000 vacancies to be filled and that is just to keep services ticking over. There is no room for expansion in the context of our growing population. We are in the bizarre position where nurses with years of professional experience are being denied access to work here, even as the HSE is making a worldwide appeal for nursing staff. I have talked to several nurses who are back here having left in 2004 in order to work in America and whose applications to be put on the register have been denied. Over 100 have made such applications and only nine have been placed on the register. I ask that the Minister would instruct An Bord Altranais to review the criteria, to act with urgency on the obligatory theory hours and to gain an understanding of the American education system. More than 100 additional nursing posts would provide a great boost, particularly in terms of patient care.
#MariaByrne	unknown-#MariaByrne-party	unknown-#MariaByrne-dob	unknown-#MariaByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	35	I refer to an incident that took place at Bengal Terrace, Old Cork Road, Limerick. The mains pipe burst and ten houses had to be evacuated as a result. As Irish Water does not have senior personnel on call at weekends, there was nobody available to deal with the incident. I compliment the social worker from Limerick City and County Council who turned up very early that morning and spent the day at the location to ensure that people were transferred to appropriate accommodation. They were put up in hotels over the weekend. One elderly lady had to be taken to hospital by ambulance as a result of the incident. There was up to 2 ft. of water in some of the houses, yet nobody from Irish Water was available to come to the location. The council staff turned up on behalf of Irish Water to fix the mains pipe that had burst. Early yesterday morning, a senior person came from Irish Water and the first comment made to the residents was that they should inform their house insurers. That is not acceptable. As the day went on, they changed their approach and offered to put people up, especially people with young children and those who wanted to move out of their houses, in a house for a month. Three families are moving into one house and a few more are moving into other houses. I would like the Minister to intervene and confirm to Irish Water that when an emergency happens, somebody has to be available to deal with the issue. I was in a number of the houses and while they were provided with dehumidifiers, they are not the answer to the problem. Floors, furniture and everything else has been destroyed. A complete compensation package will have to be put in place by Irish Water to compensate the residents. I ask the Leader to bring this issue to the notice of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten.

The strategy is really good and I welcome many parts and actions contained in it. I look forward to seeing some of those actions brought to life, which is the hardest part of any strategy. I acknowledge the fact that Senator Higgins and I witnessed the drowning of a young man at Portobello Bridge last Friday night. He entered the canal and two young men jumped in after him to save him. Drownings often happen in the Royal Canal. I am not sure what has been done to educate and inform people about the dangers posed by swimming in canals, especially at night. The drowning I witnessed took place around 10 p.m. I send my condolences to his family. My thoughts are with the young men who spent over ten minutes trying to resuscitate him before the ambulance arrived. They are probably at home and have not received support to assist them to cope with this tragic experience.

We debated the Bill for numerous months in the House and it has reached Committee Stage in the Dáil. The legislation has flaws and issues. I am sure the people who promoted the Bill, of which I am one, are annoyed that we have reached the end of this term. One of the key principles behind this legislation was an ability for certain landowners to cut their hedges that are located at dangerous roads and junctions. It is almost August and it will take at least another 12 months before the Bill is enacted or its practicalities are enacted. The debate in the Dáil last week was disappointing because Fianna Fáil did its best to slow the progress of the Bill in order that it would not go further or be sent to this House today for debate. We need action on this Bill and it is badly needed. We have debated it at length and ad nauseam. We need to have this debate, we need to have it sorted and we need the legislation put in place. I was heckled in this Chamber when I raised the issue of hedge cutting and I was told that it was not an issue. I have received a large amount of representations from people complaining that they cannot walk on the roads because of overgrown hedges and grass verges. Inaction shows how out of touch other people are. We need movement on this Bill. We need to ensure people can cut hedges in the month of August. If not, people will be killed, which will be a disgrace.

I join the party's representatives to raise the issue, as well as to propose an amendment to the Order of Business. I remind the Fianna Fáil representatives in this House that the previous Government managed to protect class sizes in their entirety and bring them down in the last budget over which we had influence. There is a line in the confidence and supply agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that says they would reduce class sizes. It was not acted upon in the previous budget and there was no reduction in class sizes at primary level. Rather than make speeches in this House, I suggest the leadership of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael implement the agreement they signed together. The initiative would cost around €6 million but it was not acted upon in the previous budget and they have no one to blame except themselves. With the Cathaoirleach and the Leader's permission, I request a change be made to the Order of Business. I formally request that No. 24, Education (Welfare) (Amendment) Bill - First Stage, which the Labour Party launched today, be taken before No. 1.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	40	I welcome the HSE's report on type 2 diabetes in Ireland that was released last week. The report claims there are 200,000 people in Ireland who have type 2 diabetes. I would say there are another 200,000 to 300,000, which is a conservative estimate, who do not know that they have type 2 diabetes. The report called on GPs to do more about the issue and wants GPs to advertise the seriousness of type 2 diabetes. People can be given a chance to improve their health, and I am the living proof, if we implement giving a free blood test for type 2 diabetes to people once they have reached a certain age. I make the suggestion because it costs €60 for the first appointment with a GP, €25 for a blood test and finally €45 to see the GP a second time to get the results. Many people do not have €130 to spend in this way. Last August, I was 50 years of age and weighed 17 stone and 11 pounds when I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and today I weigh just 11 stone and 8 pounds. The diagnosis acted as a wake-up call, particularly when I was told I had to take nine tablets a day for the rest of my life. When one is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, one becomes part of the long-term illness list scheme, which costs the taxpayer a lot of money. A free blood test and awareness campaign will save money in the long term because type 2 diabetes can eventually worsen and become type 1 diabetes. I ask for the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House to debate the report. I want us to ask him to roll out a free blood test, which would give people a chance in life.
#PaulGavan	unknown-#PaulGavan-party	unknown-#PaulGavan-dob	unknown-#PaulGavan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	41	I want to reply briefly to Senator Paddy Burke who asked for flexibility to be shown to the horse racing industry. At one point he requested that no action be taken by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which is frankly quite shocking. I know first-hand from my time as a trade unionist the level of exploitation in the horse racing industry. For him to request that no action be taken is disgraceful. It is about time the Fine Gael Party stood up for workers' rights for once as opposed to employers' rights. I know the Irish Sign Language Bill will not go through this week, but it is to be hoped we will have it in September. Last night we had a very good meeting in Limerick, and some of my colleagues in Fine Gael attended, where the deaf community expressed particular concern about the potential watering down of the Bill. First, I acknowledge the very good work done by Senator Mark Daly and acknowledge my colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, for supporting the Bill. I understand progress is being made. Last night we heard very heartfelt pleas by members of the deaf community. In particular, one lady explained that if she had to go, God forbid, to the Rape Crisis Centre, she would be supplied an interpreter in Dublin but not anywhere else. There is real concern that unless there is a legal underpinning for the deaf community, especially for the voucher system, we will end up with well intentioned legislation that does not enable rights. I was intrigued by one comment posted to the Facebook page for the campaign. It was alleged that a civil servant said, "If we do this for you then other people will want equality." Is that not good? We should all be in favour of equal rights. Will the Leader invite the Minister to come to the House as soon as possible in order that he can reassure us? I expect that everyone in this Chamber is willing to support the Bill as drafted by Senator Daly. We should not short-change the people in the deaf community. If we can afford tax cuts for the wealthy and reductions in capital acquisitions tax and inheritance tax, surely we can afford some decency and equality for the deaf community in Ireland.

He set out his case very well and I will not repeat his arguments. He set out a number of merits. In addition, a free blood test could diagnose other conditions that might be dealt with quickly and thus reduce the health bill. The Senator's proposition is radical and valuable. It could save an enormous amount of money for the health services and achieve a lot of good and improve the quality of life for people. I urge the Leader to take this on as a serious proposition. I raise a crucially important issue for the entire country but very specifically for my area of Cavan-Monaghan. A debate has developed in the media and in certain quarters among commentators to reverse the reduced rate of VAT in the hospitality or tourism sector.The reduction of the VAT rate from 13% to 9% was one of the most radical and successful initiatives of the previous Government. It had huge implications for job creation and job maintenance. With the fall in sterling following Brexit, the number of UK visitors to my area of Cavan-Monaghan will radically reduce. There is empirical evidence to support the argument that the numbers are reducing. This is why the cushion of the lower VAT rate is very important and why I want to maintain it. Tourism jobs are vital in my area. The agriculture sector in my area could face huge threats following Brexit. It is for that reason that maintaining tourism jobs is crucial. I appeal to the Leader for a pre-budget debate on the hospitality sector and the need for this VAT rate. I agree with those who are annoyed by the exorbitant hotel rates in Dublin. They are correct. It is an abuse that we must find another way of dealing with but it is not a reason to dislocate jobs in my community.

Following this pre-legislative scrutiny, the committee's report highlighted the fact that the members of the deaf community suffer from extreme marginalisation because of their inability to interact with State agencies for the most basic of issues regarding social welfare, housing and health. While the Bill is not perfect and does not address all the issues that confront the members of the deaf community, it will address the issue of access to the Rape Crisis Centre and other organisations. Members of the deaf community should not have to travel from Limerick, Kerry, Cork or anywhere else to Dublin to access the interpreting services. In a country that seeks equality we should, with the agreement of this House, be able to pass that legislation. The Minister has agreed to look at the amendments and together we will, I hope, get a Bill that is as near as possible to being perfect passed by the Dáil before the end of the year. I thank all colleagues for their support. I know Members have met people from the deaf community who have talked about the difficulty involved in accessing ordinary services that we take for granted. We all know that even accessing Members of the Oireachtas proves to be a challenge in terms of setting up meetings and having an interpreter. Who would pay for this interpreter? That is why the issue of the voucher scheme is so important to members of the deaf community. I hope we will be able to get the Bill passed in September and sent to the Dáil.

Last week, the Committee of Public Accounts issued a very important report on the funding of third level institutions, an issue I have been raising in this House for a number of years. The issue and the report deserve further scrutiny, particularly the issue of some of the subsidiaries operated by some third level institutions. It has come to my attention that Trinity College Dublin has a subsidiary called Trinity Online Services. A number of serious issues have been raised with me regarding the operation of that company. When one checks it on Google, one finds that it comes up as a Trinity College Dublin entity but whenever there are issues with the company, Trinity College Dublin washes its hands of it, even though the board of directors is fully owned and the directors of the company are senior Trinity College Dublin staff. The allegations relate to some very serious issues. There are questions of staff being poached from educational rivals and material appearing on the website that is similar to material on other educational websites. Serious HR issues have been raised about the company. From the material I have seen, the person who raised those issues has been practically ostracised by that company while Trinity College Dublin seems to be taking a very hands-off approach to any of these HR issues and does not seem to want to engage whatsoever. In many cases, particularly this one, these companies operate under charitable status; therefore, there are serious questions about governance, oversight and responsibility in companies like this and others operating under third level institutions. When we come back in September we should, in the context of a debate on the report by the Committee of Public Accounts, look at the operation of subsidiary companies under third level institutions in this country because it is not good enough that they can cherry pick all the good parts and benefits of having such a company but not take on responsibilities relating to workers and other issues that have been raised with us. I ask the Leader to raise it with the Minister for Education and Skills and arrange for a debate on it when we return in the autumn.

I also commend Dr. Velma Harkins who conducted a study that shows comprehensively that 80% of complications from diabetes can be prevented if it is managed on a regular basis in general practice. This will require funding. It is a great testament to a long piece of research that shows that we do not need expensive in-hospital or outpatient care in hospitals to achieve great outcomes for a huge number of people in the population. I commend Senator Mark Daly for the Irish Sign Language Bill. I am delighted that we are supporting it. We met a group and I have had emails from some members of the deaf community. I want to make it clear that Fine Gael and I support their cause. In respect of general practice, it is shocking to see an adult's privacy compromised by the fact that many GPs do not have Irish Sign Language and sometimes must discuss very intimate medical details through a child. That is not proper or right. I, therefore, fully subscribe to addressing this issue.  I wish to mention a terrible event that happened in Swords at the weekend. A man lost his life following an assault. This was a local man - a businessman and a man who had contributed to his community and went about his business in an orderly and quiet fashion. That a person cannot go out on a weekend night without being assaulted and losing his or her life is deeply disturbing. I know the gardaí are doing their best but Fingal is a growing area with a very young population. Skerries and Lusk have only part-time Garda stations while the station in Rush has closed and there is no station in Donabate. I have raised this issue with previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, as well as with the current Minister. It concerns bringing back gardaí on bicycles. Their presence around a town has a huge impact. We had them in Skerries a few years ago and they were very effective and popular. They broke down barriers with many young people in terms of getting to know gardaí and realising that they are there to offer help and support and were not, by any means, an authoritarian force. I ask that we get the funding to put extra gardaí in place on bicycles, particularly in towns like Rush that do not have a Garda station until such time as the Garda station is reopened. The Cabinet received a very positive report on this issue and a decision will be made later in the year. I hope the decision will be made to reopen Rush Garda station. I thank An Garda Síochána for all the hard work it does. Although we thank the Minister for an additional five gardaí for that area, this is a growing area in which we need more gardaí.

I have in mind locations such as Burma, China, Egypt and so on. On 9 November 2013 Fintan O'Toole wrote about this topic. I encourage all Senators to reflect on what he wrote. The arts, culture and heritage have great power when shared internationally, but we should not forget that these treasures will always be part of the heritage of indigenous peoples throughout the world. Billy Fitzpatrick, a citizen who wrote to the press calling on the Government to direct the national cultural institutions to begin the process of repatriation of all identifiably stolen objects, said "such a gesture would put pressure on London, Paris, Berlin and other former imperial capitals and help bring to a close one of the more visible and shameful reminders of Europe's colonial past." This is a conversation society needs to have. It is a conversation that the Seanad can lead on, especially in the light of the move to the National Museum of Ireland.
#AidanDavitt	unknown-#AidanDavitt-party	unknown-#AidanDavitt-dob	unknown-#AidanDavitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	49	I heard my fellow Senators raise two issues. Senators Conway-Walsh and Dolan sought to call the Taoiseach in today to discuss two noble causes. I passed a novelty sock shop around the corner. I imagine the Senators would have a better chance of getting him there today than they would of seeing him in the Seanad. I will move on to more serious matters. That was merely a light-hearted suggestion for the Leader. The housing crisis is one of the largest crises facing the country. There are up to 500 registered housing associations, but many more are operating in Ireland. Many of them are sitting on large bank balances. I am aware of one that is sitting on one of over €2 million. That is only one of which I am aware and with which I had some interaction. Some of them are working hard, but many are unproductive and sitting on a lot of money belonging to the State. I will move on to the second aspect of this matter. Councils should be rewarded in the context of the block grants they get to run their services and everything else. They include the block grants for roads that come from the Government and the Department. One of the criteria should be connected to the housing they are providing. The grants should definitely be paid on that basis. There are two areas that we could squeeze and where we have to get more productivity if we are to address the housing crisis. The former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, had a very long-term plan, into which he put considerable work. We are where we are in the context of housing. We cannot say the previous Minister did not try, but it is simply not working. We have to start at the base. The councils have the land. If they say they do not have the resources, then these can be provided through the block grant from the Government. That would be one of the quickest ways to address this problem. It is a matter of starting from the ground up and dealing with issues that are feeding into the housing problem. Moreover, we have to make the housing organisations more accountable. We have to discover what assets they possess. We have to make the people who are not working their assets sweat them a little harder.

Senators Ardagh, Ruane and Ó Ríordáin referred to the launch yesterday of the national strategy on drug and alcohol use in Ireland. It is welcome that it is a health-led response. I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, on her role and compliment the former Minister of State, Senator Ó Ríordáin, on the strong leadership he displayed in the Department. I commend Mr. John Carr for his work on the strategy and echo the Taoiseach's remarks. We adopted a national road safety strategy. An integrated strategy is required to deal with the issue of drug and alcohol use. That is why we have adopted an approach that will take us from 2017 to 2025. The way forward must be having an integrated public health strategy which must address the reasons people misuse drugs and alcohol. Obviously, it must address the reasons there has been a development of problems, not just in certain areas but across society. Last night I watched "Tonight with Vincent Browne", on which Senators Ó Ríordáin and Ruane appeared with the Minister of State. It is not about marginalised communities per se but the value we put on the 50 key actions outlined in the strategy launched yesterday. It is about reducing harm and supporting people in their recovery. It is a people-centred approach. I commend the Minister of State for the work she has done. I also commend the strategy, in particular, because it is about ensuring we will have a public health response led by a cross-section of Departments, especially the Department of Health. It is positive and the way forward. I will be happy to have the Minister of State come to the House to discuss the matter. Senator Ardagh stated there were no timelines. The strategy and the 50 key actions outlined in it represent a new departure in drug policy in Ireland. I have to give Senator Ó Ríordáin credit for the work he did and the courage he showed in challenging the system. To be fair to him and the Minister of State, they stood firm in the face of opposition. I know that the Senator might think we are having a love fest this morning.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	51	In fairness, we must give credit where it is due. It is imperative that we work on the strategy. A working group has been established. It will examine alternative approaches to possession for personal use, as well as considering how the programme might be rolled out across communities. The idea is to encapsulate what Senator Ardagh rightly said about the approach taken by some community groups. There is a real need to incorporate community awareness of drugs and drug misuse. This is an issue on which we need to adopt a collaborative approach. Senators Ardagh and Devine raised the issue of nurse recruitment. The HSE and the Government are committed to public sector reform and have opened up a recruitment campaign. There are now more people working in the public service than in 2014. There have been a number of career open days throughout the country. I recognise the importance of the nurses in the health system and pay tribute to them for the work they undertake on our behalf. They operate at the coalface within the health system, for which they are fine ambassadors, as well as for the HSE. A recruitment campaign is under way and an attractive package has been put together by the HSE. We must look at ways by which we can continue to attract and incentivise and nurses not only to stay in Ireland but also to come back and work here, whether in nursing homes or the public health system. Senator Ardagh referred to St. Finbarr's Hospital in the city of Cork. It provides a range of services for elderly persons and the local population in general. The issues highlighted this morning in the Irish Examiner need to be addressed. We are competing in a global market for nurses. In general, we need to see greater activity and incentivisation. A range of measures have been taken by the Government. Agreement was reached at the WRC between the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the various Departments involved on how 1,280 nurses could be recruited in this calendar year. While a programme is under way, I accept that we need to do more. However, the programme to which I refer is in place and I would hate people to think nothing was being done. This is happening and more nurses are being recruited. It is imperative that we continue to do so. Senator Craughwell, not because councillors are constituents of ours, raised the important issue of local government and the pay and conditions of all public representatives involved in it. The former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, undertook a campaign, which is being continued by the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Phelan, and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in tandem with the Minister of State, Deputy English. They have met representatives of the various groups that represent councillors. Like all other Senators, I share the view that this work needs to be actively continued, particularly to arrive at an outcome that will be positive.We need a system of local government that will work for the people and also ensure we will have quality members elected to serve at local authority level. That is something we have, but we need it to be incentivised. As part of our work in the autumn, we can reconvene, under the chairmanship of Senator McFadden who has been very active, as has Senator Craughwell, the all-party committee of this House on councillors' pay and conditions. Senator Conway-Walsh made reference to the Taoiseach in the context of Seanad reform. I have requested that he come to the House in the autumn to speak to us on a variety of matters, one of which I am sure will be Seanad reform. I will not be accepting the Senator's proposed amendment to the Order of Business because, as I said last week in the House and at a group leaders meeting on Wednesday, it is important this week to ensure we will have legislation passed. I have accepted, however, the Senator's suggestion that we have statements on the summer economic statement. That is the only item of Private Members' business, other than Private Members' legislation, that we will take this week. As I said, I have requested the Taoiseach to come to the House and look forward to a positive result in the autumn. With reference to the Swinford Garda district, it is an operational matter for the Garda, but I will be happy to take it back to the Minister for Justice and Equality. Senator Dolan referred to the national disability strategy and the UN convention. To be fair, it is a good news story. A sum of €1.65 billion is being unfurled by the Government as part of the national disability strategy. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has said on behalf of the Government that Ireland will sign the UN convention and that there is a guarantee that we will see it ratified. As the Senator knows, as part of that process discussions are ongoing on a number of issues that are particular to families and different organisations. There are 114 actions listed in the national disability strategy which must be completed by 2021. They encompass eight areas, including education, employment, housing, transport and accessible transport. Last week in the Dáil, as well as on his appointment, the Taoiseach said Ireland would sign the convention. His aim is to have it done by 3 December, UN International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I certainly hope we will be able to do so. The strategy is a stand-alone document. It does not necessarily require Ireland to sign the UN convention, but I will be happy to have the Taoiseach come to the House to address us on the issue. My priority this week is the passing of legislation to ensue it will be done by the summer. As I said, the Government has committed to providing a sum of €1.65 billion as part of the national disability stratety. If the Senator accepts my bona fides, the Taoiseach will come to the House in the autumn when we will have that discussion. I will be happy to have that conversation with him about the matter. Senator Humphreys referenced the issue of renewable energy and the need to have a wide consultation process. I will be happy to have the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, come to the House in the autumn to discuss the issue. If the Senator wants to talk to me later about putting together more structured information on the Bill, I will be happy to talk to him about the matter and facilitate him in that regard. Senators Paddy Burke and Gavan mentioned horse racing and the issue of the pay and conditions of workers involved in the sector. If legislation needs to be amended, as Leader of the House, I give a commitment that we will facilitate the passage of the necessary legislation. In the light of the comments made by the Senators on the need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come to the House, I will prioritise the issue on our return. It is an important sector, not least because of its economic value but also in terms of the number of jobs provided. I disagree with Senator Gavan who never loses his chance to critique Fine Gael's policy on employment creation.

Continuing our love-in this morning, I am happy to accept Senator Ó Ríordáin's amendment to the Order of Business, although we disagree in this case. Budget 2017 committed to reducing the pupil-teacher ratio, as does the programme for Government. The Government allocated an extra €458 million in the budget, which will have the effect of creating 2,400 new posts in the education system - an additional 900 resource teacher and 1,500 mainstream teaching posts. The budget provided for a reduced pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, from 16:1 to 15.7:1, and at post-primary level, from 14:1 to 13.7:1. I accept that we have a road to travel in that regard. An additional 4,800 posts have been created. The last Government was clear on the pupil-teacher ratio and the need to increase the numbers of special needs assistants and teaching posts in the education system. The record of this and the last Government in that regard is quite good. Senator Byrne referred to Irish Water in Limerick. I will be happy to have the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government come to the House to discuss the issue, but perhaps the Senator might want to raise it by way of a Commencement matter as she might receive a quicker response than we will in the House this week. Senator Ruane referred to the tragedy on the Grand Canal at the weekend. I join her in thanking the people who stepped in to assist with the rescue. We need to have a discussion on a national policy for how we can help and counsel people who intervene and come to the assistance of others. I know that there are bravery awards for people who perform such great acts, but as the Senator mentioned, the immediate need to have a chat or conversation with a professional should be looked at. I will be happy to work with her to progress something along those lines. Senator Lombard referred to the Heritage Bill. As the Cathaoirleach rightly said, it is a matter for the other House. It is important, however, that we allow for hedgerows to be trimmed, especially at this time of year when there are many people on the roads, in particular, narrow country roads which they try to navigate between bicycles, tractors, farm machinery, other cars and buses. It is about public safety, as well as protecting the environment. I share the Senator's view that there is a need for action, but, as the Cathaoirleach rightly ruled, it is a matter for the other House. Senators Butler, O'Reilly and Reilly raised the topic of diabetes. They referred to the need for a national campaign in order that people could have their blood tested to be made aware of their condition. I do not say it to be patronising, but Senator Butler is a walking ambassador for the need to be proactive. It is important that we all understand and recognise the need to have ourselves checked. This is a matter that can be referred to general practitioners and the primary care system. It is part of how we can change the system. I will be happy on any occasion to progress the issue with Senator Butler because it is important that we create awareness among those who might not necessarily engage in that activity. I apologise to Senator Gavan because I did not take note of the second part of his contribution.

I have a group which includes Senators Gavan, Daly and Reilly, but I cannot read my own writing. That is how bad it is. I have given a commitment as Leader of the House that we will not stop or obstruct the passage of the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill. It was included in the schedule for this week, but at Senator Daly's request, it has been removed from it. Rather than having a Bill that will not achieve what we want it to achieve and to avoid false information being given, to date, we, on this side of the House, have not been found wanting and have been involved with the Senator in every step of the process. I have not opposed him once on the Bill, on which we have worked with all parts of the deaf community - family members, interpreters, political figures, the Department and the Minister. One might not think so, having listened to Senator Gavan's contribution, but I wish to impress on him that we have, as Senator Daly will attest. We want to have a Bill that can be enacted to give rights and entitlements to members of the deaf community who have been sidelined and marginalised for far too long.

It is important that we have a Bill that can be delivered and acted on immediately, rather than it being lost in the other House. That is the fundamental goal we both share. Senator O'Reilly referred, in the context of Brexit, to the importance of the tourism sector and the jobs in it in the Border area. He made a very good point in the context of the VAT rate. There is a need to look at the rate again, given that today we have learned there was an increase of 53% in the price of hotel rooms for the U2 concerts.As someone who supports and advocates for the tourism sector and the need to have the VAT rate retained, it does pose the question as to whether we are getting value for money and how we can ensure the price of a hotel room, whether it be in Cavan, Monaghan, Dublin or Cork, is not abused. That is a matter the sector must address. The Senator made a good point about the importance of jobs in the sector. I agree with Senator Gavan that in some cases the pay and conditions of those working in the sector do not reflect the profits being made in it. There also has to be fairness.  The issue of third level education is important. There was a briefing last week by the Union of Students in Ireland and a debate on a Labour Party motion. The Cassells report is before the Joint Committee on Education and Skills. I will be happy to have the matter discussed in the autumn after we come back and work with Senator Ó Clochartaigh in progressing the issues he has raised. I am not familiar with some of the issues he raised, but I will be happy to talk to him later about them. I join Senator Reilly in sympathising with the family of the gentleman who was killed in Swords at the weekend. The loss of any person's life is to be regretted but even more so when it occurs in violent circumstances.  The issue raised about the Garda is one for the Department for Justice and Equality, the Minister and the Garda authorities. The Senator also raised the very important issue of community policing in the context of the need for greater visibility. We need to see an increase and expedition in the civilianisation of An Garda Síochána as it would allow more gardaí to be on the street and Garda stations to remain open in many key areas. The Senator referred to Garda stations in his constituency but also across the country. Senator Fintan Warfield referred to the national cultural institutions. I will be happy to have the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Humphreys, come to the House to debate the matter. Senator Davitt referred to the housing crisis and the 500 registered housing agencies. He made a very good point about their role and remit, how much money they had and what they actually did. I will be very happy to have the debate he requested in the autumn. He linked it with the issue of councils. It is a good point. We will debate the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2017 this week. It is important that we allow councils, whether by way of planning permissions, the use of vacant land or unused buildings, to have plans in place to quickly turn them around in order that housing can be provided.  I am happy to accept Senator Ó Ríordáin's amendment to the Order of Business. Regrettably, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Sinn Féin, but I have issued an invitation to the Taoiseach to come to the House in the autumn.

The add-on is the merging of the two offices. In the light of how far we have come I hope and anticipate that the co-operation there has been will continue. This Bill aims to improve the position of consumers of financial services and pensions services in a number of respects. It does so by first amalgamating the existing offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman into one single body. Furthermore, it consolidates and updates the existing legislation, including the extension of the time limits for complaints. I believe the Bill is a significant step in the empowerment of consumers of financial and pension services when it comes to addressing their complaints. There has been much cross-party co-operation in the Dáil on this Bill and I am sure this facilitative environment will continue in the Seanad. I also acknowledge the passing of Sinn Féin’s Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Bill in the Dáil last Friday. The Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance have worked closely with Sinn Féin and tabled amendments to try to ensure both Bills are complementary in areas where they overlap. However, the provisions of Sinn Féin’s Bill will be repealed once this Bill is commenced as this Bill moves the legislation from the Central Bank Act into stand-alone legislation.I will outline the key features of the Bill. A list of important definitions is contained in section 2. Chief among them are the definitions of a "consumer" and of a "long-term financial service". The definition of a consumer of financial services in this Bill has been expanded to include those who are entitled to benefit from income continuance plans, ICPs. In ICPs, the employer takes out the group scheme for the benefit of employees who may become ill or disabled long term. The contract is between the employer and the insurer. The employee is not a party to the contract. Therefore, up to now, employees could not complain to the ombudsman about a decision to exclude them from a benefit under the scheme. By including beneficiaries of ICPs in the definition of a consumer, such employees are now entitled to seek redress from the ombudsman. The delineation of what constitutes a "long-term financial service" is of central importance to this Bill. That is because the proposed extension of the time limits within which a consumer can make a complaint will only apply to long-term financial services, as well as pension products. Therefore, it is necessary that a suitably precise and comprehensive definition be adopted in this Bill to ensure the desired types of financial products come within this definition. I believe we have achieved this with our current definition of a long-term financial service. It includes all financial services or products of a fixed term of five years and one month or more such as mortgages, tracker mortgages and long-term loans. It also covers life assurance products. The definition also provides for the avoidance of doubt that annual products like car and house insurance are not included as long-term financial services. The existing six-year time limit should be sufficient time to bring complaints in respect of short-term financial services. The definition is the same as that which was agreed in this House last week in the discussion of the Sinn Féin Private Members' Bill following Report Stage of the Government's Bill. Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill set out the provisions for the creation of the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, as well as the dissolution of the existing bureau, the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman. It must be noted that the offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman have already been physically merged in one location at Lincoln Place. Mr. Ger Deering is the Ombudsman in both offices pursuant to section 23 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2015, which allowed the Financial Services Ombudsman to act as the Pensions Ombudsman. Section 12 of the Bill provides that the principal function of the Ombudsman is to investigate complaints by informal means, mediation and formal investigation, including oral hearings, if required or a combination of these means. Part 4 of the Bill establishes and regulates the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Council. It will supersede the dissolved Financial Services Council, with some important modifications. The Council has now been reduced from a maximum of ten members to a maximum of seven members. This reduction is reflective of the changing workload of the council under the Bill. The regulation-making power of the council has been transferred to the Minister for Finance. Additionally, the responsibility of appointing the ombudsman and deputy ombudsman is now also the task of the Minister rather than the council, after a public competition. It is preferable that these powers should be vested in an entity that is democratically accountable. The Minister may consult the council before making regulations under section 4. The role of the council is set out in section 40 and it includes keeping under review the efficiency and effectiveness of the office. The council retains the powers to make regulations to set the financial services industry levy, which is to be calculated according to the amount of cases concerning financial services in the previous year. This levy is one of the two sources of funding for the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, the other source being the Exchequer in accordance with the existing funding structure of the Pensions Ombudsman. Part 5 of the Bill governs the procedures for the making of a complaint by a consumer and the powers of the ombudsman in conducting an investigation. In respect of the conduct of a financial service provider, a person can complain about the provision of financial services, an offer of financial services or failure to provide financial services. In respect of the conduct of a pension provider, a person can complain about financial loss or a dispute with regard to pensions. The steps for resolving a complaint are contained in more detail in Part 6 of the Bill. Similar to the existing legislation, consumers will first be asked to try to resolve complaints with the internal resolution procedures of a provider. Section 55 now enables the Minister for Finance to prescribe minimum standards for such procedures. This may minimise a consumer's need to lodge a complaint with the ombudsman in the first instance and may lead to faster resolution of the complaint.  Section 58 stresses the importance of mediation in resolving complaints that proceed to the ombudsman. The text of this section was much discussed in the Dáil and in this House during the passage of the Private Member's Bill with the Government's amendments made on Report Stage in the Dáil. The current wording was arrived at with the consensus of all parties. I thank the other parties for engaging so productively on this issue. I believe that the current wording of section 58 should reinforce the encouraging current trend of nearly 60% of complaints being resolved by mediation. The extension of the time limit is a key feature of this Bill and had been flagged for some time in the public consultation in 2015 and the heads of Bill published in 2015. Under the old regime, a consumer had to make a complaint within six years of the occurrence of the conduct complained of. Section 51 of this Bill proposes to modify that time limit by providing that a consumer of a long-term financial service may also make a complaint within three years from when he or she first became aware, or ought to have become aware of the conduct complained of if that was later than the standard six years from the date of the conduct. Furthermore, the ombudsman retains the discretion to extend the time limit for the making of a complaint in respect of long-term financial services in circumstances where it seems just or equitable for him or her to do so. The rationale for extending the time limits to long-term financial services is because consumers of a long-term financial service may not be aware of a problem until the maturity of the product, which could be long after six years from the date of the conduct in question. On the other hand, a problem with a short-term financial service should manifest within the six-year time limit already provided for. The new time limits also apply to conduct that occurred in the past. Consumers will now be able to complain about conduct stretching back 15 years to 2002, provided that the long-term financial service in question has not expired or been terminated more than six years before the complaint. This could include complainants who have previously have had their complaints dismissed by the ombudsman in the past due to the conduct complained of falling outside the previous six-year time limit and who make their complaint within the new time limits. The decision to apply this 15-year "long stop" was inspired by the long stop recommended by the Law Reform Commission when it discussed introducing a discoverability test to extend the time limit for making personal injury claims. The use of these proposed time periods was arrived at on foot of extensive research by the Department of Finance. It is the result of a comprehensive process of engagement with numerous stakeholders, public consultation and advice from the Attorney General and I am sure Senators will agree it strikes the appropriate balance necessary to protect the consumer in a practical way. A notable improvement in the Bill is the provision for increased communication between the ombudsman and the parties of a complaint. The ombudsman can now issue preliminary decisions and explain certain decisions during the investigating process, such as decisions on whether to hold an oral hearing. This will increase transparency for both consumers and providers. Most significantly, in section 62 there is provision for the publication of the ombudsman financial services decisions, with names redacted, which should ensure an optimal balance between promoting transparency and the operations of the ombudsman and protecting the privacy of complainants.  The Bill introduces a number of important changes to the current regime. Chief among them is the consolidation of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman into a single office. The provisions contained in this Bill will considerably improve the position of consumers, especially the new time limits with regard to long term financial services. I thank all the political parties for engaging in a constructive debate on these issues during the Stages in the Dáil and thank Senators for their contribution to the debate on the Private Members' Bill last week. These contributions have resulted in a Bill that I believe will be embraced by this House. I am satisfied with the Bill, as it stands, and commend it to the House for further discussion.  I think this was the first piece of legislation I took here. I told the House that I would be as accommodating as I could be to ensure we got the best legislation possible and that still stands. I hope the level of co-operation we have had today will continue. The legislation is better for it. There had been some confusion last Friday on how we had got the legislation back to the Dáil to be concluded there, but all parties co-operated and we got through the process quite painlessly. I commend the Bill to the House.
#GerryHorkan	unknown-#GerryHorkan-party	unknown-#GerryHorkan-dob	unknown-#GerryHorkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	67	I will make my points briefly because we have discussed this on Committee Stage and many of the matters relating to the legislation were discussed in the pre-legislative scrutiny on the Sinn Féin Private Members' Bill in the appropriate committee. We teased out most of the remaining items last week. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill 2017 and confirm to the Minister of State that Fianna Fáil will support the passage of this Government Bill. Many of the provisions, such as the definition of the consumer and the timeline within which a consumer is able to make a complaint are directly inspired by the FLAC report of 2014, Redressing the Imbalance. The authors of that report must be commended for their extensive work and on other legal protection for individuals. We all want to see better protection for consumers, where they have genuine complaints about services and products which they bought, and that they are able to address those concerns robustly and in a comprehensive manner with the financial services and pensions ombudsman. I will not rehash the contents of the Minister of State's speech, which was comprehensive. It makes sense to put financial services and pensions ombudsman positions together. The pension is a financial product and it makes sense that it would be with the Financial Services Ombudsman. Physically, they have already merged and this is merely enabling legislation to allow it to take effect in practice. In effect, this Bill replaces or supersedes the Sinn Féin Bill which we passed last week. It is important that we take on board all its measures. All of the positive measures to which we agreed in that Bill last week are comprehensively included in this Bill. We do not want a situation where one Bill contradicts another. There could be a concern that the merging of the two offices may lead to a reduction in the quality of service. We must make it clear that by putting two ombudsman offices together we do not see any diminution in the service provided to either sector, whether it is financial services excluding pensions or pensions. That is an important part of this legislation. It might be the case that its smaller council could make it more focused. There will be people with a consumer background and others from the financial services and pensions industries. Expertise is important. The Minister of State discussed a levy. He said we should look at mediation, where possible. The definitions are important when we are looking at what is or is not a long-term product. We must make sure the time limits are comprehensive. The Minister of State mentioned the 15-year backstop which would give many people a reason and an opportunity to make their complaints and have it enabled in the legislation.  The Minister of State's conclusion was appropriate. It says exactly what the Bill is about which is merging the offices, improving the time limits, and giving the definitions. I support the Bill and do not want to delay its passage through the House. I commend it and hope all parties will work together on it. New politics is criticised sometimes, but it is important that when we work together and get a better result it shows that the dynamic here at the moment can encourage Governments to take on the concerns of other parties to produce better legislation for the benefit of everybody.

I warmly welcome the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy. This Bill makes absolute sense. It is important when something makes sense and has been teased out and argued, and its merits put forward, we should move on with it. There is much criticism of new politics, but it can only be new politics if those from all parties and none make it work. That is our challenge. I acknowledge the broad consultation on the Bill. We have had much debate and discussion on this legislation, for which I thank the Minister of State. The financial services and pensions ombudsman is a statutory officer who deals independently with unresolved complaints for consumers about their individual dealings with all regulatory financial service providers. The statutory role of the Pensions Ombudsman is to investigate complaints of a financial loss due to maladministration and disputes on facts of law in relation to occupational pension schemes, trusts, retirement, annuity, contracts and personal retirement savings accounts. The Pensions Ombudsman performs these functions independently and acts as an impartial adjudicator. The funding of all this and the resources that will be necessary for the new merged outfit are important. I will raise this matter later with the Minister of State. The Bill before us seeks to amalgamate the office of the Financial Services Ombudsman and Pensions Ombudsman which makes absolute sense, as Senator Horkan said. There can be no diminution of the role of the office or its strength and effectiveness. This is about supporting consumers and resolving issues in the financial services market and everything that goes with it. It cannot be seen to water down the impact of what is needed, whether it is righting a wrong, mediation and addressing issues which are pertinent to the role and functions of an ombudsman. The proposed legislation provides consumers with a one-stop shop for inquiries, which makes sense, and the potential to remedy complaints relating to pensions and financial products. It proposes to consolidate and update the legislation including an extension of time limits for complaints to the ombudsman. This is something that people have called out for and again we have seen the Minister of State respond to the public demand and genuine concern. I welcome all of these things.  In April 2013 the Government agreed to accept the recommendations to an important report, a critical review under the public service reform plan, to amalgamate the office of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman. It argued that the functions of the two organisations were "sufficiently similar to provide opportunities for improvements in the quality of the service to make such an amalgamation desirable," and it can work. The then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, had announced the intention to amalgamate the two bodies in April 2013.I do not see any Labour Party Member in attendance, but it is worth noting that was her recommendation as Minister at the time. In addition to the amalgamation of both offices, the opportunity was taken to review the existing legislation. It is important that that was done in order for the Bill to be meaningful, as the Minister of State has demonstrated it is. I have read the memorandum and other literature in this regard. A root and branch review of both bodies and how the services worked was carried out and it was decided that what is proposed by the Bill is a better option.  I am fully happy to support every aspect of this legislation. It is a good, timely and welcome Bill. The Minister of State is pushing it very early in his time in office and I wish him well with it. He should address how it will be resourced and how the new body will be funded. That is very important. I again thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and for the rapid manner in which he has pushed the Bill forward. He has also listened to, engaged with and responded to various concerns raised.

This is probably one of the most important Bills to come to the House in a long time. People in Limerick have told me that issues in respect of dealing with the ombudsman and related time limits in particular are very important. Sinn Féin brought forward a Private Members' Bill on this issue which will now be superseded and is consolidated in this Bill. Many people come to my constituency office having experienced an issue with a financial provider and then suddenly found that six years had elapsed from the date of the conduct complained of. Most may not even have been aware during that time of what was happening. It was unfair. The biggest short-term issue is that people will now be able to seek to reopen a case with the financial ombudsman over conduct going back as far as 2002 so long as the financial product had not expired or been terminated more than six years before the complaint was made. That gives a window of opportunity. People who feel they were ripped off in respect of a financial service but whose time period to make a complaint to the ombudsman had elapsed will now be able to go back to the ombudsman and have the case reopened. This legislation has gone through the Dáil and is due to be passed through the Seanad in its entirety this week. It should then go to the President as quickly as possible to be enacted. The ombudsman would be ready for that enactment. An information campaign should be begun by the financial ombudsman to inform people of the changes and should provide a freefone number for people seeking information about whether they can now make a complaint about a product in respect of which they felt they were ripped off in the past. People must be made aware that if the conduct complained of took place since 2002 and the product had not elapsed for more than six years from when an original complaint was put in, they can now re-enter the complaint. I welcome that window of opportunity. The Bill should be enacted as quickly as possible. Section 26 provides that a strategic plan be completed by the ombudsman as soon as practicable following the establishment of the Bill and updated every three years thereafter. We must ensure those targets are met and that by the end of this year the strategic plan will be known.  Section 58 deals with mediation. The Financial Services Ombudsman should be a measure of last resort. I hope this Bill puts manners on financial service providers and that problems with a person who has been treated badly in respect of a financial services product be sorted out through a financial service provider's internal mediation process, rather than the case going to the ombudsman. That is extremely important. It is welcome that the ombudsman will be able to provide preliminary decisions. A practical measure should be put in place whereby people with legacy issues who could not previously make a complaint to the ombudsman because the six-year deadline had elapsed will now be made aware that if the conduct complained of happened within the past 15 years and that the product had been in place for less than six years prior to the date they made the original complaint to the ombudsman that, they can seek to have the case reopened. There are many such people. When the Bill is enacted and up and running, banks and financial institutions should take heed of what it is purporting to do and resolve it by mediation. The ombudsman should issue preliminary decisions as a matter of course in order that people will be aware of whether they will have an oral hearing, the reasons for it and how long the process will take.  Section 62 provides for the publication of decisions, which should ensure an optimal balance and promote transparency. Redacted details should be published which would provide a standard and benchmark for financial service providers to adopt. That will help to ensure routine cases be dealt with by financial service providers rather than ending up before the ombudsman. There should be no requirement for a financial services and pensions ombudsman. Financial service providers should act in the best interests of their client, as well as in their own interests. Members know of too many instances in which elderly people in particular have been ripped off. Many such people have contacted me in regard to this issue. Members must consider whether a commission-based payment scheme for those selling these financial products has contributed to the selling of products that are not fit for purpose.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	73	Sinn Féin welcomes the Bill. As Senator O'Donnell has just said, when passed it will supersede the Sinn Féin Bill which I was delighted to see passed by the House last week. I am very glad to see that what was won on behalf of consumers in the Sinn Féin Bill will form part of this Bill. This is a Bill of two parts. First, it merges the offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman. Second, it overhauls many consumer protection rules regarding the making of complaints. Of most importance is the removal of the so-called "six-year rule". The issues in respect of consumer protection have been well debated and I am glad that common ground and common wording has been found in order that there be no differences from the point of view of the consumer when making a complaint, regardless of the date, from now on.  It is important that the merger of the offices of the Pensions Ombudsman and Financial Services Ombudsman not pass without comment and scrutiny. Members have become so used to the language of austerity that words such as "merger" set off alarm bells that the real intent is to impose cuts. There seems to be no democratic demand for such a merger. The basis for it seems to be the regulatory impact assessment by Mr. Hinz of the World Bank who concluded that there was no compelling evidence that negative consequences would ensue from the merger. That is a very weak premise on which to proceed with the merging of two very important consumer protection bodies. In view of the recent tracker mortgage and PPI scandals, can one really say this is the right time to tinker with the consumer protection bodies of the State?That is not to mention the rip-off being carried out by insurers on drivers, small business and home owners day in, day out. Reform of consumer protection law is required and this opportunity could have been taken for a more radical approach. The strict power of the ombudsman to rule only on what is legal as opposed to what is fair frustrates many people and that frustration is understandable. The Central Bank does not want to hear from individuals and the ombudsman can only stick to the narrow legal battles. That is the situation for consumers in this country. When something stinks, everyone smells it, but no one can do anything about it. I am aware, too, of the issues with endowment policies and so-called whole-of-life policies, where elderly people or their children in some cases are now realising that the small print contains some very nasty wording. The policies they were sold turned out to be different from what they were led to believe. I predict this will be a major issue for the new ombudsman's office in the coming years. This merger should not and cannot put consumers at a disadvantage relative to where they are today. That means ensuring the new office is properly resourced at all times, which we need to monitor. My party put forward an amendment during the Dáil Stages seeking to weaken the overall control of the Minister in matters such as the ombudsman hiring extra resources or engaging a consultant to carry out a study. The principle of oversight is correct, but it is my hope that, in practice, whatever resources the ombudsman wants, he will get. I warmly welcome the new provisions allowing the ombudsman to publish findings in full. This is a significant improvement. Only last week we passed some of the other measures of this Bill because of the overlap with my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty's Bill. I thank the Minister of State and his staff on behalf of my party for their co-operation in getting Deputy Doherty's Bill through. Thousands of people each year who are prevented from pursuing allegations of wrongdoing against financial institutions will now be allowed to access justice through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. Figures from the ombudsman's office show that 1,000 people every year are barred from the process because of the six-year rule. We know thousands more have not applied because they have been advised the six-year rule will apply. This rule only operated to benefit the banks and other financial institutions, which it shielded from investigation. We will now redress that imbalance, with consumers empowered to make a complaint within three years of becoming aware of possible wrongdoing. Critically, thousands of people previously refused access to the process will now be allowed to resubmit their complaint because the legislation is retrospective in nature. This will come as very welcome news and a massive relief to the many consumers who have contacted us all, I am sure, looking for an opportunity to have their complaint heard. I wish particularly to commend the work of FLAC, Free Legal Advice Centres, the report of which, Redressing the Imbalance, forms the basis of these victories for consumers. I urge those previously refused access because of the six-year rule to reapply and the countless others who did not apply because of their awareness of the situation to reconsider submitting their cases. We support the Bill.

I want to touch on the issue of when the commencement orders will be made in respect of the establishment. When we conclude within the House, I hope this week, the Bill will go to the Attorney General's office in respect of the commencement order. I do not think there is a requirement for an early signature or anything of that nature. It is going to go through the process and become law as quickly as possible. Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the funding model. As a result of having two offices, there were two streams. There is a dual funding structure in place. It is appropriate that the financial services providers should fund the ombudsman's service in respect of financial services products, since the ombudsman helps them resolve complaints, as well as allowing consumers to raise them. The ombudsman replaced voluntary schemes which the industry had in place. In respect of pensions, many of the complaints pertain to public sector schemes. It is appropriate that they should be paid for from public funds. In addition, we do not want to discourage people from taking out pensions, which could be the case if the cost of a levy was too great. There was a previous structure within both offices which has been streamlined into one. Senator Conway-Walsh asked if expenditure could be allowed within delegated sanctions. It would be the intention that the ombudsman would be allowed to operate within delegated sanctions. That is the way every other Government agency operates. There are clear sanctions and amounts within the HSE and other Government agencies. If one goes beyond that, there is a requirement for consent from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This is putting in place exactly what applies to every other Government agency. There is nothing different here. It is not the intention that the ombudsman would have to seek the approval and consent of the two Ministers each time he needs to engage consultants or advisers, but it is necessary that expenditure of taxpayers' funds is subject to the appropriate oversight. There is a lot of focus on expenditure on consultants, coming from all sides of the House. The line between pensions and financial services is no longer completely straight. There is a significant crossover and the lines have become blurred because of the products that are being sold at the moment. As a result, this is the opportunity to be able to assess those financial services that may be a pension or have some features of a pension. It is the main reason the bodies are merging. The issue of whole-of-life policies were raised. My role as the Minister of State with responsibility for financial services is a promotional role. I promote the sector very strongly and vigorously. Many people are employed in this industry in the State. I support that fully. However, I want to be very clear that if there is any sharp practice occurring, I want people to bring it to my attention. If there is sharp practice, I will do the very best I can to deal with it within my period as Minister of State with responsibility for financial services. The matter of whole-of-life policies has been brought to my attention. A number of constituents have come to me. It is very wrong that elderly people are being charged massive annual premiums to continue their policies. Some of these people have paid into a policy for decades. If they live another year or two, and please God they will, the premium becomes so high they effectively lose all they have paid over the period. That is not playing the game fairly. I want to be very clear about this. I take a very dim view of someone taking advantage of the rules and how they are allowed to apply them. On a point made by Senator Kieran O'Donnell, I agree with him that there should not be a need for an ombudsman. I would love if there was not. There can, however, be very legitimate disputes on both sides. The ombudsman's office is there to be fair and impartial and to try to come to a conclusion on matters without recourse to the courts. That is what it is for. The likes of what I just mentioned is not playing fair. If the financial services I promote and support are not doing it properly, there will be a cost.

I met a man recently who was in his 90s. He had taken out what was called a section 60, a life policy to pay taxes on his death.He has lived to a much older age. He is now 93 years old and has put a substantial amount of money into a term policy but no endowment element of any description was built into it. I suggest the design of such policies needs to be looked at. The amount of money the man in this case has put into the policy is significantly more than it would be on encashment if he were to pass away. We probably need to look at the design of these products. When the man in question went to the Ombudsman, he was informed that under the terms of the contract he had signed with the financial institution, nothing unlawful had been done. It seems incredible that he has put in significantly more than what the policy is worth. It is wrong that it is being said the policy will die if he does not continue paying the exorbitant premiums.

I look forward to our discussion of its provisions and support from all sides of the House for its early enactment. Its general objective is to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs, speeding up the resolution of disputes and relieving the stress and acrimony that often accompany court proceedings. Therefore, the Bill also forms part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle the issue of legal costs. Support for the development of mediation as an alternative to court proceedings has been building in recent years. In its 2010 report entitled, Alternative Dispute Resolution: Mediation and Conciliation, the Law Reform Commission reviewed the development and effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution, ADR, mechanisms and recommended the enactment of legislation to underpin such processes. The Bill incorporates many of the commission's recommendations on mediation. Meanwhile, revised rules of the superior courts which facilitate and encourage the referral of disputes to a process of mediation or conciliation have also come into operation. Before turning to the main provisions of the Bill, I would like to make some general points. First, "mediation" is defined as a confidential, facilitative and voluntary process in which the parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a mediator, attempt to reach a mutually acceptable agreement to resolve their dispute. I emphasise the word "voluntary" in this context: mediation is and under the legislation will remain a voluntary process. Moreover, while the Bill seeks to promote mediation as an effective and viable means of resolving disputes, it also recognises that it would not be an appropriate mechanism for resolving certain proceedings such as claims against the State for alleged infringements of fundamental rights, proceedings concerning children under the child care Acts or proceedings under the domestic violence Acts. These exceptions and some others are outlined in section 3. Part 3 of the Bill contains two key provisions that impose obligations on solicitors and barristers in respect of mediation. Put simply, the Bill requires solicitors to advise their clients to consider the use of mediation as a means of settling the dispute before embarking on court proceedings and to provide them with information on available mediation services. The Bill makes a similar provision in relation to barristers that will apply if and when in the future barristers are permitted to issue proceedings directly on behalf of clients. In order to ensure this key requirement is given effect in practice, the Bill requires solicitors to make a statutory declaration that the obligations placed on them by this legislation have been respected. I should add that a new Part was inserted on Committee Stage in the Dáil comprising amendments to the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996. The purpose of the new Part is to ensure consistency between the mediation related provisions contained in these Acts and the provisions of this legislation. Section 12 of the Bill makes provision for a mediation council. This provision which did not form part of the general scheme of the Bill stems from submissions received and observations made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on a regulatory framework for the mediation sector. The mediation sector is made up of a diverse range of bodies. For example, seven such bodies attended the public hearings held by the joint committee, while submissions were received from several other interested parties. For this reason, the Bill does not set out to impose a rigid regulatory structure on the sector. Instead, it provides for the possible future establishment of a body to be known as the Mediation Council of Ireland on condition that certain conditions are met. Section 12 provides that where, at some future date, the Minister for Justice and Equality is satisfied that a body complies with the minimum standards set out in the Schedule and is, at the same time, sufficiently representative of the various mediation interests involved in the mediation sector, he or she may, following a consultation process, make an order declaring that that body will be recognised for the purposes of the legislation as the Mediation Council of Ireland. The council, if and when established, would be conferred with the functions set out in paragraph 1 of the Schedule. The intention is that the council would be self-financing. I turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 makes provision for the entry into operation of the Bill. While it is intended that the general provisions on mediation will enter into operation at the earliest opportunity following enactment, the commencement of sections 12, 13, 15 and 23 will require the making of specific orders at a later date.  Section 2 contains definitions for the purposes of the Bill.  Section 3 provides that the Bill's provisions will not apply to certain proceedings, for example, disputes arising within an employment context referred to statutory dispute resolution processes such as those provided by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC; matters under tax and customs legislation; proceedings under the child care Acts or the domestic violence Acts.Other exclusions include judicial review proceedings and proceedings against the State in respect of alleged infringements of fundamental rights and freedoms. Furthermore, nothing in this legislation is intended to replace mediation or other dispute resolution processes in any other statue or under any other agreement or contract.  Section 4 on regulations and section 5 on expenses are standard provisions in legislation of this type. Part 2 of the Bill contains general provisions regarding mediation. Section 6 deals with general conditions under which mediation takes place, making it clear that participation in mediation must be voluntary and that it is for the parties themselves to determine its outcome.  Section 7 provides for an agreement to mediate to be signed by both the mediator and the parties to the mediation. The agreement to mediate outlines the manner in which the mediation is to take place and the matters to be included in the agreement. Section 8 outlines the role of the mediator. It specifies the actions the mediator must take prior to the commencement of the mediation and those that he or she must take during the mediation. Section 8(1) provides that the mediator must supply the parties with information concerning his or her qualifications, training and experience, as well as a copy of any code of practice under section 9 to which he or she adheres. Section 8(4) derives from a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission Report and provides that a mediator may, exceptionally and at the request of all the parties, make proposals for the resolution of the dispute but that it will be for the parties alone to decide whether to accept such proposals. Section 9 provides for codes of practice for mediators. It provides that the Minister shall, as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Bill, prepare or publish a code or codes of practice setting standards for the conduct of mediations. Section 9(2) lists a number of relevant matters that may be covered in such a code or codes. As an alternative, the Minister can approve and publish a code that has been prepared by a mediation body or another body which purports to set standards for the conduct or mediations. Subsections (3) to (7), inclusive, make provision for the manner in which a code of practice may be published, amended, revoked or even withdrawn. Section 10 deals with the crucial issue of confidentiality in mediation. It makes clear that all communications relating to a mediation, including oral communications, will be confidential and cannot be used for or in any other proceedings. A limited number of justified exceptions to the general rule on confidentiality are, however, specified in section 10(2). Section 11 deals with the enforceability of mediation settlements. It provides that only the parties have the power to decide if a mediation settlement has been reached and the manner in which it is to be enforced. Subject to the exceptions specified in this section, a mediation settlement will be enforceable as a contract at law where it is in writing and signed by all the parties and also by the mediator. As stated, the Bill contains proposals for a regulatory structure that derive from discussions during pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill. Section 12 makes provision for the possible future establishment of a mediation council to oversee the development of the mediation sector. Such a council would comprise representation from the main mediation bodies, together with a number of public interest members. The intention is that the council would be a self-financing and representative of both mediation interests and the public interest. Under the section, the Minister could, at some future date and by order, declare the establishment of a body to be called the “Mediation Council of Ireland”. The section also provides that there can only be one such council in existence at one time and that the council must be sufficiently representative of mediation interests and must also meet the minimum requirements provided for in the Schedule to the Bill.  Section 13 provides for reports of the mediation council to be submitted to the Minister and for the laying of such reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Part 3 of the Bill specifies the obligations concerning mediation which are imposed on practising solicitors and perhaps, at some future date, on barristers. Section 14 is a key provision. It imposes mediation-related obligations on a practising solicitor and specifies the advice and information regarding mediation which a solicitor must provide to his or her client prior to the initiation of court proceedings. The section further provides that the originating document to commence proceedings must be accompanied by a statutory declaration made by the solicitor evidencing that the solicitor has complied with the requirements of the section. Where the required statutory declaration is not lodged with the originating documents, the court must adjourn the proceedings to enable the solicitor to comply with the section at that stage. The section does not apply to certain matters arising under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act 1989 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996. Separate mediation-related provisions are already included in those Acts. However, sections 24 to 26, inclusive, contain amendments to these provisions in order to ensure consistency and coherence between these Acts and the provisions of the Bill. Part 6 of the Bill contains these amendments. Section 15 outlines the obligations on practising barristers regarding mediation. The provision will apply only when it is lawful for a practising barrister to issue proceedings on behalf of a client who is not represented by a solicitor. Under the section, the Minister may impose obligations analogous to those imposed on solicitors or barristers following the publication of any report under section 34 (1) of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 relating to the unification of the professions of solicitor and barrister and after consultation with the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council. Part 4 of the Bill contains provisions regarding the role of the court in mediation. Section 16 empowers a court to invite parties in civil proceedings that have already commenced to consider using mediation to resolve their dispute. Under this provision a court may, on its own initiative or following an application by a party to the dispute, invite the parties to consider using mediation to settle the dispute. The section further provides that where the parties decide to use mediation, the court will adjourn the proceedings and may make an order extending the time for compliance by any party with any provisions of the relevant rules of court or of any order of the court in these proceedings. Section 17 provides for mediator reports in such cases. It provides that where, following an invitation by the court under section 16, the parties engage in mediation the mediator will then report to the court on the outcome of the mediation.  Section 18 concerns the impact of mediation on limitation and prescription periods. In short, it provides for disregarding time taken for mediation under the Statute of Limitations. Section 19 provides for the adjournment of court proceedings to permit the mediation option to be explored. This provision is in addition to any existing power of the courts with regard to adjournments. Section 20 deals with the fees and costs of mediation. Under section 7(b), the agreement to mediate should specify the manner in which the fees and costs of mediation will be borne. Such fees and costs must be reasonable and proportionate to the importance and complexity of the issues at stake and, of course, to the amount of work undertaken by the mediator.  Section 21 deals with the factors that may be taken into account by a court in awarding costs. Section 22 is a technical amendment to section 15 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which will allow the court of its own initiative to refer a personal injuries action to mediation. Section 15 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 already provides that a court may at the request of any party to a personal injuries action, direct that the parties to the action meet to discuss and attempt to settle the action at a mediation conference. Part 5 of the Bill deals with the provision of mediation information sessions in certain circumstances. In its 2010 report the Law Reform Commission underlined the potential benefits of mediation in family law proceedings as an alternative to adversarial court proceedings and recommended that parties be required to attend information sessions in advance of the commencement of such proceedings during which the benefits and advantages of mediation can be properly and adequately explained. Section 23 seeks to give effect to this recommendation. It provides that the Minister may, for ensuring the availability of such sessions at a reasonable cost and in suitable locations, prepare and publish a scheme for the delivery of such sessions, or approve a scheme for the delivery of such sessions by another person or body. The Legal Aid Board, for example, is already involved in the provision of a free family mediation service, the benefits of which are widely acknowledged, especially in cases in which children are involved. Details of the procedure for adopting such a scheme are set out in subsections (3) to (7), inclusive. Section 23(8) clarifies that the section applies to family law proceedings and proceedings under sections 67A(3) or 117 of the Succession Act 1965. The Schedule outlines the minimum requirements with regard to the establishment of a mediation council under section 12.In particular, it specifies the general functions of the council and its membership. The main functions of the council, if established, would be as follows: to promote public awareness of mediation; develop standards in the provision of mediation, including continuous professional development; prepare codes of practice for mediators; establish and maintain a register of mediators; and advise the Minister on the establishment of a scheme to deliver mediation information sessions. The council would consist of 11 members, a majority of whom, including the chairperson, would represent the public interest. The council would be independent in the performance of its functions and be self-financing from fees calculated in accordance with its rules. The Bill will promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings. I believe enactment of the Bill will speed up resolution of disputes, reduce legal costs associated with such disputes and reduce or avoid the stress involved in adversarial court proceedings. I commend the Bill to the House.

I am a solicitor and an accredited mediator with Mediation Forum Ireland. However, I have never practised. I welcome the Bill. The Minister has gone into the technical detail of the Bill and I will not repeat it. Fianna Fáil welcomes this overdue Bill. I am really delighted that we are debating it in the House today. Taking a case to court is a serious matter and can be stressful. Usually it is very contentious. Ultimately if a judge has to make a decision, there is a winner and a loser. There are cost implications. The Bill encourages parties to go to mediation and puts a special onus on solicitors to try to sell the concept of mediation in order that legal costs are reduced. That is very welcome. It must be outlined that mediation is a voluntary method of trying to resolve a dispute. Nobody will be forced to go to mediation. The mediation environment is very practical. It is not as scary as the idea of going into a courtroom with a judge and barristers in wigs and gowns. That is why mediation would appeal to the public. Mediation is offered in family law cases, but there are other types of mediation. I know that in the family law environment, the mediation services provide proper rooms. There are waiting lists for mediation. Would the Minister consider funding the family law mediation services? People are trying to figure out, as a punter or a business person, how the mediation legislation would affect them if they were owed a debt which they wished to pursue. This is very different from family law mediation.  Commercial mediation or mediation to resolve small debts involves costs. However, they are not significant. Should people decide to take the mediation route, they wonder how to find a mediator. The Bar Council has a list of mediators, as does the Law Society of Ireland; therefore, between the two parties, it is agreed on the best person to pick, based on their experience, the cases they have handled in the past, personality types in order that both parties would have respect and confidence in the mediator. This is warmly welcomed because it means the parties can choose with whom they want to work to come to a mediated agreement. Usually what happens once the mediator is picked, is that the mediator takes over and perhaps organises a location to hold the mediation. One usually needs three rooms. There are practicalities involved and some expense, but it is obviously less costly than spending many full days in court. A date will be set for the mediation; the mediator will organise the three rooms, perhaps in a hotel or conference facility, a mediator's room and a room for each of the parties. It is conducted in a much more relaxed environment. It is not a scary environment. As the Minister outlined, it is a voluntary process. The mediator will spend a lot of time talking to each party and going through the pros and cons of their cases and I hope come to a mediated settlement and drawing up a mediated settlement agreement. As the Minister outlined, how the agreement will be implemented is up to the parties. Much of the time it is successful, but obviously just because people enter into mediation discussions, it does not mean it will definitely be successful. Sometimes one has the risk of going down the mediation route and the agreement not working and then having to go to court. In most cases it is worth a try and it is worth putting the onus on practitioners, which I think the Bill does, to encourage parties to go down the mediation route.  I commend the Minister. The Bill is well overdue and I look forward to discussing the finer details at a later Stage in the autumn.

The Minister summed up the purpose of the Bill in his final points. Anything that speeds up the resolution of disputes, reduces legal costs associated with disputes, reduces long waiting times and avoids adversarial court proceedings has to be welcomed. I am reminded of what a judge said to me recently. He said he personally would not take a case to litigation because he believed that if there was a dispute, one went to the fence and put one's hand over it to negotiate a settlement. That is the correct thing to do and one will save the legal costs and the stress. Sometimes people get bogged down in vindictiveness and other things such that they cannot reach a settlement. People suffer significantly because of delays, costs and time in getting a resolution to a dispute as quickly as possible. Mediation can help and it is not always binding. I would like the Minister to talk through a negotiated or mediated settlement and how binding it is. A binding settlement is really important. We need to understand this. I want to concentrate on certain aspects of the Bill. Part 3 places obligations on practising solicitors. I do not have to mention in the House that people have been very unhappy with the legal profession and they were perceived to be involved in the resolution of a dispute. People are not always happy with the legal profession in terms of the resolution of a dispute. That is not to knock the members of the legal profession who are Members. Part 3 of the Bill contains two key provisions relating to the obligations of solicitors and barristers as regards mediation. Let me draw attention to section 14 which will require practising solicitors "to advise" the client to consider mediation as a means of attempting to resolve the dispute which is the subject of the proposed proceedings. Under section 14(b) a solicitor must provide the client with information on mediation services, including the details of mediator services, information about the advantages and the benefits of mediation and information of confidential obligations and enforceable mediation settlements. That has to be welcomed. However, the solicitor has to advise. The legal profession is a business at the end of the day. Some solicitors, not all of them, will encourage litigation. That is a fact of life. Many people will have had experience of that. We need a stronger wording than "advise" in this section. Section 14(2) states that if a practising solicitor is acting on behalf of a client who intends to institute proceedings, the originating document by which proceedings are instituted shall be accompanied by a statutory declaration made by the solicitor confirming that the obligations under section 14(1) have been discharged. What happens if this declaration is not provided? There must be a remedy. One may say the solicitor will be asked for the declaration, but how can we be sure the declaration is provided for? Will the Minister clarify the position on the declaration? The Minister sets out the role of the mediation council in section 12. As this is done well, I am not going to rehearse it, but how is it intended to finance the mediation council? I understand it is envisaged in the Bill that the council will be self-financing. I do not know how that will work.The Minister might elaborate on how he intends the mediation council to be funded and who will contribute to that fund.  People need speedy resolution of disputes; they want curtailed legal costs and to avoid the stress of the adversarial courts process. On the whole, therefore, I welcome the Bill, for which the Minister has my support.

There is never an easy day as Minister for Justice and Equality and today is no different. It is certainly not an easy day for our esteemed colleague for whom I have huge regard, especially with the report of the Committee of Public Accounts and its damning findings on the Garda Commissioner.

#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	98	Paul Bradford was the spokesperson on justice prior to my appointment at the time. I felt then that mediation had a long way to go in this country to come anywhere near what our European colleagues had to resolve disputes. I decided then to use the mechanisms available to Members to table a Private Members' motion calling on the Government to develop legislation on mediation. I commend my colleague, Deputy Josepha Madigan, who was a Fine Gael councillor at the time, for being the only person in the country to have written a textbook on mediation. That textbook has certainly informed academic opinion on mediation. There are some very good courses on mediation in some of our third level institutions, in particular in Maynooth University, which are informed by the work done by Deputy Madigan in a former life. Her assistance to me in drafting that Private Members' motion to promote mediation was very useful and we received a great deal of media coverage. I think it was 2013 or possibly 2014. While the Bill is late, therefore, it is very welcome. With his own experience in the legal profession over many years, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, sees the merits of mediation. There are others in the legal profession, however, who see it as a threat. We have high legal fees and one way to deal with that issue is by promoting mediation. Senator Boyhan expressed concern about the declaration from solicitors, but the Bill provides that they are required to provide the certificate and that a case will be adjourned until that is done. The Senator's concerns are genuine, but the matter is covered in the Bill. I just wanted to point that out before the Senator left the Chamber. In terms of what mediation can achieve, we have a long way to go before we are in line with our European counterparts. Certainly, a code of practice as required by the Bill is important. A mediation council, to which the legislation aspires, is something that should be put in place in early course. If there was an effective, well funded, properly resourced and well-informed mediation council, it could set a code of ethics. Any code of ethics is an evolving document which is always being improved. While it is an aspiration within the legislation, I urge the Minister to set up a mediation council to take charge of the area in early course. I am glad that barristers are being included because the legal profession has resisted change more than most other professions. It is not in the cultural thinking of the profession to embrace and engage with change, but this is change that is necessary to ensure we are competitive and that there are other options outside litigation to be explored. The funny thing about mediation is that it has remarkable successes. When an independent individual is involved, listens to both sides and engages with them, it can have an enormously calming effect. Obviously, the Bill specifies issues like ensuring costs are kept at an appropriate level and that confidentiality is protected and promoted. It provides for proper training and ongoing professional development. Society changes, standards change and mediation techniques and mechanisms will change too. Continuous professional development is, therefore, appropriate. Going through the Bill, I also note that a mediator will be required to make his or her credentials and experience known to the parties prior to being retained to do the work. That is important. While 99% of people are bona fide and honest about their endeavours, requiring under law the provision of copies of qualifications, credentials and experience can eliminate the rogue. It removes the embarrassment of having to make a request for parties. As such, a great deal of thought has gone into the Bill. I note that Women's Aid has an issue with the legislation and I am sure that issue will be dealt with on Report Stage. I was surprised to receive correspondence from Women's Aid as the Bill is an extraordinarily positive step forward to bring Ireland into line with best international practice. While we have already achieved a great deal when it comes to arbitration, mediation seems, unfortunately, to have been the poor relation. The Bill is an extraordinary step in the right direction to bring us into line with best international practice.

Broadly, Sinn Féin supports the Bill, albeit we have some concerns which we attempted to have addressed in the Dáil. We call on the Minister to ensure that as the legislation progresses in the Seanad, those modest and doable amendments will be made. Sinn Féin supports the Bill's general objective of promoting mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings with the potential to reduce legal costs and speed up the resolution of disputes. I am not sure the following even applies to the Minister who is newly in office, but his predecessor took on board some concerns raised by the Opposition. It is disappointing that the then Minister did not go so far, however, as to address the specific concerns Sinn Féin raised about domestic violence, which the Minister touched on in his opening contribution. I have no doubt the issue will arise as the Bill progresses through the House. We note that while the Bill rules out mediation where disputes pertain to the Domestic Violence Acts 1996 to 2011, it will not cover the scope of the new domestic violence legislation which is making its way through the House. Rather than simply excluding proceedings under the Domestic Violence Acts from the scope of the Bill, it would be of more use in situations where domestic violence is an issue but may not have been prosecuted. It is simply not appropriate for a solicitor to advise clients to attend mediation in cases of custody or access where there has been domestic violence. Abusers may attempt to bring forward mediation proceedings to prolong matters, which is one of the key concerns of those who have passed information to us.In a 2010 report on alternative dispute resolutions the Law Reform Commission stated they were not suitable where they involved proceedings under the domestic violence Acts. It suggested a broad wording to include situations where there are safety issues. That is what we are attempting to reflect in the amendment we tabled on Report Stage in the Dáil. We would also like the Bill to provide that a mediator, prior to commencing mediation, would make inquiries about whether there has been domestic abuse in the relationship. This was also advocated by those in the sector dealing with the effects of domestic violence and those who have helped people who have suffered abuse by a spouse or other relative. There is a possibility that victims of abuse could be pushed into mediation settings, which would be wholly inappropriate. These amendments reflect the concerns of people who have worked with victims. The Law Reform Commission has also made suggestions along these lines. I hope the Minister will accept them on that basis.  As an addition to these amendments we would also like to see training provided for solicitors, barristers and mediators to give them the skills to identify domestic violence and work with abusers and victims. If the Minister will not accept there should be no scope for mediation in domestic violence cases, it would be of benefit if he will ensure there is training at the very least.  Another matter which is of importance to me is provision for mediation services through the Irish language. There are thousands of Irish speakers who would like to use Irish as their language on a daily basis in the courts and in justice matters but they simply cannot because officialdom does not consider it important enough to make provision for. This must be addressed on the next Stages of the Bill. The Minister will know, given his previous brief, that it is reminiscent of the Administration of Justice (Language) Act (Ireland) 1737, which pertains in the North. It is a penal law that is still on the statute books in the North and prohibits the use of Irish in the courts. We should not allow anywhere on this island, but in particular in this jurisdiction, a prohibition, delay or inability to use the Irish language in the courts.  We must also look at allowing for the recognition of mediation services in the Six Counties for the purposes of this Bill. It will come as no surprise to the Minister. He will understand the nuances of it. There may be people who are geographically located in the Twenty-six Counties but who will find it easier to access mediation across the Border. It is imperative that no block is placed on recognising those mediation processes and that no bar is placed on Northern mediation practitioners from providing a service in this jurisdiction. It is particularly pertinent, given the prospect of Brexit.  The Minister may not agree, but I know that he will understand the nuances of the issues for people who live along the Border. I hope the Bill can reflect and assist them in enabling the very worthwhile and important mediation services that this Bill provides for.  Sin mo mhéid.

I wish him every success. I will begin by welcoming the legislation and expressing my support for the State in trying to facilitate the resolution of disputes outside the court system wherever possible and appropriate. Such mechanisms are welcome in terms of reducing the burden on the court system but also because a mediation setting can be a less formal and adversarial environment for disputes to be considered which will often allow for a more positive outcome for all parties involved. It is my experience that many people who do not have regular, positive interactions with the criminal justice system, particularly if they are from a disadvantaged, minority or marginalised background, can often feel intimidated by the prospect of a formal judicial adjudication. Any attempt to provide greater access to mediation services for the general population should be welcomed.  There are many positive aspects to the Bill, but I will raise an issue that was raised in the Dáil by Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh, that is, the danger of initiating mediation in family law cases where domestic violence may have occurred. In section 3 domestic violence cases are exempted from these provisions. It is clear recognition by the Minister that these procedures are entirely inappropriate where domestic abuse has occurred, which is very welcome. My concern is that circumstances may arise where domestic violence may have occurred but no formal allegation was made or prosecution filed; therefore, solicitors may recommend that partners enter into mediation with their former abuser. This is a major concern and a number of NGOs are working in this area such as Women's Aid which others have mentioned. I read over the Report Stage debate in the Dáil and the Minister's response on the issue was that because mediation was a voluntary process, a party who had experienced domestic abuse would not be forced to engage with the process if he or she did not wish to. The Minister also made the extraordinary claim that if we were to make a change, women could simply claim they had been the victim of domestic abuse such that their solicitors would not have to provide them with information on mediation services. That is a separate matter. My concern is that by exempting domestic violence cases from these procedures we acknowledge they are wholly unsuitable environments for domestic violence issues to be raised, yet in family law cases where domestic violence has occurred but charges have not been filed we are potentially allowing a situation where women will engage with former abusers. The only safeguard against this is the woman herself putting her hand up to say she does not want to do it. It is not acceptable. What about cases of vulnerable women who might be intimidated by the prospect of formal court proceedings and may feel that mediation is their only option? We could be forcing a woman to engage with an abuser. Nowhere in the mediation process is there an obligation on any party to ascertain whether domestic violence is a factor in the mediation process. There should be such an obligation. Sinn Féin tabled two amendments to this effect in the Dáil. It would comprehensively address the issues I have raised. Committee Stage amendment No. 8 would create an obligation on the mediator to at least make inquiries with the parties as to whether domestic abuse has occurred in the relationship. Will the Minister consider tabling amendments in the same spirit? We have a busy schedule this week and we all want to get this Bill passed before the recess but we need to consider this vital issue and I appreciate the Minister's thoughts on it. I will introduce amendments to this effect if the Minister does not. As someone who has used mediation services in the family law courts, I found them very positive, but I was not in fear for myself, my children or my life; therefore, I was able to engage positively and actively in a healthy manner in that mediation. One part that always stood out to me with regard to women going to mediation as an alternative to the courts system, especially in the family law courts in Dolphin House, was that there was no enforcement of agreements. Women would enter into negotiations, often around access to their children and maintenance, but there was no way to enforce agreements. It can be a tiring and disheartening process to go through, to have to come back and then end up in the court system. What are the Minister's thoughts on an enforcement element in mediation?
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	101	I welcome the Minister and wish him every success in his new role. As a practising solicitor, I am a little concerned at the views expressed on this area by some people. I think the Minister will agree with me. Solicitors do everything possible to find a resolution to a dispute. If one looks at cases listed for hearing, one will find that in the vast majority of cases people try to get them settled. When it comes to the day of the hearing, one will find that anything up to 70% to 80% of cases listed for a particular day will settle on the day because people will know they are leaving it in the hands of a third party to make the final decision. Those involved in the legal profession make every effort to bring resolution to a dispute at a very early stage and try to close the file and move on to the next item. From my experience of an arbitration matter in which I was involved, because it was the contract our clients had entered into, we had to go through the arbitration process rather than the litigation process. After 30 days, we were still on the first witness. For 11 days there was a dispute about whether there was one contract or five. I welcome the Bill. It is important, but it is also important that it not be used as a delaying process. As I am very concerned about the Statute of Limitations where the time used for mediation is not counted, it is most important that the system not be abused.There should be no loophole that allows a party to use the mediation process to delay the entire procedure. I have been involved in litigation and one matter in which I have been involved has been ongoing for 16 years. One of the parties has used the court system extensively and that has involved everything up to judicial review of a Circuit Court judge to the High Court and on to the Supreme Court, knowing at the time that there was a delay of up to four years in getting a hearing in the Supreme Court. There are people who can and will use a process to suit themselves. If we find four or five years after passing this Bill into law that it must be tweaked, we should be prepared to do that. Overall, I welcome the Bill. It is important that an experienced person conducts the mediation of disputes. I refer back to the arbitration matter I was dealing with, where we found that the person dealing with it was not of real assistance in bringing forward early decisions on questions that were being asked. In arbitration it is important that the arbitrator is able to bring people along and ensure there is compromise at each step so an overall agreement can be reached. My colleague, Deputy Ardagh, raised the cost of mediation. One of the cost issues, especially with mediation, is the cost of booking independent facilities. In the arbitration to which I referred, an arbitration centre was booked along with adjoining rooms. After 30 days there was a huge bill. It is important that this not be abused in the case of mediation, whereby one of the parties is eventually forced to arrive at an agreement that is far less than to what that party would have been entitled. All of these issues must be taken into account when dealing with mediation to ensure people are dealt with in a fair and proper manner. I thank the Minister and the Department for bringing the legislation forward.

I also welcome the opportunity to debate the Bill. The Labour Party supports this important Bill. We are conscious that it is overdue, as others said. We have been working on it for a long time. Looking back through my files I saw that I had addressed the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators about the Bill in April 2015. The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I was then a member, had conducted pre-legislative scrutiny and held hearings on the heads of the Bill in March 2012, some three years prior to that. I believe Senator Conway was a member of that committee also. It has taken a long time to progress it, but it is welcome to have it before us. It is unfortunate, perhaps, that we are rushing to deal with it in two days, given how long the gestation period has been, but we are all conscious that it must be supported and passed. When the hearings were held by the joint justice committee, all stakeholders gave evidence, including the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution, Family Mediation Ireland, Dublin Solicitors Bar Association, the Irish Commercial Mediation Association and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland. They all stressed the importance of having legislation in place to underpin what is already quite an extensive ongoing practice of mediation in this jurisdiction. They made the point, which I founding striking, that Ireland could and should become an important centre for international dispute resolution and that the introduction of comprehensive legislation underpinning the practice of mediation would be an important step towards achieving that goal. It has a huge economic benefit for the country. It was agreed in the programme for Government in 2011 that the Government would support, encourage and facilitate the use of mediation. We are also aware of the Law Reform Commission report of 2010 which also fed into this Bill. The Minister has outlined the purpose of the Bill. The hope is the Bill will bring about reductions in legal costs, speed up the resolution of disputes and, importantly, relieve stress for parties involved in court proceedings. Another point stressed by the bodies that made submissions to the hearings I mentioned was that it would provide greater access to justice for people in a more affordable and effective way, notwithstanding the practical points made by Senator Colm Burke about delays in the system and the important points raised by Women's Aid and so eloquently by Senator Ruane as to whether mediation is appropriate where domestic violence is alleged. Section 3 precludes mediation in domestic violence cases but, as Women's Aid points out, there are other proceedings where domestic violence might be alleged which are not caught by the exemption in that section. I believe there is provision in the Bill under which the Minister may consider other types of proceedings in which mediation would not be appropriate. Clearly, as the Law Reform Commission acknowledged in 2010, where the safety of a party or their children is at risk the dispute, even if it is not directly a domestic violence dispute, is not suitable for mediation. That must be kept under review, even if the Bill is not to be amended.

We must be cognisant that mediation will not be appropriate in all proceedings. Ruling out domestic violence proceedings specifically, as section 3 does, might not catch all the proceedings in which safety is at risk. I wish to raise some other points that emerged from the committee's hearings. Those who are involved currently in running commercial workplace and family mediation welcome the legislation, but they made the point that there is a problem with the lack of public awareness about the option of mediation and that it must be highlighted. Section 14 provides that solicitors, prior to commencing civil proceedings, must advise a client to consider using mediation. That is welcome, but the justice committee recommended strengthening the duty. There should be an obligation to make particular information available to potential litigants, from the Courts Service, for example, even prior to consultation of the solicitor.  Under section 16, the court, of its own volition, can invite parties to attend mediation. Again, however, that is at a point where the case has already gone to the court. The issue of raising awareness about the prospect or possibility of mediation even before parties consult solicitors with a view to litigation could be examined. Some of it could be done simply through a public awareness campaign. It does not require legislation. A second issue emerged from the justice committee's hearings. It was addressed by the Minister and is addressed in section 12 and the Schedule to the Bill. It came through strongly to the committee that the lack of awareness about mediation is compounded by the fact that in Ireland there is no single list or register of mediators. Anybody can put up a sign describing himself or herself as a mediator. That is a concern for all those involved in the practice of mediation. Potential clients have no way of knowing if the person they approach as a mediator is, in fact, trained as such or is following a particular code of conduct. The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland run training for mediators. There is extensive training on offer, but the issue of a national or central register is a problem. Section 12 seeks to address that issue. I am glad that it is included as a result of our hearing, but it is aspirational in nature. Can the Minister state when he envisages being able to put it into effect? He said that there must be evidence that a particular institute or body is sufficiently representative and so forth, but what hoops or hurdles must be gone through to get to that stage? The Schedule sets out a clear list of the important functions a national body or mediation council would carry out. Given that we have acknowledged in the legislation the need for a council to carry out those functions, should we not go a little further in the Bill rather than just stating the aspiration of having a central council? A related issue raised in the committee's hearings was the absence of adequate regulation for mediators and, in particular, the lack of a central system of redress or complaint for a client who has problems with an individual mediator or the process. Again, a mediation council would address that issue. However, in section 9 there is provision for codes of practice, which will go some way towards addressing it. The confidentiality clause in section 10 is very important. It is also something that was stressed to us during the committee's hearings. A significant issue in practice is the withdrawal of a mediator. Again, it was raised with us and is dealt with in section 6. Some of the people who made submissions said the provision in subsection (6) appeared to oblige mediators to give reasons if they withdrew from mediation.Mediators raised with us the point that they believed this might not be in accordance with best practice and that it should be possible to withdraw without giving reasons. These are some of the issues that will arise as the Bill comes into effect. It is very welcome that it is coming into effect. On Committee Stage in the Dáil, the Minister introduced a new Part 6, dealing with family mediation, and amendments to relevant legislation. Some of the delay has been over the drafting of Part 6 and consultation with bodies on the idea of a mediation council. I tabled questions to the Department about this in recent years. It is certainly very welcome to see the Bill even after these long delays and to be able to raise these points.

I attended many meetings in Brussels, Malta and Sicily and noted the work he did in preparing Ireland for Brexit which must be recognised and for which I thank him. I wish him well in his tough post in the Department of Justice and Equality. No doubt we will meet in the coming period. I am delighted to see this Bill in the House and compliment the Minister on introducing it. I have a couple of small issues. My colleague Senator Bacik just dealt with one of them, the fact that anybody can stick a sign outside the door stating "Mediator". In my time in the trade union movement, particularly while I was president of the union, I always believed that where people spoke to one another, there was a chance to kill off a problem and to bring in mediators quickly. Sometimes, however, we saw the employer go for the cheap option of bringing in a retired principal who would understand the situation and people. That is why the establishment of the council is vital. People say we have too many quangos, which may be true, but this is one quango that would be well justified. I hear people talking about the Bar Council. One of the first things I did when elected was a Senator was to visit the Bar Council. I went down to the Law Library and met its members. I spoke about the need for them to put in place mediation training for many of the young barristers who were probably finding it hard to make a living. There is a considerable amount of mediation work available. I agree with my colleague Senator Bacik that we could put ourselves front and centre as a mediation centre for international disputes. I will not impede the Bill going through the House, but I urge the Minister to consider immediately the establishment of the council as soon as the Bill is passed. It would be work well done. Professional training needs to be underpinned. We need to be sure it is not just a matter of some fellow who has a bit of experience down through the years. We need to have professional mediators put in place. When president of the Teachers Union of Ireland, I encountered a particular issue which required mediation. It took 15 months to get two men to stand beside each other and shake hands. That was a major achievement. The mediator involved was an incredible character, as one would have realised if one had known the case. I will not get into it here. I ask the Minister to ensure a council will be put in place, that it will set standards for mediators, that there will be compulsory continuous professional development available for mediators and that the council will be professional. Regarding the Statute of Limitations, already mentioned by Senator Colm Burke, I would not like to see mediation continuing indefinitely. Senator Colm Burke was talking about periods of two years, 16 years and all sorts of times. If one enters into mediation, there should be a closing-off time. The idea that it might go on forever is one I am sure the Minister will be considering.  Overall, I compliment the Minister on the Bill which I hope will be passed in the next couple of days as it is badly needed. I thank the Minister for taking the time to come here.

I wish him the very best in his new brief. Mediation is not a new concept. It has been in operation across various sectors in the State, as has been said, and it is an appropriate mechanism for various parties to arrange mutually acceptable solutions in different types of row or dispute. The Bill is very welcome. It is a long time in the works, as has been said. We have accorded ourselves the reputation of being a litigious nation. I do not have the evidence to prove it, but it seems that we are quick to acquire the services of solicitors when seeking to rectify wrongs or perceived wrongs in civil matters. I hope the Bill can help to remove some of the impulsiveness and drama witnessed during some civil proceedings and will allow for more measured ways of addressing disputes from the start before they escalate into intractable Bleak House-type situations of the kind described by Senator Colm Burke, lasting up to 16 years. The resolving or circumnavigation of any intractable, stressful, financially crippling legal issues through appropriate recourse to mediation is very welcome. By directing lawyers to advise their clients to consider mediation first as a method of resolving disputes, I hope the current overwhelming civil case load in the court system can be reduced, particularly as mediation becomes increasingly regarded as an acceptable and established way of resolving conflict among potential litigants, confidentially in many cases. I hope litigation will become more expedient as a route for people and that it will prove to be cost-effective in reality. Much time and energy are wasted in court on issues that could better be resolved and disposed of in mediation. The Bill will mean a solicitor or possibly a barrister in the future must make a statutory declaration that he or she advised clients to consider mediation as a means of dealing with a dispute that is the subject of proposed proceedings. Solicitors must also provide their client with information on mediation services. This is a relatively innovative addition to the current civil legal framework.  I hope the Bill will have a positive effect on the way people communicate in personal arguments among themselves. I hope it will create in society generally a culture of compromise, in the good sense of the word, that has been absent until now. It must be stated, however, that while the concept of mediation is great in theory, its applicability will vary in practice from case to case. Many aggrieved would-be litigants will still want their day in court and to have their costs fully paid. This relatively short Bill has 23 sections and I believe it is flexible and fair overall. Section 6 provides that participation in mediation will be voluntary at all times and allows for the withdrawal from the process by the parties involved and also by the mediator. It also guarantees that independent legal advice can be availed of during mediation. I wonder whether section 7(b) pertaining to the agreement to mediate is too general or whether it could do with some additional wording. It states that prior to the commencement of mediation, a document should be signed by the parties and the mediator regarding the terms of reference for the mediation. The section uses the wording “manner in which the fees and costs of the mediation will be paid”. Has the existing wording the potential to be problematic? Will people who have never engaged in a mediation process before be nervous or perhaps unsure of what to expect and therefore unsure as to what a justifiable amount to be paid would be? I remember when, as a barrister starting off, I was invited to conduct a mediation. It never came to pass. I went to a senior counsel in the Law Library, a person known for his affability and experience in the area of mediation and asked him how much I should charge for my role. He sat down, looked at me judiciously and asked me what I thought myself. I quickly realised he did not want to give me an answer of his own making and that he wanted to avoid the question. Very often, the question of costs is one that people want to avoid in advance. I wonder whether it should be the case that the required document would provide for the manner in which the fees and costs of the mediation would be paid, to whom, by whom and by when. Would this add more certainty to stipulations regarding payments for mediation which themselves could become a very contentious issue? I am conscious I am out of time. I do not want to hold up this Bill. It is very welcome. I commend the Minister on brining it before the House. I hope it will lead to serving the public well, doing people good and helping them to avoid unnecessarily costly and stressful legal proceedings by providing ever more for a better way of dealing with their disputes.

I acknowledge the broad welcome of Seanadóirí of all parties and none for the Bill which I hope we can advance. Notwithstanding the beckoning summer vacation, I hope we might be in a position to conclude the debate before the end of the week.I hope that before the end of the week we might be in a position to conclude the debate. A number of issues have been raised which were also well aired in the Dáil and to which we will return between now and the completion of the debate.  A submission on the Bill made by Women's Aid was circulated to all Members, on foot of which, four recommendations were suggested for inclusion in the Bill. There are a number of reasons amendments were not accepted. They were not accepted on the basis that the Bill already provided that it should not apply to proceedings taken under the domestic violence code, for reasons I outlined. Similarly, it is important that throughout the debate we acknowledge that the process covered by the Bill is voluntary. That is made clear in the definition in section 2 in which it is outlined that the mediator's role will be "to assist the parties" to bring about a resolution of the dispute. That will be a matter entirely for the parties. There will be no enforced settlement or duress on the part of anybody involved; it will remain solely a voluntary process for the parties. The issue became clear in the course of the contributions of Seanadóirí. I compliment Senator Martin Conway, in particular, on his comments. He pointed out that mediation offered a less adversarial arena within which matters in dispute could be addressed. Mediation can be speedier and offer an alternative to court proceedings and, of course, there is the issue of costs, notwithstanding the point made by an Seanadóir Rónán Mullen. I hope the Whips will acknowledge the fact that Senator Catherine Ardagh and her party, Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile and his party, Senator Ivana Bacik and her party and Senator Martin Conway, as spokesman for my party, have all acknowledged the importance of proceeding with this legislation with a view to having it enacted at the earliest opportunity. I hope we can do so. I acknowledge the points raised by Seanadóirí Niall Ó Donnghaile, Lynn Ruane and Ivana Bacik about issues they felt should have been included in the legislation. I hope that in the next couple of days we might have an opportunity to deal with them in more detail as we proceed towards enactment of the legislation. I hope that might be done in the next few days, but, of course, I am in the hands of this assembly.

The process of obtaining planning permission takes time, reflecting the importance of getting the location and design of new development right. Once permission is granted, it normally lasts for five years to enable the relevant development to be built out. However, due to the economic recession of recent years and the resulting downturn in construction activity and slow pace of sales, many approved housing developments could not be built out within the timeframe of their original permissions. We discussed this last December in this House. This is the case even where some of these benefitted from an initial five-year extension of duration, which is already facilitated under the Planning Acts. Recognising these extraordinary economic and market conditions and to avoid time-consuming and pointless repeat applications for planning permission at a time of unprecedented housing need, pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland committed the Government to amending planning legislation to temporarily allow for a second extension of duration of planning permissions over the period of the action plan to 2021. Section 28 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, that is, the 2016 Act, was originally drafted to amend section 42 of the main Act and address the extension of duration provisions. Specifically, section 28 of the 2016 Act provides, under section 28(1), a permanent change to section 42 of the 2000 Act, providing that extensions of duration would no longer apply where environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment was required in respect of the original planning permission. This is to bring the planning code fully into line with EU law requirements. Under section 28(2), a temporary change is being made to section 42 of the 2000 Act, providing that a second extension of duration of planning permission could be approved for a development of 20 or more homes in certain circumstances and where development had substantially commenced within the original permission period. It was always intended to commence these provisions separately, as the first was drafted in response to EU requirements. As is the norm with such new legislative requirements, there needs to be a transitional period for practical arrangements to be made to meet them. Developers need time to consider and comply with the new EU law requirements, and, as the case may be, apply for an extension of duration or a new planning permission. This is the reason we are not commencing this provision immediately but expect to do so by the end of this year.  The second provision is more urgent. If a second extension of duration is required to deliver housing that is in short supply, the Government is anxious that this be acted on as soon as possible. However, owing to the legal construction of section 28 with these two separate provisions, as I have outlined, legal advice received indicates that it is not possible to specifically commence the second provision without also commencing the first. Accordingly, the Bill before the House today seeks to allow the Government to commence this second provision separately and without delay.  Another reason to enact the Bill before the House quickly is to address a further issue that came to light during consideration of amendments to the 2016 Act during the debates on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 which is currently on Report Stage in the Dáil. Some housing providers are not able to avail of a second extension of duration in cases where the development had substantially commenced but had done so within the period of the extended planning permission, that is, after year five, as opposed to during the original five-year planning permission period. During discussions on the Bill, the Government tabled amendments and signalled that it would be considering other changes in the 2016 Bill, taking account of the constructive and helpful views from Opposition Members. The Government is eager to facilitate as broad a cohort of house builders to be able to avail of this temporary flexibility to deliver as much new and permitted housing stock into the market as early as possible. However, recognising that the 2016 Bill will not be enacted until the autumn, it has moved decisively to bring these changes into effect as soon as possible. This is to minimise delays and provide certainty for developers, their financiers and planning authorities. The provisions before the House are, therefore, not new, but are, in fact, simplified and allow for greater flexibility for eligible permissions seeking a further extension. We discussed this issue during the debate in December and the need for this. Most people, while they had other issues with that Bill at the time, were quite supportive of this situation to allow common sense to prevail with respect to planning applications that were moving through the system. I will briefly go through the provisions in the Bill. Section 1 proposes to delete section 28(2)(a) of the 2016 Act and substitute new text to address the issues above and enable separate commencements to the different parts of section 28. Section 1 also extends the opportunity for second durations of permission to those developments whose permissions have expired, or are due to expire, regardless of whether the developments commenced during their initial period of permission, or during the first extension period. Section 2 contains standard provisions of a general nature, dealing with such matters as Short Title, collective citation and construction. As the Bill contains no commencement provision, the enacted provisions will come into force upon the date of signature of the President.  While I appreciate that consideration of such a provision would normally make its way through the legislative process in the traditional manner, we do not have the luxury of waiting for the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which will extend into the autumn. There are many issues related to that Bill that Members will wish to discuss at length. Rather than trying to rush the taking of that Bill last week, it was important that we separate out the most urgent amendment, which is what we are discussing. We are aware there are a substantial number of commenced housing projects, possibly between 50 and 100, throughout the country that could be further built out without further delay, were the amending legislation and relevant commencement arrangements to be expedited. If not, that building activity may be obliged to cease. We have heard of cases where people have been told they would have leave a site as their time is nearly up because the planning permission in due to expire. That is what has happened with housing developments. Some of those houses are badly needed. Some of them involve social housing developments and others involve private housing developments. Also, many people who plan to build houses this summer are of the understanding that we passed this measure last December. They do not get to follow all the ins and outs of what we do or how we do our business here. They assumed that when we had the debate before Christmas that this measure is in law already. Some people think their permissions are up to date and they are making plans to build in the months ahead. Therefore, it was important that we got this dealt with. As soon as it became clear from scheduling arrangements that the Oireachtas would not be able to conclude its deliberations on the 2016 Bill before the recess, the Government acted immediately to seek to progress this key provision by means of this fast-track stand-alone Bill. We did not want to rush consideration of the wide range of issues in that Bill.They include the important proposals on the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator which require the careful scrutiny of this House. That planning Bill took a long time on Committee Stage also. I know that people are genuinely interested in that Bill. It is an important one. It also reflects some of the results of the tribunal and it is important we give it proper consideration and time. This Bill ensures the affected housing providers who have substantially commenced development in an extended planning permission period are able to apply for a second extension of duration without the need to cease work while they apply for a new permission. It also means those with projects that had substantially commenced within their original planning permission period would be able to avail of a second extension. It is important to note that this provision will apply only to projects that have substantially commenced and will not apply to projects that have not commenced. This is to discourage the hoarding of planning permissions without going ahead and delivering homes. I know much of the discussion would have happened here in December and in the Dáil subsequent to that in the past week, where this was discussed. There is a fear of hoarding and we do not want to do anything to encourage more hoarding. This is the opposite. It is to try to get people to bring forward their land and to activate it as quickly as they possibly can. As facilitated under the original provisions of the 2016 Act, any qualifying permitted development that had expired between the publication of Rebuilding Ireland on 19 July 2016 and the commencement date of this provision will still be eligible to apply for a second extension. I commend the Bill to the House. I thank Members on all sides for facilitating this important matter at short notice. I know that we have had conversations with many about this and appreciate people's efforts in the past two weeks to try to facilitate this Bill to come through to be discussed and debated in a common-sense manner, which I think is important to doing our job here. Everyone has issues we have to debate, but it is also important that we be effective on the ground where there are people who are on site, have their jobs and are working. They want to continue to finish those houses and we have to facilitate that as well as we can, but it requires proper planning to do so.

I assure him, first, that Fianna Fáil will support the Bill and its passage through the Oireachtas at great speed. We have all, at different points throughout the past year, made clear that the idea of putting through all Stages of any Bill is not a good precedent. It is not a good idea to ram legislation through, but we understand the necessity for it in this particular situation. That said, it is hard to believe we are in a situation where this Bill has to come to us at all. It seems that we have to resolve matters which arise from a technical drafting error that should have been spotted when the legislation was being passed before Christmas. Without this provision to extend, as the Minister of State has said, there are between 50 and 100 projects - we seem to have a figure of around 70 - of more than 20 units which had been granted permission in advance of 2009 which, if this were not passed now, would have to stop construction, the sites would have to be left, and people would have to be laid off, all of which would further reduce the very limited supply of housing of all types, as the Minister of State outlined. It is a time when we need houses more than ever and we have a situation where it seems we have to rush this through because of something that was not spotted earlier. It could be argued that the amount of time we spend discussing judicial appointments or other things is the reason we do not get adequate time to deal with this kind of thing and we cannot lay the blame for that with a Fine Gael Minister. It is important that this be done and that we do it as expeditiously and as quickly as possible because we do not want to see a reduction in supply or people being laid off when we need construction workers more than ever. I would like to hear from the Minister of State, or from his officials through him, what happened with the various Acts around Christmas and why we have to rush this through now. What happened to the planning Bill around Christmas when we sat until 22 or 23 December to deal with it and which we supported? Why did a situation like this arise? I support the concept that it is a use it or lose it provision. We understand the economic situation, but we do not want people to hoard planning permission and we do not want people to think that they can get planning permission in a particular period and then keep sitting on it as house prices go up. It is equally important that, where there are extensions of planning permissions and a county development plan changes and introduces better or improved standards, people should not be able to renew their planning permission. I know that was not the case in the past and that if the development plan changed standards, people would often be refused the permission to build things that had been permitted under an old development plan but were no longer allowed under the new development plan. At this stage, Rebuilding Ireland is almost a year old and progress has been relatively limited. We can talk about reports and what is in the pipeline and while I know houses cannot be built overnight, we are nonetheless a long way from what was forecast and projected a year ago. I would like to hear from the Minister of State what progress he is making or he feels can be made in the short and medium term. Figures came out yesterday that showed the most expensive areas to buy houses. Two of the top five in the country are in my former electoral area of Stillorgan, Foxrock and Mount Merrion. There are huge prices for houses that are not necessarily enormous. It is the issue of supply versus demand. A relatively tiny number of houses are available with many people chasing them, as a result of which the house prices go up, leaving people who are not necessarily wealthy with very large mortgages and a very long time to service them. We now have figures for rents that are higher than they ever were. They are higher than they were at the peak of the boom in 2008, with the average rent for a one-bed place in Dublin now at 69% of average monthly earnings. These are all issues that need to be addressed. We are facilitating the Minister of State's Bill, but there is much more work to be done. I would appreciate the Minister of State's response about how it has happened that we are having to pass this legislation quickly and an assurance that this behaviour of rushing things through will not happen again.
#VictorBoyhan	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-party	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-dob	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	114	I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. There is a housing crisis. We know that there is a shortage of supply of social and affordable housing and housing generally on the market. The Government published Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. That is the policy. Therefore, it has to be pursued, not blindly by us but ultimately by the Government because it is its plan. We discussed it at great length and the reality is we must not see it in isolation from the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. There is a huge amount of legislation on proper planning and sustainable development. It does not all just spring out. This has always been there. We have a good planning code and a good planning system. We have 31 planning authorities that are vigilant. My understanding - I am open to correction - is that this legislation does not limit or stop a planning authority from giving a two-year restriction of a second extension of an extension, if the Minister of State knows what I mean. He might confirm this because it is important. It does not take that discretion from the local planning authorities, which is very important, because we hold a great deal of hope about the situation. I have to say on behalf of the planning authorities with which I have dealt, since I hold them in high esteem, that they are critical to the work and the function and that we have an independent appeals process in certain places. Coming back to the issue, while that is an important point to make, the target of Rebuilding Ireland is 47,000 social houses. It has taken longer than most would have envisaged to bed down, but it is the policy and, in time, we in the House will be holding the Government to account for the next roll-out in the next eight or nine months and how it progresses. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and we are regularly exercised by the delivery of social and affordable housing. In fairness to the Minister, the Minister of State and departmental officials, they constantly attend and engage. I acknowledge the importance of that process too. Extending the time for house building makes sense. For that reason I will support the Minister of State's legislative proposals that are before the House. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State, Deputy English, are ultimately responsible for delivery of the housing element of the programme. This is about a second extension for planning permissions over and above the first extension. The Bill seeks to ensure the extensions to planning permissions are legislatively provided for in a timely manner, which is very important, and allow house builders to complete unfinished housing estates under certain circumstances and conditions. It is not a blanket open permission but is under circumstances and specific conditions. There is discretion within the planning authority, which is very important. During the financial crisis we know that construction companies had to fold up, walk off sites and not complete them. They should never have been completed in some cases because they were not good enough, but there are issues and we have to accept the reality and live with it that there were issues which meant that developments did not get under way in a timely manner. That is a fact. Our objective must always be to deliver more housing at every level in the market. Therefore, the Bill is to be welcomed. As a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, I have been made aware in recent times that there are approximately 70 to 75 developments - the Minister of State referred to between 50 and 100 - throughout this country that are awaiting the commencement this legislation before obtaining planning permission. People are waiting and ready and want either start or recommence work. That is an important point. When we discussed all of this, it was pointed out that there would be further amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to extend the duration of planning permissions that had already benefited from a first extension of duration. The Bill is, therefore, giving effect to something that we had discussed previously. It is not all new to us. Rebuilding Ireland has a deadline to 31 December 2021. I want reassurances on this because this is something with which I have a bit of a problem. Am I correct in thinking there will be no further extensions and that this will die at that point? I want reassurances that there will be no extensions after 2021, which is the deadline for the completion of Rebuilding Ireland. This is important. Could the Minister of State clarify the position? I would really like to hear the Minister of State's views on planning authorities' discretion to only extend it by two years. Is that an option? The Minister of State might reassure us on that point. The bottom line is that we need more housing. The delivery of more housing in every sector across the country is necessary in order to address a housing crisis. That is why I will be supporting the Bill. I am aware that there are a number of amendments. I have read those amendments and have no difficulty with any of them. I stand open to correction that all of the matters to which they relate are adequately dealt with in legislation, be it building control legislation, the Planning and Development Acts and various other mechanisms. I am particularly drawn to the point relating to building controls, planning and development and climate mitigation and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. All of these areas are adequately covered. If I thought they were not adequately covered, I would be supporting the amendments. I do not think it is necessary to support them. I am supportive of the principle behind them but I would like to hear whether they are already provided for or whether safeguards and mechanisms are already in place that render the amendments unnecessary. I would like to get the Minister of State's feedback on that issue also.

This is an important day. We are trying to put legislation in place that will be very important for the Rebuilding Ireland initiative and society. What we hope to do is ensure that we can maximise the potential in every site the throughout Ireland. We are all aware of sites that have not been finished. We now have an opportunity to ensure these sites will be finished in a timely and orderly manner. That is appropriate. The second extension is something that has been sought for many years. It has been talked about by many local authorities. I know that it is limited to developments of over 20 homes, but it has been an issue for some time. The original extension was introduced in 2011 and was very positive. It gave people who were under pressure the opportunity to stall their developments and keep them alive. We are now saying that if the developments are starting, they have the opportunity to finish the development. It is positive legislation that will deliver housing as part of Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland. I compliment the Minister on bringing it forward. The larger issue is supply. How can we increase supply throughout the country? This is about trying to ensure that housing is built. This is a part of it, as is planning permission. Ensuring that planning permissions do not die is part of it. Ensuring finance is available is another key part. Another matter we need to consider relates to who is going to build houses. This is becoming a major issue across the country. Unemployment is falling rapidly and heading below 7%. Trying to get staff to ensure we can build these houses is very important. It is said we need six men to build ten houses in a year. We do not have them. I have been talking to builders in Cork. Their biggest issue is finance. They have issues regarding planning permission but trying to get qualified tradesmen to deliver the rebuilding project is becoming a huge problem. We have lost so many. Some have come back but others have not. That will probably be the biggest struggle we will have over the next few months and years in the context of ensuring that we can get the supply up and running. The Minister and the Department are doing their utmost to ensure they have opened up sites. This is another initiative. We have seen the initiative regarding bringing large planning permissions straight to An Bord Pleanála, which indicates that large master plan sites can get through the process faster, so there are major initiatives in the Rebuilding Ireland strategy which must be welcomed. I am confident that it will deliver. My one worry is the staffing element. Based on what I am hearing, my great fear is that the number of qualified tradesmen - the men we need to deliver these plans we are making today - is limited. We must do something to ensure we have the potential to deliver the plans we are making.

Ag deireadh na bliana seo caite bhí muid ag déileáil leis an mBille um fhorbairt tithíochta. Bhí muid deireanach go maith sa mbliain agus dar liom féin gur cuireadh i bhfad an iomarca brú ar an mBille a ritheadh roimh an Nollaig. Feictear dom go bhfuil an fhadhb chéanna againn leis an mBille seo. Ní bhfuair muid féin ná ár gcomhgleacaithe sá Dáil dóthain ama le dul tríd na hathruithe uilig ar an bpríomhacht. I welcome the Minister of State, but I have concerns about the way the Bill is being rushed through the Houses. I do not believe this is the way to do business. My colleagues in the Dáil and I are deeply frustrated by the lack of time to scrutinise and examine the complex planning issues in the Bill. We are dealing with a Bill that seeks to close a loophole in the legislative process which could put a stop to planned developments or developments already underway. Therefore, ample time should always be given to legislation seeking to close a loophole in order to ensure that another one is not opened. When this legislation was before the Dáil, Deputy Ó Broin wrote to the Minister to ask whether he and his Department were aware of individual developments where house construction might have to cease because of this legislative difficulty. After The Sunday Business Post reported that approximately 75 developments could be affected, Deputy Ó Broin again wrote to the Minister to repeat that simple request for information. It would have been valuable to share said information with Members of the Oireachtas who, after all, are dealing with an already highly complicated planning and development environment. I understand that at least two social housing developments, one of which is being progressed by Túath Housing, could be affected. If the Minister is asking us to take him at his word while working through the legislation in this way, it would have been fair for him to share the information held by the officials in his office. It is my understanding there is a problem with the process relating to the first extension of planning permissions. When extensions are sought, there is a sense among elected representatives and third parties that, in many local authority areas, it is a rubber-stamping exercise. Where substantial changes have happened in a development or in the environmental circumstances, it is very difficult for people to influence and engage in the first extension period regardless of whether the developer is responsible for the delay or has a bad track record of completing existing parts of a development. The intention is to ensure that if a developer is on site and only has a couple of months left but needs a year or two years, the development will not be stopped. However, as the Bill is drafted, someone could commence a development, for example, put in the foundations, to a significant degree and then pause or sit on it for a while. With house price inflation at 10%, it may be better for the developer to leave it for a period. There is a real possibility that a rogue or greedy developer, as opposed to the genuine developers this Bill is trying to help, could avail of this extension and meet the criteria to benefit from one year, two or three years of additional house price inflation. Will the Minister of State indicate the safeguards that are in place to ensure this will not be abused? How can he be sure people will not seek extensions merely to play the market? I am concerned that endless extensions granted across the State would lead to extended delays and increased house prices. A Sinn Féin amendment was accepted in the Dáil in respect of this matter - namely, that developers must provide a reason an extension to a permission is being sought. I would like to hear from the Minister of State that the Government will follow up on it. This is the second time we have dealt with fast-tracking legislation that is primarily for the benefit of private housing developments. There is a desperate need for the Department to come back with a similar set of proposals to fast-track social housing developments. The 18 to 24-month approval and procurement process is slowing the pace of social housing delivery to a level that is unacceptable.We are being told of the urgency of fixing this problem, but there is a huge problem with the State's delivery of social housing. It is taking far too long and the measures introduced by the former Minister are not having the desired impact on the ground or in speeding up the four-stage process. We need legislation that will ultimately move us from an 18 or 24-month approval process to a six or nine-month one-stage process. That would be eminently deliverable without compromising on standards or on the quality of accommodation. Ar an mhór-chuid, cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo ach caithfimid uilig béim a chur ar thógáil tithíochta sósialta. Má tá an tAire chun reachtaíocht a bhrú tríd na Tithe go tapaidh, caithfidh sé gach eolas atá aige a thabairt dúinne mar Bhaill de na Tithe.

The last time I spoke to him about housing was on 2 March when we were debating the introduction of a pilot scheme for affordable housing on the Irish Glass Bottle site. The Minister of State may remember the Commencement matter that we discussed. On that occasion I asked him for a pilot scheme and he responded that there was no need because work was well under way for a national scheme. I read last week in The Irish Times that up to 1,600 social units in Dublin city, in O'Devaney Gardens and St. Michael's Estate, for example, will be delayed because of the lack of legislation dealing with affordable housing. The article also mentioned the possibility of delaying progress on the 3,500 homes being developed on the Irish Glass Bottle site for the same reason. I find it very unfortunate that we are not seeing any emergency legislation being rushed through the House today to ensure these developments go ahead that will give affordable housing and affordable rental accommodation to people in this city. Where is that legislation? When will we see it rushed through this House? We are talking about legislation that would help real people with real jobs get real homes. Today we are seeing what is, by and large, rushed legislation for approximately 1,500 units. There is a supply issue throughout the country and I have no intention of blocking this Bill. The last time I heard language like "substantially commenced", however, was when the former Minister and Deputy Martin Cullen was bringing legislation through both Houses during the boom that prevented the delivery of the 20% quota for social and affordable housing. What he did on that occasion was to give exemptions to planned developments throughout the country that had substantially commenced without defining what that meant. My challenge to the Minister of State is to define what he means by "substantially commenced". Does it mean a hole in the ground? Does it mean that foundations have been laid, that the outer walls have been built or that the roof is on? Can we have a definition of "substantially commenced"? The Minister of State might also clarify what he means by something being an extension to planning permission. If developments are given planning permission without meeting the 10% social quota, can they then carry to on to completion without meeting this provision at all? Is this covered in the Bill? I can see that the departmental officials are quickly checking that matter. Is there any control over whether planning applications include infrastructure for storage and water? Are there safeguards to make the local authorities ensure this infrastructure is in place? What level of building quality will be stipulated? Health and safety has to be a concern for every Member of this House and building standards have changed over this period. To what regulation standards will these "substantially commenced" buildings be subject? Returning to my first point, I would like to know more about the 1,600 units on Dublin City Council land that are delayed because of the lack of the required legislation. Do we have to wait for October, November or December to see progress? Will it ultimately delay the Irish Glass Bottle site, which could potentially deliver up to 3,500 units? The Minister of State tells us that this particular Bill, which may deliver up to 1,500 units, is urgent. Where is his sense of urgency with regard to the larger sites I mention? Some clarity would certainly be helpful.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	118	I want to contribute to this debate for a number of reasons. First, the second time extension mentioned must be given on the basis that these units will be built. I would not like to see this being open to abuse if developers were to seek a second extension and then let their developments sit for five years. That is not on. I would like to discuss a second issue coming to the fore. I will give an example from my own area of Newport in north Tipperary. There is an estate in the town called Glencree, in front of which is a crane that has been left sitting there for the past five or six years. It has now gone rusty. Meanwhile the units that were to be in the front of the estate have still not been built; therefore, residents are driving through a wilderness to get their own home. These are people who put down hard-earned money to buy their house. This legislation has to be used to ensure houses are built. If they are not built, we need to ensure the sites will either be returned to green areas or given to someone else on which to build units. We cannot have a situation where developers apply for a time extension and then seek a change in design. This could see a development going from a reasonable standard to something substandard, leaving us with something that looks poor and is essentially the result of the developer looking to make a quick buck. I know how committed the Minister of State is to building units and houses. There is, however, a problem with the message. The message needs to go out loud and clear that money is available for local authorities to build social units. It is up to the local authorities to apply for this money and deal with the matter. We all know of situations where units that should have been built are not being built at the appropriate speed. A further issue is that the bureaucracy involved in approving these local authority funding applications is taking too long. Whether it is at council or Department level, this needs to be sorted out. There is also a need for a full audit of all land owned by local authorities. Perhaps this is ongoing. If these lands can be built on, they should be. Furthermore, they should be built on in a sustainable way. Large estates do not work; they are unsustainable and we do not want them. The local authorities should, in the main, be building social housing consistently throughout the country, but this is not happening consistently. A total of 255 units have been built or are under construction in my Limerick city area, for example. My final point concerns private housing. An activation fund has been put in place to open up areas to private development. What needs to be done, however, is to make it crystal clear that this funding will not be available to private developers unless they can give a value as to how much they will sell the affordable units for on the market. We cannot have public moneys going into housing developments without any knowledge of how much the affordable units will be sold for. What is required I think is an onus on local authorities to get on with the social building programme and an onus on private developers to either put up or shut up. With all of these sites lying idle, developers need either to build the units or sell the land in order that the units can be built at an affordable rate.

I thank all of the Senators who spoke for their contributions, with all of the colleagues who spoke on this matter in the Dáil last week.  The purpose of the Bill is twofold. The first purpose is to enable the immediate commencement of section 28(2) of the Planning and Development Housing and Residential Bill 2016 which was enacted on 23 December last year to allow housing providers to apply for a second extension of the duration of planning permissions. The second purpose is to broaden the qualifying circumstances within which a second extension of duration of planning permission for a substantially commenced development would be permitted.Under the Bill projects that commenced within an extended period are included as opposed to those in the initial planning permission period as was allowed for in the 2016 legislation. That was one of the key issues identified as an amendment. We also took legal advice since we had our debate here last December when we felt we could have moved ahead with this with regulation but the Attorney General strongly advised that it would have needed enabling legislation. That is why we had hoped to deal with it as an amendment in the bigger planning Bill coming through the Dáil but that would have taken too long. It was on the schedule on numerous occasions in April, May and June but it eventually became obvious to all that it would not get through either House in time and we could be caught over the summer with people who had to leave sites. That would be lunacy and would not be appropriate for anybody. It was not necessarily a technical error; it was probably a timing error, coupled with the strong legal advice. It would have added value to what we discussed in December. It was one of the Fianna Fáil Members who raised it during the discussion of the larger planning Bill in the Dáil.  The key issue for me and the Government is that we work with, and support, those that have substantially commenced badly needed housing development. It is key that they are developments that are moving and that developers show an intention of developing a site and not sitting back for five, six or ten years. This is to encourage people who have proved that they intend to build, have started or made significant progress and want to continue. There are people outside sites. Deputy Ó Broin asked for a list and we have asked for the list to be delivered to him. We will try to get that. I am aware of some sites, two of which are social housing. Others are genuinely cases where the people did not realise that their planning permission was not going to qualify. They assumed this Bill had passed. That is why the list will grow when we get full information. As soon as we have that we will give it to Senators. There were builders who thought they could go ahead and start work next week or the week after not realising that their permission expired six, seven or eight months ago. They assumed because we had a debate here that it had been passed. That is the way people think. It did not go through for all the reasons we have discussed. It is important to get that list. It is not just a technicality. In respect of the progress of Rebuilding Ireland, house building is one of the pillars and to increase the supply of housing we believe we are on track this year, based on the ESRI figures. There is some debate over what is a completed or finished house, with electricity connection and so on. Setting that aside, it is predicted that over 18,500 houses will be completed this year, maybe even more. The target for this year would have been around 18,000 in our plan and to get to 19,000 in 2020 and 2021. Some of these might have been started three or four years ago, but we are counting completions. We are ahead with that. All of the trends in respect of commencement and planning notices are coming on and they are right because they are up by between 38% and 45%. That would show the trends coming through for the next three or four years of housing completion. Our target is that a minimum of 25,000 houses will be completed per year by 2021. We will be ahead of that target. We recognise that we need to get to 28,000 or 29,000 and will do for some of those years. Since we published our plan the ESRI predicts that to stay ahead of demand we will need to 34,000 or 35,000 houses per year from 2021. We reckon we will have the system in a position to deliver at least 30,000 houses a year by 2020 or 2021. We will build on that figure thereafter.  I did not realise the Acting Chairman would cut me off after three minutes. Other questions were asked and I might get a chance later to answer them.

I think we are making progress with regard to Rebuilding Ireland. Compared with last year, there are now 10,000 houses in the social housing pipeline. They are not all on site, but over 2,000 are on site and being worked on. They were not there a year ago. That is progress. All of the trends are moving in the right direction and planning permission has been commenced. The infrastructural fund has been announced and individual projects are being worked on. We have identified over 800 sites in State ownership that will also be developed. That is progress. Each local authority must have plans in by September for all of those sites. It is a litle like the Action Plan for Jobs. A great deal of work had to go on in the first year on the foundations, for want of a better word, for building but the results will be visible in the years ahead. I am quite happy and have no doubt that in terms of housing units, completion and build that will happen in the next three or four years because of the work we have done in the past year. We want to make more progress in dealing with homelessness. We are slightly behind our target of getting people out of hotels. That will be dealt with in August and September. The planning and development can never be quick enough, but I am happy that is it on track. The planning authority has discretion. That is in the principal Act. We will bring forward more amendments to the bigger planning Bill to deal with land hoarding and Senator Boyhan's concern. It will also deal with Senator Ó Clochartaigh's concerns.

We are saying up to 2021 under the Rebuilding Ireland action plan. I cannot say what some future Government will do, but that is not our intention. Amendments are not necessary on Committee Stage. We discussed them in the Dáil already.  Senator Ó Clochartaigh asked if it would allow someone put in the foundations, then sit back and do nothing. That is not the case. We are very clear that substantial works have to be carried out. Other measures are coming forward in the legislation we will discuss in the autumn which will help with that concern. We do not want that to happen. We are on the same page.  Social housing is not covered in the Bill, but there are many plans to bring forward social housing. We are way ahead of what we did last year. It is not nearly enough and no one is saying it is. This planning permission change will aid some social housing projects and planning in general will deliver more social houses.

It inserts a new category of extensions just for housing. It is somewhat akin to category A in the original Act but less rigorous as, notably, as initiated, the Bill does not even require that the housing developments be completed in a reasonable timeframe, as section 42(1) does. The Bill provides that the planning authority, if it receives an application, shall grant an extension.There is no discretion to refuse it if a valid application for an extension is submitted meeting the broad new category.
 It limits the checks the planning authority is entitled to make to checking only that the application for the extension is in order, to just the paperwork therefore. No consideration is allowed of the suitability of the development in the area. This is despite a potentially very significant lapsed period since it was given permission. Conceivably there could now be many new developments, with huge traffic, sewerage and water supply issues to be considered, as well as other matters such as flooding considerations, etc. We are potentially seeing a return of development with poor infrastructural support such as we saw in the worst of the Celtic tiger days. The Minister can prescribe regulations under section 43 to require the submission of evidence to support the consideration of whether the development can be completed. The Minister has entirely failed to allow the councils to consider such matters in the Bill, as initiated. The extensions of duration may be applied for by unscrupulous developers and they do exist, with a view to only changing the paper value of the land, which would increase suddenly if it had a valid permission attached to it. I appreciate the Minister of State saying that this is not the aim, but the question we asked was around what safeguards were in place to ensure this would not happen. The further extended period is limited to an upper limit of the 31 December 2021. Two issues arise. The date can easily be changed by the Government and pushed out again. The Bill does nothing to ensure assured delivery under these provisions in a reasonable timeframe, commensurate with the amount of work outstanding. The developer can sit on the extended permission up to December 2021, which is three and a half years from now, and either do nothing and simply take advantage of low land value implications, or the site could be developed at the eleventh hour when the market has been squeezed to the optimal point for the developer in the area in question. Critically, it also facilitates development with out of date standards and regulations but at tomorrows' prices. This is because the Bill does not just allow for another extension, it allows for another extension of a permission which has not only run out of its first period but which has been extended and also run out of that period. Unlike the current section 42, there can be a much more significant period between the development being granted permission and conditions that were attached to that permission that reflected regulations and standards at the time. This can be the case now or in the period into the future when extensions can be sought under the new provisions. Given the time lag between the original full consideration by the planning authority, many relevant planning considerations may have changed such as the development objectives in the relevant county development plans, regional and spatial strategies. Even if the development was extended under category B previously - some of them were - time has elapsed again and the council would have no discretion to amend conditions. In the context, for example, of the awful tragedy of Grenfell Tower there has been increased focus of fire regulations and building standards. Additionally, new factors and considerations such as flood risk and flood maps have emerged, with climate mitigation and adaptation plans, which could have a bearing on whether the continued development of the site in question is consistent with proper planning and sustainable development. No consideration is permitted on these factors. Amendment No. 2 specifies a number of critical planning considerations, with which the planning authority must be satisfied in order to grant an extension of duration such as adding a requirement that the evidence that the development can be completed should be satisfactory evidence. It calls for consistency with normal planning considerations such as development plans and regional and spatial guideline and the Minister's own policies. It adds new appropriate considerations in respect of flood risk and climate change and, additionally, part II of amendment No. 2 recognises that issues could arise consequent on how old and out of date are the underlying permission and associated conditions on it. It recognises the context of the time lag between when a further extension is sought and when it was originally permitted. This is particularly expedient and in the public interest given the absolute failure of the Minister to stipulate any definition of "substantial works" as has been raised by Senators previously. We have no clear view of what has been done or is outstanding and yet to be developed. There is a clear failure to require explicitly in the alternate that in fact the development had to be substantially completed. It is sensible, therefore, that we require that what is an unclear and unspecified amount of outstanding development simply has to be completed to the most current and up-to-date standards. To fail to do this would subject the most vulnerable and desperate home seekers in the market to substandard development and less optimum standards than is reasonably feasible. Amendment No. 3 requires a definition of “substantial works” and that the Minister provides regulation that conforms to what he said in the Dáil, which otherwise would be meaningless. It deals with issues we see in the real world where the demolition of existing structures, some site clearance and the digging a hole on site are deemed to be "substantial works". This is even though tenders or key contracts may not have been written let alone met, and no real development has taken place. Such developments, which have not really been commenced, should be reconsidered fully and be treated differently to something that has been genuinely advanced. That is the rationale for putting forward the amendments. We appreciate the thrust of the Bill, but we believe it needs to be amended in the House. Given the time lag between the original full consideration by the planning authority, many relevant planning considerations may have changed such as the development objectives in the relevant county development plans, regional and spatial strategies. Even if the development was extended under category B previously, and some of them were, time has elapsed again and the council would have no discretion to amend conditions. In the context, for example, of the awful tragedy of Grenfell Tower there has been increased focus of fire regulations and building standards. Additionally, new factors and considerations such as flood risk and flood maps have emerged and climate mitigation and adaptation plans, which could have a bearing on the continued development of the site in question ,is consistent with proper planning and sustainable development

Equally, to address the point I made in my earlier contribution, where people are looking for second extensions to duration of planning permissions, it only applies to substantially commenced projects. We cannot have a situation where people who have sat on planning permissions since 2008 and are still sitting on them with not a blade of grass disturbed and not a shovel having gone into the ground wanting to extend the permission for a second time. In those situations, even if a first extension to duration is allowed, we cannot have people going back and getting extensions of such duration where an area development plan has changed the ground rules. If the development plan has changed the rules it means that they have been changed for a logical reason. The members of a local authority may have decided to change them and building standards are of a different quality than heretofore. It is important that we do not allow planning permissions that were granted in an earlier time to be extended when we have already changed the rules as to what and how projects should be built.

They are valid concerns and I do not have a problem with them. I started by saying the Bill would enable us to deliver more houses, but clearly, we do not want houses on sites that are not appropriate, nor do we want buildings that are built without proper planning controls, etc. The reality is, however, that these are sites that have received planning permission. This is a further extension of an extension. There is a due planning process that has already been gone through. That is an important point to make. The Minister has already confirmed that it is open to the planning authorities to restrict the measure to a two year extension of duration. It does not have to be another five-year extension. No good planner or local authority wants dodgy buildings built within their local authority area. These are important points to bear in mind. The Minister has also confirmed, as result of a parliamentary question I tabled, that there would be no extensions beyond 2021 - we are now in mid-2017 - which is the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland. The Minister of State has also confirmed this and I hope I am correct in his interpretation. We are talking about a very narrow timeframe, which goes back to the points made by Senator Ó Clochartaigh about the need to quantify the sites involved. Deputy Eoin Ó Broin made this valid point in the Dáil and he also has requested that the sites involved be quantified. I believe that should be addressed. The Minister of State says there may be 50 to 100, but I suggest there are 75, based on some correspondence I read from the Department recently. Quantifying the sites would help. I cannot imagine that the Minister of State does not know roughly where these sites are. I presume that he does know. It is important that the Minister of State could make that information available soon. Clearly he cannot make it available today, but we could quantify these sites and have a look at them. No planning authority or planner wants dodgy buildings or inappropriate buildings. I also reiterate again that it is up to the Minister and his officials are here. There is clearly a planning code set down through the Planning and Development Act 2000. We have planning controls and regulations and all of these still apply. I am reasonably comfortable about it and one might say who am I to be like this, but I have great interest in the planning and development process. Given the tight timeframe of the period, ending as it does in 2021, and the legislation we have, I believe this is a reasonable measure which would allow us to be assured that it is covered within guidelines set out in the existing legislation. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say. I reiterate the call for quantifying the sites. As soon as we have the definitive list of these sites the better.

I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  When I look at the various pillars of Rebuilding Ireland, I believe there is an overlap.The need for local authorities to provide social housing has been discussed. Although the Minister of State has outlined the number of units that have been constructed and the commendable progress that is being made, that is, unfortunately, not evident to those affected. The level of homelessness is rising. I propose that a new section 12 be added to the Bill to strengthen it and to recognise that there is a sense that the legislation is being rushed through the Seanad. Other Members and I want to do our jobs, strengthen the Bill and recognise some of its weaknesses. My amendment aims to ensure planning permissions extended will be in keeping with current environmental and building standards and in compliance with the most recent planning and development regulations. As other Senators have said, things have changed in recent years and I am, therefore, bringing forward this amendment. Permissions can be extended under the proposed Bill. Conditions could be out of date as it includes permissions which have run out of time, been extended, run out of that extended period and lapsed. Members know that fire regulations need updating. One does not build one's way out of a housing crisis by constructing substandard developments and giving a windfall cost benefit to developers to develop at old standards and sell at today's prices. My party colleague, Deputy Catherine Martin, and academic, Ms Deirdre Ní Fhloinn, who wrote our motion on building standards which was passed in the Dáil, have recently raised the issue of current building standards being totally unsuitable. The Bill does not give a definition of "substantial works". The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, last week said further extensions of planning permission must be for developments beyond the point of no return. On 13 July, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, the chief executive of NAMA, told the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach that, since its inception, NAMA had sold vacant land on which 50,000 houses could have been built. To that date, 3,700 had been built or were under construction. He said there was little disincentive to the hoarding of any site for as long as the owner expected house prices to rise. Allowing for an open definition of "substantial works" could lead to abuse of the procedure and further land hoarding, which has been described by many NGOs, academics and even the head of NAMA as a contributor to the current housing crisis.

In regard to the automatic granting of an extension to planning permission, since some permissions have been given, the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, studies have been published. Members have not been told where the units are located. Are some on a flood plain and, if so, how many? Would it potentially be better that such units not be finished? Is it correct to grant extensions to planning permissions? The Bill proposes an automatic extension. Has due diligence been carried out in regard to what planning permissions are to be given extensions? It is possible that houses will be completed only to be flooded in two years' time. However, Members do not know those details. The Minister of State is asking us to buy a pig in a poke. A list of sites should have been published in order for the impact to be assessed, along with a consideration of how planning and development has changed in the relevant area. No Member wants to delay the building of a unit because every unit built means another family can be housed. However, there is a responsibility to ensure we are not buying a pig in a poke. That assurance has not been given by the Minister of State. He has not told Members where those developments are located. Can he tell me that none of these developments is on a flood plain or within 30 feet of a river that has a history of flooding? I do not hold all planners in the high regard that some do. I have met some very good planners in local authorities but also some horrendous planners who have given dodgy planning permissions. I am aware of people in County Meath whose houses in a rezoned area have been flooded on a regular basis. Can the Minister of State give Members some comfort on the details of the legislation? I also ask him to respond on the delay in the provision of affordable units in Dublin due to a lack of necessary legislation.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	132	I will try to answer most of the questions posed. I missed Senator Humphreys' question earlier. The delay in the provision of affordable units in Dublin is not due to a lack of relevant legislation. Senator Humphreys raised the issue last week and I know he hoped to discuss it again this week. I am happy to debate the issue but the delay is not due to lack of legislation. Many such sites throughout the country have been identified for the development of social housing, affordable housing and private development. The Department is not dictating to local authorities on how to bring those sites forward. Councillors have enough common sense, working in tandem with their officials, to bring forward proposals for lands. They have been asked to have all proposals in by September. The Department, rather than dictating to them, wants to see what is brought forward by local authorities in terms of what they think is best for their areas in making the best use of public lands and the deliverance of social and affordable housing appropriate to each site, with private housing. Some local authorities are bringing forward proposals for high levels of affordable housing, which is to be welcomed. We have asked for the plans to be brought forward. The Department has identified the sites and will make money available, with personnel to enhance and develop local authority teams, but it needs to know what appropriate action local authorities want to take in their areas. Members have emphasised the importance of councillors and local authorities. The Department wants to hear their views on the sites in their areas, most of which are in local authority ownership. The Department does not currently dictate the course to be taken, nor does it intend to do so. If housing development is not progressed in the near future, there may be a change in the process, but progress is currently being made. The Department wants to see what plans are developed for each site. That is important. If I am incorrect, and new legislation is required to alleviate the delay in the provision of affordable units in Dublin, I will address that immediately but that is not my understanding in regard to the current situation. The Bill does not address greenfield sites. Members are absolutely correct in that regard. It addresses sites on which works have substantially commenced. A person will not be able to get a mortgage to buy a house on a flood plain, nor will he or she be able to get finance to build a house on a flood plain, irrespective of whether planning permission has been granted, because the OPW has identified all potential flood plains. I, therefore, do not share the concerns of Members in that regard. I do not know the location of each of the 70 or 80 sites and, therefore, I cannot give a guarantee to Members in that regard, but funding will not be given for the development of sites on a flood plain. However, I cannot promise that planning permission has not been granted for developments on flood plains. All available talents are being used to identify such sites. Some people have sites for which they do not realise planning permission has expired. It is likely that in such cases development has not been commenced. The Bill addresses sites on which work has substantially commenced and is progressing. We want the development of those sites to be completed. I would be surprised if Members have not received calls from people about these sites. I have received several such calls. I can, therefore, speak about some of the sites but not all of them. One will not receive funding to build a house on an identified flood plain unless one can prove through one's engineers and in consultation with the OPW that the house is safe from flooding. It is usually the case that if finance cannot be obtained, houses are not developed. That can also be a problem on some good sites, but that issue can be discussed at a later date. I will discuss all of the amendments together. On amendment No. a1, which, in a sense, supersedes amendments Nos. 1 and 2, the further extension of direction provisions which emanate from the Government's action plan for housing will affect not only future permissions but also those that expired after the publication of the action plan last summer. Such permissions may be reactivated under the provisions of the Bill because some such planning permissions would have expired in August, September, October or November 2016 but a commitment was given in mid-July 2016 that, from that date, any site with planning permission on which development had commenced would qualify under this scheme. Development on some sites may have commenced and then ceased. To require that there be active construction in progress is problematic because of the commitment given last year. The Government opposes the amendment because it would preclude those developments which have already received an extension of duration of permission which expired after the publication and which, therefore, would have stopped work before now. There are such sites.The effect of this amendment would be that only a development under active construction would benefit from the extension of duration. It would exclude that cohort of developments, the submissions on which had withered away after the publication of the action plan in July 2016. As this runs contrary to the objectives of the action plan, I cannot accept the amendment. I hope Members will understand why we cannot accept it. I know the principle it aims to achieve. This is not to facilitate the hoarding of land and we will do more on that in our planning Bill, for which some amendments have already been tabled and which colleagues may have seen. The amendments to the larger Bill will be very much in line with what the Senator wants to do to try to ensure there is no land hoarding. Members can be assured that land hoarding does not fulfil our aims or help us with our plans. We will do all we can to prevent land hoarding. On amendments Nos. 1 and 2 on the principal list of amendments and amendment No. 3 on the additional list, all of which we oppose, in subparagraph (A)(I), "established evidence" is not defined and will cause great uncertainty as to what it means precisely. I remind Senators that the provisions in this Bill already require planning authorities to interrogate the application to extend the duration of the permissions and to give only as much time as is required to complete the development. Senator Ó Clochartaigh's colleague, Deputy Eoin Ó Broin, mentioned this matter. If it merely needs six or nine additional months, it does not need to be given an extra five years in order that they can sit back and not develop it. That is for the local authority. It makes the decision on that. Again, I hope the authorities will do their job correctly. That is what we will be asking them to do and that is the guidance they will be getting. In law, local authorities have to be the judge of that and it is quite common in most cases. It is inherent in the processes envisaged under legislation that developers would provide reasonable estimates of how long the completion of developments will take, and it is therefore impractical to require developers to provide evidence of something that has not yet occurred. The Senator said there was a belief in some local councils that there was an automatic right to an extension and that people would have their applications rubber-stamped. That is not always the case. I have come across people who did not get their permissions extended. Timelines can be put in. If the Senator has evidence of this, he should bring it forward. My experience, from talking to councillors and people who were themselves involved, is that these applications are not always rubber-stamped and people have not always received their extension. In this case, the chances are that if applicants have not done substantial work, they will not get it. The legislation is very clear on that point. They have to have made major progress on the site. It is as simple as that. On subparagraphs (A)(II), (A)(III) and (A)(IV) and (B) of the amendment, the provisions propose to assess retrospectively the planning merits of a development which has already received consent and where substantial works have been carried out. It is like a new planning application. I know that is Senator Grace O'Sullivan's concern, but it is like going back to square one and resubmitting a planning application. We propose that in respect of planning permissions which have run out in the previous nine or ten months or are about to run out on sites where work has started and building is under way, those sites can be finished out. It is not a greenfield site, it is not starting again from scratch, but if we accept the amendments, it would in practice be a return to the starting position of a new application which would undo the certainty we are trying to introduce in this model. The reopening of the determination of the planning merits of a particular application where developments have substantially commenced is not reasonable and it is generally not possible to add or vary planning conditions after construction substantially commences, as proposed in this amendment. Some of these developments are well advanced and almost finished, and we are trying to get them finished. The effect of accepting these amendments would be to complicate an administrative process and effectively create a second consent process, which would bring massive uncertainty and financial risk to house providers in terms of undermining developments which have already passed through the planning process, with the potential for unforeseen consequences in relation to other infrastructural projects also. I am not inclined to insert a definition of the term "substantial works" in primary legislation, as proposed in amendment No. 3 on the first additional list, as it is subject to a widely litigated and complex area of case law which would not be well served by a restricted definition. It is noted that a consideration of whether substantial works have been carried out should be determined on the basis of the particular facts of the case and not by reference to any predetermined formula or rule of thumb. Again, this goes back to the planning authorities in the area making the judgment and, in the principal Act, it is their call. It is not defined in legislation, and if we were to do that, it would need a much more lengthy process. It is something we can look at again, but it is not something that is done without consulting the different stakeholders and having proper public consultation. There is considerable case law and to undermine it would involve much work. If people want to do that, we can look at it, but it is a complex area and not something to be done just like that. This legislation reflects the discussion in the debates we had here last December and in January. Most people would agree that if a development is under way on a site, it should be finished because we need the houses, and that is what we are trying to do here. There are also people for whom this is their livelihoods. They will be working on these sites today. Are we to say that they cannot be on site next week? That is what we are discussing and those are the practicalities. This does not relate to hundreds of sites. It is about 50 to 60 sites. Some people are saying 70 sites and we are saying it might be 50 to 100. People are on those sites today, delivering houses that we all need, whether for the purposes of social or private housing, but it is also their livelihood and we are trying to facilitate that. When we discussed this in December, most people were satisfied with that. We made changes because they made sense logically. It is not to protect hoarders or greenfield sites from being developed for another five years. I want to be clear that is not what we are doing.

It lays out the legislative basis for the establishment of the National Shared Services Office as a separate Civil Service office under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The NSSO is already in place and has been in operation on an administrative basis since 2014. The Bill seeks to formalise the existing structure, clarify accountability, and provide added assurance and robustness to its operations. The NSSO is charged with leading the Government's shared services strategy and the implementation of shared services projects and operations within the overall public service reform context across the Civil Service. Shared services is modernising how we deliver common business services in the Civil Service. We have created one dedicated team that is taking operational business functions such as finance and human resources and transforming them through the introduction of common standards and definitions, simplified processes and higher levels of automation and self-service. The move away from costly departmental-specific custom solutions and duplicated effort across Departments to standard automated processes allows the Government to lower the cost of these services and improve the quality of management information available for decision-making.With the introduction of shared services, the same numbers of staff will no longer be required in each Department to perform these specific back-office functions. As a result, more staff will be available to work on other core service areas that are priorities in their own Departments and have a positive impact on the general public. Since 2014, the NSSO has introduced many benefits for the Civil Service. They include the introduction of one set of standard human resources, HR, processes applied consistently and based on common HR policies. These standard processes are eliminating local interpretation, thereby increasing fairness for employees. Civil servants can now access HR services through a much wider range of channels, including online for the first time, giving them easier and faster access to important information on entitlements and services. For example, the HR portal receives more than 300,000 visits per month. HR analytics and trend analysis are becoming more readily available on a Civil Service-wide basis to inform policy and help drive improvements in the way we manage the workforce. The first online system for public service travel and expenses claims was introduced, with payments processed within a week. In 2016 more than 56,000 travel and subsistence claims were processed to a value of €20 million. Online payslips are now available to all payees, including pensioners, and there is immediate access to payroll information, including downloadable P60 forms. This is a significant change to the hard-copy payslips and paper-based receipts of the past. Insights gained through shared services have informed the development of relevant Government policies, such as those relating to addressing absence, leave and the recoupment of overpayments. Improved technology and automation give employees access to self-service in several areas, including the maintenance of their own personal information, such as address or marital status changes, and application for annual leave. This removes the need for multiple touchpoints and manual entry on the HR system. Almost 1.5 million annual leave updates were recorded in the past four years and more automation is planned. Government investment in shared services for the Civil Service has been significant, with €28.5 million capital funding provided to date. This reflects the importance of this major initiative under the public service reform programme. It is of utmost importance to the Government that our work continues to have a positive impact on citizens. The NSSO provides common business services for more than 40 wide-ranging public service organisations. It is staffed by civil servants who are fast becoming specialists in best practice standards of business support services such as HR, pension administration, payroll and travel and expense processing. Due to the fact that the NSSO operates a single standard way of working, it is able to contribute to, and respond quickly to, the introduction of new policies, such as the recent paternity leave scheme, and introduce new e-HR initiatives such as e-probation and e-mobility that are under way. The rationale for setting up a separate statutory office is to provide clear accountability for shared services and to separate the shared services expertise, and strong customer and service culture, from the broad-ranging policy-making functions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. However, once separated, the two organisations will continue to collaborate closely. The Bill makes clear that the NSSO will be accountable to the Oireachtas through the Oireachtas committees and, from a Government point of view, will continue to report directly to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and that Department. Service delivery and high-quality customer services are most effective when implementation is separate from policy-making. For greater effectiveness, the NSSO requires the flexibility to respond to operational matters that can distract from the focus of the Department. Creating the NSSO as a separate office also provides for the independence of shared service governance. This independence ensures clear accountability structures delivered through individual service agreements with public service bodies which specify the terms and conditions on which services are to be provided. When the new finance shared service centre is fully established and staffed, the NSSO will employ an estimated 950 civil servants and will provide payroll services to over 128,000 retired and serving civil and public servants. It will account for the estimated total Vote of €50 billion and administer approximately 50% of net Government voted expenditure. This makes the office twice the size of the Department and a significant operation when compared to other offices and shared services organisations in the private sector. This requires an office in its own right. Significant progress has been made in advancing shared services within the Civil Service in the three years since the NSSO was set up. It is important to point out that its merits have already been established in committee and in the Lower House and are being referred to by Members there. The NSSO has already established two shared services centres that provide employee shared services, namely, the HR and pensions administration shared service centre for the Civil Service, in operation since March 2013, and the payroll shared service centre, PSSC, for the Civil Service, in operation since December 2013. Recent updated analysis has estimated that €6.4 million has been saved in the annual cost of delivering transactional HR services. In 2016, the PSSC made over 2.7 million payments to the value of €3.24 billion. This figure is set to rise this year. The PSSC is in the process of replacing 18 payroll centres that had different versions of payroll systems with one shared services centre. Once payrolls migrate from Departments to the PSSC, the technology costs and payroll for staff who used to process payroll are suppressed. A project to integrate HR, pensions and payroll into a single service organisation has already commenced. The development of a new finance technology solution for government is also under way. A single finance technology platform will replace 31 financial management systems and 31 reporting systems across Departments and offices and facilitate transaction processing in the new finance shared service centre. This centre will be co-located with payroll in Galway, Killarney and Tullamore and will start providing financial management shared services next year. It will improve resilience and performance, increase financial control and deliver a sustainable reduction in the annual cost of finance of approximately €15.4 million through a reduction in the cost of support for finance technology and a reduction in the resources required to provide financial management processing. Turning to the Bill, the legislation provides for the office to carry out business administrative functions on behalf of a public service body. The legislation will specify the chief executive of the NSSO as its Accounting Officer. This issue has been raised in committee and the Lower House. The chief executive will, as a result, be accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General and, in turn, to the Committee of Public Accounts. The NSSO board, which will have an advisory remit, is also provided for in the legislation. The Bill is set out in five Parts. Part 2 allows for the practical structures in the establishment of the NSSO. It confers on the office all such powers which are necessary in the performance of its functions. Part 3 is concerned with the establishment, membership and functions of the board. Parts 4 and 5 contain technical provisions dealing with transitional arrangements and consequential and miscellaneous provisions. It has always been envisaged that the NSSO would become independent in the delivery of its functions. Shared services constitute one of the biggest change programmes the Civil Service has experienced. The statutory establishment of the NSSO will help us to meet the requirements of international best practice in this area and provide clear accountability arrangements, very strong governance structures and the operational autonomy needed to achieve the goals of high performing shared services. It will also allow the Civil Service to lower the cost of these services, improve the quality of management information available for decision-making and ultimately assist in enhancing front-line services for the public. I welcome Members' contributions. I apologise again for being slightly late. I thank Senator McDowell for coming to my rescue, with my officials and the usher.

I think this is his first time in the Seanad in his new role. I congratulate him on his appointment. I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. Fianna Fáil will support the Bill and the position that the office be put on a statutory basis. It makes sense. We have 31 local authorities and many other bodies with payroll functions. It would be much better if we could get this to work properly and have an organisation with the necessary expertise and the skill set, whether it be in ICT, pensions or payroll, if it is to deal with travel and subsistence claims, as the Minister of State mentioned. I am not sure whether we in the Seanad are involved with the system, but it does make sense that we set it up.Of course, there are concerns, to some of which the Minister of State alluded. We do not want a situation where the NSSO ends up like the HSE, that is, something that is not under ministerial control or that is passed off. The Minister of State said this would not be the case and that it would be accountable to Oireachtas committees and to Ministers and so on. It is important that it would be. It is also the setting up of another quango, for want of a better phrase. Fine Gael in 2011 announced the abolition of 145 of them and, if we look back at that list, we see most of them are still there, and quite a number more have been created. To be fair, as a party in government, perhaps Fine Gael has revised its view on that policy of culling all these quangos and making a fuss about how much more efficient it would be if they were all gone. This makes sense. I do not want to go through all of the examples in the Minister of State's speech, but there are examples in terms of HR and pensions administration when having 30,200 employees across 37 Departments and public sector bodies, as well as 48 public service bodies being dealt with under provisions for cash receipting, fixed assets, general ledger accounting and so on. These are all valid reasons to set up the NSSO on a statutory basis. As the Minister of State said, it is going to have almost 1,000 staff, which is almost twice the number in the Department. It is going to give us cost savings and efficiencies, better management information and, I hope, will free up senior management resources in many bodies around the country from doing relatively day-to-day administrative tasks in order to focus on proper policy development. I want to reiterate our concerns. This is another public service body being set up and while there is a fairly valid reason for it, I do not want a situation where, like other bodies, it becomes unaccountable and loses control of itself. Equally, it is very important that it answers not just to Ministers but to Oireachtas committees, that it would publish an annual report which is circulated to Members of both the Dáil and the Seanad and that we see a situation where we can save money for better use by the State generally.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	143	I strongly support the Bill and the initiative of the Minister of State and the Government in bringing it forward. Like Senator Horkan, I take the view that, normally, when we are told another statutory body is to be created, our antennae go up for a moment. However, on this occasion, I can see the reason that it should have a statutory basis. If it is to be accountable, if we are to have an Accounting Officer and if it is to be answerable to a Dáil committee, then, obviously, it needs a statutory basis. The second point is that although it is yet another State body, it should result in very substantial savings right across the public sector. The Minister of State mentioned Killarney. I remember, when I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, going to Killarney, where there was a payments section that was quite a large payroll operation conducting a number of departmental functions. Some of the payrolls were fortnightly, others were monthly, and there was quite an odd collection of things happening there. In regard to An Garda Síochána in particular, the number of deductions was colossal and the paperwork involved in paying members of An Garda Síochána was fiercely complicated. This is from memory, given it is some ten years ago or more since I visited, but I remember thinking at the time that there must be a better way of dealing with this. If the payment function, for example, for members of the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána can be approximated and standardised and if payment periods can be standardised, I think that would be a good idea. I remember on one occasion the annual budgetary process taking place and my officials in the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform were very pleased because they had managed to keep from the Department of Finance's keen observation - there was no Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the time - that there was one less pay day in the year in question such that we got a very significant boost in our payments budget. It occurred to me that these kinds of things were anomalies which should be tidied up. The second point is that, on the HR side, it should be the case that semi-State and State bodies which have considerable HR aspects to them should have shared services, in so far as these things can be standardised and shared. There are many academic institutions, local authorities and semi-State bodies which are replicating the same functions and, while I do not want to attack anyone's area of business, they are also hiring in IT consultants to work out small solutions for smallish operations at huge expense to the management. It makes sense that there should be a single body doing all of these things. For these reasons, I completely support the legislation. I hope the National Shared Services Office has every success in doing the valuable work it is doing.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	144	I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well. I have no doubt that he will do a great job in his new post of responsibility. Like other speakers, I welcome the introduction of this legislation to put this office on a statutory basis. Yes, I suppose it is another quango but it is both necessary and wanted. Will it do what it says on the tin? I hope it does. Will it save money and create efficiencies? It should. Will it cut the cost of payroll? I believe it should but, when I go through the Minister of State's speech and the content of the Bill, I wonder whether it will do so. I do not see where it will cut the costs. One of the gripes I have with new quangos being set up is that new staff are always put in place. They are never taken from Departments, local authorities or the HSE and put into this new office to make it more efficient and to reduce the staffing in the other areas. I believe we should be able to see where staff are being transferred from local authorities, the HSE and the Departments. If we could see staff from those areas being transferred into this new area, I would say that is a way forward and something to which we should all sign up. The Minister of State said that, eventually, there would be 970 people employed in this new set-up. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said there would be a saving of 145 jobs in the areas of pay and pensions and other shared services. To me, that means a considerable extra number of staff will be employed owing to this new legislation when it is fully operational. As I said, this is one of my gripes in that I cannot see, physically, where the staff are being transferred from the various Departments. It would be a good idea if we had that information and if we could see the level of staff reductions in Departments, local authorities and other shared services areas. Nonetheless, I believe it is good legislation and that it is wanted. Most of us in the House can remember PPARS, which was an absolute disaster. Its cost was estimated at €8 million but went up to €150 million, principally owing to some of the issues referred to by Senator McDowell in regard to nurses and staff of the HSE. For example, a nurse in Castlebar was on a different pay level from a nurse in Sligo, Galway or Letterkenny, and there were many scenarios within the organisation.Senator McDowell said the same thing had occurred in the Army and Garda, but they got over that. I hope it will be possible to get over all those obligations as well with this legislation and that we will not have another PPARS on our hands, because what happened there was outrageous. I do not believe that will happen because I have read the Bill and we have started on the right footing before putting it on a statutory basis. All in all, I welcome the Bill. I will have further questions on Committee Stage.

The National Shared Services Office, once established, will have significant power in issuing public procurement contracts. It is vital that those who spend public funds, in whatever manner, are answerable to the Oireachtas, not just the Minister. Public trust in public institutions is at an all-time low. Either we recognise this and work to build it up again or we abdicate our responsibilities, as legislators, and feed the apathy. The Government had initially excluded this new office from the scrutiny of the Committee of Public Accounts. This was unacceptable to Sinn Féin and my colleague, Deputy David Cullinane, tabled a number of amendments to address the issue. Some of those amendments were accepted and the national shared services office, once established, will be fully accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts. However, other amendments which would have provided for the pay of board members being subject to review by the finance committee, as well as oversight of consultants' fees, were rejected by the Government. There have been too many scandals involving pay and allowances above and beyond ministerial guidelines simply to ignore the issue. Unfortunately, the Government rejected these amendments on Report Stage also. This was a set back in terms of public oversight of public funds and contracts. Overall, there must be more openness and transparency in the public sector and Sinn Féin will continue to work towards that goal. Sinn Féin recognises that having shared services does not mean a concentration of services in one office, but falls into the overall principle of improved analysis and service. Departments are operating in silos, of which we all have had experience. We often hear words such as "cross-cutting" and "interdepartmental" used, which are often just a cover for the fact that Departments are operating in silos in shared services and policy terms. I agree that it is important to move away from the silo mentality to a much greater sharing of services to achieve efficiencies. International studies tend to show that there are five attributes of shared services. They comprise distinct governance, namely, a distinct organisational structure with a dedicated management team delivering the operational aspects of corporate services for one or more organisations; standard processes, which is where processes are standardised and streamlined; economies of scale, which means that scale is achieved through combining processes previously executed independently; customer driven, whereby a culture of service delivery is ingrained within the shared services centre; resources committed to key account management, monitoring key performance indicators and the achievement of service level agreements. There is also continuous process improvement, with dedicated project teams managing process change to drive improvements in both efficiency and levels of service. These are all fine objectives and hard to argue against, especially in a large public service which covers different Departments and large expenditure which could potentially lead to duplication. On the proposed office, its function is to enter into contracts for the procurement of goods and services required for the provision of shared services. The Government intends to give the office all such powers as are necessary or expedient for the performance of its functions and that the office shall be independent in the performance of its functions. The Bill will allow the shared services office to enter into agreements with public service bodies and draw up the terms and conditions on which shared services are to be provided for these bodies. It will make payments to, and communicate with, persons on behalf of public service bodies for the purposes of providing shared services. It will receive and process personal data provided to it by public service bodies for the purpose of carrying out its functions. It will develop and implement policies on the manner in which shared services are to be provided. It will provide guidance, where appropriate, in the public sector on the provision of services comparable to shared services. That is quite a transfer of power to an independent body. The areas of responsibility which will be transferred cover employment contracts, wages, pensions and financial accounts. The office will cover 40 public bodies. That means a great deal of sensitive data will be put out to tender. This has to be a concern, especially the information on personnel within the legal and judicial system. It was for these reasons that Sinn Féin tabled amendments to strengthen the public oversight of the office.

I congratulate him on his new portfolio and look forward to working with him.  There are many strong, commonsense aspects to the national shared services office, as have been put forward. I note that the Citizens Information Board, CIB, was recently debated at the Joint Committee on Social Protection. Citizens information and Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, offices put forward proposals for how there could be a sharing of human resources, HR, and payroll. They believed that to be a more efficient response to the proposal put forward by the CIB which effectively involved the dissolution of numerous MABS and Citizens Information offices throughout the country to facilitate amalgamation. We heard in the testimony to the committee that there are mechanisms whereby we can have multiple companies and entities doing work and sharing this aspect of that work. It would be useful if the Minister sent this to the Department of Social Protection and encouraged it to look on it as a potentially different approach from the approach being taken in that restructure, an approach which has been opposed in a vote in the Dáil and at the Joint Committee on Social Protection. My concern about this area is similar to that raised by Sinn Féin. Deputy Cullinane did excellent work on this issue. The Minister of State responded to some of those concerns and I welcome the new section 35. I believe there have been changes since the Bill was drafted and it is welcome that section 35 contains a more constrained definition of the data that might be shared. That is advisable and positive. I commend it, but I also hope we can get reassurances that there is no intention to extend it back to the wider capacity it had initially. I am concerned about section 8 and the power of entering into contracts for the procurement of goods and services. From my reading of the transcripts of proceedings in the Dáil, I understand the Minister has given assurances that there is no intention to tender in this regard. I am still concerned that this is an independent office and I do not know to what extent we can set the policy on decisions as to whether these areas would be tendered. The current European procurement rules move in one direction whereby if an area is opened to tender and competition it potentially remains open. It is extremely difficult to move back to a public delivery of that public good. I would appreciate hearing the Minister's explanation of the safeguards to ensure we do not move towards tendering and that we do not leave ourselves in a situation where we will be unable to reverse out of it. There are particular concerns about data in some of the contracts we have. We are aware that the Safe Harbour pact was stuck down at EU level as being an inadequate protection of the data of European citizens. Its replacement, the Privacy Shield deal, is now being challenged in the courts. There is concern. In some of the contracts we have, for example, there is the issue of American companies being able to process that data. The issue is the adequate protection of data. Again, that arises only where we have a situation of tendering and procurement, but our intention is not enough in that regard.The issue relates to human resources. We know, for example, that in the United States at one point there was a decision taken in respect of the payment of the living wage to staff members across a number of public bodies, in terms of seeking to drive forward good practices such as social clauses on employment standards, rewarding higher employment standards and giving a more positive weighting. Where does that positive practice relate to employment and will the State's capacity and the Minister of State's capacity to influence be diminished? Will we be told in the future that there are positive measures which we wish to introduce but that we are precluded from doing so because this is an independent office and it is abiding by a narrow definition of procurement guidelines? We discussed the fiasco in this House of procurement in terms of library services. We were told that we could not find a Minister to take accountability in terms of where the decision was made to bundle the library contract. It was moved from Minister to Minister and the Office of Government Procurement, back to the Department of Education and Skills and around the houses. We could not find a Department to take responsibility for the issue. Those are not necessarily complications; they are potential complications. I accept that the Minister of State has indicated that this is not the road he wants to go down, but I would like a sense from him of how he plans to ensure this independent office does not choose to go down those routes in the future. I again thank him for the Bill which makes sense.

I welcome the support that has been given to the Bill. I apologise for the confusion over the script. We had not been asked to have copies for circulation but I assure the House that in future when I come here to deal with legislation in particular that scripts will be circulated. This is not a quango. A quango in the true sense of the word is a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation. It is not a statutory body. I am fully in favour of the de-quangoisation of Ireland. That is the genesis of this project, which came about by streamlining, as Senator McDowell said, the complexity in relation to HR, payments, payroll and other matters. That is why it is referred to as a shared service. If anything, this is not a quango. The NSSO is up and running since 2014 and has delivered a lot of efficiencies already. We are not creating anything here; what we are doing is giving the NSSO statutory recognition because at the end of the day the people who are operating the system are not procured from the outside. We do not find them on a buy and sell service. They are civil servants and they have a right to be put on a statutory basis, if nothing else. It is very important for Oireachtas Members to note that we are anxious to make sure the staff of the NSSO receive the statutory recognition they deserve and the protection that affords. We could leave the body in limbo, but that would be the wrong thing to do. We are not creating anything new and we are not imparting any new power. What we are doing is extending a level of accountability that currently does not apply. That point has been missed by many. There were some calls for the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts to have special regard for it. One does not accord special treatment by the Committee of Public Accounts or the Comptroller and Auditor General to a statutory body because it is inferred from the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts that the body is already within its remit. Therefore, there is no point in doing it. The Comptroller and Auditor General Acts trump everything. Everything that is established by statute will have an Accounting Officer, in this case the chief executive, who is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts. He or she is also accountable to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. That in itself is an improvement on the current situation. The CEO will be asked to come before the Committee of Public Accounts. That was not plucked out of the air in the Dáil or in the committee, that situation is inferred from existing legislation on the Statute Book. The Department's role in this regard is very clear in that the Department will maintain a monitoring function in the same way as it does with everything else. I am also the Minister of State with responsibility for procurement; therefore, Members will be delighted to hear I will be back to them in that guise also. Accountability was mentioned in the other House also and it was mentioned at the committee. Yes, there will be an annual report and it will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and can be debated in the Seanad, the Dáil and in committee. That is good. That is not and cannot be the case; therefore, if anything, this is an improvement. The body was set up in 2014 and, as Senator Paddy Burke has alluded to, has already made a lot of efficiencies. The very fact that we can centralise the services is important. This is nothing new. We have not designed something from scratch. A lot of us in this room were members of local authorities, which have been doing this for many years. They proceeded on the basis of consultation with employee representatives and city and county managers and they have delivered an efficient service. Local authority workers have become used to the system and it has allowed staff to be used in other areas of local authority service delivery. It is important that they are able to serve and be of value to the people who ultimately pay the piper, namely, citizens. From that point of view, this change has to be good. We are taking on board the point made by Senator McDowell about Killarney and his trip there. He made a very good point, not only about justice and defence but across a range of Departments and agencies. There is a range of payment systems. I recently looked at the number of different forms of leave within the Civil Service and standardising it alone will take time. It is not as if we are trying to cut out anything. The changes are being introduced by way of agreement with representatives. This is not something that we are unused to. When one talks about the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in general, people are keen to see how much money has been saved rather than looking at the efficiencies that have been delivered. The next phase of reform in that Department might not get the same amount of air time as pay deals and other such matters but it is about the intricacies of how one delivers civil and public service reform in order that Joe and Mary Public can see a better and more enhanced service. We are not going to go off and recruit tens of thousands of people. This will not be a HSE because it already exists. It is not a quango. The NSSO will require specialist staff. Both HR and payroll expertise will be required, but that is not an exhaustive list. I hope to see this approach being replicated in other areas also. I cannot remember who raised the point, but there is no reason not to replicate this approach in education. A "Prime Time Investigates" report was carried out on HR in the education area. There is no reason this cannot become a template for other areas of public expenditure and that they cannot be encouraged to share services because by so doing one would have increased levels of oversight and also increased levels of accountability if the system is established according to proper foundations and precedent. There was never any intention to exclude the Committee of Public Accounts. I accepted amendments on Committee Stage in the Dáil debate. I am pleased that was noted because they made sense but they did not change the construct or tenet of the Bill, which was very clear. I laboured the point both in the committee and in the Dáil about the expenditure of board members that to have a statutory agency where a joint committee of the Oireachtas would set payments would grind this institution to a halt. One could not have a situation where an Oireachtas committee would decide that, for example, Patrick O'Donovan is worth €5,000 and someone else thinks he might be worth €15,000 or whatever else. Ultimately, the Public Appointments Service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have a role, as has the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. If we are to set rates of pay for non-governmental organisations and statutory boards in committees then one could say good luck to new politics achieving anything because we would not do anything other than striking rates of pay and that would grind the entire system to a halt. There has never been a precedent for it and it would also establish a very dangerous precedent for politicians to set the rates of pay for anybody. I do not think anybody would think that is a good idea. In terms of Citizens Information, I agree with the point made that there is a precedent for other agencies and Departments to do exactly the same thing.I welcome the good wishes of Members. We are certainly open for business should Departments believe further improvements could be made. We are not in the business of tendering out the work. It is important to point out that all the staff of the National Shared Services Office, NSSO, in situ are civil servants. That will continue. We do not see the staffing of the NSSO being put out to tender in the way that a road building contract is put out to tender. The NSSO is subject to the requirements of the Office of the Data Commissioner. The NSSO is also fully compliant with EU data management regulations. We are sensitive to the data of the people who work for the Government. The Government does not want the data of its employees shared in an inappropriate fashion. I will bring forward legislation in the autumn on how data is used and managed properly. The purpose of the Bill is to make life easier for the civil or public servant to access the services they need, be it sick pay, holidays or widow's payments. It is working, but it is also about driving efficiency. This is not a quango, but a means of reducing the numbers involved in the functions of Departments that had no boundaries. Senator McDowell alluded to his experience as Minister in the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and he probably saw it at first hand. There are no boundaries and I hope that as the legislation beds down, accountability will take shape. As the Oireachtas joint committees, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General see the efficiencies and the level of accountability of the NSSO, we should extend its boundaries. The concept on which the Bill is based, and which I hope will be enacted, is correct and either my successor or I could be back looking to amend it. By enacting the Bill, we will make it statutory and thus make the NSSO accountable. It is correct to give people certainty because they are civil servants. It is the right thing to do to drive efficiency and for the public. It is also the right thing to do in terms of civil servants who want to have a central point of contact for information on their personal situation, or somebody on their team.  I commend the Bill. I propose to take Committee Stage later in the week.

It will provide for the approval of the articles of agreement of the AIIB and payments associated with our membership to be made to the bank. The AIIB is a new multilateral financial institution which will promote economic development and regional integration in Asia, specifically through investment in infrastructure. The bank commenced operations in January 2016 with 57 founding members, including 14 EU member states, and has now grown to 80 approved members. The establishment of the bank was primarily a Chinese initiative and it is headquartered in Beijing. A Government decision in December 2015 allowed the Department of Finance to commence formal negotiations with the AIIB secretariat on Ireland's potential membership of the bank. Following this, Ireland made a formal application for membership of the bank in January 2017, which was accepted in March. Ireland must now fulfil a number of requirements before our membership of the bank is complete. Most significantly, our membership of the bank requires ratification of an international agreement, namely, the articles of agreement of the AIIB. Our membership will also involve a capital contribution to the bank. Article 29.5 2° of the Constitution provides, among other things, that "The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann". Passage of the proposed Bill by the Oireachtas, and its enactment by the President, would confirm such approval. Traditionally, our membership of similar international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank has been provided for through the passage of primary legislation. Why does Ireland wish to join the AIIB? A large part of the rationale is based on further strengthening our trade and economic links with Asia and, in particular, China, the world's second largest economy. This relationship has grown strongly in recent years and in 2015 Ireland's total trade with China was worth over €1.1 billion. This is an increase of 42% on the previous year. Clearly, this relationship is important to an economy such as Ireland's and even more so, given the desire to diversify our exports following the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. AIIB membership is also in line with Ireland's long-standing commitment to international development which has wide-ranging political support. Ireland's 2013 international development policy includes among its three core goals the aim to support sustainable development and inclusive economic growth - this is a goal which is closely aligned with the mandate of the AIIB. The standards adopted by the bank since its establishment reinforce the perception that it will be an effective driver of economic growth in the region, with sustainability firmly established as a core principle. It is also reassuring to see that the bank has worked very closely with other international financial institution's such as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Asian Development Bank to adopt their best practices in relation to governance, organisational practices, project appraisal and safeguards. The AIIB's mandate is to address the daunting infrastructure gap in Asia. The case for increasing investment in high quality infrastructure in the world’s fastest growing region is compelling. Research from the Asian Development Bank estimates that Asia will need to invest $1.7 trillion per year in infrastructure between now and 2030. This significant demand for investment cannot be met from other channels of finance such as existing international financial institutions, governments or the private sector. The bank was declared open for business on 16 January 2016 and approved its first loans on 24 June 2016. The authorised capital stock of the bank is $100 billion, with $20 billion in paid-in capital. The AIIB will broadly follow the model of other multilateral development banks, raising funds on international markets at competitive terms and channelling this into loans, guarantees and equity investments. Since it came into operation, the bank has approved over $2 billion in loans. The AIIB currently has 80 approved members which are divided into regional members, that is, Asian countries and non-regional members, mainly European countries but also including countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Regional countries will hold 75% of the bank’s shareholding and thus contribute 75% of the capital of $100 billion, with non-regional countries holding 25% of the bank’s shareholding and contributing $25 billion in capital.China is the largest shareholder in the bank and currently holds approximately 26% of its voting power. India is the second largest shareholder with 8% of total voting power, while Germany is currently the largest non-regional shareholder with over 4% of total voting power. The total voting power of all EU members is approximately 20%. Each member country is represented on the board of governors and nominates a governor and an alternate governor. As is the norm for membership of international financial institutions, the Minister for Finance would be governor for Ireland at the bank. The board of governors meets formally once a year for the AIIB’s annual meeting. It elects a president for a term of five years. The current president is Mr. Jin Liqun, a Chinese national and former vice president of the Asian Development Bank, whose current term will expire in 2021. The board of governors also elect the 12 members of the board of directors, who are responsible for the direction of the general operations of the bank. Nine directors are elected by regional members, and three others are elected by non-regional members. Members are arranged in constituencies headed by one of the 12 directors. Upon joining, Ireland would be part of the euro area constituency and would be represented by the director for the euro area. The director and alternate director posts in the constituency will rotate between the members of the constituency. Ireland will have an opportunity to hold such a post in the future, although the specific details of the arrangement remain to be decided. Ireland will also hold an adviser position upon joining the bank, through which we will be able to attend meetings of the board of directors.  The bank operates primarily by providing finance in the form of loans. It may also make equity investments and provide guarantees. To date, it has approved 18 projects in nine countries, with focuses spanning from transport to energy to urban development. Some typical examples of projects the AIIB has financed to date include a $216.5 million loan for a national slum upgrading project in Indonesia, to be co-financed with the World Bank, a $165 million loan for a power system project in Bangladesh and $329 million loan toward a road project in Gujarat, India. Three quarters of AIIB projects have been co-financed with other development banks, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. This demonstrates the standard of project which is being financed by the AIIB and its intent to co-operate constructively with other international financial institutions. Both the World Bank and the AIIB have recognised the importance of ensuring a partnership approach, as is evidenced by the memorandum of understanding recently co-signed by both presidents at the 2017 IMF-World Bank spring meetings to strengthen co-operation and knowledge sharing between both institutions. This co-operative approach with existing development banks and an emphasis on adopting their best practices has been a priority for EU members of the bank. They have used their influence to ensure the AIIB develops and maintains rigorous policies in terms of investments and lending, environmental and social safeguards, as well as governance, transparency and organisational matters. The bank has been highly receptive to discussions on standards and safeguards. It has made a clear commitment to being lean, clean and green and to adopting best practices. If Ireland becomes a full member of the bank we will, in co-ordination with like-minded members, endeavour to ensure the AIIB lives up to this commitment.  The expected cost of membership for Ireland will be a total of approximately €25 million, paid in equal annual instalments over five years. Ireland has been offered 1,313 shares in the bank. This figure is based on the remaining unallocated capital in the bank and Ireland's relative GDP share among non-regional countries applying for membership in this round of applicants. Each share has a value of $100,000. In capital terms, this equates to a total subscription of approximately €125 million, split between 80% callable capital and 20% paid in. In practice this would result in the subscription of approximately €25 million, to which I have referred. In general, callable capital represents the capital for which a member country would be liable if the institution encountered acute financial distress, while paid-in capital is the amount which a member actually contributes to the institution in normal circumstances. Based on Ireland's membership of existing international financial institutions and the performance of those institutions to date, the probability of the callable capital being called upon is negligible. A contribution of approximately €25 million would also be broadly in line with our contribution to other international financial institutions relative to their size. For instance, in the World Bank, taking into account the bank’s global role, Ireland has paid-in capital of approximately €49 million, and in the Asian Development Bank Ireland has paid-in capital of approximately €15 million. Ireland's capital contribution to the AIIB would be sourced from the Central Fund as is the normal practice for international financial institutions. This has been provided for in the legislation. Ireland's contributions to the AIIB would also count toward the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for official development assistance, ODA. The programme for Government commits to continuing efforts to achieve this target as economic circumstances allow. In line with the bank’s focus on development and its emphasis on the less-developed countries in the region, a significant proportion of our contributions to the AIIB will count toward ODA. The OECD is the body with responsibility for granting ODA eligibility and in June 2017 it agreed that 85% of a member's contributions to the AIIB would be ODA-eligible. Therefore, fulfilling the financial obligations which our AIIB membership would bring will help us in respect of our ODA targets. I will now turn to the specific provisions of the four sections of the Bill. Section 1 sets out the definitions used in this Bill.  Section 2 provides for the approval of the terms of agreement for membership of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The articles of agreement establishing the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank are set out in a Schedule to the Bill.  Section 3 sets out the financial and other provisions associated with joining the bank.  Section 4 deals with the Short Title of the Bill. It also provides for the commencement of the provisions in section 3 on the day when the State becomes a member of the AIIB.  I encourage Deputies to support the Bill and Ireland's membership of the AIIB. The bank will make a significant contribution to economic prosperity and regional integration in the world’s fastest growing region. This is a region which will be central to the 21st century and has a clear need for high quality investment and infrastructure. This investment will spur economic growth, benefitting not just Asia but the wider world. I believe Ireland should play an active role in the bank, shaping its policies in line with our principles and strengthening our ties in the region in the process. I commend the Bill to the House.

I believe we will be seeing him regularly for the rest of the week. Fianna Fáil is supporting the Bill. There are four Senators on this side of the Chamber, along with the Cathaoirleach and the Minister of State. The four Senators were on the finance committee when this Bill was discussed a number of months ago and it is nice to see a Bill coming through the finance committee and making its way into the system. I hope it will be passed on Thursday.  It is very important that Ireland be part of the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. While Asia is geographically a long way from us and will never be the market that the United Kingdom is for us, regardless of Brexit, it is important that we look at rapidly growing markets further afield which are rapidly increasing in their monetary wealth per head. I do not believe any of us realise how vast China is. India and Pakistan, among others, are enormously large countries, with 600 to 800 million populations. China has over 1 billion people. A new power station opens in China every four days. There are markets and opportunities there. As a First World country, it is our responsibility to provide overseas development aid contributions and do our best to make a statement that we are interested in helping countries that are not as fortunate as our own. The figures here are very small. It is €25 million paid in over five years, €5 million a year. We do many things which cost much more than €5 million and get considerably less scrutiny than we are giving this Bill. I do not want to repeat everything the Minister of State said in his very comprehensive speech. It is important to acknowledge that there are regional and non-regional members. Helping these countries is not bad for us as we are also getting involved. We are not just giving away money; we are investing in a bank that will invest in projects. By and large, the bank will be investing in projects it expects to generate a return. Its purpose is not just to give away money; it is to invest in projects. It is similar to the EIB but in an Asian context. I believe we do €11 billion in trade annually with China. By comparison, the level of trade with the United Kingdom is between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion a week. However, it is still a substantial amount of money and we should not ignore the area. The Bill needs to be passed. I will not go through the various articles of agreement, the operations, the finances, the board of governors and various other provisions. We did a lot of that at the committee. It was important that we did so. We went through it and looked at the benefits. It is clear from the Minister of State's speech that the Department has gone through much of this stuff. We scrutinised it. I am happy to support it. I look forward to it being passed this week, allowing Ireland to play a small but significant part in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

I wish to make a few observations on the Bill.  I understand Ireland will be required to invest €25 million. Does that provide us with a shareholding in the bank and what percentage shareholding does it provide? Our exposure in terms of the bank would be of the order of €100 million. It is covered on page 8. It is €125 million split between 80% callable capital and 20% paid in. The exposure would be up to €100 million. Obviously, the Department of Finance would have carried out due diligence. I ask the Minister of State to confirm this. I understand we would be able to nominate a member to the board of governors, but when does the Minister of State anticipate that Ireland would have a member on the operating board, the board of directors? I think Ireland will have the opportunity to hold an advisory position, which will rotate between the members. We live in a global economy. While I am not being parochial, obviously we have to look after our interests. We are putting €25 million of taxpayers' money into such an institution. What would be the opportunities for an Irish company to look for investment from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank? Would it be where an Irish company is looking to set up production in China? Would it be where a company might seek a joint venture with a Chinese company, exporting from Ireland into China? What opportunities does it present in an Irish context? I know it goes towards our ODA investment, which is to be welcomed. I want to bring it back to practicalities. I see the global context and the European-wide context in investing in developing Asian countries. Many Chinese investors visit Ireland and many Irish companies are looking to get into China. China is the biggest market of all and is largely untapped. I see positives with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. On a practical level, where does this present opportunities for Irish companies? I obviously commend the Bill.

My party is an internationalist one and believes the State should play a full role in development across the world. Therefore, we support the Bill. It is striking that Ireland is happy to lend to developing Asian economies, yet we are so hamstrung here to invest in our infrastructure because of the anti-investment fiscal rules and the choices of Government in recent years. We are a member of the World Bank and Asian Development Bank which are the American and Japanese-dominated development banks. Therefore, there would be no reason to shun the Chinese equivalent. The big question is why we delayed. Why did we miss out on signing up as founding members and getting the benefits that go with it? This was a question pursued by my party colleague during the Dáil Stages but without any real answer. The agreement is clear that founding members enjoy special privileges in nominating and voting for directors. Most of our neighbours will have that privilege but we will not. We hesitated and dithered and were nearly left behind. By delaying our application for no good reason we have put ourselves at a tactical and perhaps financial disadvantage. Perhaps the Minister of State will address the question as to whether American nervousness about this project was reflected in Irish tardiness. American Nobel Prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, believes that American nervousness should not have been an issue in stating:In fact, America's opposition to the AIIB is inconsistent with its stated economic priorities in Asia. Sadly, it seems to be another case of America's insecurity about its global influence trumping its idealistic rhetoric - this time possibly undermining an important opportunity to strengthen Asia's developing economies.What matters ultimately is that the right decision was made. Asia is a huge part of the world with massive concentrations of population. Its economic potential compared with Europe is very large. Good trade links in agriculture and other areas with China in particular are essential to our export sector. As the Minister for Finance told the Dáil recently: Bilateral trade has grown in significance and, in 2014, Ireland’s total trade with China was worth over €8 billion. Ireland’s priorities relate to bilateral trade and investment, particularly: higher education; agrifood; tourism; and aviation-financing sectors.While the economic rationale for joining is clear, it should not be the only consideration. I note the articles of agreement state: "The Bank shall ensure that each of its operations complies with the Bank's operational and financial policies, including without limitation, policies addressing environmental and social impacts". That is a very weak nod to those of us who argue for investment that respects human rights and environmental protection. We cannot ignore such issues when we are talking about what is effectively a Chinese bank. Many of the countries that are likely recipients of investment have issues with minorities or national rights that must be taken into account. The European Parliament has noted: "So far the AIIB’s governance structures do not foresee adequate involvement of shareholders in project financing decisions, and that the publicly available project documentation lacks any detail on the fulfilment of the environmental and social measures that the AIIB requires from its lenders". While we should not shirk away from those questions, on this occasion I believe it is a case of being better off inside the tent. Dr. Stiglitz stated: "Moreover, the need for environmental and social safeguards in infrastructure investment is more likely to be addressed effectively within a multilateral framework." Irish investment should be monitored to ensure our investment is not being pumped into projects that do not respect social, human and environmental rights. The policy decision for me is clear, but we should not forget this is not just a matter of signing an agreement; we have to put our money where our mouth is. This is not an insignificant investment for a country the size of Ireland. It is only right that it be debated here and requires our approval. When we dealt with the Finance (Certain European Union and Intergovernmental Obligations) Act, which was originally titled the Single Resolution Board (Loan Facility Agreement) Bill 2016, Sinn Féin made the point which was accepted through an amendment that when we sign off on these international agreements it is not good enough to have the Dáil sign off once and then to have changes to what we agreed made without further approval.There is a question of how practical Dáil approval for every change might be, but I would tend to err on the side of caution. In the Single Resolution Board (Loan Facility Agreement) Act, the issue was that a call on the State to provide more money could be made beyond what was agreed without the Dáil having to approve such a change. We have strict rules over the money that can be spent in Bills, which I believe is an archaic system, yet when it comes to the international agreement a blank cheque can be written. I note that because of the constitutional limitations, there is much tighter democratic control here, which I welcome. Development banks are good and we should use them more. Our take-up of the European Investment Bank, EIB, funding remains too low, even during a housing crisis, and there is a huge deviation between the current position on our capital investment and where it needs to be. The State investment arms are not necessarily doing the maximum they could be doing, for example, we could be tapping into greater funding from the EIB. However, we support the Bill which we welcome.
#GraceOSullivan	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-party	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-dob	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	163	I welcome the Minister of State. The Bill is very welcome. It is good to see Ireland engaging in the global challenge of providing the infrastructure for sustainable development and co-operation with a wide range of other countries. It is in line with our policy for international development and our commitments to human rights and climate justice. However, Ireland’s strong international development policy and our commitment to food security in developing countries makes our failure to address climate issues at home even more embarrassing. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, AIIB, is a more inclusive institution that moves away from western-led world governance to east-west co-operation. As a result, it has the power to influence and shape globalisation for the better. It is vital that the AIIB practises what it preaches and is held to respecting human rights and the right to sustainable development. The establishment of a new bank is an opportunity to learn from the mistakes of other international development banks such as the World Bank. Unfortunately, in the name of development, mistakes have been made and grave injustices committed. Actions have been taken in developed countries like Ireland, but even more so in developing countries, which have not respected human rights and have damaged the natural environment on which we all depend. International financial institutions have frequently been the plunderers of fossil fuel investments, mega-dams and other projects that have dispossessed local indigenous populations, destroyed local environments, reduced biodiversity and increased greenhouse gas emissions. As an example, the International Finance Corporation, IFC, the World Bank’s private sector arm, has funded some of the South-East Asia and Pacific region’s most destructive projects, contravening the IFC’s performance standards and its own social and environmental guidelines. These projects include mega-hydropower dams in Vietnam and Cambodia, dirty coal fired power plants and mines in the Philippines, Vietnam and Myanmar, and massive industrial land grabs in Cambodia and Laos. The AIIB has made commitments to human rights and protecting the environment, but, as the Minister of State will be aware, the difficult part is putting the commitments into practice and working out sustainable development on the ground. As an example of the difficulties of practical application, the independent watchdog of the International Finance Corporation, the Office of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman, found systemic non-compliance by the corporation with its own policies and procedures across all stages of the investment process. All the signs are that the AIIB is coming up against real challenges. The AIIB is just getting going, but already there are debates between AIIB members, some of whom, astonishingly, want the bank to fund coal and nuclear power. In Ireland, we have had our own experiences of communities divided by fossil fuel infrastructure projects. We have learned that local Irish communities must be included in the decisions made about them. We must apply this learning abroad and ensure communities in developing countries are not similarly undermined by projects funded by Irish investments. As one of its international priorities, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was due to publish its National Plan on Business and Human Rights in the first quarter of 2017. The plan is aimed at implementing the 2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It will provide Irish companies with guidance on how to ensure respect for human rights in their activities at home and abroad. The action plan aims to also build on Ireland’s national plan on corporate social responsibility, which was published by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in April 2014. In that context, it is welcome that Ireland is bringing its voice and its strong international development policy to the AIIB. The AIIB can benefit from the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the areas of business and human rights. At the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade NGO forum on business and human rights in November 2014, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, stated:Ireland has an opportunity to become a leader in the area of business and human rights. However, I worry that the current delay in publishing the National Action Plan will have implications for financial investments under the AIIB.The concept paper Public Development Banks: Towards a Better Model, published in April 2017 by Eurodad, argues that private investment can have positive outcomes, but historically, infrastructure development has been primarily publicly financed. Multilateral development banks like the European Investment Bank, EIB, and the World Bank must prioritise development outcomes over profit to lift countries into the position of being able to build their own infrastructure rather than being reliant on private investment whose interests may align with profit over the public good. Ireland, having once been a colonised country with a commodity export dependent economy, well understands the need for independence in setting a country’s priorities. We can play a mediating role in ensuring the AIIB supports infrastructure development that benefits communities and helps countries transition to a sustainable and beneficial development model away from a commodity-dependent development trajectory. The purpose of our amendment is simply to ensure we in the Oireachtas give the Minister a clear mandate to operate on the basis of our existing policies. It makes good sense that the environmental, climate and human rights principles we develop for Irish companies operating in Ireland and abroad should be applied to our financial investment activity overseas. The amendment, in setting out our mandate, starts by emphasising three main areas of concern, namely, human rights, climate change and biodiversity. Our amendment also mandates that Ireland promote, in the work of the bank: the development of human rights and other environmental safeguards to achieve the objectives; the implementation of effective remedies for failings; the operation of due diligence processes and public consultation with affected or potentially affected communities; and the implementation of international standards relating to responsible lending and borrowing. The second subsection requires the Minister to report annually to the Dáil on membership of the bank and the steps taken in accordance with the first subsection. The amendments will strengthen Ireland’s reputation as a mediator on the international stage in regard to development, business and human rights.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-07-18 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	164	I will start with the issue of the protection of human rights and the environment. A development should not be at the expense of vulnerable communities or the environment. We will work to ensure the bank has a positive impact in that regard. The bank's environmental and social framework released in early 2016 recognises and makes provision for issues such as climate change, gender, biodiversity, resettlement, labour practices and indigenous peoples. The true test of such a framework will be its implementation. However, it is an important building block and a notable public commitment to which the AIIB can be held accountable. Regarding measures to combat climate change in particular, the AIIB has an opportunity to make a major contribution. Through its focus on infrastructure, it can lay the foundation for a transition to more suitable, sustainable economic growth. That is particularly important in a region such as Asia which already accounts for 60% of the world's population. Every year the population of Asia increases by 42 million people. The AIIB is clearly aware of the role it can play in this regard and has committed to being a green bank. It recently released its energy strategy which promises to uphold the Paris Agreement on climate change and assess its clients in meeting its targets under the agreement. There was also the issue of reporting and oversight. The Government is cognisant of the importance of transparency and openness in the use of Government funding and will endeavour to ensure there is an appropriate level of reporting and oversight. I will consider what the Senators have said. I wish to clarify the issue of the State being out of pocket by not being a founder member. The State is in no way disadvantaged financially by joining the AIIB now as a regular member rather than having joined as a founding member. Each share in the bank has a par value of $100,000. Ireland would have paid the same amount per share, irrespective of the day on which we joined or our status in doing so. As the Minister for Finance outlined to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, it is true that had Ireland joined as a founding member, it would have received an additional 600 founding member votes. However, voting rights are not equivalent to shares and do not determine the extent of our financial commitment. In the event that any income of the bank is distributed to members, it will be distributed in proportion to the number of shares a member holds. I will try to ensure I respond to any question I am unable to answer or that I have missed on the next Stage. With regard to Senator Kieran O'Donnell's questions, our shareholding will be 0.14%. A sum of €100 million will be callable but our experience with other financial development banks is that these moneys are never called. While one can never say never, there is some risk, but we consider that risk to be negligible. I do not have the answer to the question about becoming a member of the board. Opportunities for Irish companies will most likely be in the services sector. We have a strong service sector in construction in respect of quantity surveying and civil engineering. The funding streams the AIIB will operate will be similar to the European Investment Bank. Equity funds that are based all over Europe are used to establish the funding requirements of financial development banks of this type. Financial services, quantity surveying and civil engineering would be the likely sources of opportunities.
