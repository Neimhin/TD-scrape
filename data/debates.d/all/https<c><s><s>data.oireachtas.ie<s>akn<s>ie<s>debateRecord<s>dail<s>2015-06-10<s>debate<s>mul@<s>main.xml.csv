#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	The reality of the economic situation and the public expenditure corrections which had to be made in recent years presented challenges across all areas of public expenditure, including higher education. The sector has responded well to these challenges and has continued to provide opportunities for increasing numbers of students wishing to undertake a higher education qualification. In recognition of the pressures that higher education institutions are under an expert group chaired by Peter Cassells has been established to examine future funding options for higher education. The objective is to identify a range of approaches which, combined, will achieve a sustainable funding base to address the continual expansion of the sector while protecting the quality of education. The group is due to report at the end of this year and its report will help inform decisions on future funding for the sector. I believe that seeking to pre-empt the conclusions of the group at this stage is unhelpful.

There is a real crisis in our third level sector. As pointed out by Mr. Boland in his commentary, there has been a 15% increase in third level student numbers over the past five years and alongside that, a 12% reduction in staff numbers. Overall, there was a 24% reduction, per student, in State funding during that period, leading to real pressures across the college system and a deterioration in pupil-teacher ratios. Undoubtedly, this has put massive pressure on the sector and has affected the quality of third level education. Meanwhile, the Government refuses to address this issue, to be up-front about it or even acknowledge it. As in the case of other issues, this can is being kicked down the road. The Government has sought reports previously from the Higher Education Authority but has failed to act on them.

I seek the views of the Minister on the comments of the HEA chief executive on whether it is acceptable to continue to expect colleges to accept further students without provision of the necessary funding to cater for them. I ask the Minister to address that specific point.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	As Deputy McConalogue knows, there has been pressure across all sectors of the education system as well as across all Departments because of the need to cut funding over the past number of years. The Deputy knows well why that was the case. The higher education sector has responded well to the increased student numbers and continues to provide an excellent education for people in Ireland wishing to go on to higher education. Internationally, comparisons are very good. Ireland has a very high reputation in terms of its higher education and a high transfer of young people from post-primary to higher education. I attended an international conference in University College Dublin last night at which the response, generally, from the international guests regarding the quality of education in Ireland at higher level was very positive. I commend the universities and institutes of technology for what they have done with the reduced funding, which was an inevitable consequence of the economic crash and they know that. As I said previously, as soon as we are in recovery, we will start to look at putting some money back into all sectors in education. We got an increase in our budget last year but we are still not in a position to put significant moneys back into the education sector. That is the reality. Mr. Cassells's report will inform where we go in the future. 
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	We all recall the promise made by the Labour Party in advance of the last general election, namely, that it would reduce the student contribution fee to €1,500. Instead, what has happened is that each student attending third level education is now being asked to pay €3,000, which is twice the fee to which the Labour Party committed prior to the last general election. Also, not one euro of the additional €1,500 which students are now being charged over and above what the Labour Party promised they would be charged goes to the third level sector. It is being absorbed into the general Exchequer. Meanwhile, the students who are now paying more for their education are experiencing a reduced service. Student services have been cut radically because colleges do not have the funding to provide them. Students are also faced with increased pupil-teacher ratios as a result of reductions in staff.  Given the expected 30% increase in third level student numbers over the next 15 years the current situation is not sustainable and must be addressed by Government. The CEO of the Higher Education Authority has indicated to Government that this is simply not manageable and that additional funding is required. This is not an issue the Government can continue to kick down the road until after the next general election. We need a real and meaningful indication of what additional funding will be provided to cater for those additional students and real action to address the crisis facing the third level sector.

As I said earlier, the group will report at the end of this year, following which we will examine the options put forward. I agree with the Deputy that we need to plan for the future.  On the contribution from students, my predecessor made it clear that the fee would increase gradually year-on-year until it reached €3,000. That was made clear a couple of years ago and that is what is happening.However, the expert group is designed to ensure we look to, and plan for, the future so whoever is in Government after the next election will have clear guidance as to how we fund higher education into the future. It must be said that the sector has responded very well to the economic difficulties that every sector across every Department has had to confront. If one contrasts, for example, the situation in Britain with the situation here, the position of students here is not as financially pressured as it is for students in Britain. This is an issue that confronts other countries as well. We have put this expert group in place and it is doing really good work. I have already received an interim report from the group and it will make proposals for the future. As soon as we receive that report, we will debate it and make plans for the future.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	Is the Minister aware of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, school leavers study that provided conclusive evidence of the importance of guidance counselling to students from lower socio-economic groups? Is she further aware that schools in that group cannot provide sufficient guidance counselling services within their current teaching allocation? What are her plans to rectify this?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	I am aware of the study referred to by the Deputy. In any discussion about guidance, it is important to note that guidance is a whole school responsibility and does not just involve the guidance counsellor. All teachers and school leaders have a role in the pastoral care of their students, including providing them with regular and ongoing guidance. All schools are required to provide guidance, notwithstanding the budget measure in 2012 which means that it must be managed within a school's standard staffing allocation. This budget measure was introduced as an alternative to a 0.6 adjustment to the standard staffing schedule. My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools most in need of support. I have repeatedly argued that improvements to the staffing and funding of our schools must be a priority as the economic recovery takes hold. In the last budget, I secured the first increase in education spending over recent years, and I fully intend to continue arguing for increased investment in education in advance of the forthcoming budget.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	The changes to the general allocation model for guidance counsellors, making them ex-quota, has entrenched inequality in schools. All of the research indicates that. If one looks at schools within the free education system and those within the fee paying system, there is a clear difference in the amount of guidance counselling being provided. Obviously that is due to the fact that those in the private system are being subsidised by parents. With regard to DEIS schools, in a later question we will discuss the recent evaluation report on DEIS, but even that report states that the ex-quota allocation for guidance will have serious implications for young people in DEIS schools. Many DEIS schools have previously been in receipt of additional guidance resources through the guidance enhancement initiative but its abolition is likely to lead to even greater difficulties in combining the education, guidance and personal counselling elements of the guidance counsellor role leading to reduced resources. It is quite clear that the proposal introduced in the budget is having a detrimental effect on schools for pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Those students are facing real challenges so this must be reversed.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	When the measure was introduced, specific measures were implemented for DEIS schools to protect them, to some extent, from the changes relating to guidance. The idea was that they would get the extra resources to ensure that they protected guidance in their schools. As the Deputy said, we are reviewing DEIS and that is one area we can examine in the review to see what the schools have done to protect guidance. Also, it should be noted that in the new junior cycle agreement, which has not yet been balloted on but which we hope will receive a positive vote in the autumn, there is a new subject called "well-being" which will be studied by all pupils. It will be compulsory. The parameters of that subject are about students having self-esteem and ensuring that students are able to protect themselves from psychological difficulties and so forth. I believe that will contribute to one of the areas that guidance counsellors deal with, which is individual student's concerns. The other area obviously relates to career guidance.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	The Minister talked about the additional supports that were put in place on the back of the cuts announced in the budget. A response to a parliamentary question I tabled stated that there is a range of supports available to promote and support the well-being of students. It stated that National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing school support teams. The problem with that, however, is that the service does not have the personnel or resources to implement the guidelines. Well-being guidelines for post-primary and, more recently, for primary schools have been produced by the Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, HSE. According to the Department, the guidelines are informed by consultation with key education and health partners and by the findings of current research. However, we do not have a full allocation of NEPS psychologists because some of them are out on maternity leave or sick leave. The Department suggests the use of NEPS psychologists to promote well-being within the schools as one of the supports being put in place, but at the same time schools are complaining that they cannot get access to NEPS psychologists to do the job they are employed to do, which is to assess students with special educational needs. There is a contradiction in what the Minister and the Department are saying, and that must be addressed.

The Deputy's point appears to be that there might be issues with the recruitment of staff, but I will revert to the Deputy on that if there are specific issues in that regard. We are also working on reforming the support system for children with special needs, but that will not be introduced this September except on a pilot basis. To refer to the original point about resourcing, I have indicated that I will examine the options available in the budget when we get whatever budget we are allocated. Obviously, we will fight for the best budget we can get for education. Certainly, guidance is one of the issues that has been raised with me when I have travelled around the country to meet various stakeholder bodies in education and, indeed, the guidance counsellors are well able to make their case as well. The issue is not closed. It is one that, along with a number of other areas, will be examined in the context of available resources at budget time.

Does she accept that overcrowded classes are not good for children, education, teachers or generally for broader society? In a recent survey of teachers' stress and workload, 90% of teachers said that teaching has become more stressful, demanding, challenging and hectic. This is directly linked to the size of primary school classes in 2015.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	This question indicates the number of different pressures there are on the budget and the different issues being raised in the context of any increased funding we will have. My focus in budget 2015 was on obtaining the additional funding that was necessary to provide for demographic growth. This funding is being used to provide 1,700 additional teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, for our primary and post-primary schools in the coming school year. This comes on top of an extra approximately 2,300 teachers in our schools over the past two years. The Deputy will be aware that I announced some improvements in the staffing schedule for small primary schools in February 2015. These are the only changes that I will be making to the staffing arrangements for schools for the 2015-16 school year. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers. In addressing the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, congress earlier this year, I made it clear that I personally believe that improving class sizes could deliver better outcomes, and that reducing class sizes will be a personal and political priority for me during 2015. However, that is a priority that will require negotiation in advance of the forthcoming budget.

In her response to the question, the Minister touched on the issue of economic growth and development. As far as I am concerned, there is a strong link between class size and economic growth and development. This growth is also linked strongly to education. We have heard this morning, for example, that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, expressed concerns, with respect to the positive economic growth figures next year, about overheating the economy. There is a debate - I am sure it takes place in Cabinet - as to whether we should have tax cuts or improved public services. I ask the Minister to ensure that as part of that debate, the focus should be put on public services. There is a solution to be found here in that we can assist primary school pupils in the State while preventing the economy from overheating. We should not just throw extra cash into the broader society. I welcome this morning's good growth figures but we have an opportunity to calm down. If we have any extra resources or moneys in the October budget, they should be spent on services.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	It is on the record now.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	We need to get the balance right between expenditure on areas like education and health, in particular, and whatever other measures will be taken in the budget. I will certainly be seeking extra funding. Addressing the pupil-teacher ratio as soon as we can, economically speaking, is something that should be done. Until now, I have only had enough money to be able to address some of the issues around smaller schools, as announced earlier in the year. As I have mentioned, this is a personal priority. We will have to measure demographic growth, which will take some of the extra money we will get for providing extra teachers and special needs assistants, etc. There will also be other budgetary demands, although this will be one of my priorities.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	It is important that the broader society generally knows of the importance of education because during the last number of difficult years, one of the arguments used for us to get out of this economic mess was the importance of education. That work has already started but it needs to be developed. It is very well to talk about class sizes but there is also the matter of educational disadvantage, with 138,000 children in the State living in poverty. That consistent poverty has increased from 6.8% in 2008 to 11.7%. Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, has indicated we could have 37,000 children living in poverty in 2020, and there are 1,054 who are currently homeless. I am linking this to broader education. If there are warm, happy schools in disadvantaged areas, they can do much to deal with issues like poverty and economic and social disadvantage. For many children at risk, the most stable part of the day can be the five hours in a local primary school. People often miss that in serious issues like educational disadvantage or poverty in modern society.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	I agree with the Deputy and I see every day when I go into schools the particular importance of early years in school for children who come from homes where there may not be many books, or where parents do not have much time to engage with children. I agree with the Deputy, and that is one of the reasons I set up the early years inspection team for the educational element. That is why we are reviewing DEIS to ensure it is thoroughly effective. From what we know, it is producing good results but it has not been reviewed since 2006. This is absolutely crucial to children in the primary school sector and particularly the early years of that sector. Involvement with parents is another matter that we must improve in whatever way we can. For example, the parent and student charter will assist in engaging parents more in the life of the school and children in school.

How many schools were involved in polling activities? Will the Minister work with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to ensure that between now and the next general election, within the next year, there will be a full audit carried out to assess what community facilities are available to use as alternatives to primary schools? In the vast majority of instances, as a result of the development of community facilities, sports clubs and community halls over the past number of years, there are real alternatives available to the use of schools, which in the distant past were the only options in many communities. There are alternatives and it is important that we make every effort to ensure they are used.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	Returning officers are statutorily responsible for the conduct of elections and may, under electoral law, use school premises for this purpose. Schools that have been identified as polling stations do not require the approval of my Department to close on polling day and, accordingly, data in respect of the number of schools are not readily available within my Department. Overall responsibility for the running of elections and referenda is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. I note that for many years there has been an ongoing campaign for polling to take place on Saturdays, which would prevent the loss of any school days. In light of this, the children's referendum was held on a Saturday, with 33.5% of eligible voters taking part. This was obviously a disappointing turnout, which raises further questions about the best day for polling. The most recent referendums took place on a Friday, with 60.5% of eligible voters taking part, the highest turnout in many years. The establishment of an independent electoral commission will allow for a much more detailed analysis of electoral turnout on different days of the week across different jurisdictions. The commission will be best placed to advise on the most appropriate venues to be used as polling stations, and I look forward to engaging with the commission on the use of school premises for that purpose.

I am very disappointed in the reply she has given, as the Minister has really not engaged in any way on the question I put for consideration. She has diverted the issue to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, as well as county registrars, by saying it is their responsibility. The Minister has indicated it is not the concern of her Department as to whether schools close on polling day and county registrars can close schools if they wish. The Department does not even seem to take note of how many schools are closed on polling days, which is an absolution of departmental responsibilities of monitoring what schools are open. Even after the putting of this question, the Department has not decided to check how many schools were closed.

There have been seven referendums or elections since the last general election, with one polling day on a Saturday. At least half the primary schools, in my rough assessment, were closed across the country for use as polling stations. That would mean at least €70 million or €80 million would be the cost of lost school days but the Department has no interest in assessing it. From an educational perspective, there is no reason to close schools as there is viable alternative accommodation in every county. The Minister is ignoring this question from an educational perspective, which is unacceptable.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	I did not say I had no interest.I said a commission is being set up, and that will have the opportunity to examine the entire area. Something it should examine is whether there are alternative locations but in terms of the places in my constituency where voting takes place, I am not sure if there are alternative locations in every area for the number of polling booths that would be needed. For example, where I vote there are at least five polling stations within the one school. In terms of finding an alternative location where I live, I cannot think of any alternative to the school but I hope that will be an issue that can be examined. Allowing polling to take place on a Saturday is probably a more viable alternative but that may pose a difficulty. It may have been the subject matter of the recent referendums but there was a turnout of 33% for one while the turnout for the other was 60%. I acknowledge there was a higher turnout for the marriage referendum than would normally be expected for a referendum but it may be more viable to consider using Saturdays as a date for referenda. That would be my personal opinion. I understand my predecessor also spoke to the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government about the issue of identifying alternative venues and it is something I will certainly follow up on but there is not an easy answer to that because we have to achieve a balance between wanting people to have their democratic opportunity to vote and ensuring that children are not taken out of school unnecessarily. It is about getting that balance right, but there is not an easy answer to it.

In cases where there is not an alternative available there is no problem with the school closing but this problem does not require a commission to be established. It does not require putting forward the idea that this involves moving to Saturday polling instead. What is generally required is a proper audit and assessment in each area as to whether there is a suitable alternative venue available in each community and where that is the case, the local sports hall, GAA facilities, soccer club or parish hall should be used instead. I know of many in my constituency. In my local polling station there was one polling booth yet there were seven classrooms in the school all closed for that day. One of those rooms, the general purpose hall, was used yet 400 yards down the road, there was a community centre which had even more space available. That is the case in the vast majority of instances but the Minister is refusing to engage and grasp this nettle. She is standing over a situation where each time a referendum is held many schools, and she cannot even tell me the number but it is well over half of all primary schools, have to close down. That means that on election day those parents have to either find child care for their children for that day or take a day off school.

She should engage with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and ensure there is real change and a real assessment so that this situation will not arise again.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	I have engaged and will engage again with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and I am not refusing to grasp any nettle. In the rural areas the Deputy describes there may be alternative venues in various communities such as community halls, sports clubs and so on but in urban areas there is a large population in a smaller area more closely together. In terms of all the polling stations in my constituency, in most cases there is probably no alternative to the school. That is the reality. Should we then have some schools closing and others not closing, which is what might result?

That is the appropriate forum to deal with the issue. I will make representations to it in terms of the education side of it and we will try to ensure that, where possible, schools are not used for polling stations. The fact is that, ultimately, the responsibility is not mine. It lies within the other Department, and it has the authority to decide that a school is needed for a polling station. It is an issue we will address but there is no silver bullet to solve it.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	On the previous issue, unfortunately, in my constituency there are no alternative locations either bar the local school. It may be different in rural areas but certainly in urban areas the school is the most appropriate venue. My question is to ask the Minister's views on the recent evaluation report into DEIS, her proposals arising from that report and actions her Department will undertake to improve the scheme.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I have recently begun a process to renew the DEIS programme. This process involves a number of strands which will operate concurrently over the coming school year. These strands include, first, the current consultation with education partners on appropriate interventions to tackle educational disadvantage; second, the establishment of an interdepartmental group to ensure a joined-up approach to future delivery of services in the DEIS programme; third, the establishment of a technical group to develop criteria for a new identification process for which schools should participate in the DEIS programme; and, fourth, the establishment of a DEIS advisory group within my Department. Terms of reference for these three groups are currently being finalised. All aspects of the DEIS programme will be considered as part of this work, including development of criteria to identify schools for inclusion in the programme and appropriate interventions that build on the positive outcomes being observed in DEIS.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	I will ask some questions in my supplementaries about some of her proposals but regarding the terms of reference which are being drawn up, it is important as an Opposition spokesperson to point out some of the issues I believe should be included in those terms of reference. The first is to examine the issue of funding. There is no doubt that the Government has done its best to try to protect funding for DEIS schools. However, there has been a significant cut in other aspects in regard to DEIS band 1 schools. I refer to the loss of language support teachers, the loss of visiting teacher services and the reduction in the school completion programmes. With regard to funding, there must be a recognition that while additional funding is going into DEIS band 1 schools, there is less likelihood of voluntary contributions coming into those schools so there must be some mention in the terms of reference on how funding is being allocated. I will come back to the other points.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	I will be happy to take suggestions on this from the Opposition spokespersons. I agree with the Deputy that we will have to ensure that we protect funding, and there will be issues around new schools coming in and protecting funding for existing schools. That will have to be central to the decisions that are made on foot of the review. Protecting that funding in terms of the allocation for the next budget will be my responsibility. Obviously, schools not currently in the DEIS programme will be applying and we will have to ensure that there is funding available to accommodate that. The intention is to continue what is positive and good about DEIS, and there is a lot of positivity in terms of the outcomes. For example, one of the outcomes we have seen in the recent numeracy and literacy results is that while there has been an improvement in DEIS schools there has also been an improvement in other schools. The gap has not narrowed, and that is something we will have to examine.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	When we look at the differences, the gap is somewhere in the region of 0.2%. One of the proposals the Minister has examined is the establishment of an interdepartmental group. When will that happen? What Departments will be represented? What form of consultation will take place? Will a timeframe be put on that? When will it report back? Will there be an interim report? Given that we are in the final 12 months of this Government, it would be important that we would try to get those consultation processes under way as quickly as possible and to have them report back, if possible before the upcoming budget because I am sure some of the recommendations and outcomes of that consultation process will feed into the budgetary process.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I expect to get an update shortly on these matters in terms of the setting up of the groups and so on. I will come back to the Deputy when I have that information. I do not have an exact timeframe at this stage, and we are working on the terms of reference. I will come back to the Deputy as soon as I have that information.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	Would it be possible to get a copy of the draft terms of reference and for myself and Deputy McConalogue to be allowed have some input into the process?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	I have not got them myself yet but certainly it would be a good idea that the Deputy has an idea of what they contain. The most important Departments in this regard are the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which deals with issues such as school completion, and the Department of Social Protection, which organises programmes such as the school meals programme. There are probably some other Departments that should also be included.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	How many people are currently training as apprentices and what plans are there for apprenticeships in the future? Would the Minister of State agree that we need a major expansion in both the number of apprenticeships and the areas covered by them?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	I agree we need to expand the areas covered and believe there is cross-party support for that. This is something we have been involved in with the setting up of the new apprenticeship council. Expansion is part of the Government's plan and we have addressed the issue at Cabinet, where there is agreement across the table that this should happen and that we should increase the number of apprenticeships on offer. At 30 April 2015, there was a total of 7,398 apprentices actively engaged with the apprenticeship system. There were 1,521 in the construction sector, 2,724 in the electrical sector, 1,340 in the engineering sector, 1,792 in the motor sector and 21 in the printing sector. These figures represent an approximately 40% increase on the registrations since 2013. Numbers are up in existing apprenticeships, a positive development, and we expect these numbers to continue rising over the next three years to 2018. In regard to new types of apprenticeship, the Apprenticeship Council of Ireland was set up last September-October and it called for proposals from the public in January this year. The council received 86 separate proposals for new apprenticeships from 48 organisations before the 31 March deadline. This is a competitive process, but there has been a very strong response and submissions which will lead to qualifications at a range of levels were received from a wide range of sectors. There was a particularly strong interest from the manufacturing and engineering sector, accounting for 24 submissions. A substantial number of proposals were also received from areas such as the built environment, tourism and sport and financial services. The council is currently in the process of evaluating submissions and it is required to report to the Department by 30 June. We have a strong belief that we need to provide young people with a broad range of education and training options which give them fulfilment and prepare them for work and for life. The idea behind apprenticeships is that people are provided with a blend of education and on and off the job training. However, these apprenticeships must be employer led and driven. We look forward to making significant progress in expanding the range of apprenticeships available in Ireland over the coming months and in 2016. The Deputy may rest assured that it is our full intention to move forward on this.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	Will the Minister of State indicate his targets in respect to the number of apprentices he would like to see involved in the various areas eventually? What are the targets? What capacity is there for dealing with the level of applications? In other words, how many have applied for each apprenticeship and how many have been facilitated? Am I correct that the number of applicants far exceeds the capacity to facilitate them? Will the Minister of State also comment on the perception that there is significant emphasis on directing young people into third level? Are there any plans to try to rebalance that, because third level is not for everybody?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	I will begin with the last question. I agree there is too much emphasis on third level and during the boom years or over the past 20 years we have probably turned our backs on the further education and training sector. I sense that most people recognise now we must correct that and the Department is trying to do so. From talking to career guidance teachers, to teachers in general and to employers, I believe most people now believe we need a blend of further education and training along with higher education. We need that blend to manage the problem with the skills gap as we know jobs are being created that we cannot fill. They will only be filled by providing the skills through a combination of higher education and further education and training. We are trying to correct the situation and have a five-year plan, developed by SOLAS, which should address the issue. There has been significant reform in the sector and SOLAS and our educational training boards, ETBs, are driving that agenda. The challenge facing us is to convince parents, decision makers and students that there are options and many different routes to developing a career and obtaining the qualifications needed.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	Will the Minister of State comment on the Department's targets? What numbers would it like to see in apprenticeships? Will he also comment on the level of interest and the capacity to facilitate those interested? What is the State's role in providing apprenticeships and what is it doing?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	Apprenticeships must be employer driven and employers must be involved. On capacity, it is a bit of a chicken and egg situation. We needed to find out what was wanted and needed and we put significant effort, through various Departments such as the Departments of Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, into getting people interested in this issue and to get people to make proposals. We have those proposals now and the apprenticeship council must assess which of the 86 submissions are viable and needed. The council will make recommendations on which and how many proposals should result in full apprenticeships and may make recommendations that some are suited to a different route, such as a traineeship. When we receive the report in June, we must assess what is required to make this happen. Many of the proposals will be acted on this year or next. No curriculum for them has been developed yet as they are still proposals. The apprenticeship council, SOLAS and the Department will assess how many can be implemented. The Deputy asked what was our target, but we do not have a specific target in each area. We know that in sectors such as haulage, there is a requirement for approximately 1,000 extra drivers per year over the next four or five years. This has been assessed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. We must decide how many of these positions should be filled through apprenticeships. SOLAS will monitor the numbers required in all sectors and we will not repeat what happened previously, where there were far too many apprenticeships in some sectors, leaving people high and dry when the crash came. The situation will be managed nationally by SOLAS, which will work with the ETBs, institutes of technology and other providers to get the numbers right. We are trying to respond to the need, but first we needed to get the proposals and examine them to see what is needed. We may require legislation for this, but we will certainly require extra resources. We must find the way to make that happen and intend to do that.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I fully support the initiative the Department is undertaking in regard to apprenticeships, which I believe are a key economic driver now and for the future. We need to learn from the past situation where we tailored our apprenticeships for the here and now, for example, for construction. When the construction area blew up, we ended up with people without skills in other areas. We need to factor this into decisions in regard to apprenticeships. SOLAS will play a key role and it is already developing an apprenticeship model for the hotel sector which will be rolled out in the last quarter of this year. We need to diversify our apprenticeship models and keep in mind future trends and ensure people are skilled so that when there is a crash in one sector, they will be able to sidestep into a different profession quickly and easily.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to cater for now and for the future. Some of the sectors that have made proposals are the hotel and catering sector and manufacturing and engineering, with 24 submissions. There were 12 submissions in the built environment area, ten in tourism, ten in financial services, eight in arts, crafts and media, six in information technology, six in transport logistics, four in business administration management, three in the agriculture, horticulture and marine sector, two in natural resources and one in sales and marketing. As I said, the process is competitive and not all of the proposals will win through. Some will be found not fit for purpose in the assessment process which is taking place currently. SOLAS has a major role to play here, working with the apprenticeship council, to ensure we get right an estimate of the number of apprenticeships we need. We cannot allow an over supply of the skills required, but there is an under supply currently. SOLAS must work with employers to ensure there is a proper blend of on the job training and education and to ensure apprenticeships are adaptable to circumstances. They may be from two to four years and involve different levels of education. It must ensure the apprenticeship model is strong and the balance is right and that if a sector hits a low point, the apprentice's skills will be transferable to another sector.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	Will the Minister consider introducing a scheme to facilitate early school leavers, because currently approximately 20% of students disengage from second level education?The scheme would engage students for a period of three to four years in an apprenticeship which would be particularly suitable for the skills required by modern employers in industry, including the manufacturing and service industries. The scheme is already in place in Europe, in particular, Germany. It is called the baccalaureate system. It allows students to continue their education on a 50% basis and they are seconded to an apprenticeship on a 50% basis, which runs concurrently. Will the Minister consider seriously the introduction of such a scheme?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	The Deputy may be aware of a report from last February showing that of students who started post-primary school in 2008 almost 97% sat the junior certificate and more than 90% sat the leaving certificate. Ireland's upper secondary retention rates compare favourably with other EU member states. In Ireland we have a broad and balanced model of education which seeks not to compartmentalise students' learning at too early an age. An expert independent group has recently recommended against making employment-based training programmes or apprenticeships available to Irish students under 16. We also currently provide vocational opportunities through the leaving certificate vocational programme. This programme is taken by about 30% of students and combines academic subjects with so-called link modules which focus on enterprise and preparation for the world of work. The leaving certificate applied also provides vocational opportunities for senior cycle students. Pathways like Youthreach give such options for early school leavers. Work experience also features prominently in transition year, which is taken by two thirds of 15 and 16 year olds. Ireland is moving in the right direction in providing a broad balanced education for students, while having regard to best practice in other countries. On the apprenticeship issue, we are really talking about students aged 16 years and upwards in full apprenticeships which involves employers and so forth, on which the Minister of State, Deputy English, has just spoken.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	Students are disengaging from school or dropping out in first or second year for various social reasons - for instance, some pupils are not academic. Those who are lost in the system are going down a cul-de-sac and have nowhere to go. We know the consequences of that. They can find themselves in an undesirable situation, which can pose huge problems for families and communities. I am not condemning anyone as such because they are victims, perhaps, of our system. It is time to grasp the nettle. I understand the Minister's explanation but the percentages and statistics I have been given are alarming. Will the Minister review the matter? We can look to the European systems, which are very successful. Employers are looking for matching skills. If these people could come out of our education system at 18 or 19 years of age with sufficient training, this is something we cannot ignore.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	As indicated in the response of the Minister of State, Deputy English, we are looking seriously at widening the whole concept of apprenticeships and providing that alternative path for students as a real career opportunity and we are encouraging parents to see that as an absolutely viable and equal alternative. We do not favour children setting out on that path at too early an age. Some 97% of children sit the junior cycle examinations. The percentages that drop out at that early age are actually very small. We want students to stay in school until they are 16. The junior cycle reform, on which I have been working fairly hard since I became Minister, is precisely about giving the opportunity to value different students and their different skills, which is why we want assessment in the school of group work, practical work and so on. That is specifically designed to address students who are disengaged at that early age and to ensure they are valued for their skills and abilities. I stand over that policy. We want children to stay in school until they are 16 and then have the different pathways.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	The vocational model currently utilised in Germany, in particular, is of high quality and is successful on the Continent. We would want to look more closely at it. We also have to examine the needs of employers and the quality of qualifications. In some cases, employers may have to wait too long to get people who may be coming out of third level but who may not have degrees that are suitable to the current requirements of employers. We also have to look at the demands made by foreign direct investment. We are not satisfying the needs of those people either. The other matter I raise is modern languages-----

Unfortunately, the tenderer pulled out. Will the Minister provide an update on that project and the commitment to it?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	I advise the Deputy that the new school building project in County Galway is at an advanced stage of architectural planning. The design team is preparing to retender the project following difficulties with the first tender exercise. The new pre-qualification of contractors list has been finalised and the revised stage 2b cost plan is currently being examined by my Department. The project is on my Department's five-year construction programme and will soon be progressed through the new tender process. It is anticipated that the design team will shortly be in a position to issue tender documents to the selected contractors and, subject to no issues arising, construction of the new school should commence before the end of 2015.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I thank the Minister for the reply. It is welcome that progress is being made and that construction will start before the end of 2015. This project has been long sought. There was an 11-year campaign for it. I commend the work of my colleague, Councillor Eileen Mannion, who has worked tirelessly on this project. It was great news in 2013 when the Minister's predecessor announced, under that capital plan, that Clifden community school was to progress to a new build. It has a huge catchment area. There are 400 pupils in the area, stretching from Roundstone across to Maam and Leenane, and obviously the existing facilities are not fit for purpose. It was unfortunate that the original tenderer pulled out for whatever reason, but I am delighted to see that work is continuing to retender this project and that the Department is committed to construction starting in 2015. I thank the Minister for her response and I am sure that she will continue to ensure to keep a close eye on this important project for the north Connemara area.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	In July 2014, EU Directive EN-1090-1 came into force requiring all structural steelwork in the European Union to be CE-marked. The training, testing and certification costs involved in the CE-marking process can cost a business anywhere between €20,000 and €30,000. The only State assistance available is a 20% discount on training costs through Skillnets which amounts to about €200, a pittance of the overall cost. Does the Minister have any plans, in conjunction with the other relevant Departments, to introduce a specific training grant to assist small steel fabricators to comply with this EU directive?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	My Department has engaged with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, on this issue. An information leaflet is being prepared for the sector for distribution through local enterprise offices, LEOs. In 2015, education and training boards, ETBs, and institutes of technology will offer over 2,000 places on a variety of welding courses. Typically, fees are not payable by unemployed people but are charged to those in employment. Subsidised training is also provided through two Skillnets networks in responsible welding co-ordinator training. While welding practices and co-ordination are important elements to compliance with this directive, it should be noted that other compliance elements need to be tailored to the specific workplace and cannot, therefore, be arranged through the mainstream education and training system. My Department funds ETBs and institutes of technology and provides co-financing to Skillnets but does not provide grants to employers to access training. It funds educational training provision in respect of welding skills, as well as responsible welding co-ordinator skills through the ETBs and the further and higher education system. There are several elements involved in the route to compliance with this directive regarding steel fabrication. Several of those elements, including factory production control procedures, welding process specifications and applications of the NSAI for audit and certification, require an audit and assessment of the workplace and cannot, therefore, be arranged through the mainstream education and training system.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	The Minister of State essentially said the Department is not structured to help out in a serious way. Too often when different Departments are involved in a matter like this, it just ends up being pushed around a bit. The firms in question generally employ between four and five people. They will not be able to come up with the kind of money in question. While regulation is good, this is more about bureaucracy and paperwork. Once the training and certification is obtained, the work is not tested anymore. It is like the lack of inspection in house building. In Britain, 70% of the cost is subsidised by the UK Government. If this Government is serious about small and medium-sized enterprises and wanting people to stay in business, it will have to help the firms in question because they will not be able to afford this certification. Over 1,000 companies will be affected by this.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	We are monitoring what is happening in other countries and I will check what is happening in the UK. We help with the training and qualifications end of this. Full-time and part-time courses are provided in all the areas affected by this directive through the ETBs and institutes of technology, as well as Skillnets which involves employers. There are many options available at the training end. However, some of this has to do with work practices in the workplace. This is not an area in which the Department of Education and Skills can get involved. I accept the Deputy’s point that the overall co-ordination is an extra burden on these companies. We are examining this through the LEOs. We are involved in the skills end of this but we do not have a role in the auditing of the workplace. That has to be arranged with the companies in question. Many employer groups are involved in this in terms of putting together various options. Skillnets is the place where we can enhance provision.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	The majority of the cost is the actual training. Does the Department subsidise the training? The certification comes after one passes the testing of the weld. The testing of the weld is done after one does the training; then one gets a certification if one passes. Is the Department subsidising the training end of this? It would beggar belief if we cannot find a way to keep these people in business.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	There are over 2,000 places for upskilling in this area through a combination of full-time and evening programmes. Some of this is subsidised. If one is unemployed, these courses are provided free by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. In other cases, there is a charge. A course is generally 25 weeks to 28 weeks long and costs usually between €250 to €300. This is generally paid for by the person themselves or by their employer. Skillnets, a combination of taxpayers’ and employers’ money, is where much of this training is provided. That is where the solution is. Maybe we can tailor the programme slightly differently to deal with this. I accept companies are under pressure with these new regulations but there are other directives that affect other companies in other areas. We must constantly ensure educational provision caters for that and takes on board new directives. In some cases, the actual on-the-job training is not a solution the Department can provide.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	The actual grant the Minister of State referred to is actually €200. Companies that have checked this out are looking at having to pay between €20,000 and €30,000 to get this done. Many of them are going to England because it is much cheaper there. One can get it done there for as low as €15,000. If one had a British passport, one could get a 75% subsidy from the UK Government on top of that. This directive will affect up to 5,000 jobs and push out the small man unless the Government does something active to help. It will be the bigger companies doing steel fabrication as a result. That would be a shame because the small firms that employ between four and five people are, from my experience, the best guys to do welding. They tend to be far more professional and good in their approach.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	I will investigate exactly what is on offer in England compared to here to see what the different systems provide and if there is anything to improve our provision. A range of options through many courses are being provided through various arms of the State. The Deputy is correct that the cost is often borne by a combination of employers, business owners and the taxpayer. I will certainly examine the UK system to see if it is placing our companies at a major disadvantage.

The review will analyse the status quo in higher education in respect of gender equality, examine the reasons for continuing gender inequality among staff across the sector and make recommendations to address this. These will include recommendations on how higher education institutions can enhance their equality policies and the implementation of those policies, as well as recommendations on how the HEA, my Department and other relevant bodies can support those institutions in that regard. The review is expected to conclude in June 2016 and will involve self-evaluation by the institutions concerned, as well as site visits by a review team.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	The reason I put down this question is due to the significant concerns at NUI Galway where four female lecturers have taken gender equality cases, three of whom have taken High Court cases and one who has gone to a tribunal. Professor Pat O’Connor, from the University of Limerick, an expert in gender equality, has turned down an invitation from the task force to advise it on gender inequality in third level institutions.The task force has been given the power to establish its own terms of reference, which, in my opinion, is a mistake. They should have been done independently and given to the task force. The terms of reference have been criticised by IFUT and SIPTU, which give full backing to the female lecturers in NUI Galway. Has the Minister seen the terms of reference? If not, why not? Will she also comment on the composition of the task force itself, which Professor Pat O'Connor has said is not made up of people with expertise in the area of gender equality?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	On the Galway situation, I have made my concerns very clear regarding the shortcomings identified by the Equality Tribunal, specifically in the case of Dr. Sheehy Skeffington. The fact that NUI Galway unreservedly accepted this and established a task force is to be welcomed. I have again stated clearly that the task force needs to have the confidence of people in NUI Galway and the body of the university. I have urged NUI Galway to make every effort to ensure it has this confidence. I have already stated these views. There is no doubt that higher education in Ireland has not promoted women in a way that would be expected in terms of the general population and the number of women academics. The fact that an Irish woman was recently given the most senior job in Oxford is an indication there is nothing wrong with Irish women's ability to have high office in universities. I strongly support the carrying out of the review. I have not seen the terms of reference. I have detail on what is intended to be done by the review team, but I have not seen the specific terms of reference. I am not certain whether they have been specifically drafted - I will check - but I have been given an indication of what they will be doing.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	As the Minister is aware, Dr. Sheehy Skeffington won the tribunal and was awarded €70,000, which she has donated towards the legal costs of the High Court action. The fact that the Minister has not seen the terms of reference is an indication of how NUI Galway is approaching the issue. There is considerable criticism from the female lecturers themselves as well as the unions representing them, IFUT and SIPTU, who have said there has been a considerable lack of consultation in drafting the terms of reference. As the Minister pointed out, unless there is confidence in the terms of reference and the ability of the task force to carry out the work it is supposed to carry out to look at gender inequality issues, and unless it has the support of the student body, the trade unions and the female lecturers, it is a dead duck before it even begins.

I have a list of what they will have regard to, including the statutory obligations; the obligations of universities and institutes of technology to prepare and implement equality policies; the complete self-evaluation questionnaires that will be submitted; site visits, which are important; and meetings with those institutions and with members of governing bodies, presidents and other senior officers responsible for equality matters, a cross-section of staff and student representatives of the relevant groups. This is the information I have on what they will look at.

They provide preschool education to young children with autism. I understand this funding comes from home tuition scheme payments. What is the status of these private organisations? Has a review of their effectiveness been carried out? How were decisions reached regarding the allocation of contracts and funding in each of these cases? I have asked the Minister and her predecessor this question on numerous occasions throughout the history of this Dáil without a satisfactory answer. The Minister recently sent me a detailed answer in written form but it raises many more questions.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	Where parents of children who are eligible for home tuition have sought alternative arrangements to be put in place for the tuition, the Department has responded by putting arrangements in place with six private preschool providers which provide group tuition to children in a class-type setting. Each of these providers was selected by the parents. The Department will consider similar arrangements with other private providers should parents of eligible children request this. In recognition of the demand for group arrangements by parents of children who are eligible for home tuition under the scheme, the Department now advises all such parents of the option of entering a group arrangement with other parents of children for whom home tuition has been sanctioned. Parents wishing to enter into such an arrangement must notify the Department in advance for approval. The arrangements must conform to the general terms of the scheme.

I have previously asked the Minister about the terms and conditions placed on service providers and about how the tendering process operates. In her lengthy written reply to me, the Minister mentioned a contract given to Jonix in 2008. Other organisations provide similar services, but no contracts were made with them. In her reply of 4 June the Minister also stated that the Department had no contract with preschool providers and it is essentially, as she reiterated today, between the parents and the relevant provider. How can it be the case that more than €3.2 million was paid to service providers who must adhere to certain conditions to qualify when the Minister states that she has no contract with them? What is the delay in publishing the policy report of the National Council for Special Education which was recommended by the Ombudsman for Children?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	We do not have any contracts. It is essentially the parents who choose the provider, and the arrangement is made between the parents or the group of parents and the provider. One organisation was agreed on back in 2008 and the rate was calculated on the basis of a collective rate for each group of six children, for whom the Department pays a sum equivalent to 48 hours calculated at the primary qualified rate and 72 hours calculated at the unqualified rate. There is a general procedure for home tuition which is used for these groups. This is the arrangement that has been there for some time and continues under the scheme, so the Department does not have a direct relationship. The Deputy asked me another question at the end.

I am not sure whether this is what the Deputy is asking about. We have decided that we do not have enough information, particularly on complex needs, to introduce the new model in September but we will introduce pilots of the model in September. I announced some variation, particularly on hours for children with Down's syndrome. The actual full new model will not be introduced in the next school year.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	101	The House and the people of Ireland owe a "Thank You" to Deputy Catherine Murphy for persistently bringing this matter to the attention of the people of Ireland and the Dáil. We must have openness and light on the biggest banking collapse in the civilised world to date. As an outcome Anglo Irish Bank, now IBRC, and NAMA have a combined written down value of assets in the order of some €60 billion to €65 billion. Around one million people in Ireland today hurt and will continue to hurt for the rest of their lives as a result of the unjustified and incorrect distribution of the losses that occurred from the credit pyramid-Ponzi scheme that was the creation solely of the boards of banks in the period 2001 to 2008. It is provable from the balance sheets but ignored by the current Administration and I am deeply depressed that, having been elected to this honourable House, any contributions I have made on this have been completely ignored and set aside. There is an unwillingness to have clarity, truthfulness and a discussion of the correct analysis. In February 2013, we came into this House at an ungodly hour for a two-day event to deal with the special liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank, now IBRC. We also cement-set the unjustified loses of investors in the bank onto the Irish people. It has been blurred and wrongly taken on board by the establishment of this country, which is hiding behind a growth rate of 4% for next year and all that nonsense. People have come into my office whose family members have committed suicide, as have widows and sick people who are literally being bullied and beaten up by the so-called pillar banks who are still operationally paralysed because they do not have the capabilities to deal with the loan ledgers which they have remaining. Anglo Irish Bank suffered admitted losses of €28 billion and Irish Nationwide Building Society losses of €6 billion - a total of €34 billion. A series of promissory notes was created for that, which are now promissory bonds, standing at €26 billion. These should be cancelled unilaterally and Mr. Draghi told about it. I will be travelling to Brussels on 1 July to support the Ballyhea group with that in mind. Yesterday, the Taoiseach said things had improved with so many thousands of jobs being created after the loss of jobs a few years ago but this is just political point-scoring. It is as if the collapse was all down to property, but it was not. The scale of credit that was allowed to flow into this country, across the board, brought the size of domestic banking from three times national income to over five and a half times national income. I want to talk about how the so-called profits of IBRC were inflated for a period starting in 1993 and travelling forward to the present date. There were two ways this was done. First was the direct manipulation of interest charges and the concealment of loaded interest, which happened in the majority of cases. An extensive exercise carried out by Bank Check revealed this. It was an excellent exercise and gives the key facts as follows: there were 113 variable DIBOR and EURIBOR loans and 17 LIBOR-based transactions. Some 494 separate DIBOR-EURIBOR rates were reconciled and found to be loaded to a degree ranging from 0.5% in the early 1990s to between 0.03% and 0.05% in 2002 and 2003. Some 80% of all the loans examined, relating to many clients, were found to have this loading. The statements which clients received never showed the breakdown of the base rate and the DIBOR 3-month rate plus a margin, which had been agreed by loan agreements, plus the reserve asset cost, RAC, if and when it applied. The quantum of the loaded overcharging was in the order of 0.3%. A margin of 1.5% would comprise two elements, namely, the amount that goes to cover overheads, which is usually about 0.9% of the 1.5%, and the remainder, 0.6%, which is the profit of the bank. A loaded secret dark pool profit of 0.3% would represent one third of the overall profits, including that dark pool profit. That means the market valuation of Anglo Irish Bank in the 14 years up to 2002 when this was going on was overstated by one third. If it had been discovered by proper auditing the market would react with a collapse, like the St. Valentine's Day massacre, of at least one third of the value of the bank and this would affect the shareholders, creditors and depositors. That would happen irrespective of whether there was an international credit bust and a freeze of credit. This has been brought to the attention of the NTMA, NAMA and others but it has been ignored to date. I have the evidence here and it is shocking.  There is a superbly authoritative letter about the second element of the overcharge by Anglo Irish Bank, now IBRC. Interest was charged for 365 days across the board, when it should have been 360 days. In the case of IBRC v. John Morrissey, this was the decision of Ms Justice Mary Finlay Geoghegan. It has been brought to the attention of the bank, which has been asked to explain what has been done about this in relation to other clients, but it has been ignored. The terms of reference which the Government has outlined for the investigation cover the period from 2009 to 2013, which is absurd. I am ashamed that this is the case as it excludes the professional conduct of the special liquidators. I have other examples of where clients of what was Anglo Irish Bank and is now IBRC are being mauled while special preferential treatment has been given to certain bidders on loans. I cite the Blackrock Clinic in this respect, which is now the subject of open court proceedings. I have the court depositions and it appears from the evidence that the senior accounting advisers of Larry Goodman are former KPMG partners and very close to the special liquidators at KPMG, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Wallace. It appears there was preferential treatment in the bidding for some of the loans of the investors in the Blackrock Clinic. This should also be investigated as there is too much darkness and too much selective, narrow stuff. On the day after the six-month stay on involvement in any property transactions relating to NAMA loan assets, the chief loans manager of NAMA, Mr. John Mulcahy, joined the advisory team of Denis O'Brien. KPMG were the auditors of Irish Nationwide Building Society, which had a balance sheet of €14 billion. They made losses of €6 billion which were put on the backs of the Irish people. That is wrong. KPMG was the auditor. It is unbelievable stuff. In May of last year all the Opposition Members put forward a motion in which people with experience and qualifications - in fact, myself - offered to go on the banking inquiry, and the Government, under the Whip, told Deputies to vote it down.

As the overcharging has continued under your watch, you are jointly and severally liable for same, together with the Minister and Department of Finance, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator.This is really serious stuff. No response has been received to letters that issued to NAMA on 7 January 2015, to the Central Bank on 22 January 2015, to the Minister for Finance on 3 March 2015, and to the Central Bank on 9 March 2015. We are now in June. This is serious stuff. There are loans that are being operationally processed by the originators of those loans. Now those loans are owned by third parties, including hedge funds, and they are calculating interest on an unlawful basis, even though it has been brought to their attention. This is shocking.

It gives me and my Government colleagues the opportunity to provide some context for the issues that have been debated publicly or, in some cases, have not yet been debated publicly. I welcome the fact that we are now able to have this debate here and that it can be covered and given the attention this matter deserves. In the time available to me, I want to emphasise to the House how IBRC came into being in the first place. This will be uncomfortable listening for Fianna Fáil. I then want to outline the actions taken by this Government to secure our banking system, which was on the brink of catastrophe, and how stability has been brought to this sector. This will be uncomfortable listening for Sinn Féin and for some on the Independent benches. Finally, I want to express my strong belief that the commission of inquiry will report on these issues in a serious and deliberate way and will bring about the transparency and the clarity that is needed on this matter. I have no doubt that this will be an uncomfortable point for many who are now challenging what the Government is doing. Let us be absolutely clear about why we are having this debate. During the Celtic tiger period, Fianna Fáil woefully mismanaged the Irish economy. It overspent, under-delivered and failed to properly regulate the sectors most closely associated with them as a party, particularly the banking and construction sectors. This resulted in a light-touch regulatory regime for Irish banks, which in turn led to a banking sector that was grossly out of proportion to the size of our economy. Eventually, that banking sector collapsed on itself. It impoverished many Irish people, it destroyed jobs and it forced many young people, in particular, to leave our country. To compound the problem, the then Fianna Fáil Government introduced a blanket guarantee for the banks in September 2008, a decision that would end up costing the Irish taxpayer, who would become liable for the debts and the obligations of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide to the tune of almost €35 billion. That is the context for this debate. That is why we are speaking about the need to protect taxpayers' money, the need to ensure the State got as good a deal as possible, and the need for transparency in the workings of IBRC to ensure the public interest was protected. After coming into office in 2011 and surveying the wreckage of Ireland then, it is no understatement to say that this Government was charged with rescuing the country. Unemployment was skyrocketing, the era of net inward migration was over and a sense of doom prevailed. The chances of success were estimated by some at nil. However, due to the choices made by the Government and the support of the Irish people, the situation has dramatically improved. The Minister for Finance's predecessor said, "The bank will be managed on a commercial basis at arm's length from the Government, allowing the full potential of the bank's business to be realised." This is the framework under which the bailed-out Anglo Irish Bank, later IBRC, operated. Not satisfied with this, it was this Government that in 2012 revised the framework to provide greater oversight by the Minister, and rightly so. It was this Government that, through its skillful negotiation, restructured the promissory notes, resulting in the liquidation of IBRC in February 2013, removing Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide from our political and economic landscape. We did this is in the face of a maelstrom from many, who spoke of default and who imagined somehow that we would walk away from our obligations and find another way to pay our public servants. I say this not only to make a political point, but also to make an economic one. Our success in sorting out the banks in a prudent and responsible manner impacts directly on our ability to fund the vital social services our country needs. We have gone from a failed bank to a recovered bank to a liquidated bank, from money wasted in the past by the previous Government to as much money as possible saved by the current Government. Deputy Mathews referred to a 4% growth rate as nonsense. This is the kind of growth that is now enabling communities to begin the steady work of rebuilding themselves, getting more people back to work, and getting our country on the path to better days. The decision to set up this commission of investigation is the right one. I have been described as many things in this House in recent weeks, but a Keynesian is not one of them. However, I agree with Keynes when he said:When my information changes, I alter my conclusions. What do you do, sir? The decision to wind down the review of the special liquidator and establish the commission of investigation has been questioned by some. It is the right response. When issues relating to IBRC first came to light, the Government believed the proposed review was the appropriate mechanism for getting to the bottom of the circumstances at the time.When further issues came to light, thanks in part to the interventions by Deputy Catherine Murphy, it became clear that a wider and deeper investigation was needed. The Government heard the points that were made about the areas of public concern in regard to a potential conflict of interest. They were considered and we have now put in place a commission of investigation to respond to these points. This is the kind of process and debate that takes place outside the Dáil all the time. I fully support the actions by the Government and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in this regard. He admitted that when circumstances had changed, so too would the approach to responding to matters that need to be investigated and discussed. It was the right decision to take and highlights again his exceptional performance as Minister for Finance during what have at times have been horrific circumstances for our country.  I want also to touch on the terms of reference of the investigation. We have had an open-minded approach to setting up the commission of investigation. The Minister for Finance engaged with Opposition parties in this regard to widen the scope of the investigation and to put in place adequate terms of reference. That is because we recognise the need for a thorough investigation. The truth must come out. This must be balanced against constant requests to widen the terms of reference. There is something incongruous in hearing Deputies complain that the commission of investigation will not report by a certain time while at the same time asking for it to investigate more and more material.  We must also recognise the independence of the figure who will lead this work and allow them the scope to determine in an independent manner how they wish to conduct this inquiry. It is clear that the greater the transparency, the better. The more light that is shone, the better. That way we learn lessons and avoid repeating the mistakes that have cost our country so dearly. I do not know what the outcome of the commission of investigation will be. That is one of the reasons we need this kind of process in place - to respond in an impartial and independent manner to issues that are of concern to the public and to taxpayers. I echo the statement by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that there is currently no proof of wrongdoing. I also echo his remarks that in response to points and concerns that have been aired, it is now appropriate to handle this very important matter in this way. This is a response, and many of the actions of the Government have been a response to situations and challenges that we inherited. However, we are also clear that the relationship and the work that took place within our banking sector must be examined and investigated. That is why we have supported the Oireachtas banking inquiry, which is doing important work. It is also why, in response to the circumstances and points that have been made about an area of interest, the Government has put in place a commission of investigation.  The banking collapse has left a deep economic scar on our country. It has taken much time and effort to respond to it. The putting in place of a commission of investigation by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is the right and the needed response to a matter that is of concern to the public, which will allow these matters to be dealt with in an independent, impartial and rigorous manner.

This two-day debate is part of the Government's commitment to transparency and openness. It is regrettable that some members of the Opposition are displaying an absence of good faith in this regard, while others, such as Deputy Catherine Murphy, are in many respects to be commended on their dedication to public service and accountability in asking questions and allowing due process. I cannot say the same about the Deputies opposite on the Fianna Fáil benches, because they have shown a remarkable ability not only to put the past behind them but to pretend it never happened at all. They fool themselves into believing that the starting point for any examination of Irish banking matters should begin after the 2011 general election. The reality, as we all know, is that following that general election, a new Government came to office - one in which Deputy Michael Noonan, as Minister for Finance, has had a huge role to play in addressing the toxic legacy of an abject failure to properly manage and regulate our banking and financial system. Fianna Fáil's approach over the many years when it was vested with responsibility of guarding the public interest is sometimes referred to as "light-touch regulation." To my mind, that is a very polite description of what is more accurately termed "gross negligence." That gross negligence was underpinned by endemic and rampant cronyism as leading Fianna Fáil politicians fraternised on golf courses and in racecourse tents with bankers, developers and other members of the golden circle that characterised the modus operandi of Fianna Fáil in government for many years. Anglo Irish Bank was inextricably linked to Fianna Fáil and it was the toxic agent that slowly poisoned the entire banking system; we are still grappling with the fallout and we will be grappling with it for many years. The subject matter of this debate continues to be part of that legacy. It is often said that Fianna Fáil in government believed that taxpayers' money was its own money to spend in whatever way it saw fit, with scant regard for the overall common good. Nothing proves that point more than the €34 billion it sank into Anglo Irish Bank. That was a staggering amount of taxpayers' money that we will never see again. It is very difficult to say that the taxpayers' interests lay at the heart of those decisions. In fact, it is impossible to say it. It is impossible to arrive at any conclusion beyond recklessness and negligence. By contrast, this Government has made a realistic and responsible assessment before investing taxpayers' money in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, and we intend to recover that investment fully. The value of the State's investment in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB continues to rise. It is not this Government's intention to remain a holder of its banking investments in the long term. Unlike the Opposition, this Government does not believe politicians should be in the business of banking or directing the banks how to act. Siteserv is a case in point. We believe a thriving, competitive banking sector which is properly regulated will produce the best outcomes for consumers and citizens. The Government's exit strategy is about recovering the full cost of the taxpayers' investment in these institutions and using the proceeds to further reduce our debt. The sale of 25% of Permanent TSB further improves this position and we are confident that all the taxpayers' money invested in Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB will be fully recovered. This debate focuses on the Government decision to establish a commission of investigation into certain activities of IBRC. There has been an attempt by some on the Opposition benches to twin IBRC and the current Government in the public mind, as if we are in some way cheerleaders for that entity. In fact, the reality is that we are its liquidators. IBRC was created by Fianna Fáil, explicitly designed to operate at arm's length from the Government. There is now a public concern about some decisions taken by the board of IBRC; most of these decisions were taken by a board appointed by the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government operating within a framework put in place by that Fianna Fáil-led Government. The framework did not require the Minister for Finance to be informed of deals such as the Siteserv one, which was already concluded by the time concerns were raised with the Minister for Finance. As soon as these concerns were brought to the Minister's attention, he and the Department of Finance put new measures in place, replacing the relationship framework in 2012 and enhancing oversight activities of IBRC. My colleague, Deputy Noonan, is without doubt the best Minister for Finance to have served his country since the foundation of this State. History will recognise him as such. His deep sense of public service and civic responsibility drives him day after day and year after year to give his all to bringing about Ireland's economic recovery and creating a sustainable and secure future for succeeding generations of Irish people.He, along with his Government colleagues, has helped to lift this country off its knees, going from the pariah of Europe to its fastest growing economy. His achievements and steady stewardship have enhanced investor and consumer confidence at home and abroad. He has moved us from being dependent on the troika after being locked out of international bond markets to a point at which Standard & Poor's this week awarded Ireland an A+ credit rating. He is widely respected internationally, as I well know from my work as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Some on the Opposition benches take a narrower, political view. They see the Minister, Deputy Noonan, as an asset to the Government and Fine Gael, a Minister at whom they need to throw a lot of mud in the hope that some of it will stick. I have bad news for them: the Minister was not the champion of IBRC, the remnants of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society. He was its liquidator. Not alone did he honour his commitment not to sink taxpayers' money into IBRC, but he succeeded in the challenging task of restructuring the punitive promissory notes that Fianna Fáil had bequeathed as part of its toxic legacy. The deal on the promissory note in February 2013 was a key step in the stabilisation of the public finances and our clean exit from the bailout later that year. The Minister also succeeded in achieving a reduction in the interest rate on the European loans provided under the bailout programme, securing agreement on extending the maturity of the European loans and replacing €18 billion of IMF loans with cheaper market-based funding. We continue to emerge from what was a catastrophic economic crisis comparable only to the early years of our State when the Government set about building a new state from the smouldering ruins of the War of Independence while civil war raged around it. Through the leadership and vision of Ministers like Deputy Noonan and the resilience of the Irish people, we are firmly on a path to recovery and are in the process of securing that recovery. The Minister has also shown leadership in proposing the establishment of this commission of investigation. I look forward to the Dáil allowing the commission to undertake its task. It will be independent of the Government and proceed. I am somewhat struck by calls from the Opposition for the commission to do more. The shopping list will continue because it makes for good politics and copy. At the same time, the Opposition wants the deadline to be brought forward from 31 December. We agreed the terms of reference and the Dáil will approve them later this evening. Let the independent judicial figure undertake this task as quickly as possible. We will await the report. Any question asked of the commission in the course of its duty will be answered. I look forward to receiving the report of the commission of investigation by the 31 December deadline.

Fianna Fáil called for a commission of investigation three or four weeks ago, but every Member on the Government side voted that down. Such a major and dramatic U-turn by the Government is welcome, but there is a big "however" in that this is only a small step. The Government is facing the right direction, but it is not willing to travel that way. It must move in the direction called for by us. Fianna Fáil made three requests of the Minister in recent days regarding issues that we wanted incorporated in the terms of reference, but none was. We want the role of the Department of Finance and its Minister in respect of their dealings with IBRC included in the terms of reference. Instead, those terms state: "in relation to each transaction under investigation, whether the Minister for Finance or his Department was kept informed where appropriate in respect of the transactions concerned, and whether he, or officials on his behalf, took appropriate steps in respect of the information provided to them." This relates to specific transactions. We want an examination of the-----

Our party leader spoke to the Minister and told him that we wanted the Department's brief included. The Minister has included a narrow amendment on specific transactions and only the judge can determine which will be examined fully. The Minister has excluded from full examination his Department's remit, his own remit as shareholder and the remit of his senior officials in terms of the relationship with IBRC during the period covered by the terms of reference. This is not satisfactory. The Minister has limited the terms specifically. We asked the Minister to reduce the threshold of €10 million but he has chosen not to do so. This is not satisfactory. We also asked him to publish an interim report, but he refused to do so. He has rejected our party's three requests. This is our starting point. The Minister has a commission of sorts. While we would welcome it, these terms fall short of what is required. I listened to the last two Government speakers. They accused us of light-touch regulation of the banking sector while we were in government. They tried to put my party under the spotlight. However, something happened during this Government's lifetime. The Moriarty tribunal report was presented to the Dáil under the Government's watch. That report detailed matters of corruption relating to when the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and other Ministers were last in government. This Government has done nothing to pursue that corruption. Not only was the Minister's former Government involved in corruption, but the current one has received the report of the Moriarty tribunal confirming this and done nothing to investigate that corruption. It is allowing that corruption to continue unchecked. Corruption was identified, but no action has been taken in response. The Government is presiding over a situation in which that corruption is going unchecked. Ministers opposite have said that Fianna Fáil has tried to put the past behind us.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	I will. The Acting Chairman is always impartial, but I noticed that, when others spoke about Fianna Fáil's record in government, she did not make a similar request. I will move on, but the Acting Chairman made her point well and I thank her. The Government's approach is one law for the rich and another for everyone else. I will ask the judge, whoever he or she may be, to consider the context in which we find ourselves, that is, solving the banking crisis. I want the judge to examine all of these matters. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I know, we have constituents in Portlaoise and Mountmellick who fell into arrears with their banks that, in some cases, had received offers from voluntary housing associations to buy those properties so that the people could continue living there. In many cases in my constituency and elsewhere, though, banks have insisted on vacant possession.They have told those who are in arrears to get out of their houses. They have threatened to take them to court. They want them out of these houses because they intend to sell them and they want to control the process. They have said they will sell the houses and decide on the levels of proceeds to be accepted. They have said that any negative equity will be attached to those whose houses are sold. They have said they will follow these people for these moneys for the rest of their days. That is the approach. That is what is happening here in the Irish banks. I know the judge - whoever he or she may be - will read the Dáil transcript in relation to the terms of reference. The biggest issue the judge will have to determine will be why Siteserv was allowed to manage its own process. Issues like money for the taxpayer, cash in the bank, debtors and whether the amount actually accepted was the highest bid, an in-between bid or the lowest bid all follow on from the fact that Siteserv was allowed to control the process. If IBRC had done to Siteserv what other banks had been doing to other people, it would have said to Siteserv: "You owe us the money, we are taking control of the situation, you cannot pay back what you owe us, we are taking a big loss on behalf of this, we are taking control of the sale process, you just get off the pitch and out of the way, we want vacant possession from your company, we are putting in a receiver and we will decide the sale process." Those situations need to be examined by the judge. Why was Siteserv allowed to control the process? All of the other matters followed on from that. If Siteserv had been removed from the process from the outset and had been controlled by IBRC, the trade buyer issue would not have arisen. If it had been sold by a receiver on the public market, rather than as part of the in-house operation that IBRC allowed Siteserv to control, many more offers might have been received. That is where this problem started. The problem with Siteserv continued from there. We are here today because of this insider dealing between wealthy individuals and the State.

The Committee of Public Accounts will deal with this at 12.30 p.m. tomorrow. It now seems that after a commission of investigation has been approved by this House, committees of the House can continue to discuss matters of relevance to what is being investigated by the commission. The Minister will have to square that circle. How can committees have debates about these matters after the commission of investigation has been set up?

The subject matter of the issue is in the terms of reference. This issue will be discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts tomorrow. Can people come in and talk about the subject matter of the terms of reference in committee after the Oireachtas has established this commission of investigation? The relationship framework is also excluded from these terms of reference. The Minister and his Department delayed the implementation of the framework. The Minister made heavy play of the fact that the relationship framework which existed at the time of the Siteserv deal was the one he inherited before he came to power. He has not told the people of Ireland that shortly after he came to power, the troika asked him during one of their quarterly meetings to update the relationship framework. IBRC was pleading with the Department to do that because it had taken control of Irish Nationwide, which was not part of the previous relationship framework. There were several drafts of that framework during the troika's visits here. The Minister missed the deadline. His Department delayed and dragged its feet. The Minister should have had a revised relationship framework in place before the Siteserv deal was done.

#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	203	I fully support the Minister's view and his decision to set up the establishment of this commission of investigation. There are many things that have quite rightly been raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy over the past couple of months. We need to learn lessons from the difficulty she experienced in getting the information she was seeking. For example, we need to change the practices that apply to the way Departments respond to parliamentary questions. I refer not only to questions tabled by Opposition Deputies, but to questions tabled by everybody in this House. That is one lesson we can learn. We need to look at the concerns that have been raised by various Members of this House, all of which have been counter-claimed or denied. We have been told that these concerns are materially untrue or categorically untrue. There are so many things that we do not know we do not know at this stage. There is a clear need to restore public trust in the liquidation of IBRC, which the Minister sought fit to do on 7 February 2013 when he introduced legislation to ensure there was nothing but transparency with regard to the liquidation and closing down of IBRC, as denoted in the relevant Act. Now we need to look at the transactions that came beforehand. Currently, we genuinely have a situation where a source can claim that somebody has two heads, this is confirmed by an insider and suddenly it is the truth. I represent ordinary people in County Meath. I do not represent the rich people, the wealthy farmers or the people who live in expensive houses. I am lucky enough to represent everybody who lives in Meath East. I am quite sure that there are not that many billionaires living in my constituency. Maybe there are, and I just do not know who they are. We need to be seen as a Government that is representative of everybody in this country. We need to rule and make the laws of the land without fear or favour to any individuals or organisations in this country. I fully support the robust criteria that have been set out in the commission of investigation's terms of reference, which cover transparency in the transactions arising from the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, the transactions that occurred as part of the sale of loan books and IBRC's interactions with its clients, the Department of Finance, the former Minister, Brian Lenihan, and the current Minister, Deputy Noonan. I think we have a situation where a political football is being used. It is almost as if there is glee on the part of some Opposition Deputies from Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin. They seem to hope that if they throw enough mud around, some of it will stick on Fine Gael. In my view, Deputy Catherine Murphy is the only person from an Opposition perspective who has acted with integrity in this process over recent months. She is to be commended and supported for that. She is one of the most reasonable people I have had the pleasure of dealing with since I came into this House. I really want to wish her well in her investigations and her pursuit of this matter. I fully support the establishment of this commission of investigation, which will be fully resourced and supported in terms of the staff and the judge when he or she is appointed so that it can conduct this review in a timely manner. We will have the documentation and the full review by 31 December next. I will explain why this is so significant to me. I know what I know, but I absolutely do not know what we do not know. People in every town and village in this country have suffered immeasurably over the past seven or eight years because of the collapse of the economy and the ensuing decisions that had to be made by the former Minister, Brian Lenihan, and the current Minister as part of the attempt to ensure the economy recovered for the rest of the people of this country. Those who have suffered silently for the most part at the hands of those decisions want to know that the rules of engagement of the Government and of statutory bodies are the same for them as they are for the people in this country who are perceived to be very wealthy. That is what the investigation will uncover. This will ensure the Government governs for everybody and not for our people and our "pawns", as Deputy Sean Fleming suggested in the most despicable way. He should be ashamed of the disrespect he has shown to this House. I fully support the Minister in his decisions. I look forward to a speedy conclusion of this review so that we can all move on.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	204	In the ten minutes available to me, I certainly will not be able to cover the multiple issues that arise from the whole Siteserv-IBRC debacle in the necessary sort of forensic detail. I assure Deputy Regina Doherty that I hope to look at the issues in a reasoned manner.Whatever about the use of language, to mention the context of the Moriarty tribunal, the adverse findings in relation to Denis O'Brien and his relationship with a former Fine Gael Minister is relevant to this, particularly given that no action was taken subsequent to the Moriarty tribunal, when we were possibly talking about criminal activity. That is a serious issue and is not playing politics. It is one that must be addressed. The failure of the Government to act on the findings of the Moriarty tribunal raises very serious questions connected with this matter. I pay tribute to Deputy Catherine Murphy for pursuing this matter. It raises serious questions about the Government’s responsiveness to parliamentary questions and issues raised by parliamentarians about this and other matters and whether the Government’s attitude was to deliberately not pursue the matter, to obfuscate, to cover up or not respond at all as it should do. It has been dragged kicking and screaming over four years to finally launch the investigation that should have been launched in 2012. I am sorry the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, has left the Chamber because this raises serious questions generally about the Government’s attitude to parliamentary questions and serious issues of concern. To give one example which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport might consider, I have asked 50 questions or more about Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company-----

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	223	I asked 50 questions raising issues of corporate governance to do with public assets, unexplained payments, expenses and so on, over a four-year period but no action was taken. There is a story there. This connects with the Siteserv issue. In the Minister of Finance’s statement last week, he said "any concerns around the [Siteserv] transaction were not known either to me or to my officials when answering parliamentary questions prior to June 2012”. I dug out a question I asked the Taoiseach in June 2012, when I said:I am simply summarising what was in the Moriarty report. It made serious findings about the circumstances in which Mr. O'Brien received the aforementioned licence [the Esat licence] and about the role a former Fine Gael Minister had in helping him to secure that licence. ... This is not simply an historical question and the Taoiseach should clarify his relationship and that of his party to Mr. O’Brien. I ask him to so do particularly as a live issue faces us yet again in respect of Mr. O’Brien’s recent acquisition of Siteserv plc and its facilitation by the writing down by Anglo Irish Bank of €110 million worth of debt to that company. This deal deserves considerable scrutiny and in the context of the controversial plans to introduce water metering and water charges, I note Siteserv provides contracting services to Bord Gáis, including the installation of water meters. The Taoiseach said:In regard to the question about the Siteserv position, I point out to Deputy Boyd Barrett that the Competition Authority looked at that merger to see if there were any anti-competitive practices contained therein and it made its decision approving that merger independently, as is its function and responsibility.There was no mention of the fact that the Minister for Finance had launched an investigation at that point into the sale of Siteserv. It was a case of nothing to see here. In his statement, the Minister essentially implied that because no further parliamentary questions were asked after April there was nothing for him to respond to in respect of the concerns he had about Siteserv. In fact, I had asked the Taoiseach about it in June. There was something to respond to. Even if the Taoiseach was not aware of it, which I find surprising, why would the Minister not inform him afterwards and inform a Deputy who had raised it that there was in fact an investigation at that stage and that the Department had very serious concerns about what was going on in Siteserv? Mike Aynsley pointed out in his interview with The Sunday Business Post that, contrary to the notion the Minister knew little of what was going on in Siteserv, from the last quarter of 2011 there were monthly meetings with the Department and all significant transactions were being discussed with the Department and the Minister would have been aware of them. There were numerous press reports in the aftermath of the sale and, indeed, in the run-up to the sale about serious concerns raised about the matter. One quite startling report was in the Sunday Independent on 8 April, before the parliamentary questions were asked, where Jody Corcoran writes about Denis O’Brien and Phil Hogan: "In due course, Siteserv will, no doubt, tender for state contracts, such as, for example, the installation of water meters at households around the country - a contract that will be granted by the Department of the Environment.” That is interesting. He goes on to say: “As both men are no doubt aware, it simply would not do for them to have either formal or informal meetings, nor, for that matter, for them to bump into each other over a burnt rasher, lest anybody get the wrong idea. You cannot be too careful these days." There were already suggestions in the public domain of an improper relationship between Phil Hogan and Denis O’Brien, water metering, the sale of Siteserv, the write-downs and so on.  Another fact that needs to be looked into in this matter is that Denis O’Brien got the money he used to buy Siteserv, as well as the €119 million lost to the State in the write-down on Siteserv, and possibly preferential interest rates, from Allied Irish Banks, AIB, another publicly owned bank.

This is somebody who owes €500 million to one bank, where there are now allegations that he was not meeting the terms of those loans and was looking to renegotiate them, who gets an enormous write-down to his benefit when he takes over Siteserv, and the bank that lends him the money to buy the company is 100% publicly owned. Do we not need to look into the decisions to lend him money for that transaction and other big loans or write-downs, the question of Independent News and Media and the €100 million write-down, which, to some extent, benefitted Denis O’Brien? The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport put this in context. The big context is that in a period when child poverty rose and 137,000 children live in consistent poverty, Denis O’Brien’s wealth went from €2.2 billion in 2009 to €6.9 billion by 2015. That is a massive transfer of wealth from ordinary people into the pockets of the new oligarchs. That is a very serious context in which we need all the answers about the most important job this Government and the Minister for Finance had, the disposal of the assets and loans of the banks we bailed out, who they went to and did that involve enriching a tiny insider elite, as the evidence suggests it certainly might have.

Rud eile atá ag titim amach as seo ná go bhfuil cumhacht na Dála ag dul i méid. Tá sé sofheicthe ón obair atá déanta ag an Teachta Catherine Murphy, go mór mór maidir le ceisteanna parlaiminte a chur faoi bhráid na Dála agus ó thaobh na litreacha a fuair sí - cé nach bhfuil a fhios againn an bhfuil na rudaí ráite iontu fíor - gur ceart go mbeadh an fiosrúchán seo againn agus go mbeadh daoine ó gach taobh i bhfábhar an fhiosrúcháin. An cheist atá ann anois don Rialtas ná, má thagann rudaí nua os ár gcomhair nach bhfuil luaite faoin ráiteas poiblí atá againn faoi láthair maidir leis an bhfiosrúchán agus na cúrsaí ábhartha, ar nós litreacha eile a thiocfaidh isteach ó dhaoine cosúil leis an Teachta Pearse Doherty, a luaigh ábhair nua sa Dáil inné, an mbeidh seans ag an bhfiosrúchán neamhspleách féachaint isteach sna rudaí sin. Is rud bunúsach é sin. The commission of investigation will be a good, independent inquiry and, along with everyone else, I am convinced of the need for it. I have no doubt the eminent justice appointed to lead the commission of investigation will be the proper person to do so. The establishment of a commission of investigation shows the strength of the Dáil. Deputies on all sides have praised Deputy Catherine Murphy for her tenacity. The Deputy has shown great persistence in raising an issue through parliamentary questions and her work is coming to fruition. We do not know whether the information provided to her is the full truth, as it has been denied in the media. The Oireachtas has emerged strengthened from recent events as the courts have provided clarity on the right of Members to raise issues in the House. This right has been found to be sacrosanct and Deputies cannot be sued for comments made in the House. This is a positive development.  Deputy Pearse Doherty has been given information that differs from that provided to Deputy Catherine Murphy. There is certainly a conflict on the rate of interest purportedly charged on some of Mr. Denis O'Brien's loans, with certain letters indicating a rate of 3.5% was charged, whereas Deputy Murphy referred to a rate of 1.5%. The judge who will be appointed to lead the commission of investigation should be able to clarify the matter and determine the veracity of this information.  Further documents may be released once the commission of investigation is up and running. If a new issue enters the public domain and is not germane to the information we have received thus far, the judge should have the authority, should he see fit, to bring it within the scope of his work. I ask for clarification on this matter.  On the timeline for the work of the commission of investigation, most of the comment has focused on the Siteserv issue and it is important that the judge complete his work on this matter as quickly as possible. However, Deputies will disagree on whether it is necessary to specify a date by which the work should be completed or if an interim report is required. I have no doubt that the justice who is appointed to lead the commission of investigation will, in his wisdom, be keen to complete the investigation as fairly and quickly as possible. The issues of fairness and equity arise in this case because everyone, whether it is Denis O'Brien, Michael Murphy, the Minister for Finance or Deputy Catherine Murphy, has a right to be treated fairly and properly. Some of the comment on this issue has been one-sided as we do not have all the facts, although we all agree on the need for the facts to be established independently. All relevant information, irrespective of its source, should be provided to the judge who will carry out the inquiry. He should then exercise his discretion and use it as he sees fit.  The issues that arise in this regard are credibility, transparency and the manner in which the Oireachtas conducts its business. A commission of investigation is the best means to achieve accountability and transparency. All Deputies want a fair and independent inquiry to establish what did or did not happen.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	227	I am probably the only Deputy present who voted against the blanket guarantee in September 2008 and its subsequent renewal during the term of this Government. I voted against the guarantee because it was a totally unjustified and economically crazy policy and I feared it would leave Irish people with a large burden of debt for decades to come. I also feared that members of the golden circle of insiders that produced the crash, who are represented in this House by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, would continue to escape the consequences of their profligate behaviour and would be permitted to protect their key assets. My fears are proving to be justified. Would any future historian draw much of a distinction between the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government that was in office until March 2011 and its Fine Gael-Labour Party successor? The Siteserv and IBRC controversy simply highlights the widespread fire sale of business and financial assets by IBRC, the National Asset Management Agency and other State banks as well as a result of troika diktats issued from late 2010 onwards. The bottom line is that nothing changed after the 2011 election when the new Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance chose to steadfastly persist with the policies of the two previous Taoisigh, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, and the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan. Deputy Catherine Murphy and her valiant staff have done Irish people an enormous favour over the past year in doggedly questioning the sale of Siteserv in early 2012 and the treatment of high-value customers of the now liquidated bank. I commend the Deputy on her perseverance, painstaking research and great courage in pursuing the major questions raised by her inquiries. The arrival in this country of vulture funds and various financial sharks from early 2009 onwards raised many worrying concerns for citizens across many sectors of the economy, from commercial property and housing to financial institutions such as Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB. One of these key concerns related to the strange sale of Siteserv. Most people were familiar with the Sierra company, which was heavily involved in developing infrastructure such as the gas network. People looked closely at Siteserv when they realised it was a Denis O'Brien company and had secured a €500 million contract from Irish Water to meter every household. Similarly to other Deputies, I had no knowledge of the Siteserv balance sheet in 2012 and no way of knowing whether the net price of approximately €45 million was a fair return for citizens or a knock-down price that squandered €100 million of State assets. However, articles on the sale published in Phoenix magazine and The Sunday Business Post were alarming. While the Siteserv company was seriously indebted to IBRC in 2012, it was a profitable going concern with a workforce of several thousand. We now know that in 2010-11, its sales increased by 11% to €169 million and turnover increased again in 2011-12. I note that an article in the Phoenix argued that with an annualised EBITDA - earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation - of €15 million, the sale price multiple should have been at least six, indicating that Siteserv was worth a minimum of €90 million in early 2012. Allowing Siteserv management to handle the sale seems to have been a serious error by the chairman and chief executive officer of IBRC. The exclusion of trade buyers from the sale also seems unbelievable. It has also been suggested that a sum of between €90 million and €100 million could have been realised for Siteserv if its important British subsidiary, Deborah Services, had been sold separately, given that the company had been purchased for €60 million as recently as 2008. I welcome the belated decision of the Government to establish a commission of investigation under section 3(1) of the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004. The schedule of terms of reference appears to be reasonably comprehensive. Nevertheless, I support the proposals made by Sinn Féin and Renua to reduce the relevant write-off limit by 90%. I also welcome the decision to shine a light on the Department of Finance, because a major question mark hangs over the future of the Minister for Finance. Why, in July 2012, did the Minister not order the independent review of the Siteserv sale that Deputy Catherine Murphy had sought for so long? Why did he not at least order the special liquidator to check out the Siteserv sale and similar sales concluded in the two years after the so-called prom night? Why, just weeks ago, did he appoint a company with a clear conflict of interest, KPMG, to lead the review of the Siteserv sale? Given the scale of these errors, a Minister in a similar position in most other European Union jurisdictions would have resigned by now. I call on the Minister to do so, as it is still the right course of action.

Did they care and did the Minister for Finance care? Thanks to the appalling decision of September 2008 taken by Fianna Fáil and supported by Fine Gael, Sinn Féin and many Independent Deputies, €35 billion of precious public money was sunk into the dead carcasses of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society. The totally discredited Rabbitte-Gilmore leadership of the Labour Party jumped on the same bandwagon in March 2011 and over seven years, the most vulnerable citizens in our society have been crucified with cutbacks and ever increasing charges and debts. Hopefully, the investigation now underway will shine a further bright light on all those responsible for these terrible failures and the suffering of our people.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	231	I raise with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, the ongoing debate around the commission of investigation into issues pertaining to IBRC and the need for absolute clarity in relation to the terms of reference the Government has proposed and guarantees that they cover key issues. The heart of this goes back to concerns raised by civil servants in the Department of Finance on the governance at IBRC. Thanks to the painstaking efforts of Deputy Catherine Murphy, we learned of that through freedom of information and parliamentary questions. At the heart of the concerns was a sense that IBRC was being mismanaged, that there were governance issues at the very heart of it and, for example, that departmental officials had concerns about the relationships between big borrowers and key personalities within the management of IBRC, including the CEO, Mr. Aynsley, Mr. Hunerson and, indeed, Mr. Woodhouse. This is all minuted in departmental information files. In responding to assertions by the Department as to whether relationships were too close - this involved Mr. McKillen, Mr. O'Brien and others - Mr. Aynsley said, "They are strong but not inappropriate" and "I might have had four of five dinners or lunches with them". That is how he responded. Why I raise that is because yesterday evening in the Dáil, Deputy Pearse Doherty raised - Deputy Catherine Murphy raised it last week and the week before - the so-called loan extensions that Mr. O'Brien sought, which are being disputed. The terms of reference refer to contractual relationships. In the context of the loan extensions, Mr. O'Brien apparently argued that he had a verbal assurance with Mr. Aynsley and Mr. Woodhouse. The bottom line is that it seems to be a bit unclear as to whether that verbal assurance is covered by the terms of reference and by the phrase "contractual relationships". The language used in the terms of reference is tortuous. We asked for "governance at a macro level" to be put in and while that is done, it is qualified in the manner in which it is put in. The same applies to this issue. Last night, the Minister for Finance said in response to Deputy John McGuinness that it is covered by the terms of reference. I ask the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to give an assurance to the House between now and the close of the debate that the Government will come forward with language in the form of an amendment that makes it absolutely clear that the issue of the loan extensions moving into the liquidator's sphere and period is absolutely covered by the terms of reference, as are the other issues that we have alluded to.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	232	I thank Deputy Martin for his questions. First, this is clearly a painful legacy of a bank that was not governed by proper regulation over many years. I recall clearly that when money was first put into this bank by the previous Government, we were told it was solvent shortly after it took control. We are now entering the last act of this arrangement and it is important to bear in mind that the only actions this Government has taken in respect of Anglo and IBRC have been, first, to change the control framework - under the previous Fianna Fáil arrangement, there was no official within the IBRC to oversee what was occurring - and, second, to liquidate the bank. Both of those decisions will be vindicated by the history of this. In terms of the question specifically raised, I give the Deputy absolute assurance that the issues raised by Deputy Doherty and others are within the terms of reference. There is no doubt about this. The Minister for Finance signalled that last night and the Attorney General, who has reviewed the documentation, has also confirmed it. There is no doubt that the issues about which Deputy Martin has raised concern are within the terms of reference and will be covered. The judge will have the power to investigate the issues raised in the debate last night. I hope that gives the Deputy assurance.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	233	I regret that, again, the Minister had to be politically partisan in his opening remarks. What he just stated in his opening remarks was exactly what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said during the Private Members' debate and in answer to a parliamentary question to me some time back. He had to come to the House and, humiliatingly, apologise. He also wrote to me to apologise because the assertion that nothing happened until after March 2012 was wrong. Nevertheless, the Minister comes in and says it again. I know from my own sources that there was a relationship between the Department of Finance and Anglo Irish Bank after it was nationalised going right back to 2009. We know now that there were board minutes going right back. The Minister should please not repeat the falsehood that was articulated in the House a week or two ago. We have sought to be constructive here and we met with the Minister for Finance to get the terms of reference right. We understand that we are not going to get everything, but the language was tortuous. I must be honest with the Minister and say I would like to think the term "contractual obligation" covers the verbal assurances that Mr. O'Brien says he got from Mr. Aynsley and others, but I am not certain. I have preliminary legal advice, but I am not certain and the House deserves certainty on that point. Are loan agreements that might have taken place under the old Anglo Irish Bank outside the relevant period or not? Given the controversy that has arisen, we cannot let this hang. There is an absolute necessity for the Government to make it clear in writing that this issue is covered within the terms of reference. This issue also underlines the need for an interim report by the end of October as there are a lot of issues hanging out there now. They cannot hang out there forever. I refer to the Siteserv issue and the issue of the loan extension.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	235	It is unacceptable that it would be allowed to drag on over an indefinite timeframe and, as such, we need clarity and certainty in relation to it. Given what the Minister has said, it should be within the Government's capacity to give that certainty in writing before the close of the debate.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	I have given the Deputy the assurance he needs in the House. I have given him the assurance of the Minister for Finance and the assurance of the Attorney General, who is the legal adviser to the Government. Any reading of the terms of reference clearly embraces this. It was specifically in response to concerns raised by Deputies that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, included within the investigation the issue here on contractual obligations agreed during the relevant period but not executed until after. It was very clearly in response to concerns to make sure the terms of reference covered this that they were framed in this way.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	240	I have never heard of appendices being written by Attorneys General to legal documents adopted by the Dáil and neither has Deputy Martin. That would be a wholly inappropriate approach. We have the terms of reference and the categorical assurance that they will cover the issues of concern raised by Deputies. These are legitimate public interest concerns and it is right that we have an investigation. We have appointed a judge who will do this. All of the documentation provided by Deputy Doherty or others will be provided to the judge who has the authority confirmed by the Attorney General to pursue these issues and to satisfy the public as to how these were handled.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	241	The Government's draft terms of reference for the commission of investigation concerning Irish Bank Resolution Corporation has a cut-off date of 7 February 2013 which is the date of the appointment of the special liquidator. Information was passed by Sinn Féin's finance spokesperson, Deputy Pearse Doherty, to the Taoiseach so the Taoiseach has all the information and not just the part of it which was read into the record of the House yesterday. I have also seen this documentation which indicates transactions, activities and decisions beyond the date set in the Government's terms of reference. The special liquidators have disposed of €21.7 billion of loans since that date and that dwarfs the sales in the period open to the commission to look at under the Government's terms of reference. We are talking about billions of the people's money being transferred to private interests in a completely opaque way. This money could have been spent on hospitals, schools, houses and in combating poverty. They include the sale of Racing Post loans which have been criticised by a bidder as being less than transparent. It includes the sales of the mortgages of thousands of people to unregulated vultures that also fall into this timeframe. Contrary to the Minister's claims and the Minister for Finance's claims, these and the period involved are not included in the Government's terms of reference and could be subject to a legal challenge or not investigated at all if the terms of reference are not amended. One of Sinn Féin's amendments proposes that the relevant period be from 12 January 2009 to 12 March 2015, inclusive, in order to cover all of these transactions. That is what Fianna Fáil should support if the Government does not signal clearly that it will accept our amendment. Will the Government accept our amendment and change the terms of reference accordingly?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	242	I do not accept that the liquidator has been dealing in an opaque way with loans that have disposed of. The legislation governing the liquidator provides that he must get an independent valuation of the loans and the loans must then be disposed of by way of open public tender. He cannot dispose of the loans below the value indicated by the independent evaluation - they have to go to NAMA - and he cannot dispose of them below that price.

Deputy Pearse Doherty made it clear yesterday that he was reading that section into the record of the House to point out one of the transactions which was being claimed had taken place in order that the Government would change the terms of reference. The Government has not changed the terms of reference. However, this is in line with the Government's refusal to deal properly with these issues of major public concern, despite them being brought to its attention for more than three years. Another example is the mystery of the missing minutes and the Minister for Finance's failure thus far to explain when he was first alerted to the sale of Siteserv. Did the Minister for Jobs, Innovation and Enterprise, Deputy Bruton, know of the sale of Siteserv before the Minister for Finance? Sinn Féin has uncovered via a freedom of information request that the issue of Millington's purchase of Siteserv was reported to the Competition Authority on 16 March 2012 and reported to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in correspondence from the Competition Authority on 20 March 2012 and on 21 May 2012. This issue was already a matter of major public concern. On 17 March 2012, Fiona Reddan, writing in The Irish Times, drew attention to Siteserv being sold to Denis O'Brien for €45 million in cash with a loss to the taxpayer of €105 million and an award of almost €5 million to Siteserv executives and shareholders. Why was the Government not alert to these issues, especially when it was being brought, along with all of this, to the Government's attention by the Minister's own officials? Was the Minister aware of the Siteserv deal before the Minister for Finance knew? I ask him to please tell us when the Minister for Finance became aware of this deal.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	256	Money was not frittered away by this Government in respect of Anglo Irish Bank. This Government did not put a single euro into Anglo Irish Bank. All of the money was put in by the previous Government and the actions by this Government and by the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, reduced the cost of the debt of Anglo Irish Bank. Also, the liquidation is actually showing signs that we will get back more than was expected. No taxpayers' money is being frittered away by the actions of this Government in respect of Anglo Irish Bank. To be honest, Sinn Féin is playing a political game, despite getting assurances that all of the issues raised are being covered by the agenda.

In so far as the issue of the sale of Siteserv, it was notified to the Competition Authority among many other such mergers on grounds of competition.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	259	And the Minister?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	The Competition Authority made very clear that there were no issues of competition in respect of that sale. I accepted the advice from the Competition Authority and officials at that time. Sinn Féin is scrambling around to find some reason to vote against the terms of reference of an investigation that is clearly going to deal with all of the issues of public concern-----
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	261	I have seen this in the past but this is a robust inquiry. We have the assurances of the Attorney General and this inquiry will deal with this issue in a timely way so that we can have a report here by the end of the year.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	263	I wish to remind the Minister of what the Taoiseach said yesterday during Leaders' Questions: "I have been a supporter for a very long time of the idea that Dáil questions should be answered as fully and as completely as possible." Fair play to the Taoiseach. Perhaps he could have let the Minister, Deputy Noonan, know that this is the approach of the Government. Four weeks ago I asked the Taoiseach a very simple question. I asked how many people had paid the water charges so far. In response, he advised me to toddle along to the AV room where Irish Water would give me the answers to any questions I wished to ask. Indeed, he accused me of thinking I was Julius Caesar because I wanted an answer to a question in the segment of Dáil business known as Leaders' Questions. He then said that the point of Leaders' Questions was to tell us where to go.Undeterred by this less than full and complete answer, Deputy Coppinger and myself duly toddled along to the audiovisual room and asked the people from Irish Water the question. They confirmed that over 600,000 bills had passed their pay-by date and that they knew how many of those had been paid and how many had not. However, they refused outright to give us the figures for payment.

Helpful to whom? We then took the advice of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that if one really wants an answer to a question, one has to submit a freedom of information request. We duly submitted the request, in response to which Irish Water confirmed that by 18 May almost 800,000 bills had passed their pay-by date, although it again refused to say how many had paid and not paid on the grounds that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to result in undue disturbance of the ordinary course of business. Could that be because the payment levels are on the floor and disclosure of the figures would undermine the Government's scare campaign and give many others the confidence not to pay?

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	267	Could it be that it would give confidence to people, particularly at a time when people are looking at the IBRC scandal, the bailout and write-offs for the rich, for the Denis O'Briens, at the expense of the majority through measures such as the water charges? Four weeks later, I came back to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, in place of the Taoiseach. By now almost all of the bills have issued-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	268	The Deputy is over time. Would he please put a question?
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	269	I am at the question now. A total of 1.4 million bills have passed their pay-by date. I ask for a full and complete answer to two simple and precise questions. Have the figures for rates of payment been discussed between Irish Water and the Government? How many of those due to pay have paid the water charges by now and how many have not?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	270	If the Deputy is unhappy with the response to the freedom of information request, there is an independent Information Commissioner, who will deal with those issues.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	272	Although I do not have the information that the Deputy seeks available to me here, I can say that the establishment of Irish Water is an important national infrastructure. We have laboured under a system in which 34 different local authorities have operated a water network. We have seen leakages from that water network of up to 50%.

I am going to ask it very clearly and would like a clear answer in response. Has the Government discussed the levels of payment with Irish Water? Has there been communication of information about the levels of payment from Irish Water to the Government? I would like a clear answer to that question. It is simply not credible that they have not been discussed. The only conclusion people can draw is that the Government is hiding the figures, although it boasted about the bloated registration figures, because the figures are on the floor. That explains the scare tactics and the attempt to suggest Irish Water can take the charges from people's wages, social welfare benefits or pensions when it simply cannot. That is simply a dirty lie. To come back to simple questions, looking for simple answers, has the Government discussed the payment levels with Irish Water and can the Minister please give us the figures?

A national programme is now being put in place to deal with it. We are seeing the benefits of having a single integrated utility already and I believe it is the correct approach.

We have seen the figures for waiting lists getting much worse month by month. Our health system is in crisis, particularly in terms of information and data. The Minister for Health has promised a raft of legislation pertaining to our health service in the programme for Government. The Government has been committed to the health information Bill for the last four years in terms of enabling us to properly assess and analyse what is happening within the service. It would be helpful if the Minister, Deputy Bruton, could indicate a timeline for that Bill. Could he also indicate when legislation pertaining to patient safety and the patient safety authority will be forthcoming?

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	The Charities Regulatory Authority and the Charities Act 2009. On the electoral commission Bill, the Minister will know the Convention on the Constitution addressed reform of the Dáil electoral system in its fourth report, that the Government published a consultation paper on this and that it was discussed by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in March and that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has described it as of the highest priority for the Government. However, we still have not got it. When will the electoral commission Bill be published? On the Charities Act 2009 and the Charities Regulatory Authority, there have been a number of controversies around the management of charities recently, as was most obvious in the case of the Central Remedial Clinic. The Minister for Justice and Equality established the position of charities regulator in 2012, which we supported, and the board was set up in April 2014. However, the part of the Charities Act which gives the regulatory authority statutory powers with respect to charitable organisations has yet to commence. Subsequently, the authority does not have the power or the resources to conduct such investigations. When will the Government deal with this matter?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	319	In respect of the electoral commission Bill, a consultation paper was published on 27 January this year and sent, as the Deputy said, to the joint committee for pre-legislative scrutiny. I presume there will be a report back and that the Minister will, on the back of that, decide what changes, if any, are needed to the consultation paper. However, at this stage, it is not possible to indicate a time as it has not gone to Government yet. I will have to get the Deputy an update on the Charities Act. I do not know what is the state of play with respect to the commencement order but I will get the Deputy the information he requires.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	334	The text of that Bill was approved by Government on 3 June.

#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	336	I understand the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has recently published the heads of Bill to provide for the introduction of a new model of periodic payment orders. This new model of payment orders will allow the courts to decide that catastrophically injured people can receive the cost of future care in the form of annual payments instead of a lump sum award. When can we expect the civil liabilities (amendment) Bill to be brought before the House?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	It will be later this year.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	When is publication expected of the greyhound industry Bill? It is very sad to see the protests outside today on the sale of Harold's Cross due to the bad management of the last Government and the €30 million debt. Somebody has to be held accountable for the Limerick track disaster also. When is publication expected of the noise nuisance Bill?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	I am afraid no date is available for either of those Bills. The greyhound industry Bill is at a preliminary stage and it is hoped to publish it this year. There is no date for the noise Bill.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	340	It has gone to the dogs.

Media reports over the weekend suggested the commission will shortly distribute preliminary reports to interested parties. The work of the commission is extremely interesting, not least given the fact the House will move today to establish another commission of investigation. When can we expect to see the Fennelly report published? I want to ask about the regulations and guidelines being devised by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in respect of wind farms. I understand work is going on between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. As we speak, applications are being made to An Bord Pleanála under the strategic infrastructure Act which are quite clearly premature in circumstances where the guidelines are not in place. Will the Minister tell us about that? Finally, on this, the fourth anniversary of the death of the late and, indeed, great Brian Lenihan, I ask what is being done by the Government in respect of the promised legislation on the sale of loan books, that is, the consumer protection Bill that was promised some time ago.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	342	To take the questions in reverse order, Report Stage of the Bill to provide consumer protection on the sale of loans will be taken next week. The review on the guidelines in respect of wind farms was commenced in 2013 and I understand the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources are considering that review at this point. I do not have a date as to when Mr. Justice Fennelly will complete his work and publish it, so I cannot offer the Deputy information on that.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	343	In the absence of employment opportunities in rural areas, the Minister last year announced the Action Plan for Jobs for the regions. It is important that we continually encourage people to upskill and be prepared for new opportunities in the regions.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	That is grand. What Bill is this?
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	345	When will the apprenticeship Bill be brought before the House?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	346	I should assure the Deputy that all regions have seen employment growth. Under our regional enterprise strategy, we are very determined there will be further improvements and there is now an opportunity for all regions to participate in shaping a plan for their region. In terms of the apprenticeship Bill, I understand the Minister of State, Deputy English, hopes to bring this forward this summer but, as the Ceann Comhairle probably knows, applications have already been received and are being assessed by an interim group so that apprenticeship needs are proceeding ahead of the Bill.

One of the matters being dealt with in that is the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services. Extensive work was conducted on this matter by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality last year and a detailed report was submitted to the Department and the Minister. Ironically, a delegation from the North of Ireland discussed this very topic with that committee and it has now progressed ahead of us in terms of introducing this legislation. I hope the Minister will confirm this legislation will be before the House before the end of this session.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	348	I understand that work is well advanced on this. I cannot give the Deputy an exact schedule as to whether it will be taken before the end of this session. I will seek information and provide it to her.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	349	The Minister has Clonmel connections. I refer to a telecoms company in Clonmel which is losing 200 jobs and to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill. What action is the Minister's Department taking to secure the jobs? I understood there was to be a deputation, including the Minister, but the matter seems to have gone off the radar. I would like him to give us an update on that. I refer to the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill. The Taoiseach told me two weeks ago that 100 GPs a day were signed up, which is totally erroneous and untrue. When will the number of GPs which have signed up be published on a website? No GPs have signed up in County Tipperary. 
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22732	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	350	I understand Report Stage of the Bill is being taken today and I am sure the Minister will comment, during the course of the debate, on the level of sign up which, I understand, has been very strong under the scheme. Order for Second Stage and Second Stage of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill is listed on today's Order Paper as back-up business to the commission debate.

Unfortunately, a large number of nurses have had their names removed from the register and they are being fined €250 to get back on to it. In other words, they have to pay €350 for what should have cost €100.

He was on a trolley until 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday, a total of 26 hours. It was his third time in hospital within the past month. Just one month ago a 61 year old lady was admitted to Kerry General Hospital on a Monday morning. She was paralysed, having lost the use of her legs the night before, and suffered from thrombosis. She spent the next 18 hours on a trolley and died 12 hours later. Two weeks ago-----

The Minister has refused to engage with or meet one of the key representative bodies, the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association. He is introducing a monopoly in this area. Why or how does the Government think it can bring forward a comprehensive policy without fully engaging with one of the key stakeholders?

When will the Bill come before the House? Have the heads been cleared? Is it likely to come before the House by the end of the current session? Quite a number of people are concerned about it. I refer to the Companies Auditing Bill, which is also promised legislation and is to allow for member state options contained in an EU directive. When is it likely to be published?

In common with everybody from County Kildare and many people throughout the country, I am conscious of the enormous significance of the 5,000 acres of open plain that is shrouded in history and mythology.The plains have given the county its other title, the short grass county. It is also connected to Kildare's recognition as a centre of excellence for the bloodstock business, thereby giving Kildare the other title, the thoroughbred County. Over the years, the plains have been used by the bloodstock industry, an activity which needs to be guaranteed, monitored, controlled and supported into the future. The farming sector, not least the sheep breeding sector, makes extensive and vital use of the plains too. Both the bloodstock and sheep breeding sectors have always demonstrated a level of responsibility in their use of this significant resource. Additionally, the Curragh plains have been an important recreational resource for many activities ranging from golf to football, from walking to running. Other less desirable forms of social and leisure activities have been happening there in recent times too. As far back as 1999, an interdepartmental group was established to examine the management of the Curragh plains. It was recognised then that an effective and efficient management system was required to be put in place. The late Michael Osborne, a colossus in the bloodstock industry and a great ambassador for County Kildare, was the first to suggest the Curragh might be developed as a national park. Notwithstanding the work done in 1999, nothing of any major significance has happened, however. Accordingly, we find ourselves in a situation in which the Curragh Plains need to be protected and managed. This legislation envisages two particular initiatives, namely, the establishment of an advisory committee made up of State agencies with an interest in and representative of the users of the Curragh Plains and the establishment of a management team to be drawn from the Department of Defence, the lead agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which has responsibility for the bloodstock industry, and Kildare County Council, which has a particular interest in this important public property. The principal objectives of this initiative are to ensure and facilitate the continued responsible use of the plains in a manner that respects its integrity and unique nature. It will also prevent the degradation of the resource and ensure its protection against encroachment in a reasonable and practical manner. This is the first legislation seen in this regard in some time. I appreciate the opportunity to present it to the House. I hope in the near future the Government will take this Bill on board and enact it. I am not suggesting the set of proposals are perfect but they do form the basis for further detailed discussion.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	413	I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, on her dogged persistence in pursuing this matter. She said it was like pulling hens' teeth. We know from the so-called answers to parliamentary questions she asked on these issues there was definitely at least one cover-up. It was only when Deputy Murphy submitted a freedom of information request that the Department of Finance revealed there were serious tensions between departmental officials and senior members of IBRC. Given the fact that IBRC was charged with recovering as much as it could on behalf of the State and the Irish people, the relations between this nationalised entity and the Department of Finance necessitate a full and proper inquiry. We should never forget that €25 billion in State funds was put into the dead carcasses of the bankrupt banks, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society. I believe this was unconstitutional, as this House did not vote on spending these State funds. I hope the matter will come before the Supreme Court this year. Given the scale of this €35 billion, which equated to almost 20% of our national income at the time, we need complete and absolute transparency on IBRC and its dealings after its liquidation. The people have a right to know whether wealthy and powerful individuals and the corporations they control were given very special treatment. We must remember that 10% of the wealthiest people in the country own 54% of the wealth while the bottom 20% own nothing but debt. This is particularly important, given the findings of the Moriarty tribunal on Mr. O'Brien. It found it was almost without doubt that a company controlled by Denis O'Brien, Esat Digifone, won the mobile phone licence competition through the then Fine Gael Minister, Michael Lowry.The tribunal found that Mr. Lowry unduly influenced the bidding process. These events formed the basis of Denis O'Brien's subsequent fortune, so what happened at that time is linked directly to the tribunal. We know from the Moriarty tribunal that he is well able to use his contacts and influence for commercial advantage.  There has been no criminal follow-up to the outcome of the Moriarty tribunal. In the real world outside this building, families with distressed mortgages are being pursued for every cent up to the point of being made homeless or put into distressed situations leading to suicidal tendencies. There are no favours and no special deals for ordinary people in this country. The dogs in the street know that there is a golden circle which operates at the top of Irish society. I hope this inquiry gets to some of the truth, but on past evidence I am extremely doubtful about that. The Government's U-turn on the need for an independent inquiry is nothing more than the usual political stroke. The previous attempt to bury this issue proved untenable so the issue has now been kicked to touch, and anyone who believes this inquiry will report before 31 December or before a general election is living in Disneyland. During the winding up of IBRC and its aftermath, other issues emerged around the payment of workers. This took a long time to be resolved, and there was persistent pressure from the unions. Another issue was the selling off of the mortgages of Irish Nationwide. I received a letter today from a couple in Lucan whose mortgage had been sold by IBRC to Shoreline Residential Limited. They are still in the throes of dealing with it and the company is trying to make them buy out their home. They are under a lot of pressure from this company. They say that, just recently, Shoreline told them through Pepper Finance Limited that they might look at restructuring their loan but this is not a solution. They say that another company, to which their loan might be off-loaded, is not an ethical company because when it started operating in southern Ireland it had no licence to operate. It also put interest rates up without notice and uses subterfuge to make its customers stay with them. The couple's response to that is, "No thanks, Shoreline. We do not want a solution from you; we need help." This couple is seeking help from us as elected representatives. They said they had written to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and to the Taoiseach, but had received no response on how their mortgage was being dealt with. These issues, relating to the aftermath of the selling off of these mortgages to vulture funds which are now capitalising on the situation, should also be looked at as part of the investigation. They do not even know how much their mortgage was sold for and whether what they are paying back is equal to that. I will support the motion for the investigation, but there should at least be a six-month review relating to Siteserv and the judge should be told that the Government wants that issue sorted out quickly. The other issues should be dealt with as soon as possible afterwards, and in any event before 31 December, although I doubt that will happen.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	414	Somebody said to me during the week that the more this issue drags on the more it resembles a scene from the Mad Hatter's tea party. "We had a problem," was followed by "No, there is not a problem." "We need an inquiry," was followed by "An inquiry would be inappropriate," and then "An inquiry is exactly what we need." "The Siteserv write-down taken by IBRC was €110 million," became "No, it was €119 million." "The minutes for certain IBRC board meetings do not exist," turned into "No, here they are after all." That is the public perception of what has been happening over the past month. No matter how much it might feel like it, though, it is not in reality a tumble down a rabbit hole, nor is it a child's bedtime story. This is very serious. Large loans extended by a wholly State-owned bank, IBRC, resulted in the loss of millions to taxpayers, including in the case of the controversial Siteserv transaction. It was said in the press that IBRC, the ruins of a bank, was originally propped up so that business could continue as normal. What is "normal", however? Is it normal for bondholders to be repaid every cent? These are gamblers of the highest order who were no doubt gobsmacked at their good fortune. Was it normal that a rake of taxes, charges and levies and cuts in social welfare, education and health were heaped upon ordinary working class citizens to cover these costs? These taxpayers are surely now entitled to know if, in the wake of the hardship they suffered, the maximum return possible was achieved by the sale of Siteserv. Was it normal for the same legal advisers to act for both the buyer and seller in the sale of Siteserv by IBRC? This is what people are asking. Was it normal that KPMG, which advised on the sale of Siteserv and whose personnel were involved in that company, was also involved in the liquidation of IBRC and was then paid to investigate the sale of the company? What are we at here? Taxpayers have footed the bill for this and so many other transactions and they now have the right to know exactly how much each property within the remit of NAMA, for example, was bought for and sold on for and to whom it was sold. We do not know that and we have a right to know that. My colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, has for many months been requesting an inquiry into IBRC and the sale of Siteserv. It has taken 19 parliamentary questions to get a straight answer from the Minister for Finance. Over the months when she was asking the questions, she told me she was submitting question after question and getting nothing back. Is this normal practice from a Government Department? Deputy Murphy deserves high praise for her determination to get to the bottom of this case, and her diligence appears to have paid off, but serious questions need to be asked regarding the way the information had to be dragged out of the Government over many months, particularly regarding Siteserv. The reluctance to investigate and report quickly to the Dáil when the issue emerged was, no matter how it is dressed up, a delaying tactic. Maybe the idea was to make Deputy Murphy tire and say "I've had enough. I can't go any further with it." She did not give up, of course.  It is crucial that the inquiry has in its remit the question of how the whole IBRC operation interacted with and was overseen by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank in the context of the transactions it is examining. This is especially important in light of the barriers which have been placed in front of Opposition Deputies in the past couple of months as they tried to probe and access these controversial issues. The fact that a Department attempted to fob off an elected representative over controversial issues in itself merits an independent investigation. I would be curious to know whether any Fine Gael Deputy is willing to go on record and state whether the actions by the Department and the Minister have been examined by the party. There is something not right when it takes 19 parliamentary questions and months of investigation by a parliamentarian to bring it to this stage. All this does is to further erode the public's trust in the political system as they have followed the issue over the past weeks and months. Serious questions also need to be asked about the way reporting by the mainstream media was influenced by money and power. Last week Irish people were relying on the international media to report on what was happening in our own Parliament. This cannot be right and it should never, ever have been the case. I myself was out of the country and it was embarrassing to meet people who were able to tell me what was and was not being said, and that what should be reported was not being reported. It could not be reported by the press, RTE or even a Dáil Deputy outside the Parliament. We became a laughing stock in the media around the world. It would not do any harm for us to read some of the statements and editorials on how the media reported this in Ireland, while Dáil Deputies were prohibited from speaking and threatened with consequences if they spoke outside the Dáil on the issue.Dáil privilege has been described by the Supreme Court as a cornerstone of Ireland's democracy. Hence, the questioning of it by Denis O'Brien's spokesman does not bode well for democracy in Ireland. People should listen carefully to the NUJ. Whatever one's opinions may be of unions, people should listen to the NUJ when it says that it has long warned that our media imbalance lets the powerful off the hook. In the wake of this controversy, there is an onus on the Government to examine our defamation laws and to assess whether they are fit for purpose. I am not too sure anymore, in light of what has happened. Previous speakers have correctly pointed out that this inquiry will be a massive task. The former IBRC chief, Mike Aynsley, has suggested that over €1 billion worth of write-downs might fall under its remit. However, it is crucial that all transactions, even those below the €10 million threshold, are examined. We need to have everything examined in this inquiry, no matter how far down we must dig. Everybody should be wary in a democracy when one month ago, there was no problem but where we have now reached a stage where we have been debating this in the Dáil for two solid weeks, the NUJ has given a crucial warning to people about the influence of the media and the media in Ireland, particularly RTE, was unable to report on an issue that is a cornerstone of our democracy, namely, freedom of speech. Members of the Dáil had to go to The Observer or The Guardian in England or to the Spanish news, which were reporting all this when we could not. It is rather shameful and disappointing. I am not blaming the Minister for that, but I found it sad and disappointing when I spoke to people outside the country. As a Member of the Irish Parliament, I was restricted and people were asking how it was that they could speak about what was happening in Ireland but all the Irish newspapers, RTE and all the television and radio programmes could not? How does that look for us in Europe? How does it look for democracy? After all of this, there must be some discussion on how we can deal with the press and the media moguls who think they control the press. Not only do they think they control the press but they think they control what Members in the Dáil say and how they say it. That is the difficulty in Irish democracy.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	415	At the outset, it is important to emphasise that the nationalised Anglo Irish Bank was deliberately set up in such a way as to keep it at arm's length from the State. As the late Brian Lenihan said at the time: "The bank will be managed on a commercial basis at arm's length from the Government, allowing the full potential of its business to be realised". The Minister for Finance was not required to be informed of details such as the Siteserv deal. That also applied to the Minister of the day, the late Brian Lenihan. As soon as concerns were raised in relation to Siteserv, however, the Minister and the Department took a series of actions on foot of them. The Minister revised the relationship framework with IBRC. As a result, he now has more oversight of IBRC activities, and rightly so. This Government's priority has been to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of the bailout of the banks and restore a functioning banking sector to serve the Irish economy. IBRC, the wind-down vehicle for the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, was liquidated as part of the deal to restructure the onerous promissory notes arrangement. The promissory notes deal in February 2013 was a key step in the stabilisation of the public finances and our clean exit from the bailout later that year. This Government reduced our borrowing requirement by €50 billion over the next decade, including €10 billion in cash savings. The disappearance of the former Anglo Irish Bank and former Irish Nationwide Building Society from our financial, political and social landscape were long overdue. Both institutions became synonymous at home and abroad with the reckless mismanagement of our banking system and wider economy. They became emblems of a culture of cronyism that undermined confidence in both our economy and our political system. They became a stain on our international reputation and a dent to our national pride. Investigations by Mr. Peter Nyberg into the causes of our banking crisis revealed that both institutions had abandoned traditional checks and balances and risk management procedures in the pursuit of ever bigger short-term profits. Both institutions are also key to understanding the wider crisis because they were both seen as highly profitable institutions to which other Irish banks should aspire. As other banks tried to match the profitability of Anglo Irish Bank in particular, their behaviour gradually became similar. Accordingly, when the crisis broke, large losses were realised not only in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, but also in other banks. Such was the prominence of Anglo Irish Bank at the time that a Member of this House who is with us today, Deputy Shane Ross, suggested that the gentleman at the head of that institution should be made Governor of the Central Bank.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	442	After the catastrophic economic management of the past decade so epitomised by Anglo Irish Bank, there is a long and hard road to travel in our country's journey back to prosperity and full employment. However, the budgetary strategy this Government is pursuing will ensure that our debt levels continue to fall and we are better positioned to withstand any shocks that may occur in Ireland, in Europe or in the global economy. Already the Government has succeeded in almost halving the interest rate on the European loans provided under the bailout programme; in securing agreement to extend the maturity of the European loans; in replacing the promissory notes with very long-dated Government bonds; and in replacing €18 billion of IMF loans with cheaper market-based funding. We pledged to wind down Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society in our 2011 manifesto. In government, we are gradually winding them down in the form of IBRC and our broader strategy is to stabilise the banking sector. The value of the State's investment in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB continues to rise. It is not the State's intention to remain a holder of its banking investments in the long-term. We believe a thriving, competitive banking sector, which is properly regulated - I cannot emphasise the need for proper regulation enough - will produce the best outcomes for consumers and citizens. The Government's exit strategy is about recovering the full cost of the taxpayers' investment in these institutions and using the proceeds to further reduce the debt. The sale of 25% of PTSB further improves this position and we are confident that all the taxpayers' money invested in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB will be fully recovered. The scale of the economic crisis we have gone through has been unprecedented in Ireland's history. As the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said, we have essentially lost a decade in terms of economic growth and job creation. Difficult decisions have been taken and huge sacrifices have been made by the Irish people but this has not been in vain. We have made real progress. The recovery has begun, it is getting stronger and we are focused on securing the recovery. Some 100,000 new jobs have been created since we took office. We are on course to return to full employment by 2018, having reduced unemployment from over 15% to below 10% in the past four years. This has been possible because the economy has returned to strong growth as a result of the choices made by this Government and the sacrifices of the Irish people. I welcome the commission to further underscore the transparent and open manner in which this Government operates. I commend the motion to the House.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	447	The fact of the matter is that I did not suggest that he be made chairman of the Bank of Ireland either. I put down a question about whether he was in the running, along with many other people. If the Minister wants to misinterpret that, as he does, it is no wonder he gets into so much trouble politically in this House and that he is now a Minister demoted rather than one promoted. If he does not check his facts and comes into the House and says things like that, it is no wonder, as he cannot be relied on by the Government. Having cleared that up, I would like to make one or two points. I welcome the fact that there is a unanimous pursuit of the truth in this House and I do not doubt for one moment that this is the objective of the Minister for Finance and other Ministers in this House. I do not doubt that this is also the objective of Deputy Catherine Murphy or the leaders of the Opposition, but I find that the solution that has been agreed upon, of setting up another commission of inquiry or tribunal, or whatever one would like to call it, is unsatisfactory. This is a tried and tested way to divert problems out into the distance. The history of tribunals of inquiry and commissions of inquiry is a sad one in this House. I will reflect on one or two of the things that have happened previously. The Ministers will be aware of the fact that an Ansbacher inquiry was set up many years ago in order to unearth, remedy and penalise those who had committed offences which were revealed by political stories. I cannot remember the exact number but I believe more than 100 people were outed by the Ansbacher inquiry. They settled with the Revenue Commissioners. How many of those people have been prosecuted to this day? The answer is none - not a single one. The response of the Revenue Commissioners to that when asked about it was that it is very difficult to collect evidence against people of that sort. Many of those people settled, yet they cannot be prosecuted. It is an extraordinary solution to a problem that has never been resolved and that remains unresolved. Another inquiry into DIRT tax in the banks was set up by this House some years ago. The result of that was that many small people who had indeed indulged in tax evasion were outed and had to make large settlements. How many bankers have been faulted for what happened in those cases? How many of the powerful have been faulted? The answer is none - not a single one. There are either still in their jobs or retired, but the result of that inquiry was the outing a large number of people who were encouraged by the powerful to break the law, and they were prosecuted or penalised while the bankers were not.  Let us consider other inquiries. We had the Smithwick tribunal, which went on forever, we had the Moriarty tribunal, which was debated in this House, we had the Mahon tribunal and we had the beef tribunal. The result of the latter was fairly ineffective, but what it did result in was a statement in this House by a former Attorney General that it was the longest job application in history. That is why I worry particularly about this inquiry: because the judge in that case who was sitting on the tribunal ended up as Chief Justice. Therefore, I ask the Minister this: is there some absolutely sacred rule that a person who has been in the Judiciary should automatically be appointed as chairman of such an inquiry, and therefore we should accept him or her as someone of totally unimpeachable motivation or expertise? There should be no automatic acceptance of that fact. It is true that under the 2004 Act a person who sits as a single judge in charge of a tribunal and should be a judge or retired judge. One of the problems here is that we have insiders judging insiders. I am not suggesting that whoever is appointed eventually is flawed. It would be helpful if we knew in advance who it was, but everybody in this House knows that those who are going to sit in judgment in such tribunals are political appointees. They are appointed by Governments and by individuals on a very partisan basis which is utterly flawed and discredited. I know the Government intends, or so it says, to introduce a new judicial Bill with a new way of appointing the Judiciary, but that has been delayed and delayed. My guess is that it will not sort out the problem of appointing judges and it will not sort out the problem that political appointees will be in charge of this inquiry. That in itself raises the question as to who should be in charge and how they should operate. It is very serious because it indicates the kind of web that exists whereby people can choose political appointees to come up with a solution which, by its very nature, is questionable and should be challenged. I also believe that while there is a genuine desire to find out the truth, this is a political vehicle. What has the row been about over the past few days? It has been about terms of reference and timing. One can put forward all sorts of reasons as to why the timing should be different. One can say we should have the report by Christmas and an interim report by October. The reason there are timing differences and timing disagreements is nothing to do with the merits of a report, the timing of a report or the facts that will come out. They are to do with one thing: the date of the election. That is all they are to do with. The Government wants it to go to 31 December or beyond because it is out of its control and they do not want something like this coming out before the election if it is out of its control. The Opposition wants an interim report earlier because it wants this particular controversy to be kept alive and fester in case there is an election in November. That is the truth of what is going on. Kicking this off to a commission of investigation is on one hand a means of deferring it until a certain day, although not because one gets the truth better on one day than on another, and on the other hand a means of keeping it in the public arena and embarrassing the Government.Both sides see this as a way of taking political advantage. It is what all of us politicians do, but let us tell the truth about it. One need only consider what is happening down the corridor today, namely, the banking inquiry. It is a neutered and hopeless inquiry that can, in effect, make no findings. It has been called an impartial inquiry to find the truth, but it is really a political vehicle to crucify Fianna Fáil once again. The game is to bring in Mr. Brian Cowen, Mr. Charlie McCreevy and Mr. Bertie Ahern, but only last thing before the election. No one should be naive enough to believe that inquiries of this sort are set up in sole pursuit of the truth. They are established for political advantage or to escape a political down side.

I welcome an investigation. I have not been in the Dáil for long, but I have seen something. As Deputy Ross stated, the banking inquiry is taking place down the corridor. The more one learns about this place and that no one will be crucified or made to pay a price for doing wrong, the more one grows frustrated. I have always understood that, when one does wrong, one pays the price. One does the time if one does the crime. Sadly, a certain group of elite people in Ireland are allowed to do whatever they want and walk away without consequence whereas every youngster and mother and father in Ireland is at home working hard and paying the price for what happened in this country over the past ten, 15 or 20 years. No one has been held accountable and the same types of people are investigating. We are debating appointing a judge to investigate this matter, but we need to look outside Ireland. This is a small country. As with the scientists whom I have dealt with down the years, we need to look further afield. We have accountancy firms that seem to get all the jobs. The same people are looking at the same problems. As in any walk of life, when someone gets to know people, he or she will not kick them as hard as an outsider who does not know them might, an outsider who tries to do something in the interests of what is right for the country. IBRC and NAMA involved the single largest movement of private debt onto the public's shoulders. The people of Ireland will be paying for what has happened for years. Although I am iffy on whether there will be any, I hope that there will be answers about what interest rates people were paying and whether there was cronyism. The more I look at the cronyism in this country, the sicker I get. Some people are being looked after better than others.

According to it, the Minister and the Taoiseach have been sent copies. A couple with a house in Lucan is being kicked around by the same bank that supposedly gave others favourable treatment. The couple's loan has been sold. The list of directors at the various companies that buy secondary mortgages off the likes of IBRC makes for interesting and sickening reading. The same people's names crop up time after time. That couple has repeatedly tried to repay their ordinary mortgage. They wanted to do a deal and the loan has been sold on at a reduced rate, but the company will not listen because it wants to get its pound of flesh. We cannot continue in an Ireland like this. Transparency must come to the fore and we must ensure that, at long last, a nod and a wink will not let someone get away with whatever he or she wants. There must be a new type of politics. Deputy Ross was right. For the Opposition, this is great and will last for a long time whereas the Government will try to kick it out, but that is not what this should be about. Who gets elected or not should not matter in this instance. Only the people of Ireland should matter, the people in every corner of the country who have seen 250,000 of their children emigrate because of others using authority in ways they should not and abusing the system. Yesterday, Deputy Pearse Doherty raised issues that may be relevant. I understand from the Minister that they can be covered by the inquiry, but let us be clear in the terms of reference and include them. Let there be no doubt. Let us ensure that we do not follow the alphabet only to E or F, but right to the end so that we do not consider just half of the story. We must read the full book and, for once in this country's life, do something right. In a few weeks' time, ex-taoisigh will attend the banking inquiry. There will be a big hoo-ha, but what will we have at the end? Will anyone announce that someone did something wrong and that he or she will pay the price? If one does not pay a television licence immediately, one will be thrown into Mountjoy Prison. If one gets away with hundreds of millions of euro and, in many cases, places that burden on the people of Ireland, one gets a clap on the back. This is not the Ireland in which I or many others want to live. They want to see an Ireland where there is transparency, people do things right and matters are handled in a new way. I urge the Minister to include everything in the terms of reference that needs to be included. Let us have no doubt about them. This is not a question of opposition and government. This is about doing something right. This is about listening. This is about setting an agenda for a new Ireland and a new future that shows people that the Dáil is not just a talking shop, but that we care and want to do something right. I urge the Government to do this from now on.

I commend and thank my colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, for highlighting this issue. She has displayed great courage, determination and commitment. Once again, this shows the need for independent voices in the Dáil and Irish society in general, people who are not in anyone's pocket and will stand up for the rights of the Irish people, particularly those in weaker sections of society who are voiceless and do not have the power or clout of the wealthy, powerful and elite. Those of us who believe in public service for the right reasons must always be vigilant and stand up for our people's rights. Trust and respect are the key issues in this debate. Where I come from, one never stands up to demand trust and respect. One earns them. This is a major problem in politics. As we debate the motion, see the play-acting and remember the original refusal to answer questions, I think of the 102-year-old woman on the trolley, the 14-year-old carers or the cut to the respite care grant that the Government claimed it could not help making when €4 million will be spent on this commission of inquiry. Three weeks ago in the House, I asked the Ministers for Health and Education and Skills to provide a fund of €1,000 to complete an educational service in Trinity College Dublin for adults with Down's syndrome. They turned me down, yet we can spend this €4 million and not even bat an eyelid.That is another issue we should address. It is something the Ministers should address. I feel angry about the original proposals because questions that were put were never answered. It is very important that we say this in the debate. I am concerned about some of the other issues we came across in recent weeks, such as freedom of the press, democracy, accountability and transparency in this country. We cannot allow the influence of one individual to be a major threat to free speech and democratic principles. We must stand by Article 15 of the Constitution. We have seen other movers and shakers moving in to buy TV stations. People who work in the media are looking over their shoulders. People are asking whether journalists are afraid. In recent years, we had the sad case of the disgraceful treatment of Sam Smyth, who is one of our top journalists. The Government should act by saying that no one person can have a major influence over the Irish media. Journalists have to be free within the law. I emphasise the word "within". Like some of my colleagues, I recently received a letter from a couple who are being pushed and messed around in this regard. I would like to read a section of the letter:We are a couple from Lucan, that got into trouble with our mortgage in late 2010 with IRISH NATIONWIDE BUILDING SOCIETY. We went to INBS four times during 2010 [and] 2011 and requested that they restructure the loan and they told us the Government would be bringing in legislation to help all stressed mortgage holders and people would be looked after and there was absolutely nothing to worry about. The Government's solution was IBRC, and we embraced the process and gave them all our financial data thinking they would at the Government behest minimumly restructure our mortgage. The IBRC sent us a 20 page letter demanding that we sell our family home within six months or they would sell it over our heads. A Mr. Weller from IBRC told us at his office in 6 Grand Parade D2, that they had the courts and judges on their side and there was nothing we could do.

I will stick to the guidelines. The letter continues:We refused to sell our home. We paid off most of our debt within a year and secured an agreement from IBRC to pay 1100 euros per month which we have paid every month since the agreement in 2013. Recently we have paid this amount into an account and not to Shoreline residential due to them not handling our situation. At this point IBRC viewed us as an asset and sold us off to Shoreline Residential Ltd. for [in the region of] 40000 euros. Our first communication with Shoreline was to request to buy back the mortgage and they agreed and said make an offer. We did make an offer which they refused and said we needed to make another offer which we did and they refused it again. At this point we felt we were doing all the running and requested that Shoreline make a counter offer so we could see where they were at and they totally refused and ignored 5/6 letters to them. We had let them into our home to value it and gave them our finance data and cooperated with all of their requests so we felt totally isolated.That is just one case. I am raising it during today's debate because people out there are saying that the wealthy in Irish society are getting loans and debts written off, whereas people who are actually making an effort to pay back some money are being screwed and hammered into the ground. This really gets up my nose when we are talking about the terms of reference. In relation to the terms of reference, the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance have decided that each transaction involving losses of over €10 million should be included. I would decrease that to €1 million. I also believe the timeline should be extended. There are serious governance issues in this regard. My colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, has raised the issue of the timescale, which is vital to the investigation. She said that it should not conclude on prom night, but should expand to cover transactions up to the present day because there are issues that straddle both time periods, including the interest rate issue. She asked for an assurance that the report will be concluded in a timely manner and that the election will not scupper it. These issues have been raised by Independent Deputies in relation to this matter. When we are discussing these issues of banking and finance, we should not forget the broader issue, which is that many of those who support the wealthy elite in our country seem to have friends in the print media who enjoy kicking a poor country like Greece around. I strongly feel that Greece is being bullied by the EU.

The Government has decided that the establishment of a commission of investigation under section 3 of the Commission of Investigations Act 2004 is necessary to investigate certain matters of significant public concern regarding certain decisions, transactions and activities entered into by IBRC between 21 January 2009 and 7 February 2013. It is also looking at the details of the guarantee of the Irish banking system on 30 September 2008. A new management team and board were put in place in 2009 with the objective of managing the bank in a manner that minimised the ultimate cost to the Irish taxpayer. I am saying it is very important that we raise this as well. I will support this commission of inquiry, but I have concerns about some of the issues that have been raised by my colleagues. I sometimes wonder why we do not have commissions of inquiry to investigate the 138,000 children in this country who are living in poverty in 2015, the increase in the level of consistent poverty from 6.8% in 2008 to 11.7% or the 37,000 children who will be living in poverty in 2020, according to the Ombudsman for Children, Mr. Niall Muldoon. Some 1,054 children are homeless at the moment. I am saying that commissions of inquiry have to be focussed on these issues as well. I add to that the need to support people with disabilities. People with intellectual and physical disabilities are crying out for services at a time when €4 million of taxpayers' money is being spent on a commission of inquiry. Overall, I commend Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising these issues and showing once again that strong Independent voices are needed in Dáil Éireann to stand up and protect the rights of the citizens of this country.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	462	I welcome the decision to commission a full inquiry investigation into IBRC transactions, even if it is belated at this stage after certain matters were comprehensively brought to the attention of the public stage by Deputy Catherine Murphy on numerous occasions. The terms of reference have certainly been expanded and significantly extended by comparison with the original KPMG inquiry that was sanctioned. In their current format, the terms of reference cover all aspects of the various dealings. It is imperative that this report will be finalised before the end of the year. We hope that will happen because the general public, like everyone in here who was elected by the public, is waiting in anticipation. The other thing that should be mentioned is that at this stage, the general public is fairly punch-drunk following a whole plethora of investigations and tribunals and a whole spate of State investigations in recent years.Almost all the inquiries featured golden circles, cronyism and greed, which has been rampant as people manipulated taxpayers' money. These people were self-centred. The general public is battered and bewildered. It is disgusted by the revelations alleged against the banks, big businesses and people carrying out their duties in a manner that would normally qualify as unorthodox and unethical. There is plenty of material to verify this. These people manipulated to gain the maximum out of the system. For a long time before the Minister’s appointment this bloody system was short on regulation. There was very lax, poor or no regulation. Regulators were brushed aside or seemed to go into hiding. The shortage of enforcement compared with international standards makes us the laughing stock in the outside world. It is obvious that we have not learned from, or paid any heed to, the previous major banking scandals and their catastrophic effect on Irish society. It is mind-boggling for the general public to accept the revelations here, the huge scale of the write-downs, which were approved by the IBRC, the involvement of individuals and their agent companies. In many cases, there is evidence to show a very strong conflict of interests, double standards and manipulation of finances by these people out of greed and self-interest. The IBRC has sanctioned over 40 write-downs for these big businesses and for a select group of individuals who received a combined write-off of debts of up to €1.25 million. That figure may emanate from the Department of Finance, or from the Minister. It is all the harder for the general public to accept, digest and tolerate this when at the other end of the scale the ordinary householders, who we meet every day in our clinics and when we carry out our duties as public representatives, are in a sorry state. They are devastated and, in some cases, families are on the point of breaking up. Some people have serious health problems while others have lost their jobs. I hope the Minister will make proper provision for the banks to ease this burden because people deserve a break from the layers of austerity and tough measures they are enduring. Up to 10,000 houses are in danger of being repossessed or of suffering severe additional penalties because the IBRC has sold them off to vulture capital funds. They have no mortgage protection because the mortgages are outside the control of the Central Bank. This is symptomatic of the rough treatment inflicted on the majority of the public. The elite is getting preferential treatment at the expense of those ordinary people. Major tensions existed between the IBRC and the Department of Finance, which went far beyond the original issue of Siteserv. I will not blame the Minister because there is a legacy matter involved. The engagement between the two organisations went so low that at one stage the Minister said following the Siteserv sale there was a serious problem and he was not confident of reporting the IBRC’s affairs to the Dáil. This signifies a lack of information and maybe a lack of stewardship by the Minister’s officials and advisers. That is a matter to be clarified. It is not good enough that matters were not properly reported to the Minister and that there was not proper communication. That is very undesirable. One the controversies concerning the IBRC and the Department is the way it conducted several other deals such as pay deals and appointments at the bank and how it handled major borrowers. It appears that matters came to a head at a meeting in July, which the Minister and his senior officials, the chairman of the bank, Alan Dukes, and the chief executive officer, Mike Aynsley, attended. The major issues of concern to the Department included the sale of a high profile residential block in New York. One IBRC staff member raised questions about the appointment of the US firm, Blackstone, to sell the big assets without following proper procedures. There appears to be a web of questionable activities and conflicts of interest. 
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	463	I do not know if the Minister does any political reading but obviously in the Dáil, there is not a high level of debate. Outside this Chamber there is a great deal of political writing. I recently visited America where Chris Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize winner, has been writing about a corporate coup d’état, a global corporate takeover of society whereby what he calls the internal controls that used to exist have declined and the corporate takeover is complete. By internal controls he means a questioning media and a questioning government that would, in some way, constrain the global oligarchy.The issue the House has been debating for many hours yesterday and today is the epitome of this. Hedges writes that "a tiny global oligarchy has amassed obscene wealth". The Minister will be aware that the wealth of 80 individuals equates to the wealth of 3.5 billion people, or one half of the population of the planet. Hedges also speaks of corrupt governments "abandon[ing] the common good to serve corporate profit" and notes that "no mechanisms to institute genuine reform or halt the corporate assault are left". He adds: "The citizen has become irrelevant. He or she can participate in heavily choreographed elections, but the demands of corporations and banks are paramount." He must have had Ireland in mind when he wrote these words, given their relevance to the topic under discussion. Hedges also states that governments the world over blindly serve their masters and "acquiesce to the looting of state treasuries to bail out corrupt financial houses and banks while ignoring chronic unemployment and underemployment, along with stagnant or declining wages, crippling debt peonage, a collapsing infrastructure, and the millions left destitute and often homeless". While he is referring to the global position, his description accurately characterises the position in this country.  Yesterday, we heard about an insiders' investigation into very dodgy dealings. We are discussing the winding down of a bank for which ordinary working and unemployed people have paid a heavy price. KPMG is investigating KPMG. Many of the members of an old boys' network who have multiple business links, including shares in each other's companies, and were involved in the original deal will be involved in investigating this deal.  Lest we forget, the individual we are discussing was the subject of the Moriarty tribunal. Does the Government accept the findings of that tribunal? Is the Minister in a position to answer that question because the Government certainly sends out mixed signals on the issue? The tribunal found that "no conclusion can be arrived at, other than that repeated and clandestine courses of actions were adopted by persons intimately associated with Mr. O'Brien, to confer payments or other benefits upon Mr. Lowry, on behalf of Mr. O'Brien." The tribunal's report also detailed the various payments that were made.  Following the general election, the Taoiseach stated that he would "sever the links between politics and business once and for all and, in so doing, achieve three fundamental goals: stop the further pollution of our society; re-establish a moral code and order regarding public life; and, through that, restore public confidence in politics and government." Public confidence is at an all-time low following the events of recent weeks.  If the Government believes the findings of the Moriarty tribunal, which cost taxpayers €200 million, why was Denis O'Brien a guest of the Government at the Global Irish Economic Forum which, ironically, took place at Dublin Castle, the location of the hearings of the Moriarty tribunal? Why has Mr. O'Brien had such a strong relationship with the Fine Gael Party? The Taoiseach has seen fit to have many public meetings and engagements with Mr. O'Brien, including at the New York Stock Exchange. Last week, Mr. O'Brien was given an opportunity to publish an article in The Irish Times despite having ready access to many other media organs. Reading the piece, people will have been nauseated by the arrogance on display. Clearly, a person living in a retreat in Malta will not be familiar with the pain that has been inflicted on ordinary people in this country as a result of seven years of austerity. Mr. O'Brien wrote: "Maybe I am old-fashioned but I operate on the basis that a client’s relationship with its bank is at all times confidential." It is incredible that he believes his dealings with a bank which was bailed out using billions of euro belonging to taxpayers and unemployed people should be secret. Mr. O'Brien also wrote: "Dáil privilege is an important component of our democracy; however, there is a parallel duty of care on the TDs and Senators to use this privilege with integrity under the guidance of the Ceann Comhairle." However, no parallel duty exists to respect the findings of a tribunal that cost taxpayers €200 million and that investigated the award to Mr. O'Brien of a mobile telephone licence that amounted to a licence to print money. Lo and behold, Mr. O'Brien was subsequently given another licence to print money when he was awarded the contract to install water meters. That depends, however, on whether the Government proceeds with its plan to implement water charges, which is highly unlikely.  Denis O'Brien has boasted that his actions of late were an act of patriotism. I did not realise that when the purchase of Irish assets by foreign companies was at its height, Mr. O'Brien decided to buy a number of companies "to keep some of them Irish, to preserve and grow employment and to seek opportunities for these businesses to develop in Ireland and overseas." What is the Minister's view on this statement? The companies in question included Siteserv, Topaz and the Beacon Hospital, which, taken together, cost taxpayers approximately €350 million through write-downs on their debts. Taxpayers will not take the view that Mr. O'Brien did us all a great service. Mr. O'Brien also wrote that, over dinner one night - probably in Malta - a friend told him not to bother buying anything in Ireland as he would "get dog's abuse." These people live on another planet, yet they have such an ordinate power. I understand, for example, that Mr. O'Brien has pursued 28 cases of libel.  Considering how much money the Fine Gael Party has received from Denis O'Brien, he can certainly be described as a patriot. In an 18-month period between March 1995 and June 1996, when the Minister was either at the helm of the Fine Gael Party or held a high-profile position in it, Mr. O'Brien supported Irish democracy by attending 14 Fine Gael fund-raising events and donating £20,000 to the party, which was then in government. In 1996, he donated a further £50,000 to Fine Gael on behalf of three of his companies. The late Jim Mitchell also worked as his political consultant. Given this baggage and history, I would have expected the Government to seek to remain a million miles removed from Denis O'Brien. It seems that is not the case. The lucrative water meter contract that Mr. O'Brien was awarded as a result of Siteserv setting up GMC Sierra confirms to those who are sick and tired of what they are hearing about this issue that they should boycott water charges. This would be a powerful way to fight back, as these people should not be further enriched. The word on the street, in case the Minister is not aware of it, is that not only has Mr. O'Brien won the contract to install water meters, but he will probably also come to own Irish Water. Events have shown that the system is at fault. Senior journalists stated on a radio programme today that it is probable that the commission of inquiry will not find anything illegal. Does it not say something about the system that all of this will be found to have been perfectly legal? It shows what a rotten system we have and that capitalism is at fault and must be eradicated.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	464	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It is unfortunate that it is being held at the end of a protracted period of public discourse on an issue that could have been addressed at the outset. While I will not use the word "advice", as I do not wish to insult the Minister, the Government should have taken on board some of the views of Deputies on this side of the House. The nature of the information emanating from the debacle in IBRC around the sale of Siteserv suggested on most people's radar that even if there was not prima facie evidence of legislation being breached, there were certainly matters that would have given rise to the suggestion of some level of impropriety.Had the Minister for Finance acceded to the request from this side of the House, we could have moved on yesterday and today to deal with issues of significant importance. From the very start, it was clear that there were issues around the way in which the Siteserv deal had gone through. For me, the warning bells rang loudly when a bust company and its directors walked away from the ashes of that event with €5 million. The matter was further compounded when the person who negotiated the sale on behalf of the State went on the national airwaves and used the phraseology, "The votes had to be bought." It may be that buying votes in the corporate world means something different from buying votes in the political world, but it should not. It should suggest from the very start that there was something wrong - if not a breach of the law, a breach of the basic moral code. When, in essence, it was taxpayers' money rather than any shareholders' money that was at stake, alarm bells should have been ringing loudly in the ears of Ministers too. It disappoints me that the Minister for Finance allowed a veil to be pulled over it because he felt that IBRC as constituted was working supposedly in the best interests of the taxpayer. That was notwithstanding the fact that €5 million from such a deal ended up in the back pockets of shareholders and notwithstanding the fact that there was significant activity on the share register in the weeks preceding the finalisation of the deal. Obviously, there were people with inside information or who had access to information who believed there would ultimately be some payout. It baffles most people, particularly those who have experienced the loss of their family homes or other assets, or know of people to whom this has happened, as a result of the fall. Many people have taken a huge hit, whether in terms of private pensions or property or the family home. They are not given a dividend when the bailiff shows up and they are not given a sweetener to go when they are asked to hand back the keys. It does not happen. Their authority is not bought. That is why it is most troubling that the Government was not able to see it. I have no issue with capitalism to the extent that others might. I have nothing against Denis O'Brien as a businessman seeking to make money, but someone needs to protect the taxpayer. Denis O'Brien cannot be seen - nor can anyone else - as a white knight who is rocking into town, buying up distressed assets and returning value to the taxpayer. That is not what they are doing. The Minister knows well that they are cherry-picking the salvageable assets that have long-term potential. I wish them the best of luck if they have the wherewithal to do it, but when we see the complex transactions that appear to be funded by some State assets, we can see that it is wrong. The State needs to put in place the appropriate protections. How the Minister ever accepted that KPMG could carry out an investigation that would pass the most basic smell test is beyond me. I do not care what Chinese wall the Minister was prepared to build that would challenge any structure in place in the good times; it would not have withstood public concern or basic standards in any jurisdiction where the rule of law reigns paramount. That is why this matter has been so protracted. It goes back to the question that Deputy Micheál Martin asked the Taoiseach the other day, which was whether someone in government is afraid of Denis O'Brien. Is there somebody who is genuinely afraid of him, such that the Government cannot stand and act in the best interests of the taxpayer while letting him do what every other businessman does - that is, look after his own interests? If it is in his best interest, he will purchase assets, but someone needs to look out to ensure that in an environment where distressed assets are on sale, interests are protected. It seems to me that if a sweetener had to be put in place to get the Siteserv deal over the line, that should have been the first flag or alarm bell prompting people to say, "Hang on a second, there is a problem here." One then moves on to what has happened since. David Murphy in RTE, a noted and reputable journalist, put a solid story together and gave Denis O'Brien the opportunity to comment. Like many others, he was served with a legal writ. That worked its way through the courts and Deputy Catherine Murphy came to the House with further information which she put on the record. Mr. O'Brien decided to usurp the authority of the court in one instance and use a judgment in one particular case to silence the House. He silenced the national broadcaster, which was prudent in its approach, and many other mainstream media in the full knowledge that he was bluffing. That was proved when he failed to submit a defence in the case that was taken by RTE and The Irish Times the following week. Throughout that period, the Taoiseach failed on numerous occasions to assert the primacy and authority of the Constitution in the protection of utterances in the House and their reporting thereafter. When one puts the two things together - the way in which the Siteserv deal was allowed to languish without a proper investigation, and the Taoiseach's failure to protect the Constitution and assert its supremacy in protecting the House - one must ask the legitimate question of why the Government is beholden to Denis O'Brien. Why not put the Government's side of the story? We have a belated acceptance now by the Government that a commission of investigation is warranted, but the caveat the was dropped in was the phrase "there is no evidence to suggest...". There is ample evidence to suggest that there was considerable wrongdoing, if not within the narrow definition of some legislation then certainly morally and certainly outside what one would have thought was the best interest of the State, which the public elected the Minister for Finance and the Government to protect.

It does not necessarily fall at the Minister's feet, but his own Department has been behind the scenes on this. That is surprising in view of much of the documentation that came from John Moran, the former Secretary General, wherein it seemed he had a very adversarial discourse with IBRC. It then transpires that there were packs associated with various board meetings that disappeared or are still floating in an in-tray, an out-tray or a parked tray. I do not know where they are, but maybe the Minister can help us with them. The average person could not be regarded as cynical for feeling that there was an unholy mess and a lack of desire on the part of the Government to address it appropriately. The big issue for me in relation to Denis O'Brien is his significant control of the media. What he does not own, he has threatened. That is wrong. He is a businessman and I have no issue with him making vast sums of money. The best of luck to him. However, when he seeks to use his influence in the media and his very strong approach to litigation to silence the House, it steps over the line. It steps over the threshold of acceptability, or should from a Government perspective also. The Labour Party has talked a great deal over the last number of years about ensuring a diverse media and ensuring diversity in its ownership, but it has sat on its hands through two successive Ministers and failed to address the issues. I am not surprised that Fine Gael, as others have said about its relationship with Denis O'Brien, did not want to rattle that cage in advance of an election, but the Labour Party has been abysmal in the protection of free speech. It is appalling. The Government's acceptance of the necessity of establishing a commission of inquiry was too late. The fact that it has decided not to allow for an interim report in advance of the next election speaks volumes as to why it ducked and dived for the past number of months on this issue.

He began by saying that he would set the context for this debate. He proceeded to turn on Fianna Fáil. I have no problem with that because, in some ways, Fianna Fáil deserves what it has got and probably a lot more. However, the context is a little different because it is the recent years of this Government's term and decisions taken by it or its agents with public moneys, and IBRC was public money. It is in the interests of the Irish taxpayer and of ordinary people who have suffered the consequences of recent years to know what decisions are being taken on their behalf with their money. If it is decided to write-down €1 million, €2 million or €3 million, they are entitled to know for what reason and whether it was in their interests. If it is decided to make sweetheart deals or deals of any type with their moneys, then they are entitled to know. What we now have is a discussion around the motion which we did not need to have. This could have been teased out, as was attempted by my party leader, Deputy Adams, by our finance spokesperson, Deputy Pearse Doherty, by Deputy Catherine Murphy and quite a number of others, over the past number of months. What they asked is exactly what the Minister promised in an election not so long ago - at this stage, it is over four years ago - that a new era had dawned, that this new Government would be transparent, that we would be entitled to find out what was happening with public moneys and that the era of the cute hoorism of the previous Government and everything that went with it was over. Backbenchers and opposition Deputies, in particular, were forced to extract information not by means of parliamentary questions, because most of those received obscure or irrelevant answers, but through freedom of information requests. Thankfully, once again this Parliament is being served by whistleblowers who have exposed deals that are not in the public interest and about which the Department of Finance had major concerns in terms of the probity of the deals. To explain the context again, this is in an era when people are languishing on trolleys or in seats, as in the case of Beaumont Hospital which I attended recently with mother. Instead of trolleys, it has 20 seats because 20 trolleys will not fit in the accident and emergency department. This is in an era when we have the highest number of homeless people and nearly half a million people have emigrated in the past ten years. That is the context. They are the people whose money the Minister has been playing with, or has allowed others to play with without any recourse to this House. The Minister was brought kicking and screaming to this motion which does not go far enough. This did not end in February 2013; it is still happening today. If we decide to have an inquiry, then all transactions must be included. Those decisions are affecting the public purse and the future because any tax foregone or any write-down means that money is not available for other services. The decisions to write-down, whether €100 million, €200 million or €1 billion, all mean that money is not available for public service. The Minister might stand over that, which is his right and his decision, but those of us on this side of the House have a right to question whether that was the right decision. The Minister has tried to obstruct us in that regard. The other big promise the Minister made at the time the Government was elected was that the old boys' network, the cute hoorism, was gone-----

People understand exactly what I am talking about, that there is a clique in society, a group of people who are not bound by the usual norms of this Parliament and who have looked after each other. What is even more galling is that they have been facilitated, despite the conflict of interest, by this Government on a number of occasions. Some have a lot more understanding of and specific details about the transactions and have highlighted some of them - my party leader, Deputy Adams, included - but they have not received the answers. The terms of reference which the Minister has produced may allow the judge to look beyond quite specific aspects but we are calling in our amendment for quite specific details to be part of the remit rather than an afterthought that might be, will be or shall be or whatever that judge decides. We are asking the Minister to include them in the remit and to outline a timetable for the reports because the case of Siteserv, which triggered this, is the most immediate case. We all know some of the details and some of the work may have already begun. While this is ongoing, we need to examine some of the other issues raised by Deputies in this House. It is only right and proper that this happens. It is also not only right and proper but it will recognise the public interest aspect because it is the public's money.  Michael Geoghegan suggested one of the Blackstone officials should be on the NAMA advisory board. Whether that is right or wrong, there is a conflict of interest but nobody seemed to step in until that question was raised in this House. These are major questions. Did the Minister not see that there would be a conflict of interest in the appointment of some people to advisory boards who were conflicted in some aspects? The buck stops with the Minister because he is the Minister for Finance but was he aware of all the write-downs and all of the sweetheart deals that went on? The idea of KPMG acting as auditors, advisers and facilitators raises major questions about the Minister and the appointment by this Government of advisers. I remember very early on in this Government's term and in the run-up to the election, there was extensive criticism about the use of advisers by the Fianna Fáil Government but this Government seems to have extended the practice because there seems to be more advisers for every Minister than there ever was under a Fianna Fáil Government and I am not protecting or congratulating Fianna Fáil. The toxic relationship between the group that seemed to be looking after itself rather than looking after the public interest has never been fully investigated.I wish the judge well when and if he takes on such an onerous task. I hope he will reach speedy conclusions and that the officials and civil servants will move heaven and earth to facilitate a quick report. It is pointless unless it is brought up to today. I ask the Minister again to use the little time he has before we put the motion to a vote and to look at the logic of the Sinn Féin proposals. He should accept that it is the same logic that forced him to at least put some motion before the House. We should go right up to today in terms of transactions and write-downs.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	474	I would like to thank all of the participants for their contributions during the course of this debate. The debate reflects the constructive consultation that we engaged in, and I am confident that the majority of the concerns around the terms of reference of the commission of investigation are already addressed in the revised terms of reference. Throughout the evening yesterday, and again today, there has been a lot of discussion about details of specific customers, specific transactions and decisions taken by IBRC. The public concerns about these matters are why we are initiating this commission of investigation. I would like to encourage Deputies who have information that may be a cause for public concern to bring this to the attention of the judge and I commend Deputy Doherty on committing to do exactly that. I have listened carefully to Deputies' concerns and would like to address some of those relating to the terms of reference in these closing remarks. The issue of an interim report or an earlier deadline was raised by Deputies from Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin as well several other Deputies. However, I maintain the view that the 31 December 2015 deadline is appropriate, bearing in mind the different nature of the review and its extended scope. Turning to Sinn Féin and Deputy Creighton's proposal to extend the scope of the transaction by reducing the monetary threshold to €1 million, let me restate that under the terms of reference, the commission will have the power to investigate any transaction of any value that gives rise or is likely to give rise to potential public concerns, regardless of the level of loss. The movement between the particular and the general in terms of governance
within the bank and the role of the Department and Minister for Finance has been raised by Deputy Martin and a number of other Deputies. While it is essential that the focus of the investigations remain on individual transactions, it is from a review of the individual transactions
that trends and potential concerns may be identified. Section 4 of the terms of reference provides the judge the power to go further with the investigation in the public interest "on any other matters of concern arising from its investigation", and report and make recommendations on these matters. Deputy McGrath and other Deputies' concerns focus on the role of the Department and the political oversight
by both my predecessor, the late Brian Lenihan, and me as the respective Ministers for Finance. I want to assure the Deputy and indeed other Deputies who raised similar concerns last evening and today, that under paragraph 2(f) of the terms of reference the judge will be in a position to exercise judgement as to whether the Department took appropriate
steps with the information provided. Regarding Deputy Martin's concerns about the wealth management unit,
I can assure him that the specific inclusion of the wealth management unit in the terms of reference as a result of our consultation on Monday enables investigation into both general and specific concerns around transactions and decisions made by the unit. Similarly, the terms of reference have explicitly included the performance of agents of IBRC on the matters under investigation, in order to enable the investigation of concerns raised regarding the role played by IBRC's advisers. Agents are included; the consultants mentioned are agents who may be inquired into by the judge, as may their role. The concerns raised by Deputy Doherty are covered in the current terms of reference; the commission shall investigate all
transactions, activities and management decisions during the relevant period
which are identified by it as giving rise or likely to give rise to potential public concern. The issues of managerial decisions and verbal agreements between IBRC and borrowers
were raised by both Deputy Doherty and Deputy Murphy during the debate last night. The terms of reference cover all transactions, activities and managerial decisions during the relevant period that are identified by the commission as giving rise or likely to give rise to potential public concerns would like to clarify that the relevant period was broadened following consultation with Deputies Murphy, McDonald and Martin to include any situation where a contractual obligation, either written or oral, was entered into prior to the liquidation of IBRC but was not executed until after the liquidation. It is not my intention nor the intention of the Government to cut off a potential line of investigation into transactions, activities and managerial decisions of IBRC, that have given rise or are likely to give rise to potential public concerns. Following consultation this morning with the Attorney General and a review by the Attorney General's office of the statement made by Deputy Doherty last night and the document provided by the Deputy to the Taoiseach's office, I can confirm that the circumstances raised by Deputy Doherty relating to a verbal agreement before the liquidation of the bank is within the scope of the terms of reference. Questions also have been raised regarding the examination of unusual share trading activity in respect of any transaction under investigation. The judge is explicitly empowered to investigate such activity with the commission of investigation's broad powers - activity which cannot be adequately investigated based on a review of files held by IBRC. I also welcome Deputy Murphy's support for this commission of investigation and want to address her concerns regarding the motivations of the promissory note transaction. I can assure Deputy Murphy that my statements in introducing the promissory note transaction were and remain accurate. The promissory note transaction was designed to significantly improve the financial position of the State with regard to the heavy burden of the promissory notes on the State's finances. As Minister Humphreys pointed out earlier last evening, the promissory note transaction was an important milestone which has significantly improved the financial position of the State and benefited taxpayers. I do not agree with Deputy Creighton's contention that the investigation is toothless
as the commission has significant powers, including the right to compel witnesses to attend, to inspect premises and to prevent the destruction of evidence. Criminal sanctions can apply to persons who commit offences pursuant to the Act. These offences include failing to comply with directions without reasonable excuse; failure to preserve documentation; the obstruction of authorised officers of the commission; and the making of false statements to the commission. The broadening of the scope of the review to cover NAMA
was raised by Deputies Wallace, O'Sullivan and others. It is worth recalling that NAMA is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and NAMA's clear and well-stated policy is that properties and loans are openly marketed. Members of the House, particularly members of the public accounts committee, will know that the Comptroller and Auditor General maintains five or six staff permanently in NAMA, who are effectively embedded there. They review all transactions and report to the Comptroller and Auditor General. Deputy Keaveney made a serious allegation that my comments to the effect that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing will prejudice the commission of inquiry.I reject that assertion and maintain that while various allegations have been made, nothing has been proven at this stage and it will be up to the commission of investigation to investigate these matters. The other suggested amendments made by different speakers are largely included in the terms following the productive consultation I had with Deputies Micheál Martin, Catherine Murphy and Pearse Doherty. At this time, I would like to confirm that retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Daniel O'Keefe, has agreed to serve as chairperson of the commission of investigation. Mr. Justice O'Keefe has a strong commercial background as a chartered accountant and he is also a former chairman of the Irish Takeover Panel. I would like to express my appreciation to Mr. Justice O'Keefe for agreeing to serve in this important role. I would like to repeat what I said in my opening remarks and encourage Deputies who have received information that may be a cause for public concern to bring these concerns to the attention of the judge. I would again like to thank all of the Deputies who contributed to this debate. I am confident that the majority of the concerns around the terms of reference of the Commission of Investigation have been addressed in the revised terms of reference and I look forward to the results of the investigation being made available.

I am pleased to introduce the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 for the consideration of the House. For several years there have been gaps in the statutory framework as regards workers who seek to better their terms and conditions either through collective bargaining or by means of registered employment agreements, REAs. These gaps arose after the Supreme Court struck down the old REA framework on constitutional grounds, having at an earlier stage found serious fault with the collective bargaining legislation. The Bill is a direct response to these rulings. It represents delivery on two key commitments and it is a Bill I am very proud to have progressed. I entered public life 16 years ago to improve people's living and working conditions. I believe this new legislation can help to do exactly that. The legislation has two purposes. It will provide for the reintroduction of the registration of employment agreements between employers and trade unions in individual enterprises and for a new framework to replace the former sectoral registered employment agreements. The Bill will also put in place the legislative amendments required to give effect to the programme for Government commitment to reform the Industrial Relations Acts 2001 and 2004 dealing with collective bargaining. Before moving to detail the various sections of the Bill, I would like to give Members an overview of what the Bill achieves. Part 2 of the Bill provides for the registration of employment agreements between employers and trade unions governing remuneration and conditions of employment in individual enterprises. The content of these agreements will be a matter for the contracting parties and they will be legally binding on those parties. Part 2 also provides for the making of a new type of ministerial order, namely, a sectoral employment order, SEO. The Labour Court will be entitled to initiate a review of the pay, pension and sick pay entitlements of workers of a particular class, type or group in a particular sector and then make a recommendation to the Minister. Such a review can be initiated at the request, separately or jointly, of organisations that are substantially representative of employers or workers. Where the Minister is satisfied that the process provided for in the new legislation has been complied with by the Labour Court, he or she shall make the order. Where such an order is made, it will be binding as regards all members of the class, type or group of workers in the sector to which it relates, and it will be fully enforceable. There is broad acceptance that the reintroduction of REAs and a sectoral pay and conditions framework in a constitutionally robust manner will benefit workers and their employers. From a worker and employer perspective, these agreements and orders will provide certainty around pay and conditions. They will also provide the very real pay-off of industrial peace. These are critical considerations for workers planning their future and for employers when tendering for and working through contracts. They will also maintain skill standards and help avoid a race to the bottom, which, in the end, is of no lasting benefit to either employers or workers. In this regard, we all note the considerable importance that employees in Aer Lingus have attached to securing a new and comprehensive set of registered employment agreements to underpin their continued employment under new owners. I am pleased to have played a role in securing a meeting of minds between workers and management on the way forward for employment at Aer Lingus, and, of course, I hope the Bill can be expedited through the Houses in sufficient time to enable its provisions to be made use of by those parties. While there can be no REA at Aer Lingus unless and until the legislation is passed, there is, of course, nothing to prevent management and unions from starting negotiations on a new employment agreement now with a view to having it registered as soon as the Bill becomes law. In due course I imagine Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann may well become engaged in a similar process. In all these cases, I stress, however, that while Government policy is to support enterprise level agreements and to provide the framework for them, believing they are mutually beneficial and that they safeguard the interests of employer and workers, they are in essence voluntary agreements negotiated between a business and its workforce through their unions. The content has to be settled between the parties themselves and is not imposed by Government. Part 3 of the Bill fulfils a significant commitment in the programme for Government to ensure Irish law is consistent with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. It will provide a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed where there is no collective bargaining in the workplace. It will ensure that workers, aided by a trade union, can advance claims about remuneration and conditions of employment and can have these decided by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies. This part of the Bill provides guidelines to help the Labour Court identify the genuine independence of internal bargaining bodies and sets out policies and principles for the Labour Court to follow when assessing the comparability of the remuneration and conditions in dispute. I know that workers may feel exposed when seeking to improve their terms and conditions. Simply making themselves known may have unwanted and unwarranted consequences. The legislation will therefore provide significant protection against such consequences. This will be available by way of interim relief in the Circuit Court to a worker who challenges a dismissal on the basis that he or she was victimised as a result of invoking the process under the Act.I conclude this short overview by acknowledging that both trade unions and employer organisations played a critical role in assisting to develop this clear and workable framework and that representatives of both sides of industry made a major contribution.  In summary, the re-introduction of REAs in a constitutionally robust manner will provide certainty around what pay and conditions will be into the future. In addition, I have no doubt that REAs and SEOs will assist in resolving industrial disputes or potential disputes and will promote industrial peace. A balanced mechanism for determining terms and conditions where there is no collective bargaining provides a statutory remedy against workplace exploitation. This Bill is described in its Long Title as "An Act to make further and better provision for promoting harmonious relations between workers and employers". Industrial relations harmony is one of the principal objectives of our industrial relations legislation. I have made repeated statements about the ongoing dispute in Dunnes Stores. I have said I am disappointed that the company decided against attending Labour Court hearings, contrary to good industrial relations practice, and I have called on both sides to engage and to use the professional expertise of our workplace relations institutions to assist them in resolving the dispute. I call again on the company to engage in a meaningful fashion with the Mandate trade union. If there is no willingness to do so now, it may well be that passage of this legislation will sufficiently alter the circumstances to persuade the company of the merits of doing so in the very near future. In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court offer the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving the issues at stake in that dispute. Taken together with the national minimum wage (low pay commission) Bill that is at present before the Seanad, I believe that the next few weeks represent a unique opportunity for the Oireachtas to bring about the most significant shift in the industrial relations landscape seen in many years. I will now outline in detail the provisions of the Bill. Part 1 of the Bill deals with the Short Title, citation and interpretation provisions and commencement date. It also provides for standard provisions on expenses incurred in the administration of the Act. Part 2 deals with registered employment agreements and sectoral employment orders. Chapter 1 deals with the definitions for this part, while Chapter 2 deals with REAs at individual enterprise level. Section 5 defines key terms to be used throughout Chapter 2 including "parties to the agreement", "employment agreement" and "trade dispute". Section 6 provides for a register of employment agreements to be maintained by the Labour Court. It requires the details of REA registration, cancellation and variation to be published on the Internet. Section 7 provides that, where an application is made to register an employment agreement, the court shall register it only where satisfied that there is all-party agreement that it should be registered, and where it is satisfied that it is desirable or expedient to have a separate agreement for the class, type or group of workers covered by the agreement. Similarly, the court shall only register the agreement where it is satisfied that the trade union or trade unions is or are substantially representative of the workers. To be registered, every agreement must also provide that, if a trade dispute occurs between the relevant workers and their employer, there shall be neither industrial action nor lock-out until the dispute has been submitted for settlement by negotiation, in the manner specified in the agreement. In addition, the court shall not register an agreement unless it is satisfied that registration is likely to promote harmonious relations between workers and their employer and the avoidance of industrial unrest. Importantly, an REA may not prejudice any rights as to rates of remuneration or conditions of employment conferred on any worker by or under this or any other Act. Section 8 provides for the variation of REAs. This may arise where all parties so agree, or where one party wishes to vary the agreement but the other does not. In the latter case the court, after the exhaustion of the agreed dispute provisions, may refuse or grant an appropriate variation. Provision is made for a party to withdraw from an agreement following variation, where the agreement provides for a party to do so.  Section 9 provides that the court may cancel the registration of an employment agreement at the request of all parties, or on the application of any party where the registration of an employment agreement has continued after the finishing date, and consented to by all parties. It may also cancel the registration where it is satisfied that a trade union is no longer substantially representative of the workers concerned. Section 10 provides for the terms of an REA in respect of remuneration and conditions of employment to be incorporated into a worker's contract of employment. Section 11 provides that the Labour Court may, where asked, decide a question as to the interpretation of an REA or its application. In addition, a court of law, in determining any question arising in proceedings before it on this point shall have regard to any decision of the court on the agreement or may, if it thinks proper, refer the question to the Labour Court for its decision. Chapter 3 deals with the new mechanism for sectoral employment orders. These will encompass remuneration, pension schemes and sick pay schemes, or a combination of any or all three. Section 13 provides that a trade union or an organisation of employers which is substantially representative of workers or employers of a particular class, type or group in a particular economic sector may, separately or jointly, request the Labour Court to examine the terms and conditions relating to remuneration, or sick pay, or pensions and may request the court to make a recommendation to the Minister. The court may not consider a request where the Minister has made an employment order for the same workers in that sector in the previous 12 months, unless there are exceptional and compelling reasons. Section 14 provides that the Labour Court shall not undertake an examination unless it is satisfied that the trade union or organisation of employers is substantially representative. In so satisfying itself, the court will take into account the number of workers represented by the trade union and the number of workers employed in the sector by employers represented by the organisation concerned. Section 14 also provides that the court will have to be satisfied that it is normal and desirable practice to have separate rates of remuneration and sick pay and-or pension provisions for the class, type or group of worker concerned and that any recommendation is likely to promote harmonious relations. Section 15 provides guidance to the Labour Court on the principles and policies that it must take into account before making a recommendation to the Minister. These include the requirement to ensure that the recommendation would promote harmonious relations, promote and preserve high standards of training and qualifications and ensure fair and sustainable rates of remuneration in the sector. Section 15 also provides that the recommendation by the court may provide for a minimum hourly rate of pay in excess of the national minimum wage; not more than two higher hourly rates of basic pay, based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned or the attainment of recognised standards or skills in the sector concerned; and minimum rates of pay in respect of young workers as provided for, and in accordance with, the relevant percentages set out in the National Minimum Wage Act. The recommendation may also include a minimum rate of remuneration for apprentices, and for pay in excess of basic pay in respect of shift work, piece work, overtime, unsocial hours, Sundays and travelling time. Recommendations in this respect are at the discretion of the court. A recommendation will include procedures to apply in case of a dispute concerning the terms of a sectoral employment order. Section 16 provides for the submission by the Labour Court to, and consideration by, the Minister of the Labour Court recommendation. The Minister must refuse to make an order if not satisfied that the process has been complied with. Otherwise, the Minister must make the order. Standard provisions dealing with the laying of orders before the Oireachtas are proposed. However, I am considering whether this should be amended to a positive resolution and will come back to this matter on Committee Stage. Section 17 provides that if an order has not been amended or revoked within three years, the Minister may request the court to undertake a review of the terms and conditions of the previous order. Section 18 provides that an SEO shall apply to all workers of the class, type or group in the relevant sector, regardless of whether the worker and his or her employer were party to the request to the Labour Court, and provides for the incorporation of the terms of any SEO in a worker's contract of employment. Section 19 provides for anti-penalisation measures to protect a worker who invokes any right conferred on him or her by the Act or who takes other specified actions under the Act. Section 20 provides a mechanism to allow an employer experiencing financial difficulties to apply to the Labour Court for a temporary derogation from the requirement to pay the remuneration stipulated by an order. I move on to Part 3, which addresses the Government's commitment on collective bargaining. Section 23 amends the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 - the "Principal Act" - by inserting definitions in relation to "collective bargaining" and "excepted body". Section 24 amends the principal Act to remove the right of access of what are called "excepted bodies" to these procedures. I should explain that "excepted body" is the term used in the trade union Acts to describe a body such as an in-house works committee or the like that is not a registered trade union and that conducts negotiations on pay and conditions only for the staff of one employer. Since the decision of the Supreme Court in larnród Éireann v. Holbrooke, it is now clear that a body cannot be an excepted body within the meaning of the Trade Union Act 1941 unless it actually conducts consensual negotiations with an employer so if there is a genuine excepted body in operation, that means that there is genuine collective bargaining going on. Since this legislation is only about providing a remedy where there is no collective bargaining, a fundamental prerequisite for invoking this Act must be the absence of collective bargaining negotiations. That prerequisite cannot be satisfied where there is a genuinely functioning excepted body. Section 24 also amends the principal Act to provide additional matters that the court must consider in determining, before embarking on a full investigation, whether an employer engages in collective bargaining with his or her workers. I recognise that the procedures under this legislation would not be appropriate to disputes involving an insignificant number of workers. Therefore, new provisions are added to the principal Act which balance the need to avoid the possible creation of artificial grades, groups or categories to subvert the intention of the Act, with the need to avoid erecting barriers to access for all reasonable cases. To achieve this, the principal Act now provides that the court shall decline to conduct an investigation of a trade dispute where it is satisfied that the number of workers party to the dispute is such as to be insignificant in relation to the grade, group or category of workers concerned, or any larger related grade, group or category of workers, unless there are exceptional and compelling reasons that justify an investigation. Section 24 also amends the principal Act to ensure that the same or a different trade union cannot repeat the process if the court has made a recommendation or determination for particular workers in the previous 18 months. The section inserts a new subsection into the principal Act to give practical effect to the principle of the independence of an excepted body. It gives guidance to the Labour Court as to the criteria it should take into account in determining whether an excepted body is engaged in collective bargaining and is genuinely independent of the employer. The section amends the principal Act by providing that where an employer asserts to the Labour Court that it is his or her practice to engage in collective bargaining with an excepted body in respect of the workers concerned, it will be for the employer to satisfy the Labour Court on this. Section 25 inserts a new section into the principal Act to provide for supplemental matters relating to members of the trade union employed by the employer. The Government has decided, as a matter of policy and principle, that it would be preferable for the workers involved in a dispute under this Act not to be required to make themselves known to their employer early in the process if possible, so as to avoid any potential for victimisation. The new section provides that a statutory declaration made by the chief officer of the trade union concerned setting out the number of its members who are party to the trade dispute and the period of membership in the grade, group, or category to which the trade dispute refers shall be admissible in evidence without further proof unless the contrary is shown. However, where the employer asks that the matters specified in the declaration be examined, the Labour Court shall satisfy itself that these are indeed correct. Section 26 amends the principal Act to substitute the term "terms and conditions of employment" with "the totality of remuneration and conditions of employment". This is required to ensure that the totality of pay and conditions is examined by the Labour Court. The section also makes provision in the principal Act to the effect that the Labour Court shall not make a recommendation unless it is satisfied that the totality of remuneration and conditions of employment of the workers concerned provides a lesser benefit to those workers than the totality of remuneration and conditions of employment of comparable workers employed in similar employments. This provision is required because the principal Act, as it stands, provides no guidance to the Labour Court on the factors that should be taken into account in formulating a recommendation or determination under the Act. Section 26 also provides new guidance to the Labour Court, in considering whether to make a recommendation, as to the procedures to follow in its assessment. The court is required to have regard to the totality of the remuneration and conditions of employment of comparable workers employed in similar employments - whether those comparable workers are represented by a trade union or not - and the comparability of skills, responsibilities and physical and mental effort required to perform the work in which the workers are engaged. In this respect, the court may have regard to similar employments of an associated employer outside the State. In addition, the amendment provides that where collective agreements concerning the relevant worker are commonplace in similar employments, the court shall, in addition to other evidence presented by the parties, have due regard to the terms of such agreements for the time being in force. Where collective agreements concerning the relevant workers are not commonplace in similar employments, the court shall have due regard to all evidence presented by the parties, whether by way of collective agreements or established by other means. Finally, the amendment provides that the court shall, for the purpose of making a recommendation, have regard to the effect a recommendation may have on the maintenance of employment and the sustainability of the business in the long-term. Section 30 amends the principal Act by inserting a new section to provide interim relief pending the determination of a claim for unfair dismissal arising from the provision by a member of a trade union of evidence, information or assistance under the Act. The appropriate amendment to section 6 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 is provided in section 35 by adding an additional ground on which a dismissal is deemed an unfair dismissal. The terms "worker" and "employee" are given the same meaning to ensure consistency between the two Acts. The remainder of the Bill is concerned with what are essentially consequential amendments, which are detailed in the explanatory memorandum. I look forward to the contributions from all sections of the House on this Bill and I hope to respond in detail to the views expressed. I believe the Bill in its totality represents a significant step forward for workers and employers. It provides a clear, workable and constitutionally robust framework within which workers' remuneration and conditions of employment can be discussed and determined. I am confident that this framework will fit Ireland's constitutional, social and economic traditions and its international obligations and, very importantly, will ensure continued success in creating jobs and attracting investment into the economy. I commend the Bill to the House.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	480	I welcome the publication of this Bill and its arrival into the House after a few false dawns. In 2011, when the Government was appointed, I made the point that the lack of appointment of a Minister for labour affairs to the Department would result in a setback to workers' rights and various pieces of legislation such as this. I was dismissed at the time. I was told it would not be. However, my concerns proved to be correct. The present Minister of State, Deputy Nash, was appointed to the role in July 2012 and suddenly these things started to move, because there was somebody within the Department who was driving them forward and whose job it was to see them progress. This is why we are here. It is why we have this legislation and the minimum wage legislation. I welcome much of the Bill. There will be little disagreement on many aspects of it. However, the climate of employment has changed in many respects over the past four years. It is important to recognise that the vast majority of employers are not Dunnes Stores or some other operations that have gone to court to suppress workers' rights. They are decent, fair employers that work for the interests of their enterprise and employees and that want to get on with their business in as fair a way as possible without being choked by administration. That was one of the difficulties with the old REA system. I hope that the changes being brought in do not choke businesses with administration and do not leave them exposed for lack of administration procedures, as opposed to a commitment to the spirit and the intent of the legislation. That is what we will be looking at on Committee and Report Stage to ensure this is as administration-friendly as possible. Unless it is, people will not get the benefit of the legislation. They will lose out on the benefit of the legislation, which was a feature of the old system. I also welcome the provision allowing for review every three years, because under the old system, some of the REAs have been in place since the 1940s, and things have changed in most areas in this country since then. It was a feature of that legislation. It was not fit for purpose and it was not a major surprise that it was struck down. At least now we have that provision with regard to registration. There are a couple of gaps. One glaring gap is the omission of any kind of provision for representation of pensioners of companies. That must be given consideration. We have seen, and will continue to see, so many examples of people who gave their lives to particular companies - especially large companies, some of which the Minister of State mentioned in his remarks - but find their pension entitlements are being changed and that they have very few rights in terms of contesting those changes to their daily income. If they were still workers within the company they would have all the rights and protections proposed in this legislation. However, because they have gone out on a pension, they have lost many of those rights and that role in the decision-making process of the company. There is no respect for their role in the company and the fact that they are still on the payroll, albeit in a different way. That needs to be dealt with. There are so many examples of companies that are completely changing defined benefit schemes, leaving pensioners who have no ability to earn any other income high and dry without representation.Surely this represents an opportunity to address the issue. I agree with the Minister of State's remarks about Dunnes Stores. It does not listen to what happens in this House and it could not care less. That said, however, we need to ensure that we keep using this House to call on Dunnes Stores to support its workers, who are an essential part of its enterprise. It is quite extraordinary that companies in that sector which are headquartered outside the country are leading the way in terms of protection for their workers and involving them in their enterprises, yet the company that is headquartered in this jurisdiction seems determined not to do anything and to move as far away as possible from such a partnership arrangement. I would say to those big organisations and companies that are protesting and complaining about the introduction of this legislation that they should lift the phone and call the Dunnes Stores of this world and other companies that have shown such scant regard for workers' rights that it has proved necessary to reinforce and re-launch this legislation. There is a proportionate balance in the intent of the legislation between increased collective bargaining rights and anti-victimisation provisions in particular, while maintaining a voluntarist approach. I note that considerable work has been under way in the Department to ensure consultation across the various employer organisations, but in particular with those that represent our foreign direct investment, FDI, sector. People have ideological issues with them, but we should remember that they employ nearly 300,000 people and they have a stake and a role in this. The legislation is progressive. It has the capacity to significantly improve the rights of workers who are seeking to negotiate collectively. The litmus test for it will come very quickly: will it be able to assist in the resolution of the dispute in Dunnes Stores and will it be able to assist in the resolution of other disputes that may be coming down the tracks, such as those in the transport companies that the Minister of State mentioned? It will not be long before this legislation gets its full test. The Minister of State should include a commitment in his reply to the debate to review the legislation in the autumn if it seems to have failed or not assisted in the resolution of those disputes. Otherwise, it will be left as it is for many years in a flawed state. I welcome section 8 among other sections. Section 8 is important because it allows for some element of variation in situations in which there is a difficulty around an agreement, particularly where parties agree to the variation or where one party agrees to it. We must ensure that is done fairly and that access to that provision is given in a cohesive and consistent manner. A difficulty with the old system was that what happened under one registered employment agreement, REA, differed from what happened under another. The rules around them were different. That led to a certain lack of equality and transparency in the running of the entire programme, which needs to be addressed. In particular, section 8, while it allows for flexibility, needs to be applied in a fair and a transparent manner. In terms of examining a difficulty in the context of section 13, one of the claims made about the old system was that it was a closed shop. We can consider organisations that were in existence in the 20th century that do not reflect new types of organisation, be that within the union movement or the employer movement. Small businesses in particular will say that they do not have a role in this regard under the new regime. Their input needs to be recognised because many small businesses want to engage and involve themselves in this area but it is one that is a minefield for them. They often do not realise that they are committing an offence under labour legislation until that is found to be the case at an inspection. We need to ensure that the information given to them is comprehensive. We need also to ensure that the organisations that represent them have a role in the management of this process. I hope that will also be allowed under section 13. The issues in regard to the resourcing of this legislation are hugely important. The Minister of State must ensure that when we are giving all this new responsibility and new flexibility to the Labour Court, it is properly resourced. The passing of the Workplace Relations Bill and its implementation this week are significant, but the delays that were allowed to happen at the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Labour Court and the various points of access for the apparatus that is envisaged under this legislation were unacceptable. Many of them were because of the delay in reform and because of the negotiations that took place, but there is no sense in introducing such robust legislation unless the Labour Court and, more importantly, the implementation of the Workplace Relations Act are resourced. The workplace relations agency, through the old National Employment Rights Authority, will be the body charged with implementing and enforcing the REAs, and unless they are resourced to carry out proper inspections, set up proper helplines and have proper administrative support, this legislation will fall at the first hurdle. The Minister of State needs to ensure that employers have the information that is needed to ensure they comply with this legislation. I emphasise that the majority of employers will want to comply with it and their failure to do so is usually due to ignorance of the legislation, which needs to be resolved. In terms of the administration of the provisions of the legislation, I would point to the inconsistencies under the old REA system and the inconsistencies within the same organisation, with different REAs applying to different companies depending on the business or trade in which they were engaged and whether they expanded or did their business in a different way while operating under the same roof, whereby they found themselves exposed under a number of new regulations. We have to ensure that the protections contained in this legislation are as administratively friendly as possible and that private employment law firms will not make a fortune out of this Bill. It should be the case that employers who want to comply can easily do so. If we can do that, many of the frustrations experienced with old REA system will be removed. The aim of the Bill, as the Minister of State set out, is to improve the communications and atmosphere between employers and employees, and this will be more than achieved, but the legislation is only one part of that. The Minister must ensure, in the context of the implementation of the legislation, that resources are provided, together with an understanding of the consequences of the new provisions, if he is to fully achieve the stated aim of the legislation.

Cúpla seachtain ó shin ag an gCoiste um Poist, Fiontar agus Nuálaíocht luaigh ionadaithe ón Construction Industry Federation, CIF, cúpla achrann mór a bhí ag titim amach san earnáil construction. Dúirt siad go raibh siad ag titim amach ag an móimint sin de bharr easpa registered employment agreements, REAs. In ainneoin go bhfuil an geilleagar ag teacht chun cinn, cé go bhfuil sé mall, dar leis an CIF go mbeidh conraitheoirí agus oibrithe fós faoi bhrú agus nach mbeidh aon tairbhe ann dóibh siúd as go dtí go mbeidh struchtúr ceart i bhfeidhm agus páirc cothrom iomaíochta os a gcomhair. It is worth noting the challenges facing workers within the construction sector, although the challenges are not limited to that sector. They have suffered a massive crash in recent years. The construction sector is, in many cases, in chaos. We have seen a vacuum created by the absence of sectoral wage-setting mechanisms, and construction workers have been forced into bogus self-employment arrangements and, in many cases, have been paid less than the minimum wage. As the Minister of State will be aware, I have on many occasions used the opportunity presented in this Chamber and at committees when dealing with legislation on Committee Stage to raise awareness and focus on their particular needs. One of the most famous of these disputes is the one at Kishoge. It showed how weak Ireland’s compliance and enforcement mechanisms were, even on a publicly funded capital project. In other words, where the State was the employer or had initiated the contract, we saw desperate behaviour by contractors with regard to worker rights and their pay and conditions.Even where the contractor was in breach of a contract, the State took no action to vindicate the rights of workers. Workers got up at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. day in, day out to go on the picket line in the lashing rain in order to vindicate their rights. No matter which angle we took, door we knocked on or Minister we brought the information to, we were led to believe that nothing could be done for those workers in the immediate term. Labour Party Ministers are often found close to microphones blowing their own trumpets about how far they have advanced workers' rights in the past four years. The situation on the ground could not be further from the truth, however. Compliance and enforcement across the industrial relations framework have been weakened under the Government's watch and the resourcing of enforcement bodies has been inadequate. Consider some of the organisations involved. The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, Scope and the Contractors Administration Services, CAS, do not have the teeth necessary to resolve disputes quickly. Rates of prosecution are low, as are the fines imposed on rogue employers. The Government has stripped out well-established rights provided for under previous registered employment agreement, REA, legislation that, for example, allowed access to workplaces by designated union officials to monitor compliance. If one cannot measure or monitor, it is difficult to manage what is happening. Those agreements tried to ensure that employees were protected from victimisation by employers arising from such visits, for example, the docking of wages where an employee met and spoke to his or her trade union official. The Government has taken an extraordinary length of time to commence the Construction Contracts Act 2013. How far the Government allowed the construction industry to collapse into chaos is an incredible indictment. It took two years for the Bill to pass through the Houses and a further two years for the appointment of a cathaoirleach to the panel of adjudicators, as required under the legislation. We have not even seen the appointment of the adjudicators yet, nor have we seen the code of practice, which needs to be drafted. We still have no indication from the Government, which is in its dying days, as to the date by which either provision will be delivered upon. The level of prioritisation that the Government has brought to the table on this matter is an indictment of it. Similarly, the Government has dragged its heels in addressing the industrial relations vacuum arising from the McGowan judgment. Employers and unions do not become united on issues regularly, but they are united in their criticism of the practices that have arisen in the intervening period. For many workers, pay rates have hit the floor and conditions have become intolerable. Across the construction sector, reputable employers are caught between a rock and a hard place. They are forced to compete with unscrupulous companies and contractors that secure tenders by underbidding for jobs, that is, bidding below the price for which a contract can be delivered, after which the bidders either choose a subcontractor down the food chain or their employees to get stuffed on their prices or wages. This leads to decent companies and subcontractors going out of business and workers being forced to take wages less than should be the case. Employees cannot pay their mortgages or rent, feed their children, etc. while those decent contractors that bid at prices commensurate with the jobs in hand and did not win the contracts suffer significantly reduced turnovers. This is happening on publicly funded capital projects and yet no action has been taken. NERA does not have the teeth and the Department of Social Protection has proved ineffectual. The relevant contracts tax, RCT, system is a mess and a disgrace. These contracts were designed to facilitate a small number of individuals who had to get involved in self-employed contract work, but thousands of employees have been forced into such contracts. The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners appear unwilling to investigate thoroughly what has been described as widespread abuse. When endeavouring to raise and pursue these issues with the Minister, like his colleagues in the Departments of Finance, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform, he presents us with an exercise in political pass the parcel. No one wants to deal with the issue. I seek flexibility in legislation. One should try to make negative practices uncompetitive instead of banning them outright. However, the situation has reached the point at which it will be necessary for the State to grab the RCT crisis by the scruff of its neck and legislate. This is not just a workers' rights issue, as the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, has highlighted. This matter is a cause of concern for decent businesses tendering for projects. Throughout the Kishoge dispute, I was deeply shocked by the blasé attitude of Ministers to the reported abuse of RCTs, paying of brickies below the national minimum wage and flouting of contractual obligations that were clearly set out in the public works contract. It is widely accepted that compliance and enforcement in industrial relations is lacking. The Labour Party has not addressed this matter during its term in office. For many, particularly trade union members, that has been deeply disappointing. On collective bargaining, neither the Labour Party nor Fine Gael can claim credit for the introduction of the legislation that is before us today. The programme for Government affirms this. In order to ensure compliance with European Court of Human Rights judgments, the Government committed to reforming the law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining by introducing statutory recognition of that right. The Government promised this legislation more than four years ago. While we welcome its arrival, the delay in introducing it underlines where the Government's priorities have laid to date. The Labour Party in government has not set out a clear strategy on how it intends to address the challenges that arise from the voluntary nature of Ireland's industrial relations system. Many wonder why the Labour Party has shied away from ambitious actions to achieve what were long-held values. When the Labour Party faced a decision between betraying its hard-pressed, working class base or its new, leafy, liberal, middle class constituency, it made its choice. The compliance with and enforcement of employment and industrial relations Bills are not what they could and should be. This Bill's measures on non-compliance fall short of what is required. Monitoring and compliance rights established by the previous wage-setting mechanism have not been replicated in the new REA framework. We raised similar concerns when dealing with the workplace relations legislation and had hoped that the Government would incorporate them in this Bill. When presenting to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, a number of amendments were suggested and clarifications sought by stakeholders on the draft heads of the Bill. While the legislation has addressed a small number of the concerns raised, I hope that the Minister will keep an open mind when revisiting those omitted when presented on Committee Stage. Trade unions asked for it to be clarified that the basic plus two higher rates of pay could be set in respect of each category of worker coming from the various classes, types or groups in the sectors concerned. Facilitating the ability of an employer to sign up to an agreement where he or she was not party to the original agreement was also raised during the pre-legislative scrutiny phase. It was noted that the protection of agency workers was not adequately secured. With specific reference to the collective bargaining provisions, we remain concerned that the mechanism will not adequately meet the goal and that the voluntary system underpinning this approach is fundamentally flawed. Conclusions raised by the jobs committee in its pre-legislative scrutiny report on the REA provisions have been dealt with by the Minister in the final draft.For example, legislation still provides that the Labour Court may have regard to work in similar employment of an associated employer outside the State. Obviously, the legislation does not contain any corresponding obligation on the Labour Court to take into account general wages as compared to cost of living issues. I have raised this issue with regard to the Low Pay Commission as well. A comparison between corresponding rates of pay in the South and the North of Ireland is simply not comparing like with like if the cost of living is excluded as a comparable factor. For example, many people in the North of Ireland have far greater access to health care at a far lower level of cost to them. That is just one of the cost of living factors that needs to be taken into consideration. When the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was speaking in the Seanad earlier this year, he told Senators they need to recognise that the State's approach "has always been voluntarist". He said the Government is seeking to remain within the voluntarist tradition because it "has served us well". Of course many people would disagree with the Minister in that regard. The labour movement sees the collective bargaining Bill that is before the House as a stepping stone that marks an improvement in the rights of workers. I do not doubt that they are correct because this legislation represents an improvement on the absolute absence of the right to collective bargaining. However, it falls short. I will explain exactly why SIPTU on behalf of the Labour Party is championing this Bill as a win for the party’s programme for Government negotiations. The leadership of SIPTU needs the perception, at least, of a Labour Party win on workers’ rights primarily because the Labour Party in government has failed the labour movement over the last four years. Trade unions and their members know well that we have to thank the International Labour Organisation and the European Court of Human Rights for the collective bargaining provisions in this legislation. I suppose we should not take the claims of labour leaders too seriously, given that they told us in 2009 that a "Yes" vote in the Lisbon treaty referendum would deliver collective bargaining and of course jobs, jobs, jobs. Neither has come to pass. I want to mention the case of the Tara Mines workers and pensioners in my constituency. The pensioners are engaged in major difficulties as they see their own pensions being reduced in part by legislation from the Department of Social Protection. These pensioners find themselves voiceless in this whole process. They do not seem to be able to have a direct impact on the pensions they paid into and were told they would be able to draw down in the future. I am concerned that the system being used by the Government with regard to pensions can be exploited by companies by front-ending their claims under that pensions legislation. I appeal to the Minister of State to ascertain whether a mechanism is available to allow the rights of former workers to be upheld. It seems to me, as was the case with the previous issue, that this problem is being exacerbated by those who are playing political pass-the-parcel with it. In other words, everyone we consult on it tells us that it is not exactly their responsibility and that they are broadly in favour of doing something. At the end of the day, nothing gets done. I hope the Minister of State will see this as an opportunity for him to resolve this crisis for these workers. The legislation before the House is a reinstatement of rights that have already been won and a real step forward with the international right to collective bargaining. The anti-victimisation provisions in the Bill are welcome. The Minister and the Minister of State should be commended for addressing some of the concerns that were raised at the early stages of the legislative process.

This Bill seeks to address two central areas. I welcome the decision to replace the registered employment agreements that were struck down as a result of a court ruling. Similarly, the provisions in the Bill that seek to address the whole issue of collective bargaining are long overdue. Obviously, the context for this legislation is the fact that we have the second highest level of low pay in the OECD, which is a pretty dire situation, and the existence of the phenomenon of the working poor, which is linked to the fact that 16% of those who are living in poverty are working. The Government has been central in pursuing an agenda that involves the introduction of so-called labour activation schemes like JobBridge and Gateway. To my mind and the minds of many others, such schemes are exploitative because they essentially use cheap labour instead of employing people on a properly paid basis to do real jobs that need to be done by local authorities. In the case of JobBridge schemes, private sector employers are essentially able to avail of free labour. Like many people, I would certainly say that such schemes have been used as a mechanism to massage the unemployment figures, encourage a push to the bottom in terms of wages and conditions and further the low pay economy. It has already been mentioned that the phenomenon known as bogus self-contracting is another important dimension to the context in which we are debating this legislation. The abuse of the relevant contract tax system was particularly highlighted at the time of the Rhatigan dispute. Construction workers will certainly say that the absolutely flagrant, widespread and massive abuse of that system is absolutely endemic across the construction sector. Developers and big contractors use the relevant contract tax system as a means of exploiting workers in the most appalling way. In the Rhatigan case, workers discovered after six weeks that they were getting €5 an hour, in effect. They were forced to go out on strike. It was just appalling. It is worth remembering that the workers were fully vindicated when they finally went to the courts, which found that the abuses they claimed were happening were happening, that they were being exploited and that this system was being abused. It has been clear ever since when I have been talking to those workers and others concerned with this area that the Government needs to take urgent action to address this whole scheme. It does not seem that Revenue is making a serious effort to address this issue. One allegation made by workers concerned about it is that there is a massive loss to Revenue. The massive number of people employed under the relevant contract tax system is disproportionate. Of course there are real subcontractors out there. If they are examined carefully, it is clear that many of these people do not fit any serious criteria of being a subcontractor. The tenders they put in, often for public jobs, are a joke. Any serious examination of them would show that these people are putting in tenders that they could not fulfil without brutally exploiting the people who work for them. These subcontractors often use laughable addresses. I have a document showing the address of a contractor involved in a public contract for a development at St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra. The address of the contractor who was employing people to do a job at that college turned out to be an undertakers on the Lisburn Road. There is too much to go into there. This is a very serious abuse. These things have to be looked into. On the Bill itself, obviously the re-establishment of the registered employment agreements is a positive development. We are going to have to look at the details of this measure on Committee Stage to make sure it is fully robust.Whether a group is substantially representative is the key issue we need to consider to ensure that there are not too many hoops for workers to jump through in order to avail of these employment agreements to ensure decent conditions at a sectoral level or in the registered employment agreements. On Committee Stage we will need to scrutinise the Government’s claim that we cannot, for constitutional or legal reasons, establish union recognition where the employer is obliged to recognise a trade union. The Government will no doubt argue we cannot do that and this is the best way to get around it. There is, however, a substantial difference between proper trade union recognition and an employer being required to recognise a trade union, which should be a basic right for workers, and what this legislation proposes which is also potentially open to abuse by the employers. 
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	484	I welcome the Bill, the re-establishment of the registered employment agreements and the introduction of the employment orders for rights already won and struck down. While these are welcome, the only organisations that will properly ensure compliance with these orders and agreements are the trade unions and active trade unionists. The real weakness of this legislation is that it will not fundamentally provide the legal right for collective bargaining compelling employers to recognise trade unions where a majority of employees wish their union to negotiate on their behalf. I recognise that requires constitutional change but the 1937 Constitution is not fit for purpose. This is demonstrated by the fact that we have one or two referendums a year to attempt to bring our Constitution up to date. Among other things it over-emphasises the right of private property. We need a completely new constitution based on economic, cultural and social rights to reflect the real values of the democratic republic we wish we had today. I welcome the measures to protect workers from victimisation by their employers for trade union activity. The recent Dunnes Stores strike demonstrated disgraceful examples of the victimisation of workers through demotions, reductions in hours and in some cases sackings. In my constituency, in the Dunnes Stores at the Ashleaf Shopping Centre workers were intimidated into participating in a company ballot to not go on strike again. The action by employers such as Dunnes, Aldi and Lidl in the retail and grocery trade and others in areas, such as construction, shows the need for strong legislation to protect workers. We have become a low wage economy, second only to the United States in the number of jobs classified as low paid. A total of 16% of workers are working poor and the share of national income spent on wages is now lower than that in the 1940s. That is a terrible indication of what Irish workers have gone through in the past decade or so. The State is in many cases supplementing profitable employers through family income supplement and other welfare payments while many workers are paid so little they do not pay tax. This impacts on the State’s ability to provide decent health and child care services, the services society needs to fulfil many people’s aspirations and hopes and essential human rights. I urge all workers to use this legislation, make sure it is fit for purpose, that it is robust enough, join a union if they are not already in one, become active in their union and join with their workmates to stand up to their employers because in the long run the only solution to low pay, bad working conditions, bogus self-employment contracts, zero-hour and low-hour contracts and precarious employment is strong, democratic, militant trade unions. I, and others, will move amendments in regard to trade unions access in the workplace and for collective bargaining rights and for workers to be able to meet their colleagues and distribute information, etc. The Minister of State should also provide negotiating rights for former workers, that is, pensioners. The ESB pensioners have contacted me to say this should be included in this legislation and must be provided for. These people are part of society but are not represented in any shape or form to vindicate their rights. There should be a mechanism in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 to do so. 
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	485	Like most, I welcome this Bill, with a few reservations. While it is a positive attempt to foster better relations between employers, employees and their representatives, this Bill contains a number of shortcomings. Fundamentally, it does not increase the obligation on the employer to recognise the role of trade unions in dispute settlements. While we are told this is due to a Supreme Court ruling in the Ryanair v. IALPA decision in 2005, which deemed it was unconstitutional to force an employer to recognise a trade union, I wonder is that really what this case turned on. We are constantly told we cannot introduce any form of rent control in this State because of a Supreme Court decision on an Act from the 1960s but a detailed reading shows that is not why the Act was ruled unconstitutional. It is very limited. Is the Government really willing to engage with this issue? There are other ways to normalise employer recognition of representative bodies representing the interests of their employees. In the United Kingdom, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 includes a duty to bargain in good faith and obliges the employer to disclose certain information to trade union or worker representatives. Even without forcing the employer to deal directly with trade unions, it is very possible to foster a more co-operative environment, which would, in turn, lead to more resolutions. I deal with many non-unionised workers in my constituency. Seasonal work is a large source of employment in Donegal and for many the only source of employment, especially among farmers and fishermen. Often they are on call, have zero-hour contracts, low-hour contracts or are engaged in casual contracts. They might be reliant on social welfare payments for the other half of the year to supplement their income, or they might return to other seasonal work, such as farming. Budgetary cuts introduced by this Government in recent years have left the seasonal workers in an even more precarious situation. Due to the lack of work and hours available to them they are unable to maintain their social welfare entitlements. They are now dubbed the "precariat", due to the precarious nature of finding work. They find themselves in a unique situation compared with most other employees across the country and in other sectors and they are vulnerable to exploitative work practices in the industry in which they work. Some seasonal workers work on call shifts and employers are obliged, in theory at least, to compensate workers who are required to be on call but are not used for work. Under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, workers must be paid for 25% of the hours when they were on stand-by or paid for 15 hours, whichever is less. However, this is not always the case and many workers find they are not given what is due to them. Furthermore, these compensatory measures do not extend to casual work contracts. How will this Bill increase protection for those in precarious work and what is the level of enforcement allocated to ensure compliance by employers? The Bill sets out mechanisms for employers, employees and trade unions to engage on terms and conditions and where employer engagement is non-existent, the trade union can make a request to the Labour Court to investigate the dispute but there is little focus on the non-unionised workers. The Bill addresses excepted bodies, which are non-unionised and have a representative who puts forward the issues of the workers employed within the same company. The Bill outlines the factors the Labour Court must take into account to determine whether a body is independent, elements such as election of representatives, voting, financing, number of meetings, etc. and the employer will have to prove that it does not have control over the negotiating body. My concern, however, is that the legislation does not apply where the number of workers party to the trade dispute is insignificant having regard to the total number of workers employed by the employer unless exceptional and compelling circumstances exist. If collective bargaining is a right, those workers who are a minority in their workplace are not entitled to this right. I know from personal experience that many small groups of workers within a single employment have changed conditions for their colleagues because they were willing to step forward and take cases to tribunals and fight for their rights but they are left in a very vulnerable position and have to represent themselves.  This is where the issue of victimisation is relevant because behind the scenes in workplaces there are many different types of intimidation and ways to discourage the organisation of workers.In the fishing sector, in particular, workers may be silently black-listed and prevented from working in the industry if they are known to have tried to organise workers, join a trade union or resolve an issue. Such practices are not dissimilar to those that prevailed at the time of the 1913 Lock-out. It has been claimed the Bill strengthens the employees' protection from victimisation by employers, for example, through the provision of interim relief in the case of dismissal and the enhancement of protection of workers who believe they are being victimised. While it is fine to introduce legislation to try to strengthen the rights of workers, the key issue is one of enforcement. Notwithstanding the compensation provided for in the Bill, the enforcement of labour laws will be another issue. It is positive that the Bill provides that any determination by the Labour Court may also be enforced by the Circuit Court should an employer refuse to engage. However, it is a matter for workers who may be in a vulnerable position to come together, in the first instance, and take a case to the Labour Court to secure a recommendation that will be enforced. The Circuit Court is not available to such workers because they do not have funds to take a case. In County Donegal, an employment tribunal ruled in favour of workers in a case involving redundancy payments but the case was lost when the employer took the matter to the Circuit Court because the employees could not afford to be represented in the court.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	490	I strongly concur with Deputy Pringle's concluding remarks. While all Deputies will welcome the Bill up to a point, it is long overdue and pretty underwhelming in the context of the challenges that arise in this area. The Bill has been packaged as progress but it simply reinstates the position that obtained in 2007. That is not good enough on the part of the Labour Party, which claims the legacy of James Connolly. The background to the Bill is the Ryanair v. the Labour Court and IMPACT case, which encapsulated the voluntarist tradition of collective bargaining in place here. This case has had a chilling effect across industry in the intervening years, including the four years since the Government took office. During this period, the Labour Court has been used much less to rule on industrial relations disputes. The programme for Government included a promise to reform the current law on the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. While it is good that we have finally had sight of the Bill four years after the programme for Government was published, it is not exactly great for workers at Dunnes Stores who have been victims of some of the practices the legislation belatedly attempts to address. People are being victimised for their participation in trade disputes. For example, 20 workers at Dunnes Stores have been sacked and a brutal regime of intimidation is being directed daily at workers who remained in the company on the basis that they engaged in industrial action. Deputies will be familiar with last year's bitter dispute at the Greyhound company where workers were locked out of their employment in Dublin for 14 weeks. It is good that the Bill provides that employers will not be able to lock out workers who are covered by a registered employment agreement, REA. As previous speakers stated, however, it is not the case that a registered employment agreement is a panacea to the problems. While Deputies will welcome the decision to implement some of the measures provided for in the Bill, they are being introduced a little late. It is an insult that the Government was able to ram through the sale of Aer Lingus in one and a half days, without notice, yet it has dragged its heels for four and a half years on this legislation. As part of the debate on the sale of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus, Government speakers placed great stock on registered employment agreements, portraying them as a get out of jail for free card or guarantee against all eventualities. This is not the case because REAs only cover terms and conditions and will not protect Aer Lingus employees against outsourcing, job losses and so forth. Democratic trade unions that are willing to fight are the only way to provide such protection.  Ryanair, the company whose action gave rise to the legislation, still does not recognise trade unions. Its staff are placed on airport stand-by, which requires them to hang around an airport for eight hours in case another staff member does not show up. While at the airport, they are required to sell rail and bus tickets, for which they receive a sum of €30 which equates to a payment of approximately €3.75 per hour. They may work for 12 hours without a break, the company does not respect rest periods and sick pay requirements and wages are based on flight time, even though staff are subject to mandatory hanging around periods. Sales targets are linked to pay, which means staff on a flight to Manchester must start selling products on board, even as the aircraft is climbing, which is in contravention of safety regulations.  There is no doubt that the Government's failure to act quicker on this vital legislation has had a chilling effect during its years in office. In that four-year period, wages across the economy have declined by 2%. One could ask whether this was a deliberate policy. The Government, in ostensibly reforming the joint labour committee, JLC, system, effectively gutted it. The most vulnerable workers in sectors such as retail, accommodation and catering have not been protected.  Deputies have spoken about collective bargaining but does the Bill really amount to collective bargaining? While the legislation is welcome, the most glaring omission is the absence of a requirement on employers to recognise and engage with trade unions. The greatest fault in the legislation is that it maintains Ireland's voluntarist system of industrial relations which IBEC argues is vital. As such, the Government is dancing to IBEC's tune.  The definition of the term "collective bargaining" is weak and does not offer sufficient protection to workers. The Bill refers to voluntary engagement between employers and trade unions or accepted bodies. We do not know what constitutes "engagement" and I am certain lawyers in the Labour Court will exploit this vagueness to the detriment of workers. Neither the Labour Court recommendation nor international collective bargaining legislation contains the phrase "voluntary engagement". What does this term mean? A number of other issues also need to be addressed. Previous speakers made critical points about pensioners who are denied a pathway into the industrial relations machinery on the basis that they are not deemed to be employees, despite valid issues arising that relate to their previous employment and affect their material well-being. This issue needs to be addressed. While the Bill does something to improve the lot of workers, restoring the position that obtained in 2007 is inadequate and it needs to be drastically changed.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	491	Any measure that enhances the rights and conditions of workers is welcome. This Bill, we are told, will restore the system of registered employment agreements that was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in three sectors, namely, construction, forestry and meat processing. The Bill establishes a system for sectoral orders that can define pay and conditions in areas of the economy where an employer's refusal to recognise unions prevents voluntary registered employment agreements from being applied. I will focus primarily on addressing concerns that have been raised with me by trade union and worker activists, particularly in the construction industry, on the basis that the measures will not alter the position for many workers because of practices that have become more entrenched on the employer side in recent years. I refer specifically, as previous speakers have done, to bogus self-employment arrangements on building sites that have become rife. A person who enters a building site supposedly as a self-employed person as opposed to an employee will automatically lose the protections offered in the Bill. This matter will only be remedied if a serious approach is taken by Revenue, which is forgoing millions of euro by permitting this practice to flourish, all Departments involved in tendering out major construction projects, and the trade union movement, which has serious work on its hands if it is to re-organise in the construction sector. Take as a case study the JJ Rhatigan strike last year which spanned some six months. Workers organised by UNITE rightly opposed bogus self-employment practices on a Department of Education and Skills funded project which meant bricklayers working for the equivalent of €5 per hour. The very tendering processes for construction projects funded by the State should be enough to alert the Government that these practices are taking place when major construction companies tender on the basis of a price per block that can only be achieved at less than a registered employment agreement rate or even the minimum wage. I have an advertisement from CLS Recruitment which offers to locate workers for construction firms or their sub-contractors by means of what are, in effect, bogus self-employment arrangements. The advertisement refers to the advantages of using the company which include no PRSI to pay, no holiday pay, no pension to pay, no bank holidays to pay, no sick leave to pay, no redundancy payments to make, no disputes with employees or unfair dismissals actions, and the ability to hire and off-hire staff at one hour's notice throughout the country. Here one sees written down in graphic terms what many companies do not write down. There it is in evidence. The company is offering bogus self-employment for people and a charter for total exploitation that robs construction workers of decent pay and conditions and Revenue of significant PAYE contributions which then have to be made up elsewhere. Interestingly, one provision of the Lansdowne Road agreement which partially restores pay for public sector workers is that when certain work is being considered for outsourcing, the pay levels private firms offer will no longer be criteria that can be factored in. Can this principle not apply on State-funded construction contracts? Can the Government not insist on REA rates and direct employment practices when bids come in for school building projects and the like? The issue of who is representative of workers in a sector or workplace as provided for in the Bill is potentially problematic. The trade union movement operates in a hostile environment, particularly in the private sector. The jobs recovery touted by the Government and large sections of the media is built to a large degree on precarity. The reality of trade union organising is that significant resources have to go into some sectors and it can require painstaking work to build and then maintain a certain union density. The admirable efforts of Mandate in recruiting Dunnes workers over the years, for example, led to it achieving 60% density on the eve of the strike action. One has to deal with staff turnover and concerted anti-union campaigns by employers which under the terms of the Bill as drafted could result in unions being no longer regarded as substantially representative. Finally, I make a more general point on the model of industrial relations we have. The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill refers on a number of occasions to the objective of achieving a system of harmonious industrial relations. Such an objective denies the reality of the opposing interests of the boss or employer class on the one hand and, on the other, of working class people. The boss class is broadly speaking hostile to trade unions. Some are willing to go all the way to the Supreme Court so as not to have to deal with trade unions for a reason. The initiative for achieving and maintaining decent pay and conditions fundamentally lies with workers themselves organising to take from the boss what he or she wants to keep as profits for himself or herself and his or her shareholders. Active organisation in democratic, fighting trade unions is the best mechanism available to workers to protect their interests and to fight for improvements in their conditions. Therefore, I will oppose and seek to amend and improve various measures provided for in the legislation that serve to curb the ability of workers and the unions to take effective and timely action to defend pay and conditions in response, for example, to future rises in the cost of living.

It has been challenging for many people as vividly described by many Deputies in the House today. I appeal to people in the Chamber to support the legislation on the basis that within the context of the constitutional challenges, achieving the utopian aspirations of some was never going to happen with Fine Gael in government. That is the reality. Deputy Catherine Murphy described the conflict between the worker and the employer. It is in the Constitution, in fact. The relationship is that of master and servant. There is a lot of rooting out of the Constitution to address the imbalances that have been described, but there is no justification in my view not to take the Bill as a positive. The economy has been damaged significantly over the course of 2011 to 2015. It is in that context that we must welcome the Bill to give people an opportunity to start to engage with the shares of a recovery. That will require some method of engagement to ensure that there is a fair and equal distribution of the wealth from the economy. My criticism is that in the recent past we had a referendum which involved reducing the presidential age. What was the chance of ever looking at constitutionally progressing the imbalances in the relationship between the employer and employee, the master and the servant? It was a wasted opportunity as the Government made little or no effort with respect to the presidential age. That was born out of the Constitutional Convention. If there is to be a Constitutional Convention under a future Government, it is critical that the difficulties and hurdles to the utopian view of collective bargaining are first addressed in a referendum to decide what the balance of the relationship between an employee and an employer should be. I have no doubt that if there had not been a change of leadership within the Labour Party, we would not be speaking here today on collective bargaining. I am concerned, however, about the consequences of the delay. Where one has seen investment in the economy and jobs, a significant advantage has been given to enterprise with respect to competing and bottom-feeding at the bottom end of the economy. The result is that significant time has been created for some enterprises to circumvent the principles set out in the legislation. Where there is non-unionised employment, I have witnessed the construct of a staff representative council. How are we going to test how meaningful the substance of negotiations in an enterprise is where the non-unionised structure of a staff representative council could end up negotiating whether it is to be fig rolls or Mikado biscuits or the content of the Christmas hamper? How do we establish what is meaningful in the context of pay and conditions in non-unionised employment? A significant opportunity has been afforded. It is a huge concession that was given by the Labour Party to the economy and the masters in government, Fine Gael. I have no doubt that if the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, had not been appointed, we would not have this Bill in the House today. I have no doubt that Fine Gael has reluctantly given him what was Fianna Fáil legislation. Fianna Fáil legislation has been dusted down and copper-fastened by the Minister of State in relation to the three court challenges. The politics of this appears to be that a week ago, the Labour Party was hopped into selling Aer Lingus and needed a vivid demonstration for the backbenchers of Fine Gael of the justification for a registered employment agreement. That was the silver lining of the argument that justified the consensus on the sale of a State asset. If that is what it takes, the Minister of State must reflect on the people he is in government with. The Government sold the State share in Aer Lingus for €320 million. It was only last Thursday that the Taoiseach was describing the Opposition as hysterical with respect to the raising of issues around discounts of €1 billion for top companies which have, again, had an opportunity to bottom-feed.The Government has come out worse politically on this, but that does not detract from the Minister of State's own role in getting it to this juncture. We are all entitled in this House to have an opinion and to make an analysis, but this should not distract us from what is good about this legislation. I am convinced that if the leadership of the Labour Party had not changed the Minister of State would not be sitting here today, but that is the end of the Labour Party in government; it is over. That is the last commitment the party had in the programme for Government and it took it four and a half years to get to this juncture. It has resulted, in my view, in significant concessions. I refer to that virtuous blind eye by which the Labour Party has turned its back on things when it was needed most. This legislation was needed four years ago. That is the criticism I have. I refer to the consequences of the delay in accelerating critical legislation. When one looks at the composition, the structure and the procedures in the legislation, one can see that this is Fianna Fáil legislation which has been dusted down and copperfastened with respect to the role of the Attorney General and the three challenges to the constitutionality of the previous legislation, including Aer Lingus and the fast food industry. That is a pretty poor legacy after four and a half years, and the consequences for the workplace have been significant. It would be wrong to reject the legislation because of the politics of the situation. It would be short-sighted of people in this House not to accept it as a stepping stone towards normality and harmonious relationships in the workplace. We anticipate that there will be some recovery in the economy, which will be a real recovery. In those circumstances we need to see a formal mechanism by which workers, trade unions and staff representative councils - preferably unions - could have an opportunity for meaningful engagement. However, the vacuum created for four and a half years is an issue of legacy politics because much of the investment that has taken place has been on the basis of circumventing the legislation, hand-picking a staff representative council and a negotiating team and deciding the agenda. I want assurances from the Minister of State that there will be a real test with respect to non-unionised employments with regard to efforts to provide for a staff representative council. There has to be some element of testing the real gains that are made by non-unionised staff representative councils, as opposed to the proxy organisation of a union in unionised employment, where terms and conditions of employment are less than in the unionised employment. That is the test - whether the terms and conditions in, for example, a non-unionised hotel are less favourable than in a unionised hotel. What is the mechanism to ensure that a staff representative council is meaningful in terms of pay, conditions, pension provisions and health and safety regulations and that people are not acting in bad faith to superficially comply with the spirit of the legislation? I do not see that copperfastened in the legislation, but it would be wrong of people to ideologically kick the Government on this. The legislation is as good as it can be because the groundwork was done prior to this point. My only reservation is that it is four and a half years late. I am pretty confident it would not have happened if the Minister of State were not there, but these are the benefits of getting rid of the last leader of the Labour Party.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	495	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and to welcome the long-promised Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015. The proposals are broadly welcome, as the legislation strikes a balance between increased collective bargaining rights and anti-victimisation provisions for workers while maintaining the volunteer approach to collective bargaining supported by employers. As Deputy Keaveney said, the Bill might not have come before the House were it not for the courageous stand taken by the Dunnes Stores workers. Their stand certainly pushed the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government to bring forward this legislation and to prioritise it. I hope it will pass all Stages as quickly as possible. The new legislation aims to provide an improved framework for workers who seek to enhance their terms and conditions of employment where collective bargaining is not recognised by their employers, as well as to provide a replacement structure for the REA system.  In recent years I have noted that workers' rights have been seriously eroded, with some employers offering poor working conditions, low pay and low health and safety standards. It may be due to the recession or because people find it very difficult to get work and they are often very glad to take any kind of work. This seems to be the norm with some employers. I hope this Bill will deal with some of the issues in this area. Sometimes I wonder about the role of the unions nowadays in that they seem to accept too easily rogue employers and employers operating in the black economy who are not treating their workers to the correct standards. In my county we have a lot of seasonal workers who work as strawberry pickers, meat processing workers and forestry workers, as well as in seasonal farming and fishing work. What rights will these workers have under this Bill? As seasonal workers, many of them are on low wages, and if they were forced to go beyond bargaining with their employer - if they had to take it a step further into the legal arena - they would not be in a position to do so if they had to hire solicitors or go to court. Some employers are very good at looking after their seasonal workers, many of whom come from Poland and other countries. However, at the end of the seasonal period I have noted that people come to my office saying they are unable to get their P60 or P45 documents or their holiday pay or overtime pay from the employers. It is necessary to battle with some employers to ensure that the rights of their workers are respected and, more important, that the documents they require for claiming social welfare or holiday pay are provided. Because they are seasonal workers, many of them are not in a position to get social welfare payments, and they certainly are not in a position to get contributory benefits. They may be entitled to jobseeker's benefit eventually, after being put through the wringer by the local social welfare office. If they earn any kind of income from the seasonal work, more often than not they are ruled out for jobseeker's benefit. They are forced to appeal the decision, and it can take six or nine months before any entitlements are awarded. I refer to the situation of Dunnes Stores in Gorey, which was shocking. Dunnes Stores closed its store overnight. Workers were called in and told that the store was to close as and from that evening. There was no explanation offered and there was no discussion or dialogue as to when it might reopen. We accept that legal problems arose over an entrance door, but instead of reverting to the original entrance, the Dunnes Stores management decided to close the store without any explanation to its 70 or 80 workers, who have families and mortgages.They were left high and dry for the best part of a week before being told that the store would re-open. This is no way to treat workers and is certainly no way to treat regular customers who were locked out for the week. How will the Bill protect workers in similar situations in the future? The most galling of all was that many politicians in Wexford made contact with senior management in Dunnes Stores in Dublin by phone and e-mail and yet we were all ignored. It is the management's right to ignore politicians but at the same time, we were representing people and had been contacted by the workers. We did not even get the courtesy of an acknowledgement of our e-mails and phone calls asking when and whether the store would re-open. The same thing has happened with zero-hour contracts in Dunnes Stores; it is very difficult to get any explanation from the company as to why and how it operates them. We are talking about people who have worked in Dunnes Stores for many years. All they are looking for is the same contracts and conditions as are offered by Tesco, SuperValu and other supermarkets in order to give them a level of security in their hours and earnings. It is an issue that will continue for quite some time unless the Bill helps bring about dialogue between management and workers. We met the Dunnes Stores workers who are looking for decent hours and earnings, job security, fair pay and representation and the right to dignity at work. I do not think that is too much to ask in this day and age. I was a union representative for many years back in the 1970s and at that time, the unions fought to improve the conditions of workers. Collective bargaining was introduced, which was helpful. For some reason, companies now want to make huge amounts of money on the backs of workers, putting them on the lowest possible pay and hours while creaming off the profits. That should not be allowed to continue. I am sure that if legislation such as the Bill before us had been in place, it would have compelled Dunnes to go to the Labour Court or to the Labour Relations Commission. The legislation aims to address most of the deficits exposed by the 2007 Supreme Court ruling which, as we all know, involved Ryanair. It provides an avenue for workers, through their trade unions, to secure improvements in pay and conditions when an employer refuses to engage in collective bargaining. In these cases, the proposed legislation allows for the Labour Court to make a determination in a dispute which can then be enforced by way of a Circuit Court order. Perhaps the Minister of State would clarify who will foot the bill for the Circuit Court order. Many of the people I know who are working seasonally or for 16 or 17 hours a week in supermarkets will certainly not be in a financial position to go to the courts. Will there be some support in that area?  Will the Minister of State look seriously at the plight of the ESB retired workers? We all got letters in the last couple of days from the ESB Retired Staff Association. Its members want to be included and the letter states that: The right to engage meaningfully with an employer and the trustees of an associated pension scheme is the very essence of pensioner grievance. Pensioner representatives, as of right, should be affording meaningful equality of esteem by having formal input to any or all discussions or negotiations that may effect their pension entitlements - entitlements that flow from the collectively agreed industrial relations employment contract that bound us throughout our working careers and continues to collectively bind us in retirement.  What they are looking for is the right to engage, to be involved and to have their pensions protected. It is very important the Bill provides an opportunity for these people. They are looking to change the definition of "worker" to include former workers and to grant them access to the industrial relations machinery of the State. They further argue:The right of trade unions to represent their members in negotiations with employers on industrial relations issues is an inherent part of the industrial relations process in Ireland and therefore we, as pensioners, should be included in any negotiations for the future. I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of the demands sought by the retired workers and that he will ensure their rights are protected by way of amendment as the Bill makes its way through the House.
#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	496	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, which is a combination of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill. This Bill is a fulfilment of the programme for Government's commitment to reform the current law on employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining. Indeed, it is also a fulfilment of the statement of priorities agreed by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste last year. Despite the claims of Deputy Keaveney and others, this plan was in place as far back as the programme for Government. The aim of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2014 is to put in place a new mechanism for a revised framework for the setting of pay, pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector. It will also provide for the registration of employment agreements which are binding only on the parties to the agreement - the employer and the trade unions. The decision to prepare the legislation was made as a result of the 2013 judgment by the Supreme Court in the McGowan case which held that Part III of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 was invalid having regard to Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution. The effect of this was to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under that Act. The Bill forms part of a suite of employment legislation currently being enacted by the Government to counteract perceived weaknesses in the framework for employment legislation in Ireland at present. It is critical that this matter be addressed when one looks at the increases in industrial disputes from quarter one 2014 to quarter one 2015. In 2014 just two disputes were ongoing, involving 178 workers with 310 days lost. Just one year later this has increased to disputes involving 27,588 workers and 24,056 days lost. In light of these figures, I fully support the Government's position that this legislation be provided in the interest of legal clarity, harmonious industrial relations and establishing a more constitutionally robust regulatory framework. This will have a significant impact on employers and their employees in respect of rates of pay and tendering for contracts. It is vital that industrial peace be maintained, especially in the construction sector. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the Bord na Móna workers, many of whom live in my constituency, who are in the Labour Relations Court at present. I welcome the fact this Bill will provide a process of registering employment agreements on an individual enterprise basis and on a sectoral basis. It will also introduce reforms in the right to engage in collective bargaining and amend the procedure under which trade disputes are brought before the Labour Court in circumstances where collective bargaining is not practised. In fact, it is the first time that collective bargaining is defined in Irish law. Anti-victimisation measures are also an important part of the Bill, which I fully support. Last September, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash provided a copy of the general scheme of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2014 to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and requested that the committee undertake pre-legislative scrutiny, which the committee considered and agreed to the next day. Engagement with stakeholders is an important element of this process and so the committee sought submissions by way of notice on the Houses of the Oireachtas website. Submissions were received from IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU. The committee also held a series of stakeholder meetings, commencing with a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, and officials of the Department. Subsequent meetings were held with representatives of the following organisations: the Labour Relations Commission; the Construction Industry Federation; the Association of Electrical Contractors of Ireland; National Electrical Contractors Ireland; the Technical Electrical and Engineering Union; and the Construction Workers Alliance, with a view to scrutinising the provisions of the General Scheme. The final report was agreed by the committee on 16 December and forwarded to the Minister of State for his consideration.  Nine of the conclusions to which the committee came were contained in the report. I do not have time to go through them all but will refer to some of them.For example, conclusion 4 has had an impact on the Bill, which is to be welcomed. We highlighted the stakeholder concerns that parties would be bound to a revised REA to which they did not agree. I welcome the fact the Bill provides that a party may withdraw from an agreement where the Labour Court makes an order varying an agreement in the absence of agreement by both parties. I would also like to refer to conclusion 9, which refers to enforcement and compliance especially in regard to cross-border competition. Stakeholders highlighted the necessity for the existence of an enforcement body with appropriate authority and powers to ensure that no unfair competitive advantage could be gained by employers coming from other jurisdictions. The Minister of State might consider having conclusion 9 specifically addressed in the Bill as this is not provided for at present. He might also review some of the other conclusions which we put into the report. Before I conclude, I would like to welcome the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, which is chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitléir. I acknowledge his welcome appearance at the Oireachtas committee. I wish him and the other members well and I look forward to their first report, which is due next month. Although this might sound a little philosophical, I believe the relationship between the employer and the employees is symbiotic and every effort to enhance that relationship is most welcome. This legislation will go a long way towards achieving that.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	497	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill. I compliment the Minister on his work on it and on bringing it before the House. I would like to respond to Deputy Keaveney, who claimed that after four and a half years, the legacy of this Government was to bring this Bill to the House very late. I remind him that the legacy of this Government, of which both Fine Gael and the Labour Party are part, is economic stability, reducing unemployment and giving opportunity and hope to people, as well as providing security, which was lost under the last Government. I would also remind him that he joined Fianna Fáil, which was the party that sold us out, with the result that the troika had to be brought into this country. I am sure we would all like to move on from that point because the Irish people do not want to hear about it for too long more. Research has suggested that industrial conflict may be more rather than less likely when unions are weakened and unable to assist in ordering industrial relations systems. In particular, current economic and social policy in Ireland relies on unions being able to enforce agreements made with employers and the State. It is clear that the conduct of pay determination and industrial relations, especially in the public sector, is now a significant influence on a country’s credit rating and, hence, on the cost of borrowing and the resulting scale of public debt. It is very important we have a system whereby workers and employers can work through various issues that appear from time to time. From listening to the Opposition, I know there has been a lot of talk about employees, which is very important, but we must also recognise the role employers play in this country, given they are the people who take all the risk. The majority of employers are small businesses which must deal with a huge amount of legislation. I welcome the fact the Minister of State intends to simplify much of this legislation because there is a lot of it that must be muddled through. This is a huge issue, especially for the small employers who, as I said, employ most workers in this country. While I welcome this new legislation, there are some issues and concerns around it, in particular from the point of view of the unionising of organisations that may not want to be unionised. It is important that we keep ourselves competitive. Changing pay can have an effect on that, which can then have an effect on the economy and particularly on encouraging people to become employers and perhaps attract investment into this country. Nonetheless, I welcome the legislation. I want to quote an employer from my constituency who wrote to me as follows:How is it acceptable for one private organisation, a union, to be allowed to dictate to another private organisation how it conducts its affairs? This is effectively what this legislation will allow happen.I do not agree with all of that but this is a concern of an employer who employs a lot of people. He continues:The union is a private company who is in the business of securing members and all this legislation is going to do is allow unions agitate workers in private organisations, which will make the union look good and therefore increase their membership. In addition, there is surely a constitutional issue where you have legislation allowing and encouraging a private organisation to interfere in the running of another private organisation. It would not be tolerated in the everyday life of an individual and maybe should not be tolerated in a private company. It could be argued that this legislation is not required and if employees are unhappy with pay or conditions, they may move elsewhere.I accept that is probably a very right-wing view but, again, it is a concern of employers of which we must be mindful. I welcome the measures on collective bargaining, although I have some concerns. My biggest concern is what is to be considered "a significant number" of employees. I ask the Minister of State to consider inserting a figure in the Bill that would bring clarity in order to prevent future issues arising down the road. What everybody wants in regard to collective bargaining is that, where there is a genuine dispute, people have an opportunity to speak and workers and employers have an opportunity to represent themselves. Reference was made to seasonal employment, which is a complicated issue. Not every employer is a big employer and many, particularly in recent years, have been just trying to keep the payroll running and do what they can. Much of the time, they are doing that at a huge cost to themselves and to the people who are working for them. The majority of employers are decent, hard working people. They do their best and get up in the morning with the intention of looking after their employees and they take that very seriously. As always, our job as policy makers is to ensure that is done in a fair and safe way. It is important to do that while, at the same time, ensuring we are conscious that the majority of employers in this country are small employers who must deal with a lot of legislation in their everyday lives. I would welcome the opportunity to simplify that further but it is important that we also try to make it fair. In that context, I again ask the Minister of State to consider inserting a percentage figure for the number of employees who can take a case in regard to collective bargaining.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	498	I welcome the Minister of State. I know he has a considerable interest in this area and he has certainly put a lot of work into the Bill, for which I commend him. The Bill will reinstate the system of registering collective agreements and will provide for a new system of registering employment agreements in certain sectors. It also contains measures to put in place collective bargaining rights. As a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and as a Deputy for Galway West and Mayo South, I have engaged with businesses, particularly small to medium sized enterprises but also with larger companies, employers and workers. It is clear that a balance needs to be struck on the issue of registered agreements. Our recovery is strengthening, employment is increasing and State revenues are up, but the recovery is fragile and we cannot put in place inflexible arrangements that would endanger job retention and job creation. However, it is also clear from a number of high-profile cases that we need to ensure this legislation helps contribute towards a sense of security and certainty for workers - certainty in pay, in working hours and in working conditions. Making work pay is a key policy of Fine Gael and gainful employment in sustainable jobs is vital. Work should always pay more than welfare. I view this legislation in that light as part of the number of measures under way to encourage job creation that is sustainable and through which a person can support himself or herself and his or her family. Other measures include the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, the reform of the State's workplace relations organisations and the introduction of the back to work family dividend in the last budget, which was particularly welcome. This Bill is another example of a reform introduced by this Government which unfortunately has been often overlooked, namely, reform of the pre-legislative stage. This is very welcome because it provides for scrutiny and a process of engagement with interested parties, and it has really opened up the legislative process. Last autumn, at the Oireachtas committee, we engaged with stakeholders on this issue, specifically the general scheme of the Bill. I have been encouraged by the Government's motivation to provide clarity and harmonious industrial relations and to establish a more constitutionally robust regulatory framework. Following stakeholder hearings with a range of groups, including IBEC, ICTU, the Labour Relations Commission, the Construction Workers Alliance and others, our committee compiled a report and submitted this to Government. The Department then considered a number of the issues raised in the report. Some sections of the Bill stand out. Section 7 concerns registered employment agreements and instructs the Labour Court to register agreements only where there is all-party agreement and where the court is satisfied that a trade union is substantially representative of workers in an organisation.On the flip side, section 18, which concerns sectoral employment orders will extend advantageous benefits and conditions to workers in a sector, even if they or their employer are party to Labour Court proceedings.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	501	It is my pleasure today to conclude the Dáil legislative process for what is a significant and important Bill. This Bill will provide for a universal GP service to be made available to all persons over 70 years of age and builds on the first phase for those aged under six years. Under the Bill, access to a GP service will be provided to all persons over the age of 70 years on a universal basis, replacing the existing GP service arrangements for those aged over 70 which is based on a means test. Their dependants, including spouses or partners who are under the age of 70 years, will continue to have access to a GP service without fees where they meet the existing income limits. The decision to prioritise the over 70 cohort for the roll-out of the universal GP service had regard to the significant prevalence and comorbidity of chronic diseases in the population aged over 70. It is estimated that about 36,000 people over the age of 70 must currently pay to attend a GP because they are not covered by a medical card or a GP visit card. The annual cost of the system for those aged over 70 based on existing GMS GP costs is estimated at €18 million. It is important to be clear that nothing will change for any persons over 70 years of age who have or are eligible for medical cards. They will continue to receive all of their other medical card entitlements as normal. The Government remains committed to the introduction of a universal GP service for the entire population, in line with the programme for Government. We are in the process of re-orientating the health system to one that only treats sick people to one that keeps people well.  The Government is committed to completing the most radical reform of the system in the history of the State to develop a universal system that treats all according to their health needs and not their means. While we are making progress on universal access to GP care, we also recognise that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  Late last year, the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people's needs, especially where serious illness is involved. The medical card system is now operating in a more sensitive and sensible manner. Greater discretion is clearly being exercised by the HSE and the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased by about 56%, from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to more than 85,000 at the beginning of this month. When someone meets the crisis of a serious illness at any stage of life or a child develops a serious illness, one may be in a financial position to meet one's immediate needs or have those needs met by the hospital system. In general, that is what happens in Ireland and we all agree that the problem is access in terms of the health service. Once one is in the system and being treated, it is second to none, apart from the mishaps that often occur. We are not the worst in the world and most people, when they come out of the service, will say they have had a very good experience. The normal reaction of those who have been ill or their loved ones is that the service is good and responsive once one is in it.  We need to get away from the immediate instinct to go to accident and emergency in an acute hospital because that is where difficulties occur. People who are doing their very best to deliver a service often find themselves having to tell people that they should not be there in the first place. Access to a GP will ensure that we have a more defined delivery of care. It is about staying healthy, rather than concentrating on ill health. Universal access to a primary care system is not just about GPs; rather, it is about care as we age, for very young children or people with long-term chronic diseases. Primary care is about recognising that one does not always need to go immediately to accident and emergency. Our aim in health should be keeping people well, as well as right across the board, in terms of paediatrics, gerontology, mental health and physical well-being. I have said many times in the recent past that people did not have a great interest in mental health and that is why A Vision for Change garnered universal approval. I am not certain which one of us read it in any great detail in terms of how it would deliver a service but surely if we can agree on the principles of what we want from health, we can also agree a pathway to ensure it is delivered. This Bill will deliver universal GP care to the 36,000 persons aged over 70 who do not at this time have access to a medical card or a GP visit card. By the summer all 800,000 people aged over 70 and under six will be able to visit a GP without facing a financial barrier, which will be a significant step towards a universal GP service for the entire population. I commend the Bill to the House. I know the House will be interested to hear that as of now well over 50% of doctors have signed up to the new contract. I have no doubt that there will be issues, but what system is perfect? We are convinced that by the end of the summer we will have those aged over 70 and under six covered. The sign up for those aged under six and over 70 will begin on 1 July and 1 August, respectively. There is an issue of timing to ensure that the system can cope.

I agree with everything the Minister of State has just said but, unfortunately, the reality on the ground is so different from what she is working towards. We have a general practitioner system that is in a fundamental crisis and has been for some time. When one is not near an acute hospital, one uses one’s GP. I often remember the case 20 years ago of a visitor to Ballina asking where was the nearest acute general hospital. When I informed her it was an hour away in Castlebar, she nearly dropped. I then explained to her that we simply went to our GP. Now, however, we are struggling to get GPs in rural areas. Although it was once seen as a fantastic career, rural areas now cannot be guaranteed a GP service. Of course, in such instances, people will have to go to the hospital even if it is an hour and a half away. We have had instances of this in Bangor and Glenamoy recently. While there are more pharmacies, we need to embrace their services and use them more to keep people out of the acute hospitals. Unless we resource our GPs and refuse to accept that our best and our brightest GPs need to be in Canada or Australia to make money, and unless we actually make it a viable business once again, and not just as a supplier of primary health care, then I am afraid the Minister of State’s vision will not happen. We will lose younger GPs and those coming out of medical college will not sign up for the life of a GP unless we resource general practice and bring back the rural practice allowance as a guarantee. The HSE seems to have washed its hands of this, and the Department moves on a case-to-case basis. Someone whose child is diagnosed with an illness should not have to face the trauma of a delay, even if they are financially secure, but that is the reality. We have all dealt with cases in which there have been delays. The team dealing with medical cards at the primary care reimbursement service is working under huge pressure but is always helpful. The members are an example to other civil servants in their helpfulness and in the provision of information. I thank them for that. However, we should not have to be ringing them. There are still many over-70s falling between the cracks, particularly if they are diagnosed with conditions such as dementia or Alzheimer’s. I am dealing with one horrendous case in which the people in question have the resources to deal with it but they are facing ten years of treatment. They will not have the financial resources in the end unless they get support now. The system does not seem to be able to comprehend that many illnesses will not be cured in the short term but in the long term. People will have to make arrangements around that, but our system is struggling to cope with it. I certainly agree with the Minister of State’s vision and I have no doubt she is doing her best, but it is not happening. There are still vacancies for consultants because the contract is still not attractive enough to bring our own home, to give them the freedom to do academic research and the private practice they need to engage in. Why do we have so many vacancies on the consultancy front? The legacy of the contract introduced by the former Minister, Deputy James Reilly, is still there and still raw. We have to make this place one to come to. Today, we saw a massive increase in outpatient waiting lists in general hospitals across the country. Once people get in, they generally get a good service. It is getting harder to get in, however. While we continue to undermine our primary care service, unfortunately, the delays will get harder. Unless we give the National Treatment Purchase Fund the power to get into that space and shake it up, those waiting lists are going to increase. I apologise for the long sum-up, but the Minister of State gave me some thoughts. This Bill is an improvement, but the health system is under enormous pressure at the moment. Those working in it are fantastic, but we need more working in it, as well as more proper spending and resources.

I hope the outworking of the legislation and its provisions will prove beneficial to all to whom it is intended. It is important to recall that my support for this particular legislation, and indeed for the provision of free GP access for children under six, was in the context of the roll-out of universal access to free GP care. That was a position I took with the former Minister of State, Deputy Alex White. I know we were on the one page in that respect. I cannot emphasise enough how important it is that we programme that for the earliest possible timeframe. Otherwise, we will perpetuate yet another difference within the system - a two-tier situation, with the under-sixes and over-70s and everybody else. That simply is not acceptable. The delivery of universal entitlement must be by the shortest possible route. Listening to those voices from the GP representative organisations, the most common criticism levelled against the two Bills in this area, particularly the one regarding the under-sixes, is that children over six who are unwell will not be accommodated while the many well children under six will be provided for. That in itself must be a further incentive to move with the greatest possible speed to the roll-out of universal health care. From the overwhelming majority of GP commentators, I do not note any resistance to moving towards universal free GP care. On the contrary, there seems to be quite strong support for such a system. The earlier we can reach this, the better. If it were signalled at this point that greater speed was intended, it might even help by ensuring a greater take-up of the provision for the under-sixes and the over-70s in turn. The legislation also promises something I raised on Committee Stage - namely, doctor choice. I know we both have the same understanding on this. Regrettably, however, in great swathes of rural areas, as well as in considerable numbers of large urban areas, doctor choice is a significant problem. People will not have GP choice when there is a continuing depletion of GPs across the country. It is important to recognise that GPs feel poorly dealt with over recent years. They have taken a number of significant cuts in service provision and this has had an impact on their respective individual or shared practices. We have to resource primary care. That is the bottom line. We must resource primary care if we are to ensure that the cohort of general practitioners across the country has the capacity to cope to ensure people are not, through displacement, moving towards accident and emergency centres at our network of hospital sites. We want to encourage a system whereby the first point of contact with the health services is at GP level. That cannot be done if the necessary numbers of general practitioners and practices are not available.

I am very happy to have the opportunity to bring the Bill before the House this evening. It deals with an issue of major social importance, which is a political and economic problem also. The Bill deserves the support of all sides of the House which can play a part in righting a wrong. The Bill would empower the Central Bank to act in the public interest, taking into account economic considerations to set a cap on standard variable rates in the banks bailed out by the people. Recent research from the Central Bank, and the hundreds and thousands of people who contacted our offices in recent months and years, confirm a rip-off is taking place. It shows Irish standard variable rates are way above the EU average. The research shows the average outstanding standard variable rate in Ireland is 4.24% compared to an EU median mortgage rate of 2.8%. The interest rate for new mortgages in Ireland at 4.26% is the highest of all the countries analysed. In Britain, the effective rate is only 2.01% and the eurozone average is 2.1%. In Ireland, it is a staggering 3.42%. We do not have a functioning market and pretending we do serves no purpose. I note the Minister has left his options open on this question. He has insisted that, "The issue of a penal banking levy in the Budget or powers for the Central Banks to regulate interest rates will be considered at that time if sufficient progress is not made". These are fine sentiments but it is not like this issue has suddenly popped up out of nowhere. For years the Government has been told of this issue. Four years ago, when the Government still spoke of things like democratic revolutions, the then Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, told my colleague, Deputy Doherty, that he need be in no doubt that the Government would act decisively, forcefully and effectively with the banks. This sounds so ridiculous now, after four years of rule by the banks for the banks. I hope this evening the Government will finally abandon its policy of trusting the banks. Surely at this stage the penny has dropped that the banks are not looking after the people. They are failing society in many ways and need to be brought into line. Talking to the banks does not work. Appealing to their humanity and moral duty does not work. The Government's failure on mortgage arrears, on bankers' pay and on making the banks play ball on insolvency cases is well documented. Its approach is always the same and it always fails. It always put the banks first, and in return the banks pocket the gains and make new demands. This vicious circle of bank rule must end. The Bill is a measured and appropriate response. It is a major step to take. It is an extraordinary move for extraordinary times. We cannot go on pretending we have a functioning banking system. The market is failing the people and intervention is needed to restore a functioning and fair system. The Bill is short and is designed to lapse by December 2017. This will bring us to almost a decade after the banking crisis began. The criteria proposed on which the Central Bank would make its decision on whether to introduce a cap and at what rate to set this cap are set out in section 2. The range of criteria allows for a balanced view taking into account economic and social factors. The Central Bank would consider the current rate and any justification for this a bank might offer, the ECB rate, the profitability and viability of the bank concerned and, crucially, the impact of current rates on mortgage holders. Section 3 outlines how any direction on a mortgage cap would be in force for 12 months unless renewed. It would also allow a bank to seek the setting aside of the decision after six months if it could make a case for so doing. The nature of any cap imposed would be a maximum rate, allowing for a bank to decrease it further if it wishes. The Central Bank would give each bank affected a report outlining why it had chosen to act. Section 4 deals with the relationship between the Minister of the day and the Central Bank. The Central Bank would each year report on the use of this power to the Minister. Additionally, the Minister could seek interim reports on the use or failure to use this power. In this way we believe public concern could be brought to bear on the Central Bank through the Minister while respecting the independence of the Central Bank. Section 5 would allow the Minister to set down regulations on how these reviews would be carried out, including timeframes for submissions, decisions and implementation. Section 6 would make it an offence for persons not to comply with a direction made by the Central Bank under the Bill. We all know the Government's approach of threatening levies does not scare the banks. They know extra levies or charges can be passed on to the customer. Section 7 deals with the commencement date and includes a clause whereby the Bill would cease to have effect from 31 December 2017. There are always arguments for doing nothing or hoping things get better by themselves, but there are times when we have to accept that some problems are not going to sort themselves out and that action is justified if taken in a considered and proportionate way. I note the concerns expressed by the Central Bank that it does not want these powers. At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, raised a couple of objections to the principles behind the Bill. It is worth nothing his comments in a full way. He said among other things that "none of the banks has so far provided what I would regard as a clear and quantified statement of their policy with respect to adjustments of the standard variable interest rate " and "Nonetheless, I would welcome a reduction in bank standard variable rates in current circumstances as a benefit to the economy at large". The concerns he expressed are valid for a man in his position, but I believe the approach taken in the Bill negates much of the logic behind his objections. For example, he says that in the medium term such a move could have a negative chill effect on new competitors weighing up the option of entering the market.I understand that logic, but by limiting this Bill in its timeframe and limiting it to the covered institutions I believe many of those concerns have been addressed. Fundamentally, doing nothing has failed and is no longer an option. This Bill is not diving in head first - it is simply dipping a toe in the water. I understand too that some will be unsure about why the Bill is limited to the covered institutions. These are the banks which the people bailed out. They are at least part-owned by the people as a result. The mandate that gives to the Government to act on the people's behalf is significant. It is understood, too, that between them these three banks account for at least 80% of the mortgage market. At its most basic, my argument is that it is time the banks started playing a role in the economic and social regeneration of this country. God knows they have taken enough. Separately, we have put on record our belief that the Financial Services Ombudsman has taken far too conservative an approach to the powers available to him and that there is more scope for that body to be fighting for mortgage holders who find themselves paying over the odds on their mortgage rates. I urge all parties to support this Bill. It is an issue of direct relevance to hundreds of thousands of families across this State. We are now at a point at which, after many, many years of brutal, counterproductive and ultimately failed austerity, we have a State with a massive interest in the banking sector. We have a market failure, meaning that the cost of standard variable mortgages to most families is out of sync with the rest of Europe and with normal market laws. When we look coldly and objectively at two facts, it is inconceivable that the State would not move to use its influence at those banks it owns to make it possible to bring rates down. It makes sense at this point of our economic development to act in the people's interest, finally. There is no reason to delay, no reason to give more time and no reason to be satisfied with some banks' indication that they will reduce rates by the bare minimum. I am calling on the Government and all other parties to support this Bill and to move swiftly to implement it. The hundreds of thousands of customers at banks owned by the people and bailed out by the people deserve no less. The rip-off must end.

Tá sé ag titim ó ghéarchéim go géarchéim. An fáth go bhfuil sé faoi bhrú ná nach bhfuil sé ag tabhairt airde ar chor ar bith ar mhuintir na tíre. Tá teip uafásach déanta mar gheall ar fhiachas na ndaoine agus fiachas gnóthaí thar timpeall na tíre. Tá sé sin i gcodarsnacht mhór leis an tslí ina bhfuil an Rialtas ag plé le IBRC agus le comhlachtaí móra saibhre freisin. When I first came into this Chamber, I said that if the Government continued on the path on which it had started, it would be the author of a lost decade, and that is what we seem to have. We are eight years into a disaster affecting tens of thousands of families. A home is very important. If a family does not have its own home that is warm, comfortable and safe, very little else will work for it. Education, health and mental health are determined according to one's ability to be in a safe, warm home. The fact that the Government has not made this a priority is a disgrace.  On my books at the moment are approximately 150 families in mortgage distress. One individual from County Meath had bought a house in Foxford to which he was going to move, but the collapse happened and the bank forcibly sold the house after just four months and €2,000 of arrears. On the basis of that, he was left with a debt of €80,000. I know a woman who has just gone through a separation. She has three kids and has an extreme bout of cancer at the moment, and she is also likely to lose her home. I know of a family which has just lost its home. They applied for emergency accommodation and were told they would have to wait seven weeks just to get onto the emergency accommodation process and then, maybe, get into a hotel room or a bed and breakfast. When they ask what they are to do they are told, "Find somewhere to live." They are not alone. There are hundreds of people going through this level of damage in my county on a daily basis and tens of thousands throughout the State. The worry I have is that the Government sees these individuals in a completely different light from the large benefactors of their political parties, against whom we hear allegations in this Chamber day in, day out but who have received debt and capital write-downs. None of these things seems to happen for the average punter. In the case of IBRC, we know of 18,000 mortgage holders whose loans were sold to vulture funds with no talk of a write-down of capital or a reduction in the interest rate. These people are not even entitled to full regulation under the law, which is incredible. Businesses are also suffering debt distress and there is not a business organisation in the country which does not deal, day in, day out, with debt distress and the legacy debt which exists within companies. Many businesses, having made it through the disaster of this Government, are now faced with a situation in which they have a millstone of debt in their business and the likelihood of their growing, employing people or adding to the economy in any way is held back because of the austere nature of the Government and the banks. If we were to reduce interest rates for mortgage holders, it would have a significant effect on the number of people in mortgage distress. Straight away we would bring down the number of people in mortgage distress and make mortgages achievable for families. The question is one of intent and whether the Government has the desire to do that. It is plain that Fine Gael does not have that desire, but there would have been an expectation that the Labour Party would have this as an objective, particularly through its housing sector policies. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in the week in which an investigation is being held into low interest rates for large business people, to support the right of Irish citizens to an affordable interest rate as put forward in our Bill.

Back in February of this year, it took Donegal's county registrar two hours and 29 minutes just to do a call-over of the motions list at Letterkenny courthouse - two hours and 29 minutes. That day, there were some 271 people facing repossession in just one court sitting in a Donegal court. The people affected by this crisis are ordinary people. They are constituents whom the Minister and I deal with every week. As my colleagues have alluded to already, a total of 351 homes have been repossessed or surrendered in this State during the first quarter of 2015 alone. These are ordinary people, kicked from their homes directly into hostels or other emergency accommodation and a homeless system that is not fit for purpose. What is happening to the mortgage holders of this State is scandalous.We have a situation in which banks, which came crawling with outstretched hands when they needed bailing out, are now failing the very people who were forced to do that bailing. The lack of gratitude is sickening. What is even more sickening is the Government's lack of initiative and its reluctance to embrace the change that is needed to solve this crisis for fear of upsetting the status quo as laid down by the banks. In March of this year, the Minister for Finance had the gall to say that figures published by The Irish Times on home repossessions were a reflection of banks using the courts to force homeowners to engage with them rather actually repossessing houses. What sort of system is that for the Government and Central Bank to stand over? These are homeowners who have found themselves in dire straits. They deserve help, not intimidation. However, what we see is the banks ruling and the Government doing their bidding. Sinn Féin is providing a real, credible solution. It is a solution that provides the control that is needed to stop the continuous downward spiral. This is a solution that can have an immediate effect on lives filled with worry and fear - those people who face sleepless nights wondering whether a letter taking the roof from over their heads will be slipped through the letter box in the morning. For the first time, here is a Bill to provide for a legal process whereby the regulator can set a cap on the standard variable rate that the covered institutions can charge. The Minister for Finance would be able to prod the regulator to undertake a review, which could lead to a rate being set. He could ask for reports on the use of these powers and make regulations on how they can be used. It is a solution that gives the Minister and the Central Bank the real power to deal with this crisis. It is also a Bill designed for where we are today. Any cap to rates will lapse after 12 months unless the regulator renews it. After six months, a bank can make an appeal, which the regulator must consider. The legislation as a whole is designed to lapse at the end of 2017. This Bill is an extraordinary measure for extraordinary times. As my colleagues have all said, we cannot go on pretending we live in a normal banking environment. The banking sector is still a major drain on the economy. The banks must start playing their part in creating a fair recovery and the Government must, if needs be, have the power to make sure they do this. We cannot wait, as has been suggested by the Government, until the budget to deal with this crisis. The banks are ripping off mortgage holders, and inaction is not an option. I urge the Minister to reconsider his position and to have the decency to help those mortgage holders who are in trouble by making the banks fulfil their moral obligation to give something back. I am mindful that all those ordinary people, the hundreds who have gone before the courts in deep distress, are observing the situation with IBRC and Siteserv and the deals that are done for the wealthiest people in this State. They must be asking themselves, "What in God's name is happening? Have we learned the lessons of the crisis that brought this State to its knees?".

We know that the rates currently applied by some banks in Ireland are among the highest across Europe. All the while, the Irish public has had to cough up further taxes and charges, including double taxation of water. At the same time, the Government has reduced supports and services across the board. Despite this reality for citizens, with financial worry leading to ill health and in some cases to tragic consequences, this Government has failed to exert any influence of substance on the banks. Those who say this Bill would give too much power to the Minister and the Central Bank must remember that the measures are limited by time. The legislation as a whole is designed to lapse at the end of 2017. Banks can also apply for a review after six months. This would cover eventualities in which the cost of borrowing by the bank increases. We recognise that the adoption of this Bill would require a change of direction for the current Government, but anything that switches the balance of for-profit finance back in the direction of the populace at large is a positive measure. There are also measures in place that would ensure this could only be applied where the Central Bank has examined several factors, including the profit level and size of the bank, along with its interest rates and ECB interest rates. For the first time, this Bill would introduce a legal process whereby the regulator would have the power to set a cap on the standard variable rate that the covered institutions can charge. The Minister for Finance would be able to ask the regulator to undertake a review which could lead to a rate being set. The regulator would decide whether a cap was to be set after an analysis of the bank. Why is it specifically AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB? They hold the vast majority of mortgage accounts that are in arrears. Also, these banks would not exist today if the Irish people had not bailed them out. These three banks are partly or fully State-owned. The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, has himself stated that he feels a cut in the standard variable rate would benefit the economy at large. The current Government has been too beholden to financial institutes and gambling individuals, often forgetting the very real and tangible social effects of its decisions. This was evident in its continuation of Fianna Fáil cutbacks, and it is evident once again in its failure to lead a fair recovery. We need to ensure that mortgage holders are given a fair chance of repaying their borrowings at a reasonable rate. We need to address the current situation in which a lack of competition has had the effect of maintaining artificially inflated rates. Those with distressed mortgages, estimated at 100,000 people, have been left high and dry by this Government. It is now time to act, and this Bill provides the means. While the Government may have talked the talk about asking the banks to pass on the ECB interest rate cut to struggling mortgage holders, it has failed to achieve much. When push came to shove, it did nothing. What have the public interest directors on their boards done? They have done little, if anything. I ask the Minister of State to outline how she sees such directors optimally taking a part in such issues. Deir an Rialtas gur thriail sé labhairt leis na bainc ach nár tugadh cluas éisteachta dó. Tá tráth na cainte leis an dream sin a chruthaigh pian agus peannaid d'iliomad daoine timpeall na tíre thart. Rialtas maith é Rialtas a thabharfadh ceannaireacht agus a chinnteodh athshlánú cothrom don tír. The days of talking to the banking institutions, which through their greed have caused suffering the length and breadth of this country, are over. We need to see a clear affirmation of who is actually in charge - those elected by the people of this State, or the bankers who have only profit as a goal. Fine Gael and the Labour Party will tell us that by supporting or not supporting this Bill, as the case may be.

Chaithfeadh siad an t-airgead sa gheilleagar áitiúil, áit nach bhfuil sé faoi láthair toisc go bhfuil siad i gcruachás agus toisc go bhfuil na bainc á robáil. Is é sin an príomhrud gur chóir dúinn déileáil leis amach anseo. Ba chóir go mbeadh an fhadhb réitithe ag an Rialtas seo cheana ach tá teip iomlán air mar tá teip iomlán air. Tá gnáthphobal na tíre seo, nó go leor acu, sásta an morgáiste agus na hiasachtaí atá acu a íoc agus tá siad tar éis iad a íoc in ainneoin nach raibh siad in ann bia a chur ar an mbord nó íoc as scolaíocht agus go raibh cruachás eile ina saolta. Bhí siad chun é seo a dhéanamh toisc go raibh siad ag iarraidh déanamh cinnte de go raibh dídean acu agus ag a bpáistí agus gur chonaic siad nach raibh an dara rogha acu toisc nach raibh an Rialtas seo, ná an Rialtas roimhe, sásta infheistíocht cheart a dhéanamh ar thithíocht shóisialta. Chomh maith leis sin, feiceann siad go bhfuil cíosanna ag ardú sna tithe timpeall orthu le dhá bhliain anuas. Tá cruachás ann agus tá roinnt den locht ar an Rialtas seo. Ní gá dúinn ach smaoineamh siar ar ráiteas an Teachta Gilmore nuair a bhí sé ina cheannaire ar Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre agus ina Thánaiste. Dúirt seisean leis an Teachta Pearse Doherty, a chur an Bhille seo le chéile, "Deputy Doherty need be in no doubt that this Government will act decisively, forcefully and effectively with the banks". Ní dhearna an Rialtas é sin sa bhliain sin, 2011, agus ní dhearna sé é ó shin. Níl sé sásta fós é sin a dhéanamh. Mar sin, táim ag impí ar an Aire ní hamháin tacú leis an mBille seo ach déanamh cinnte freisin go ndéanfar gníomh de réir briathar an Teachta Gilmore. Is linne na bainc seo. Ní chóir go mbeadh fadhb ann ach is é an fhadhb ná nach bhfuil an Rialtas sásta seasamh in éadan na mbanc agus go bhfuil sé sásta ualach breise a chur orthu siúd atá morgáistí acu sna bainc Stáit seo. Ní hamháin gur íoc muid as na bainc seo trí airgead an Stáit ar fad a chur isteach i ráthaíocht do na banc agus iarracht a dhéanamh tarrtháil a dhéanamh orthu, ach anois tá an Rialtas ag iarraidh orthu siúd atá morgáiste acu íoc sa bhreis ar an ngnáthráta úis agus tá orthu siúd atá ag déanamh gnáthbhaincéireacht leis na bainc sin táillí a íoc nach raibh orthu a íoc roimhe sin. In 2009, sular glacadh EBS faoi sheilbh an Stáit tríd é a chur isteach in AIB, ní raibh aon táillí ar an ngnáthdhuine a raibh cuntas aige nó aici. Anois tá orthu táillí a íoc agus tá orthu ús breise a íoc má tá morgáiste acu cé go bhfuilimid tar éis é a íoc cheana féin. Tá an Rialtas ag cur an ualaigh ar fad ar ghnáthphobal na tíre in áit é a chur orthu siúd a mba chóir go mbeadh sé orthu. Is é sin le rá, na sealbhóirí bannaí sóisearacha agus fiú, mar a dúirt Páirtí an Lucht Oibre roimhe sin, na sealbhóirí bannaí sinsearacha, ach ní raibh siad sásta glacadh leis sin. Rinne an Rialtas praiseach de. Mar sin, táimid ag iarraidh orthu ar a laghad glacadh leis an reachtaíocht seo chun déanamh cinnte de go mbeidh airgead breise i bpócaí na ndaoine atá morgáistí acu amach anseo. Ní leor a rá, mar a dúirt an tAire, an Teachta Noonan, gur féidir linn fanacht cúpla mí agus go ndéileáilfimid leis ag am an bhuiséid. Sin cúig mhí breise ag íoc 2% níos mó ná mar a chóir go mbeadh daoine ag íoc do go leor daoine sa Stát. Is am thar an gnách atá i gceist againn anseo. Ghlac an Rialtas seo agus an Rialtas roimhe cheana gur am thar an gnách é agus thóg sé isteach reachtaíocht éigeandála a ghoid tuarastal daoine, a laghdaigh na huaireanta a bhí acu, agus a ghearr na seirbhísí a bhí ar fáil do ghnáthcháiníocóirí an Stáit. Chuir sé breis cánach ar ghnáthphobal na tíre ach ní raibh sé sásta bogadh i gcoinne na mbanc seo chun déanamh cinnte go raibh airgead i bpócaí an ghnáthdhuine agus airgead á chaitheamh i ngnáthgheilleagar ceantar aitiúla. Sin an méid atá á lorg againn anseo: go nglacfar leis go bhfuil éigeandáil i gceist, nach bhfuil na bainc ag déileáil le gnáthphobal na tíre go cothrom, gur chóir go mbeadh an Stát ag déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil sé sin brúite orthu ar feadh 12 mhí ar a laghad agus go mbeadh orainn teacht ar ais go dtí an Teach seo i gceann bliana chun a rá ar chóir dúinn leanúint leis seo toisc nach bhfuil de bhéasa ag na bainc déileáil leis an bpobal mar ba chóir. Is sort léiriú é gur ghá dúinn é seo a dhéanamh ar fhadhbanna an chaipitleachas ina iomlán. Tá fadhb ann nuair nach féidir leis an Stát déileáil leis an margadh nó a ladar a chur isteach sa mhargadh, nó nuair a chreideann daoine, ar an taobh sin den Teach ach go háirithe, nár chóir dó é sin a dhéanamh. Measaim féin gur chóir don Stát seasamh isteach i gcónaí agus tacú le gnáthphobal na tíre i gcoinne na bainc nó na buic mhóra sa tír seo. Sin í an difríocht idir mise agus iad siúd ar an taobh eile den Teach. Níl sé sin déanta ag an Rialtas seo go dtí seo agus tá fíorbheagán ama fágtha aige. Táim ag impí air inniu an chéad chéim a thógáil maidir leis na bainc agus déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an Stát ag seasamh le gnáthphobal na tíre agus nach bhfuil sé ag seasamh leis na buic mhóra agus déanamh cinnte freisin go bhfuil airgead breise ag gnáthphobal na tíre. Caithfidh siad sa tír seo é. Ní bheidh siad ag dul thar lear. Ní bheidh siad ar nós na buic mhóra sa tír seo. Ní chuirfidh siad an t-airgead sin isteach i dtithe thar lear. Caithfear é ar ghnáthtithe agus i ngnáthshiopaí sa tír seo agus beidh buntáiste ansin do ghnáthgheilleagair na tíre agus don tsochaí ar fad, seachas an gnáthchéim atá tógtha ag an Stát go dtí seo, is é sin le rá, neamhaird a thabhairt do gheilleagair áitiúla.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	514	I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Finance, who unfortunately cannot be here. On his behalf, I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty for proposing this Bill on an important issue. The Minister for Finance appreciates the concerns the Deputy has attempted to address in this Bill. The Government considers this to be a very serious issue, which is why the Minister asked the Central Bank to examine this issue and met the six main mortgage banks to discuss the banks' plans to reduce mortgage payments. The Minister has made it clear that the issue of a penal banking levy in the budget or powers for the Central Bank to regulate interest rates will be considered at a later stage if sufficient progress is not made. This Bill requires the Central Bank to consider whether it is necessary to review the interest rates charged on mortgages and gives it the power to issue a direction to a covered institution to vary its mortgage interest rate. It also gives the Central Bank power to set a maximum interest rate ceiling. The Bill puts forward some of the considerations that the Central Bank must take into account in this review. The Government is opposing this Bill, and I will outline the reasons it cannot be accepted.There may also be legal issues regarding definitions in the Bill, but I do not propose spending significant time on them, since the Bill is being opposed. The specific reference to interest rates that reflect market conditions could result in the exclusion of mortgages that use different wording to describe how and when rates change. The Bill appears to propose two separate but overlapping powers for the Central Bank: to direct a variation in the level of interest under section 2(1) and to set a maximum rate of interest that may be charged under section 3(1). It is not clear why these are presented as separate powers or whether they are designed to apply in different circumstances. It is worth drawing specific attention to the possibility that there could be issues of encroachment on the independence of the Central Bank. This would have to be considered, particularly in a European context. A major flaw in the Bill is that it restricts the power that it would give to the Central Bank to covered institutions only. Therefore, a significant number of borrowers' situations would not be addressed. It is a tenet of public policy that all borrowers should be treated equitably. Deputy Pearse Doherty has attempted to avoid making a negative impact on competition in the mortgage sector by only allowing the Central Bank to issue directions in respect of the covered institutions that have benefitted from State support. However, by focusing solely on covered banks and standard variable rates, SVRs, it is not clear that the Bill would achieve the objective of reducing payments and it would not benefit customers in other banks or those on other products. New entrants or existing suppliers who are not covered would not be impacted. There is no question but that the Minister shares the Deputy's concerns about the high SVR currently being charged by mortgage lenders. As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister met the senior management of Ireland's six main mortgage providers in May and strongly delivered the message that changes were expected. The meetings focused on the mortgage market and the comparatively high SVRs being charged. The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, which is in only a few weeks' time, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for mortgage customers. There is no one-size-fits-all offer and, in a competitive market, different banks will offer different products. Some of the potential products discussed include lower SVRs for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates that take account of loan to value, LTV, ratios for new and existing customers. The need for greater competition in the market and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates were also discussed. Assurances were sought and received that home owners in negative equity would be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly payments. Progress will be reviewed during the coming weeks and a follow-up set of meetings with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the budget. The issue of a penal bank levy in the budget or powers for the Central Bank to regulate interest rates will be considered at that time if sufficient progress has not been made. Bank of Ireland has announced cuts of up to 0.3% in its fixed mortgage interest rates available to new and existing customers. AIB has announced cuts of 0.25% for AIB SVR customers and 0.38% for EBS and Haven SVR customers. AIB also announced reductions in LTV and fixed-rate mortgages across AIB, EBS and Haven. These rate reductions will apply to new and existing customers. It would not be appropriate to accept this legislation in advance of the date agreed with the banks by which they must have simple options in place to reduce the monthly mortgage payments of the hard-pressed households on SVRs. Senator Quinn initiated a Bill last month in this regard and Deputy Michael McGrath initiated a further Bill this week. The Government is committed to helping to address the particular problems faced by those individuals who bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008. In this regard, in budget 2012 the Minister fulfilled the commitment in the programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30% for first-time buyers who took out their first mortgages in that period. This was the period during which house prices peaked. The 30% rate will continue to be applicable to those first-time buyers for the remaining years that mortgage interest relief continues to be available. In the absence of this change, the available mortgage interest relief would have gradually reduced to a rate of 15%. The Government is firm in its belief that competition is the best way to achieve a sustainable long-term solution. The ESRI research note published today supports this view. It reads: "Overall, these results suggest that the most effective way for the continuing wedge between the different mortgage variable interest rates to be remedied is for a more efficient resolution of the mortgage arrears issue and greater competition within the domestic banking sector." What has the Government done to foster competition? It introduced changes to section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 via the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013. This section regulates fees and charges and the changes mean that it does not apply for the first three years of operation of new entrants to the Irish banking sector. There is some evidence of improvements in the banking sector, with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business models. In the past 12 months, there have been a number of new entrants to the mortgage market, bringing additional and welcome competition to the sector. Some new branches and hubs are opening in certain parts of the country, reflecting progress. Competition is essential and banks will only respond in terms of pricing if they believe that they will lose customers otherwise. Professor Honohan, who has been much quoted tonight, stated that there might be 15,000 people who, if they had the time to do the sums, would save four-figure sums in one year by switching to a lower priced mortgage provider. The ongoing mortgage arrears situation has had an impact on the SVRs charged by the banks. The Government is committed to helping people in arrears to reach sustainable solutions, and engagement between lenders and mortgage holders resulted in almost 115,000 solutions being found by the end of December. On 13 May, the Government announced a number of further measures to support mortgage holders who were in arrears. Building on actions previously taken, these measures aim to increase the supports available to people in arrears and the number of people availing of them. This package will reform the personal insolvency framework to give courts the power to review and, where appropriate, approve insolvency deals that have been rejected by creditors. The mortgage-to-rent scheme will also be expanded and made more accessible. It was also agreed that the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, would play a greater role in offering information, advice and assistance to borrowers in arrears. In advance of the meetings that the Minister held with the main mortgage providers, the Central Bank, at his request, prepared a report on the influences on SVR pricing in Ireland. This report was submitted to the Department of Finance last month and has been published on its and the Central Bank's websites. The report provides a valuable insight into the mortgage market and I urge Deputies to read it carefully. It showed that 52%, or €60 billion, of credit advanced to Irish resident householders for home purchases was on a tracker rate, with a further 7%, or €8 billion, fixed and the remaining 41%, or €47 billion, on SVRs.The report acknowledges that the spread between official ECB rates and the standard variable rate is relatively high, and lending rates are above average compared to European peers. However, it made clear that the high pricing of loans reflected three factors: credit risk, competition and bank profitability. The report went on to say that credit risk is influenced by the high level of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process of collateral recovery. Competition is weak. This is not unrelated to the credit risk, as new entrants may be deterred from entering the Irish market. Finally, bank profitability is constrained by legacy issues, but profitability is needed to build capital buffers and meet increasing regulatory requirements. The report did note that the reduction in ECB policy rates has not been passed through fully to the funding costs of Irish banks. In addition, non-tracker mortgage lending rates have been slower to respond to a lowering of the policy rate than to increases. Furthermore, the Central Bank thought it was likely that the rates in effect for most banks at the end of April 2015 were higher than would be necessary in the long run for a bank unburdened by a poorly performing mortgage back book. The Central Bank has highlighted that the mortgage business as a whole is not profitable for Irish banks. This reflects the high level of non-performing loans and tracker mortgages on their books. The Central Bank suggested that the ability of the banks to partially compensate for the burden of trackers by retaining higher spreads on variable rates is likely to be transitory, as such spreads will in time encourage entry into the market. This report by the Central Bank sharply cautioned that any policy steps to interfere with the rates being charged risk creating damaging side-effects. Further research from the Central Bank can be expected over the coming months. Another reason for opposing this Bill is that action such as that suggested in this Bill would be premature at this stage, given that there have already been moves in this area by AIB and Bank of Ireland to reduce rates. I have no intention of cheerleading for these. Obviously, we are waiting for moves from the other banks, but we have seen some progress already. There is no reason not to expect further developments in the near future. As I have said, the Minister is opposing this Bill because it is not the right time to act. He has set down clear deadlines with the banks. We are currently in the interim period, when such action is due to take place and has already taken place in the case of a number of providers. Furthermore, the Minister is opposing this Bill because he is taking account of the views of the Central Bank on whether it wants the power to regulate interest rates. In relation to the regulation of the standard variable rate, in his introductory statement to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 28 May last, the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, re-emphasised his opposition to administrative control of interest rates. While he acknowledged that he would welcome a reduction in banks' SVR rates in current circumstances as a benefit to the economy at large, he said it remained his firm belief that the introduction of administrative controls on interest rates in Ireland would be bad for the country as a whole in the medium term, notably because of its "stultifying effect on bank efficiency and ... chilling effect on the entry of other banks". The Governor acknowledged that "since the crisis, banks' standard variable rates have moved higher than previously, relative to their cost of funds". He continued:It is essential for the survival of banks that they achieve a sufficient return on the investment of funds, including equity, much of which, in our case, is owned by the Government. If not, they will not be able to achieve and maintain the growing requirement for capital adequacy in the years ahead. The profitability goal has to take account of long-term considerations, including the risks involved in lending, especially the actual and prospective losses on non-performing mortgage loans. While the Governor signalled that he would "welcome a reduction in bank standard variable rates in current circumstances as a benefit to the economy at large," he said was opposed to this being brought about by "administrative control" and instead thought that competition would be the crucial determinant. The Minister has also highlighted the importance of competition in exerting downward pressure on interest rates, although it is acknowledged that this competition must be tempered by prudence. The Governor pointed out that in the current conditions, "the standard variable rate borrower’s main protection is competition: the fact that, by setting its standard variable rate too high, any bank stands to lose business, whether new business or switchers, to competitors". He acknowledged that the effectiveness of this strategy was currently hampered by the low level of competition in the Irish banking sector, while suggesting that this fact further strengthens arguments against administrative control of interest rates. He made it clear that ensuring "official policy does not inadvertently deter competition and entry of banks to the market is thus vital for the long-term health not only of banks, but of the economy". He warned that if Ireland were to be the country that controls interest rates, this would have a signalling value far in excess of what one might think in terms of causing a retreat of service providers. The Governor firmly cautioned "against the enacting of legislation that would provide for officially administered lending rates". I have yet to see convincing evidence to justify going against this advice. He explicitly stated:Nothing could be more likely to curtail and discourage entry of new competitors into Irish banking, and without the possibility of such entry, I cannot see that banking can recover the operational efficiency and competitive pricing that is essential for Ireland in the long run. For the sake of modestly lower SVRs for a few quarters, a much larger and quasi-permanent, albeit somewhat invisible loss, would be incurred by the customers of the banking system in Ireland. Well-capitalised banks operating more competitively will, in the end, offer lower rates and better service. [In addition] close administrative control of interest rates would not be easily compatible with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, which has underpinned the considerable increase in national prosperity over the past half century in Ireland, and which, of course, is enshrined in the European Union treaty. [The issue of administrative control] is not a matter to be taken lightly or [quickly] for what would clearly be at best a transitory advantage.As Deputies are aware, banks must operate on a profitable basis if they are to provide the services necessary to the economy. Furthermore, this is necessary for banks to comply with international regulations surrounding capital requirements, to be fully financially autonomous and not dependent on the State, to have the resilience to deal with future shocks and to serve customers adequately. The Minister has made it clear to the banks that the possible introduction of a penal banking levy in the budget or the possibility of giving the Central Bank the power to regulate interest rates will be considered at a later stage if sufficient progress is not made. The Central Bank does not want the power to regulate interest rates. In fact, it believes this power would be detrimental to the economy and the country at large. I think we should take the advice of Professor Honohan, who has served this country well. The Central Bank set out its position in relation to policy measures to administratively determine interest rates in a report it submitted to the Department of Finance on 11 May last. As I said earlier, this report, which has been published on the websites of both organisations, maintains that policy measures to administratively determine interest rates would be likely to have damaging side-effects. By discouraging entry, innovation and competition, such measures could result in higher lending margins and higher Exchequer costs over the longer term. As recently as 28 May last, when he addressed the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, the Governor of the Central Bank expressed his firm conviction that the introduction of administrative control on interest rates in Ireland would be bad for the country as a whole in the medium term. Furthermore, the Minister for Finance met the main mortgage providers in May. A clear schedule has been outlined to the banks. It has been made clear that the banks have agreed that by July there will be moves to ensure all customers have offers of lower payments either through lower SVRs or by fixing their mortgages for a particular term. The banks must respond to this initiative, as the Minister will meet them again in September. For that reason, it would not be appropriate to accept this Bill until the effects of current policy initiatives have been evaluated. In addition, all advice from the Central Bank indicates that the powers contained in the Bill would prove detrimental to Irish mortgage customers and the country as a whole in the long term.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	515	Several factors militate against the untimely and opportunistic proposal by Deputy Pearse Doherty and his party. Since the recession and the sea change in the Irish mortgage lending market, there has been a decrease in the number of institutions offering mortgage products. This is not a healthy situation for the market, for the country or for borrowers. The Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance, and indeed the Central Bank, recognise and highlight the lack of competition and the apprehension that would be off-putting for any potential entrant into the Irish market. It is essential that we have a strong regulatory framework for policing banks, but they must be able to arrange their activities in developing products that will generate a profit. Bank profitability is at the front and centre of any potential entrant's mind in deciding whether to operate in Ireland, as the Irish market is not a profitable one. However, when rates being charged are excessive they act as a brake on the economic growth of the nation, and the banks need to recognise that glossy advertising to attract people will be counterproductive if they fail to deal with their customers in a fair and transparent manner. The issues that give rise to the current situation remain largely within the legacy of the Fianna Fáil Administration. The absence of Fianna Fáil Members this evening is noticeable. In 2006, when dark clouds loomed and interest rates began to rise, a former Minister representing a now defunct party said that Ireland did not need the revenue raised from stamp duty. In June of that year, by way of a written response to a question tabled by the current Tánaiste, Deputy Burton, the then Minister for Finance, later Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, of Fianna Fáil, said:A high proportion of household indebtedness in Ireland ... relates to borrowing for house-purchase which, in turn, involves the acquisition of an asset for the households. ... It therefore reflects the strong performance of the economy and confidence in Ireland’s economic prospects. Demand for housing has risen strongly in recent years and has been underpinned by demographic factors, the innate strength of the economy and the impact of an accommodating monetary stance, including historically low interest rates. House prices have risen rapidly in recent years driven by these fundamental factors. It is reasonable to assume that, over time such factors as the large increase in new housing supply will restore equilibrium to the market. This should allow output to move gradually closer to sustainable demand and result in more moderate price increases. Unpicking this answer exposes and explains the web of betrayal that was wrought on the Irish people. The former Minister went on to say that we would be in for a soft landing. This phrase will be remembered by all of us, as it was bandied about in Dáil debate after Dáil debate; the Official Report is peppered with the phrase. It leaves a bad taste even now. Over a year later, Mr. Cowen's boss, the former Taoiseach, in his now infamous speech to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, said of the people who urged caution:Sitting on the sidelines, cribbing and moaning is a lost opportunity. I don't know how people who engage in that don't commit suicide because frankly the only thing that motivates me is being able to actively change something.Of course he recanted this and apologised, but I wonder just how many lives have been lost to suicide since the financial crash that the Fianna Fáil Administration lumbered into as it believed its own bluster. How would those members of the Opposition who were part of that Administration explain themselves to the Irish people? The borrowing-fuelled property market that ran amok with the boom, followed swiftly by the bust, dragged large numbers of young people into, and saddled them with, mortgages of up to 110% that would be ultimately unsustainable, resulting in negative equity as the much-touted soft landing became a catastrophic crash. A total of 52% of Irish mortgages are low-yield tracker mortgages. It is against this backdrop that the current mortgage market is structured. The Minister for Finance has met with banks recently. We are waiting for the lenders to come up with options that will be available at the beginning of July. In the circumstances it is wholly inappropriate and most untimely that this Bill has been brought before the Dáil. I do not support the Bill.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	516	Last month I stood here during Private Members' business urging the Minister for Finance to meet with and put real pressure on the banks. I said, "I would urge you to make it clear to them that as the banks stabilise and get lower interests rates from Europe, they must pass this on to the financially strapped mortgage holders across the country." Dún Laoghaire has some of the highest house prices in the country, and by inference some of the highest mortgages. Most people who purchased a property after the Celtic tiger years are on a standard variable rate mortgage. Several helpless constituents have come to me in mortgage arrears. They are hard-working families who pay their property tax, universal social charge and water charges. It is one of the most compliant counties in the country. I am pleased to acknowledge that the Minister listened and has met with the six main mortgage banks in an effort to help homeowners in Dún Laoghaire and the rest of the country. I only hope that the banks will actually sit up, listen and do something about it. Only last week I received an e-mail from John in Blackrock, and his thoughts say exactly what I think. I will read it in full:There is a fear that a derisory offer of 0.50% to 0.75% will be offered by the banks and that the Government will accept this small, token reduction. It has been reported in the media that the Government is looking for at least a 0.75% cut in the standard variable rate, but I believe more should be demanded in order to undo the strangle hold the banks interest rates have had on mortgage holders over the past 7 years. This reduction should have been demanded years ago, which would have saved people thousands in increased interest payments. It is grossly unfair on the 300,000 or so standard variable rate mortgage holders who are paying through the nose to supplement the Tracker rates being paid by others. We have already, as taxpayers, paid more than enough to bail out the banks and enough is now enough. Currently the ECB interest rate is 0.05%. While the Irish banks' interest rates are the highest in Europe at an average of 4.2%. This is almost twice as high as the European average. Is this equitable? Is this fair? In an economy that is now slowly recovering some of its confidence, which has been hindered rather than helped by high interest rates of the banks, this is an important opportunity to release some cash flow back into the economy. Every euro paid in to a bank is a euro less spent in the economy. Thankfully, the banks have faced increasing political pressure in recent months to reduce their rates but I believe more should be done. A levy on the banks is not the answer either as we mortgage holders will not see any benefit in our pockets. While the recently announced cut of up to 0.38% by AIB on standard variable rate mortgages is welcome, the bank is still charging up to 1.5% more than it is charging in Northern Ireland. This is simply unethical and unacceptable. It is unethical and unacceptable and I urge the Minister to ensure the hard-pressed homeowners of Dún Laoghaire are given some reprieve on their rates. I welcome the pressure the Minister is putting on the banks and I urge the banks to propose fair and viable options to reduce monthly mortgage payments in the coming weeks.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	517	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Sinn Féin Private Members' Bill, which was introduced by Deputy Pearse Doherty. While we have some reservations about some of the details, the Fianna Fáil Party will support the legislation, as Second Stage is about broad principles, and I support the broad principle of giving the Central Bank the power to intervene in respect of the mortgage interest rates being charged by banks. We need to get real in this debate. Approximately 300,000 standard variable rate mortgage account holders are being ripped off. Paying way over the odds makes a dramatic difference to a monthly mortgage repayment and can add hundreds of euro each month in interest above and beyond the rates that are charged elsewhere in Europe. Over the lifetime of a 20- or 25-year mortgage, Irish mortgage holders on variable interest rates are paying tens of thousands of euro more in interest than mortgage holders elsewhere in the European Union. I have yet to hear a logical explanation for the reason mortgage interest rates charged in Ireland are double the average rate in the eurozone.  I am pleased the campaign for fairness for standard variable rate mortgage customers is gaining considerable momentum. Since Fianna Fáil highlighted this issue during the debate on a Private Members' motion at the end of March, some progress has been made. Our motion resulted in a meeting being arranged between the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank to discuss the issue of standard variable mortgage rates. We subsequently secured, for the first time, an admission from the Minister that the rates being charged by the banks are too high. The Central Bank has also produced a report on variable rate pricing, and while we can agree or disagree with it, at least it forms the basis of a discussion. The Minister also held six meetings with representatives of the various banks. It is now time for action.  As of yet, not one of the banks has reduced its standard variable rate on account of a meeting it has held with the Minister. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, referred to the reduction in the standard variable mortgage rate charged by Allied Irish Banks. This reduction was announced by AIB's chief executive officer, Mr. David Duffy, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform several weeks before the bank's representatives met the Minister. Bank of Ireland has since announced a reduction in fixed mortgage rates. The purpose of the meetings between the Minister and representatives of the banks was to secure reductions in variable rates. The statement issued by the Minister following these meetings was carefully worded. He indicated, for example, that simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for standard variable rate customers would be available by the beginning of July. As such, he can claim that the reduction in the fixed rate ticks this box and fulfils that promise.  The Minister's statement continued: "Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers." In tandem with this official statement, we heard a great deal of spin from unnamed Government sources who spoke to the media and indicated that an initial 0.25% cut in the interest rate would be followed by a second 0.25% reduction in a few months. We also heard that the Government fully expected standard variable rates to fall by 0.75% within the next year. Thus far, however, not one bank has reduced its variable rate on account of a meeting with the Minister.  The Minister should not accept a reduction in the fixed rate as a substitute for reducing the standard variable rate. The cost of funds for banks has declined dramatically recently as a result of lower funding costs from the European Central Bank and reduced costs on the wholesale markets, and because the banks pay little or no interest to savers and depositors. The variable rate has not fallen in line with reductions in the costs of funds. Instead, the net interest margin has increased dramatically. I accept that banks must be profitable, and the pillar banks are reasonably profitable again. However, if the cost of funds were to increase for the banks, they would not need to be asked twice to increase their variable interest rates. On the contrary, their variable rates would be increased almost immediately.  The House must speak with one voice on this issue, because the rates mortgage holders are being charged on standard variable rate loans are simply not acceptable. Regardless of whether the Central Bank wants to acquire the power to intervene where there is a clear market failure, it should be given such a power. The House is tonight debating a Sinn Féin Bill and will soon debate a Fianna Fáil Party Bill on this issue. My party will maintain pressure on the Government. While we must wait until 1 July before we can measure the response from the banks to their meetings with the Minister, thus far, Ulster Bank, KBC and ACC have not commented, Permanent TSB has given a strong hint that it will not reduce its rate, AIB announced a cut in its rate before its meeting with the Minister, and Bank of Ireland has gone through the back door by reducing the fixed rate.  Fixed rates do not suit everyone, and many people do not want to move to a fixed rate. Bank of Ireland is only offering a fixed rate for existing customers who sign up to a minimum two-year term. If customers lock into a specific fixed rate and the variable rate subsequently falls significantly below the fixed rate, they will lose out a second time. For this reason, the campaign sets out to reduce the standard variable mortgage rates the banks are charging. The Minister and Government should not settle for anything else, and my party certainly will not settle for anything less.  This Bill, or similar legislation, is also required to address the sale to private equity funds of approximately 20,000 mortgages from under the feet of the mortgage holders. These so-called vulture funds are outside the control of the Department and the Central Bank. We are still awaiting the passage of consumer protection legislation covering this area, but even that Bill will not deal with circumstances in which the vulture funds decide to increase their rates. If they were to charge rates of 6%, 7% or 8%, the Minister and Central Bank could do damn all about it. This is not acceptable, because the mortgage holders in question are exposed to a real and unacceptable risk.  I welcome the Bill, and my party will support it on Second Stage. We will wait until 1 July to ascertain what has been the reaction of the banks to the Minister's statements. Thus far, it has been deeply disappointing, as there is no evidence that they have taken on board the spirit of the message the House has consistently sent in respect of the exorbitant standard variable mortgage rates they are charging.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	518	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this extremely important issue. I compliment Sinn Féin on using its Private Members' time to introduce this Bill, which gives Deputies another opportunity to discuss excessive variable interest rates and the Government's handling of the mortgage arrears crisis. The softly-softly approach it has adopted is clearly not working. My colleague Deputy Michael McGrath, who introduced a Bill similar to this one some days ago, has led the charge in highlighting that 300,000 variable-rate mortgage customers are being thrown to the wolves by the Government. These mortgage holders are paying twice the European Union average interest rate at a time when the ECB is at an historically low level. It was unbelievable to listen to Government speakers describe this as an inappropriate time to introduce legislation which would provide assistance to 300,000 people. Talk about being out of touch with reality. I wonder if they hold constituency clinics or meet and engage with their constituents on a daily basis. We are told that the Minister for Finance met representatives of the various financial institutions.Let us remember that the Minister originally said he had no hand, act or part in this. It was only after considerable pressure from Members of the Opposition and considerable media attention that he decided to engage with the banks. While the banks have until 1 July to produce a formal response, the early indication of what the banks propose is pathetic. Regarding Bank of Ireland reducing its fixed interest rate, most people on a variable interest rate do not want to be on a fixed interest rate. To listen to previous speakers talking about how we got here, it would appear that they think describing how we got here absolves them of responsibility for helping people who are in a particularly difficult situation with their mortgages. Earlier in the House, we voted for the establishment of a commission of investigation into certain transactions at the liquidated IBRC. Similarly to the action required on the variable interest rate, the establishment of the commission of investigation was initially rejected out of hand by the Government. It said there was no proof of wrongdoing. Now, it says it is only establishing the commission to reassure the public. What reassurance will the Government give to the 300,000-plus families being screwed by their financial institutions? They are looking in here and what they see is one rule for friends of Fine Gael and another for the ordinary Joe Soap. People with high borrowings with IBRC are availing of bargain basement write-downs on their debt and bargain basement write-downs on their interest rates. What does that tell Joe Public? It says the Government is not serious about helping and supporting families. If it was, it would be supporting the legislation. As my colleague said, while we have concerns about certain elements of the Bill, it should be allowed to pass to Committee Stage so that we can examine how to improve it. As a party, we recognise the need for the banks to be profitable. We also recognise and acknowledge, however, the right of customers to be treated fairly, which is clearly not happening. The recent report by the Central Bank clearly outlines the dysfunction in the mortgage market and states that there needs to be greater transparency in variable interest rate policies. People who are looking on are absolutely bewildered at the margin the banks can charge and the difference being charged in this jurisdiction vis-à-vis the rest of the EU. Someone with a 20-year mortgage of €200,000 in Ireland pays €4,000 more a year in interest than people in the rest of the EU. How is that fair and equitable and how can the Government stand over it and allow it to happen? Nevertheless, Government Members say it is an inappropriate time to talk about this issue. I heard a previous speaker use the words "hopeful" and "confident," and say that he or she expected the banks to act in a certain way. The father of a young lady came to my constituency office. She is under huge pressure and depressed due to the manner in which the banks are dealing with her. She is in her early 30s and took out a mortgage in good faith which she paid consistently, on time and in the right amount for seven years. It was only after that that she got into difficulty. The manner in which the bank has dealt with her and her family has been wholly unacceptable, but we are told we are leaving it to the banks' control. Two years ago my party advocated for the removal of the veto, but we were blocked by the Government before it arrived at similar thinking. In the same way, the Government must reconsider introducing legislation to ensure the banks cannot rip off our citizens by charging high interest rates. Before I finish, I want to touch on the wholly inadequate manner in which the Government is dealing with those in mortgage arrears. Again, a constituent of mine was lucky enough to be in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, given that the scheme was scrapped by the Government a number of years ago. She was getting €280 a month but because she negotiated a revised repayment deal with the bank whereby a greater percentage of the payment went towards the capital rather than the interest, the full mortgage interest supplement has been cut. She is a young woman with a husband and a child and the only income coming into the house is social welfare. How can she afford to pay her mortgage? She cannot. What help and support is she getting from the Government? She is getting none. The Government refers to the mortgage interest scheme and its representatives say the mortgage-to-rent scheme is there. When that was introduced in 2012, 500 applications were meant to be approved each year. There have been 88 since 2012. What does that say about the attention the Government is giving to those in mortgage arrears? It is giving none. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, to reconsider the Bill and allow it to pass on Second Stage to give all Members of the House an opportunity to tease out how we as elected representatives can bring forward legislation to give some hope and breathing space to the 300,000 people who are at the pin of their collars tonight.

#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	520	Billions of euro were spent to rescue the banks at the expense of the taxpayer in the period after the economic crash. Now the banks are recovering, but they are showing their ingratitude and demonstrating unethical behaviour towards customers. There is a fear and distrust among the general public regarding the banks and the manner in which they have treated financially vulnerable borrowers. Certainly, it has impacted significantly on public opinion, and there is now a backlash. The banks do not seem to be taking any notice of the negativity from the general public, however. Up to now, the banks have paid little or no heed to the Government. The continuation of inflated variable interest rates as well as the unfair burdening of lenders are inhibiting our economic recovery. Due to the banks ignoring Government approaches and the proposals within the Bill, there have been suggestions in Government circles that there might be rate reductions of 0.25%. This is a punitive and pathetic proposed decrease. It may get all mortgages under 4% before the end of 2015, but it is not an adequate target for the Government to have.Deposit rates are nil, allowing the banks to make a substantial 4% margin on all loans. The Central Bank has presided over and allowed this disproportionate practice of the banks exploiting their clients over recent years. The European Central Bank interest rates are at an historically low level, with up to 300,000 Irish mortgage holders required to pay mortgage interest rates in respect of variable rate mortgages which are excessively high in comparison with the ECB interest rates. The practice of the banks using mortgage holders to supplement loss-making elements of the mortgage book will have to be halted due to undue hardship. It is also hampering consumer confidence and severely restricting consumer spending. It is about time at this stage considering the very softly-softly approach from the Government benches. In general, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet have been playing a waiting game with maybe too much pleading and holding back to see will the banks make any substantial move. We are well aware that thus far the whole situation is dismal with practically no concession given. This approach is not working and decisive action will have to be taken. The Central Bank should be given the tangible necessary powers to force the banks to reduce the variable interest rates to a reasonable level and therefore I support this Bill.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	521	The Anti-Austerity Alliance is happy to support this Bill as an attempt to curb the gross profiteering of the banks. The rip-off of the bank bailout has been laid bare for all to see in recent weeks in particular as has the inequity of that bailout, where we see how the banks have treated the victims of austerity, those in mortgage difficulty due to unemployment and pay cuts, who are being asked and told to pay back every cent. Those who do not are pursued viciously and are led into extremely stressful situations, leading to them eventually losing their homes. There are no write-offs, no special deals and no bailouts for them. We have even seen an increase of 500% in court proceedings against mortgage holders. On the other side, particularly highlighted in recent weeks, has been the treatment afforded to the benefactors of austerity, the super wealthy, the capitalists, the Denis O'Briens of this world. They have been given sweetheart deals, write-downs and massive reductions in interest rates by IBRC and the banks at a cost of hundreds of millions of euro to the taxpayer. Following the bailouts and the crisis in this country we have been left with a largely publicly owned banking system. One may have thought that with a nationalised banking system we would have banks that would pursue policies that would take into account the overall good of society and of the economy as a whole rather than the narrow interests of maximising profits. In fact, the opposite has taken place. The bailouts and the nationalisations took place in order to let them reprivatise, of which a central part is driving profitability in the banks. There has been a continuation and a deepening of the robbery of working class people. The holders of standard variable rate mortgages are particularly exploited and ripped off. They pay approximately 2% over the European average which represents a massive extra €330 a month for a €200,000 mortgage. This is a massive extra burden and hardship for low and middle income households, with a deflationary effect on the economy as a whole. The banks are consciously increasing their profit margin on variable mortgages to cover the losses on other loan books such as tracker loans and buy-to-let. When asked about it the Government's fundamental reply has been that it does not intervene in the day-to-day decisions of the banks and that it is a question for the management of the banks in question. The Government attempts to apply some sort of pressure but fundamentally it is a question for the banks. It is a pathetic attempt to wash its hands of any responsibility for this rip-off. The Government is responsible. It is a Government that stands over the banks having a mandate to maximise profit. The Government is pursuing the logic of profit maximisation. How else would the banks operate in a situation where they are making losses on one side of the business other than to pursue maximising profits where they can with those who have relatively little power, namely those with variable rate mortgages? I was therefore disappointed to see that the Bill obliges the Central Bank to consider the profitability of the banks when deciding on its direction on rates. That accepts the logic that the banks must be run for profit which is the central issue here that we have to challenge. If the Government was serious it would introduce legislation, amend regulations and instruct the banks not to operate solely to maximise profits at the cost of ordinary mortgage holders. It would use the fact that we own the banks to run the banking system in the interests of the majority. The problem we have had over the past whole number of years is that we have had societies run in the interests of banks. Now we own the banks and we should run the banks in the interests of society. That would mean ending evictions and court proceedings against mortgage holders; writing down mortgage debt that is unpayable; and having interest rates that are payable by people.

I welcome this Bill as a positive, helpful and sensible proposal. It is also very relevant to what is happening in Ireland in 2015. All Members have had families coming to our clinics and offices with their mortgage problems. These are decent, hard-working families, most of whom wanted to pay something and yet were being pushed around by banks and some of the financial institutions. They need our support and help and they need proper and adequate support from the Government. Many lost their jobs and yet they are being hammered. They are afraid and they are angry when they see the wealthy elite in Irish society getting millions written off while they scrape to survive. That is the reality for these families. Action is needed and there has been too much talk and not enough support for these families. I refer to the detailed proposals in the legislation. Section 1 defines “interest rate” as the variable rate mortgage whereby the interest rate varies to reflect market conditions;"viability" means the ability of the covered institution to sustain or maintain growth and development in the market. There is concern about overheating of the economy. The Government is considering the idea of giving tax cuts to people who are very well-off and yet services need investment. A balanced approach should be achieved by putting money and investment into services, in particular services in health, education and disability. Section 2(1) proposes:The Bank shall consider from time to time whether it is necessary to carry out a review of the rate of interest being charged by the covered institutions on standard variable rate mortgages and may issue a direction to a covered institution instructing it to vary the level of interest it charges on standard variable rate mortgages. Section 6 proposes:(1) A person commits an offence if he or she without reasonable excuse, does not comply with a direction issued by the Bank under this Act.(2) A person who commits an offence under this section is liable—(a) on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, or(b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both.As I strongly welcome this legislation and support it I am thinking of the 300,000 variable rate mortgage holders. They need our practical support and they need action from the Government parties. I welcome this Bill.It is strong, decisive and inclusive and, above all, it helps mortgage holders who need our support in the current climate. The fat cats in society seem to be always getting away with things and getting the breaks. Now it is time for justice for all these families and, particularly, for the mortgage holders. I welcome the legislation and will strongly support it.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	523	I, too, welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening and will fully support the legislation. It does not surprise anybody on this side of the House that the Government will not accept the Bill because it is about benefiting the small people who do not have the connections, who are struggling to survive and keep a roof over their heads. They are the people who do not really matter to the Government and have been the cannon fodder for the crisis and the recession. They cannot talk to special receivers and make a verbal agreement to ease things for them in the new dispensation. They constantly struggle, and the Government refuses to represent them. Over the past four years we had to be such good Europeans. We had to take one for Europe, bail out our banks and ensure that no European bank would fail. We did that by putting ourselves to the pin of our collar, destroying our economy and doing untold damage to our society. However, when Members on this side of the House point out that the rest of Europe enjoys interest rates on variable rate mortgages that are at least 2% lower than the Irish average, we are told there is nothing we can do about it. How is it that we can pick and choose what kind of Europeans we are? We can be good Europeans when we put ourselves into destruction by bailing out banks, but we cannot be good Europeans in hoping and expecting to avail of the same kind of interest rates other European citizens enjoy? That is the type of European citizens the Government wants us to be and the type of Europe we are in - citizens who kowtow and tip the hat to Europe and say, "We will take everything you give us, we will take all the medicine you insist we take and will not look for anything in return that would benefit our citizens". It is a sad reflection of why the Government is resisting the Bill so much and why it has resisted dealing with the mortgage crisis for so long. This crisis was first raised in the lifetime of this Dáil by the Technical Group in May 2011 during Private Members' business. We flagged that the crisis was coming down the road, but the Government refused to listen. The Government simply considers its role to be to bail out banks and save the European Union without benefiting the citizens of the State. Over the past few months, much has been made in the media of the banks returning to profitability. It is reported that the banks are recovering and getting back to where they should have been, and that we can look forward to selling off part of them to recover some of the cost we put in to bailing them out. However, Deputies in this House have been at work outlining the differences in the interest rates and showing how the variable rate mortgage holders are the ones returning the banks to profitability. There are 300,000 variable rate mortgage holders paying over the odds in terms of interest rates, which could be costing each of them somewhere in the region of €4,000 to €6,000 per year in extra interest. That works out at over €1.2 billion to €1.8 billion in extra profits for the banks. Coincidentally, that is about the amount of extra profit they made this year. It is on the backs of those citizens that the banks are returning to profitability. Once again, it is a false economy. Although the Government claims to be driving a recovery, it is actually on the backs of citizens and vulnerable people.

Deputy Pearse Doherty knows that when one puts forward legislation, one is supposed to look at things in totality. From my experience of watching Deputy Doherty in the finance committee, he understands finance and how legislation works. I do not think this Bill takes into account the grand totality of what is actually happening or what has been done for people in mortgage arrears, how the market works or what happens with banks. I am sure most of the Opposition Members have not read the Central Bank of Ireland May 2015 report on the influences on the standard variable mortgage pricing in Ireland, although they should read it. That report states that there are three main factors involved: credit risk, weak competition and bank profitability which is constrained by legacy issues. Some of those legacy issues stem from the fact that half the mortgages in our banking system are tracker mortgages. They are absolutely fantastic for the people who have them, but they make no money for the banks and drag them down. This impacts on how the banks work. An interesting point was made, which could be investigated further by the Minister. When Richie Boucher came before the finance committee, he said that Bank of Ireland's mortgage book in the UK is similar in size to the book they have in Ireland. The mortgage book in England is considered to be of better quality, although the repossession rates in the UK are twice those in Ireland. He has a better quality loan book but twice the repossession rates. That does not make sense. One would expect the repossession rates to be higher in Ireland rather than in the UK. That is something that deserves investigation and discussion in this House, if we could have reasonable, rational debates rather than what passes as debate. If repossession rates are lower in Ireland, what factors are causing it? Is it because we have better protection from the Central Bank? Do we have better legislation protecting people with mortgages? Do we have courts that understand peoples' concerns better than the UK courts? We need to know these things. It has been pointed out time and again that banks cannot take title back, to use that phrase, which describes them as the credit risk. If they cannot take the title back on properties for which they have loans, they say they have to pay more for the money they rent out to everybody. It is quite possible that, without realising it, there is a solidarity going on in this country among the 85% of people who are paying their mortgages on time and those who are paying their restructured mortgages. We do not understand that we may all be in this together more than we think. There are so many other factors coming into this, yet the proposed legislation is simplistic. I do not know what the thinking behind it is at all and cannot really understand where it is coming from. Quite a lot has been done to protect people and we can do more. I am surprised the proposed legislation makes no reference to offering protection to people whose loans might be sold on, which are not protected under the usual structures we have for the banks. That is an issue for many people, as I am sure the Deputies across the floor understand. The legislation we are putting through the House right now is there to offer individuals who had their loans sold from the regular banks, which are covered by the Central Bank, protection under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. It will ensure that they will not end up in the situation we have been hearing about, especially in respect of small businesses, where many of these so-called vulture funds are trying to take possession of people's property. We must continue to examine this in order to protect those individuals. From Sinn Féin's experience in government with the DUP in Northern Ireland, has it done anything that has changed the way banking laws work in the United Kingdom and that follows the proposed legislation? Has Sinn Féin some experience it can bring from there? I do not think banking legislation in Northern Ireland has changed that dramatically. The situation up there is just as serious as it is down here.I do not think this legislation is genuine or that the Sinn Féin Members genuinely believe in it at all. They are just putting it forward because they think there is a market for votes in this legislation. They are trying to sell this concept to the Irish people that the financial crisis and our economic system are somehow in silos, that what we do with this legislation has absolutely no effect on the variable rate of the other 85% of people who are paying their mortgages on time, that it is has no knock-on effect at all on the cost of credit to banks in the future and that this just happens to sit there on its own and makes no difference.

They have a poor understanding of how legislation impacts across the economy. Even the Bill they want to put through would have significant impacts on other individuals with mortgages in Irish society. Their so-called solution could actually generate a bigger problem. This comes as a surprise to me. I actually thought they would have put more thought and effort into what they are doing, but clearly not. It might be useful to read what the Central Bank is saying and we might get a more sensible response to what is happening out there.

The area of variable interest rates is of concern to many mortgage holders, particularly those in distress. I refer to the part of the Bill which deals with trackers, many of which are costing the banks money, as we know. My view on all of this is that banking is a business, the same as every other business. In order to make it effective and competitive, we need more competition in the market; in order to do that, we need more banks to open in Ireland; and in order to do that, we need to be an attractive place for banks to come to do business. I hope that we see that take place in the coming months. Perhaps some European banks will come here and offer people an alternative, and allow them to change their existing mortgages to another bank. At that stage, they would be able to get the mortgage at a different rate. My personal belief is that this is not something we should interfere in, as policy makers, and we should let the market dictate this. I know the Central Bank has looked into this and the Minister for Finance has spoken to many of the banks, which are due to report back before the end of July to give their views on what they will do on variable rates. That is an important process which we should let come to fruition before we suggest enforcing a particular rate and deciding how banks should operate. I do not believe that would be good for commercial business, for households or for first-time buyers. It would create a completely different animal and, while it might solve one problem, it might create many others. Competition between banks is crucial, as is ensuring that the price customers have to pay moves in the right direction. We saw this worked previously in a different climate in Ireland, when interest rates were much lower. Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a person taking on a loan always paid arrangement fees and so on, but we got rid of all of those fees. We reached the stage where one wondered how banks could even operate and make a profit but we are now back to different conditions in business. Interest rates must be paid and loans must make sense, in the same way that deposits must be attractive for people to put money into the bank. Therefore, the way banks operate must go back to the normal way it was before what we would call the Celtic tiger, when interest rates were extraordinarily low and, as I said, one would wonder how the banks operated given the low fees. That is my view. We should wait until the banks report to the Minister in July on what model they would like to use. At that stage, we will be able to see more clearly. I believe we need more competition in banking in Ireland. We should be out there looking for other banks, European banks in particular, to come to Ireland to set up, as this would solve many of these problems. This would be good for business given credit is an issue for small business in particular, although it is an issue for big business as well. We need more competition in the market to achieve this. There was a time when credit was free-flowing but, given the crisis, we have gone to the other extreme. We need to get back to normal conditions. There has to be an element of risk when a business borrows money, which is an important point, and we need a certain amount of competition in the market. The Central Bank is very clear that regulating interest rates would have a negative effect on banking efficiency and hinder the entry of other banks into the Irish market. It was asked if we wanted the power to regulate rates. Future competition is a better way of creating a sustainable long-term solution. As I said, the Minister has spoken to the six main mortgage lenders in the last month and they are due to report by the end of July. We should wait for that process to conclude and then look at this again. My firm belief is that the Bill would not be good for business in the long term. We should let the market dictate this and the best way to do that is to have more competition in the market.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	542	With this Bill, Sinn Féin and Deputy Pearse Doherty are asking for nothing more than for the Government to do what it said it would: to act forcefully and decisively with banks to protect the public and, among them, the homeowners who bailed out these banks. In truth, the steps contained in the Bill would only be a small but important move towards making that commitment a reality. If it chooses to oppose this Bill, the Government will again be stating clearly that commitments to be strong and to act in the interests of the people are just something Labour and Fine Gael do at election time. When Fine Gael and Labour took office, they took charge of quite a mess. Following a catastrophic bank bailout led by Fianna Fáil, which lied to our faces, many mortgage holders were left in dire straits, with falling incomes and big mortgages. The banks were ripping off Irish mortgage holders and a new firm hand was needed to bring these banks into line and protect homeowners. We were to be in no doubt of the intentions of the Government to change things. It did indeed change things in many respects, but it has not changed the situation of mortgage holders, who continue to be mistreated by the banks they bailed out. The Government have been very good at showing little concern for the interests of many sections of society, such as the homeless, single parents, children, young women, students and Travellers, and the list goes on. However, it has been all too eager to protect the interests of those running these bailed-out banks, which have continued to ride rough-shod over the people of the State. The hands-off, softly-softly, laissez-faire attitude must end. We need that forceful and decisive hand in dealing with the banks that Deputy Eamon Gilmore promised us four years ago. This Bill would be part of that change. This Bill is on the side of the homeowners of Ireland, not the banks, a position utterly absent from the Government's actions. The Bill would introduce a legal process to allow the Financial Regulator to set down a cap on the standard variable rate in bailed-out institutions.It also gives power to the Minister for Finance to tell the regulator to set a cap should it not act on this power, and to seek reviews and reports on the use of this power by the regulator as well as setting regulations for its use. Depending on the context of the time, a cap does not have to be set, but should it benefit the public good the power is there to be used when and as needed. The regulator will be mandated to consider a number of factors when using this power, most crucially the impact on mortgage holders. This is a fair, reasonable and proportionate proposal which will tackle seriously a problem which should never have come to be, but has in any case been allowed to continue for too long. The time for asking banks to comply with any notion of fairness is over. It is now time to tell the banks how things will be and what their responsibility is to the public who saved them. It is not acceptable that banks bailed out by our citizens should ignore their plight. As Deputy Pearse Doherty said, this is an extraordinary measure for extraordinary times. It is borne out of the need to tackle a problem which has only been allowed to grow and cause wider issues. The public still carries these banks. They must now play their part in making things better for struggling families and bringing fairness to their treatment of their customers. We provided an opportunity to tackle this problem earlier with the Interest Rate Approval Bill, but it was rejected. Now, as time has passed, stronger measures are required and a cap is needed. The Minister said the issue would be considered in the budget. We do not have time to waste.  When the House breaks for the summer, the struggles of families with variable rate mortgages will continue. They do not want to wait and see what will happen. They have done that for four years under this Government as they paid a rate which is higher than anywhere else in Europe and more than 1.4% higher than the median rate. The time to be decisive and forceful is now. It is already long overdue. Sinn Féin would consider going further than this Bill, but we have attempted to put forward a plan for tackling this problem that the Government would support. We want to see some action rather than no action at all.  The Bill should be supported. We should all support and back any citizens forced out of their homes as a result of unsustainable mortgages and interest rates. The Bill would be a further step in addressing the major mortgage crisis and the subsequent consequences for society in general. Supporting it is the right thing to do and will send out a strong message that, above all, people matter.

In fact, people are getting sick of listening to the talk of recovery. The constituency offices of every Member of this House are full of people in distress about their inability to pay their mortgages and the fear that they will lose their homes. A constituent who is facing eviction, possibly in the next number of weeks, contacted me today. A 25 year old man also contacted me today. He was given a mortgage of €250,000 from a lender at 19 years of age on the basis of two payslips. The same lenders are, for their own selfish interests, extracting every cent they can from the public and people who borrowed money to build houses for their families. This Bill is the product of many years of work from Deputy Pearse Doherty who has been active on the issue of high interest rates since he set foot in this House. As far back as 2011, he asked Deputy Eamon Gilmore to ensure that the banks passed on the ECB interest rate cuts to ordinary borrowers and he was extracting promises from the Minister of State's former leader that the Government would act forcefully with the banks to ensure they passed on the rate reductions to consumers. Meanwhile, four years on the Government has watched people's distress and has done nothing to curb the powers of the banks. The banks still have a veto on any kind of mortgage resolution. When I consider this kind of behaviour by the Government, sometimes I wonder if it is really so far removed from the reality of the lives of the people it is supposed to represent, or is it the case that it knows the reality but does not give a toss about the stress people are under and what that does to them, their families and their friends in terms of putting food on the table and paying exorbitant interest rates to banks that are way beyond anything else in Europe. The Bill is a response to the reality of the situation. The very high standard variable rate mortgages are a scandal. Irish mortgage holders are paying more compared to England and other EU states. The eurozone average is only 2.8 %, while people here are paying, on average, 4.26%. We are bringing forward this Bill to put a temporary cap on interest rates. This is an exceptional measure for exceptional times. We are referring only to those banks that the people have bailed out and it is about time the Government put its foot down on behalf of the people who suffered because of that bailout. It is time to stand with the people against the banks. I and the people I represent are fed up watching the Government crumple in the face of the banks. The banks have a moral obligation to start giving something back to the people. The Government has been sadly lacking in that regard. This Bill is very careful to give regard to the profitability and viability of the banks. It allows the Central Bank to set a maximum rate of standard variable rates at the covered institutions and even allows banks to look for a review of any cap after six months. The Bill only applies to bailed out banks, that is, the banks which would have gone under if the people had not bailed them out. Incidentally, the people were never consulted about that. These institutions now have some responsibility to society to give something back. They are State-owned banks and they have a duty to the State and, more importantly, to society. The interest rates are too high and if the banks will not act to reduce them, then the Government must. If the Minister of State was serious, he and his party members would, given what his previous leader said in the House in 2011, support the Bill.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	544	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty's purpose in bringing this Bill to the House is to tackle the unsustainable levels of variable interest rates being levied by banks on home owners. Under new legislative proposals by our party, the Central Bank would have temporary powers to impose a maximum cap on variable mortgage interest rates. As my colleagues have previously outlined, Irish home owners are paying over the odds for these interest rates compared to other EU countries. This Bill is an effort to counteract the wholly ineffective response by the Government to fight the corner of home owners in any credible way. Some four long and painful years have passed since the issue was first raised. We were told by the Labour Party that we should be in no doubt that this Government would "act decisively, forcefully and effectively with the banks".  The continued penance being paid by taxpayers through mortgage rates, however, is nothing new. Rates currently being suffered by home owners in this State are among the highest in Europe. The standard variable rates here are almost double what they are across Europe. The measures proposed in this Bill would allow the Central Bank to set a maximum rate of mortgage interest for an individual bank for a period not exceeding 12 months.  The Bill is limited to the covered institutions quite simply because these are the banks which the people bailed out. They are partly owned by the people as a result.This should, therefore, provide the Government with a mandate to act on the people's behalf. Under the proposed legislation, the Central Bank would have new powers to set out the maximum rate of interest which any of the five covered financial institutions could charge. Any bank affected by such an order could apply for a review after six months. This would cover eventualities such as a rise in the cost of money on wholesale currency markets. Such rules and measures are in place for credit unions which cannot lend at a rate above 12.5%, as well as for moneylenders who are subject to individual maximum rates. Why not apply the same to the banks which were bailed out by the people of this State? Why not shift the power balance in a way that serves the people? It is about making a choice that will serve and protect families rather than banks. There needs to be a change from the fearful hands-off attitude to one that is on the side of the mortgage holder. This Government's failure on mortgage arrears, on bankers' pay and in making the banks co-operate on insolvency cases is long documented. Its approach is always to put the banks’ interests first and the taxpayers' last. The banks in turn make gains and new demands. Recent research from the Central Bank itself evidenced that home owners are being ripped off to the benefit of the banks in that Irish standard variable rates are far beyond the European Union average at 4.24% compared with an EU median mortgage rate of 2.8%. The banking sector is still broken and continues to sap the life out of citizens. There should be no illusion that the banking sector has changed in any significant way. The sector remains the largest drain on the economy. It cannot continue. It is unethical and unjust. Banks must be forced to play ball in creating a fair recovery rather than profiting from the lack of it. The Government needs to step up to the plate. It is incomprehensible that the State would not use its influence with those banks it owns to make it possible to bring rates down. It makes sense at this point of our economic development to act in the people's interest. It is not good enough for some banks to indicate they will reduce rates by the bare minimum. We are calling on the Government and all other parties to support this Bill.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	545	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Deputies on the Government benches gave the basic message that we cannot interfere with the markets. There was another crisis in Irish history when we heard that mantra from the British Tories. It was during the Famine when people were left to the vagaries of the free market. We know what happened then. There are occasions when governments and public bodies must intervene. The numbers of those in mortgage distress have not been dealt with by this Government. In County Laois alone, 16% of mortgage holders are in arrears, the fourth highest percentage in the State. Many of these people are under enormous financial as well as mental pressure. During the boom, many people working in Dublin were forced to buy basic three-bedroomed terraced and semi-detached houses in the commuter belt towns such as Monasterevin, Portlaoise and Portarlington. Many of them now find themselves in difficulty due to job losses. They are also paying double the interest rate that is applied in the rest of Europe. That is a scandal which the Government has done nothing to fix. Many of these home owners also find the price of their houses has fallen dramatically over the past six years. Many of them were bought for €280,000 but are now only worth €120,000. In my housing estate, houses were selling for €260,000 during the boom but now some have been sold for only €95,000. These are the kind of hits people have had to take. People have these enormous debts with little possibility of paying them off. They also have no prospect of even selling the house, which is doubly demoralising. Problems with mortgage debt are exacerbated by the attitude of the banks and lenders, many of which show little inclination to come to a reasonable arrangement with lenders in arrears. In the case of sub-prime lenders, they tend to be too quick to resort to repossession proceedings. I received a letter this week from someone with a mortgage with IBRC which demanded they sell the family home within six months or it would be sold from over their heads. IBRC later sold the mortgage for a fraction of what the person paid for the house to a company called Shoreline Residential. The home owner is at the mercy of this company which is now selling the mortgage to Start Mortgages. When one does not have regulation, that is the kind of wild west capitalism one gets. With vulture funds increasingly active in this country, the level of repossession proceedings will increase. Earlier, the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, said that more than 8,000 repossession bills had been lodged with the Circuit Court in 2014. In excess of 1,600 of these were lodged in the single month of June 2014. It has also been claimed that the increase in proceedings has been due to the banks and other lenders realising that property prices have started to increase again. This has given them a huge incentive to sell these homes. The banks are now far more aggressive and pushy with no tolerance for arrears. While the courts have generally been understanding of people who have been victims of these attempted repossessions, it is notable the number of repossession orders granted is increasing. The initiators, namely, the lenders - the banksters - are becoming far more aggressive and pushy. It is vital we have legislation to deal with this area. Banks can refuse a reasonable offer for settlement because they were given the veto in the insolvency legislation. This gap was pointed out to the Government during the passage of the insolvency legislation several years ago. The banks have used this gap since then. The Government is meant to be bringing forward measures for the courts to deal with this. However, the problem is that the courts are already chock-a-block with cases and it will be cumbersome. An independent resolution body needs to be established to deal with this problem. Such a measure, along with giving the Central Bank the powers to control interest rates as set out in this Bill from Deputy Pearse Doherty, would bring relief to the hundreds of thousands of people who are suffering.

Our party has a long record in this Dáil of bringing forward legislation that aims to protect borrowers from unscrupulous lending by financial institutions. In 2011, when I challenged the Government on its failure to stand up to the banks to pass on a European Central Bank rate decrease, the then Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, told me: "Deputy Pearse Doherty need be in no doubt that this Government will act decisively, forcefully and effectively with the banks.”It would be almost laughable in retrospect if it was not so serious. That was during Leaders' Questions in 2011. In 2012, I introduced a Bill to cap the interest charged by moneylenders, which was debated in the House. To this day moneylenders are allowed to charge rates of more than 187%. In 2013, I introduced the Interest Rate Approval Bill, which would have given the Central Bank the power to veto any mortgage rate increase at the covered institutions. This was at a time when AIB had in the previous weeks increased its variable mortgage rate by 0.04%, the third interest rate hike in 12 months. The situation has escalated to the point where we know from the Central Bank's report the banks are simply ripping off their customers in the State, and because one lives in Ireland and borrows from a financial institution in the State one is likely to pay more than any of one's counterparts in the European Union. People have painted the picture in our national newspapers that it amounts to approximately €4,000 in hard cash for the ordinary borrower. The Bill seeks to address this and end the rip-off of customers by the financial institutions. I thank Deputy Michael McGrath of Fianna Fáil, Independent Deputies and those Deputies representing smaller parties for their support in principle for the Bill. The Bill is a genuine reaction to a serious crisis we have the State. It is about a specific time-limited intervention for the public good. It is more than justified on social and economic grounds. Section 2 of the Bill outlines the criteria the Central Bank must use to decide whether it will set a cap and issue a direction. These criteria include the current rate, any input from the banks concerned, the ECB rate, the profitability and viability of the bank, its mortgage exposure and, crucially, the impact of the current rate on the actual mortgage holders. This is a balanced approach weighing up the social and economic needs of the State and empowering the Central Bank to act accordingly. Section 3 permits the Central Bank to set a maximum rate for standard variable rates at the covered institutions. In her speech the Minister of State raised as an issue that it would only apply to the covered institutions. The reason we did this was because we want the Government's genuine support for the legislation. If the Government believes it should apply to all financial institutions we are willing to accept this amendment on Committee Stage. Under the section, the Central Bank must give the bank a report outlining why it has set a cap, and if it decides not to set a cap it must report to the Minister its reasons for not doing so. Any cap placed will lapse after 12 months unless renewed. After six months any financial institution can ask for a review based on the criteria in section 2. This will hardly send a chill through international capitalists in Ireland or the European Union. Rather, it is an appropriate response to a market which is simply not working. Further elements in the Bill protect the need for competition and diversity in the banking sector. The remaining sections of the Bill set out the practicalities and make it an offence for a person or bank to ignore a direction from the Central Bank. The Government instead threatens levies. Let us be honest, in most cases a levy on the banks is a levy on the customers. The Government's big stick to the banks is to threaten them with a levy that can be passed on to the very same customers paying their extortionate rates. In her response, the Minister of State cherry-picked her arguments and ignored the fact this is a temporary measure for extraordinary times. There is no recognition in the Government's response to the fact the market has failed. The Minister of State's answer is to carry on as normal and pretend this is a normal society which has not suffered a disastrous economic and social spell of austerity. There was no consideration in her response of the social imperative behind the Bill. She simply trotted out the same tired old arguments that are doubtful at the best of times and not far from completely irrelevant in times like these, when more than 100,000 families cannot pay their mortgages. Listening to other Government spokespersons I was weeping inside. I heard comments from Fine Gael about leaving it to the markets and not interfering with regulation. If I closed my eyes I would have believed I was back in the Seanad in 2007 listening to Fianna Fáil and the PDs argue for non-intervention by the Financial Regulator in the financial system at the time. The same mantra was echoed by some of the Government backbenchers today. The Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform seemed to have taken leave of absence from his facilities during his speech because he simply does not understand what the Bill is about. He asked about the 85% of mortgage holders on standard variable rates who are paying their mortgages. Does he not understand this applies to every standard variable rate mortgage holder in the covered institutions? He spoke about the fact this is not a solution. Did he not read the Central Bank's report which outlined three reasons, which I have read? He, along with other backbenchers, fails to understand the Government committed in its opening speech to examine the very issue addressed by the Bill, which is to empower the Central Bank to regulate interest rates. He fails to understand the Minister is calling in his buddies in the banks and asking them on bended knees please to reduce their variable interest rates because the Government is coming under severe pressure from the Opposition, campaigners outside and elements in the media. The State-owned bank responded with a pathetic 25% basis points reduction and Bank of Ireland simply gave the Minister the two fingers, stating it would reduce its fixed rate but standard variable rates would not go anywhere. The Minister says the Government is still considering introducing regulation and empowering the Governor of the Central Bank to do this but it will wait until closer to the budget and the time when it must go to the electorate. It is continuing to pretend it will do something about this, just like back in the days of March 2011 when the Government came to office. Why would anybody believe the Government?

Under his watch during the term of the Government the mortgage crisis has doubled. It has peaked and is starting to reduce but it has got worse and worse and these are facts the Minister of State cannot dispute. Four families a day are losing their homes. This is what the Government has in mind when it says it will stand up to the banks and will protect mortgage holders and citizens. We know the mantra but we also know the reality. I acknowledge that yesterday Deputy Michael McGrath tabled a similar Bill, as did Senator Feargal Quinn last week. I welcome this because this is a genuine campaign to force the Government to do something which it states on the record it wants to achieve. The Government has not just said in recent weeks that it will empower the Central Bank to set interest rates for the financial institutions. This goes back to 2011. The Taoiseach himself suggested these powers would be given to the Governor of the Central Bank. At the time Mike Aynsley went on RTE to say the Central Bank did not want these powers. In 2013 I met the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, to discuss the issue and we are very aware, as the Minister of State laid out in her speech, that he does not want these powers. However, these powers need to be given to the Governor of the Central Bank because all of the other approaches have failed. We can argue over how the t's are crossed and the i's are dotted and we can argue over how many institutions should be covered, and this is what Committee Stage is for if we are genuine about improving the Bill to reach the objective which every party in the House wants to achieve, at least according to the statements which have been made, which is the reduction of standard variable interest rates for our citizens. The challenge is to accept it. It is time to put up or shut up. Let there be no doubt the Deputies who vote against the Bill are abandoning hundreds of thousands of mortgage interest holders who are being fleeced by their financial institutions.Those financial institutions would not be in existence today if it was not for the generosity of those same customers whose Government bailed them out in 2008. This is about walking the walk, not just talking the talk. I ask the Minister, in a genuine way, to allow this Bill to go to Committee Stage so that we can put it up to the banks together.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	549	I thank Deputy Doherty for bringing this Bill to the House and for the debate that has taken place as a result. We all share a deep concern about the issue of the high mortgage repayments currently being faced by mortgage holders, and the stress and hardship that this causes to families. I do not think any side of the House has a monopoly on this, as the concern is shared by all sides and views have been put forward on the matter by Deputies on all sides. The Minister has made it clear that a penal banking levy in the budget or powers for the Central Banks to regulate interest rates will be considered if action is not taken by the banks on this issue in the coming weeks. It is important not to have a debate in a vacuum, and that is the context of this evening's debate. However, the setting of interest rates is a complex issue and any move to administratively control interest rates, as proposed in this Bill, should not be undertaken lightly, given the long-term negative impacts for borrowers, the viability of the banks, and the good of the economy and country at large, as well as the many citizens who want access to mortgages now and in the future. As such, the Government is opposing this Bill for the reasons that have been outlined in the debate. Increased competition in the banking sector is where we want to get to, as this will exert pressure on the banks to reduce mortgage repayments. The influence of competition in reducing interest rates represents the best value for the consumer, the economy and the country as a whole in the long term. This has been recognised in the most recent ESRI report today, as well as the Central Bank report. The Government has been active in encouraging competition in order to achieve this aim and to give customers more choice. In this context, I also understand that the competition and consumer protection commission is planning to provide better information to consumers to encourage switching. The Government is also opposing the Bill because it has already taken action. The significance that the Government places on this issue was highlighted in May when the Minister for Finance called in the senior management of the six main mortgage providers to discuss the issue and put forward his views. He also requested that the Central Bank provide him with a report on standard variable rates, which has since been published. The banks now need to act on this matter, and we will be closely watching, expecting action. Action at this stage such as that suggested in this Bill would be previous, as there have already been moves by some banks to reduce rates. We are awaiting additional progress on this issue from the other banks but there is no reason not to expect further developments in the near future. We have made clear what options the Minister for Finance has available to him at budget time should insufficient progress have been made. It would not be sensible, therefore, in the middle of this process, when the Government has set out a clear path to follow, to intervene until the full impact, scale and nature of the moves by the banks as a result of their engagement with the Minister can be gauged. It would certainly be the best solution if banks were to make the commercial decision themselves to reduce rates. In addition, the Government is opposing this Bill as it contains significant flaws which could, for example, result in only certain mortgages being included under its scope. Furthermore, as it is restricted to covered institutions only, there are a considerable number of borrowers whose situation would not be addressed. The Government has also taken into consideration the fact that the Central Bank does not want the power to regulate interest rates. Deputy Doherty spoke of his days in the Seanad and the fact that people did not listen to regulators, but the Central Bank has clearly said it does not want the power to regulate interest rates. The Central Bank was asked if it wanted the power to regulate interest rates, and it does not. The Governor of the Central Bank has outlined his view that the introduction of administrative control on interest rates would be bad for the country and he re-emphasised that ensuring official policy does not inadvertently deter competition and entry of banks to the market is vital for the long-term health of the economy. The Governor is not a biased participant in this but is giving his clear advice, based on his expertise, to the Government and the citizens of this country, and some weight should be attached to his comments.  Well-capitalised banks operating more competitively will, in the end, offer lower rates and better service to borrowers. The Central Bank report also makes clear that banks should not exploit the lack of competition. It is on that basis that the Minister engaged with the six main lenders, and we expect to see action in the coming weeks. The Minister has made it clear what will happen and what options are open to him should such action not occur. The Minister has committed to reviewing progress on the issue of reductions in mortgage repayments over the coming weeks and a follow-up set of meetings with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the budget. A number of Deputies raised the issue of the sale of loan books to unregulated firms. These will be protected by the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 when it is enacted. As Deputies know, this is currently working its way through the Oireachtas, and we look forward to further discussion on that Bill on Report Stage, which I believe has been set for 17 June.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	551	I thank every Deputy who took part in this evening's debate. I also acknowledge and thank my colleague Deputy Pearse Doherty for introducing this legislation, and I thank Fianna Fáil and Independent Deputies for stating their support for allowing this Bill to go through to Committee Stage. The Minister of State's rhetoric is depressing, though not unexpected. We are disappointed but not terribly surprised that Government will not support this Sinn Féin Bill. If recent history is anything to go by, the Government may well have moved to adopt Sinn Féin's position on this matter before the election, just as it did, very belatedly, on the bank's veto and on the need for a full, albeit limited, commission of investigation into the IBRC allegations and a range of other issues. However, it might just be too much to ask the Government to stand up to the banks. Ask the hundreds of thousands of families if this Government is capable of standing up to the banks. Ask those who know how the banks hold a veto over a new beginning because of the insolvency laws the Government brought forward. Ask all those who have lost their homes because the banks wanted the law changed to let them repossess family homes. Ask their opinion on whether the Government really believes that this is a bad Bill, or whether the Minister, the Government and all their friends are just afraid of the banks. I think I know and can predict what the people would tell the Minister if he were to put those questions to them. This Government is neither willing to nor capable of standing up to the banks, on this issue or on any other. It hides behind EU rules and it hopes that foreign competitors will come riding in on white horses any day to save the day. That is simply not realistic. Fundamentally, all the arguments we have heard tonight against this Bill boil down to a single argument, namely, that the interests of the banks must come first. Never mind the social disaster that has brought us here and never mind the clear rip-off that is going on. According to the Minister, it seems that no account should be taken of the unprecedented situation we have found ourselves in for years. No account should be taken of the fact that we have lived through a massive recession, a huge part of which, let us remember, is down to the banks. The Minister says the Government will look at this again if there is not sufficient progress by the banks. I note that there is no definition of what might constitute sufficient progress. How are we to judge sufficient progress? Who will judge sufficient progress? The Bank of Ireland has already decided that it is not going to play ball. What is the Government going to do about that? I think we all know the answer. The bank runs rings around this Government every day of the week and it is now beyond a joke. The Government owns the banks on paper, but in terms of policy, the banks own the Government. I do not know what country Deputy Áine Collins has been living in if she thinks banking is just a normal business.It is far from it. The Minister says it is not the right time to act. How many hundreds of thousands need to be ripped off - a rip-off proved by the Central Bank - before it is the right time to act? One would swear, listening to Government, that there are hordes of banks lining up to get into Ireland and the only thing stopping them is the possibility of this mild and modest proposal. It is a mild Government intervention. We accept and we have stated that there is need for competition. However, we know that is not going to happen tomorrow or the next day. In the meantime, the Government seems content not to rock the boat and to let the banks carry on with the highest interest rates in Europe. One could not make this up. This "hear no evil, see no evil" approach to the banks and their scandalously high rates serves no purpose. It seems to be an ideological blind spot for the Government. It is a failed approach that shows that, after four years, this Government has learned nothing. The Minister of State said that giving more power to the Central Bank could somehow raise issues of encroachment on the independence of the Central Bank. Let us think about that. How is it that giving the Central Bank more power makes it less independent? That has not been set out. The Minister of State stated earlier that it would not be appropriate to accept this legislation in advance of the date agreed by the banks, by which time, she told us, they will have simple options in place to reduce the monthly mortgage payments of the hard-pressed households on standard variable rates. She said this as though there were any repercussions for the banks if they do not act by July or as if the Government was insisting on a set target by which to reduce rates when we know there have been no repercussions for the banks. The signs are that there will be no repercussions for the banks and the Government has taken a studied, deliberate and consistent hands-off approach. There are no real reasons not to support this Bill. It is a reaction from a Government that knows it has done nothing for four years and is facing a very angry group of people who are being ripped off every month by banks owned by the Government. If the Government votes against this Bill, it confirms again its inability and unwillingness to take on the banks and to stand up for struggling mortgage holders. It demonstrates again that it has nothing to offer but lip-service for the ripped-off. It did this almost casually this evening. The Government's concern is not worth a single euro or a single cent to any of those struggling mortgage holders. It has nothing but lip-service for the ripped-off mortgage holders and empty, meaningless posturing for the banks, such as calling them in for a chat, to somehow win them over by the force of its argument. That has not achieved anything and the prospects of it achieving anything are minimal. The banks see through the Government. They have it sussed. The people see through it too. It is allowing them to be ripped off. It is as simple as that. Tonight's debate confirms that fact. The Minister of State said that the banks need to act. How is that a convincing argument from a Government that itself refuses to act? Has he thought about the Government's credibility and standing in the eyes of banks that have been obstinate, greedy and totally unappreciative of the rescue afforded to them by hard-pressed citizens and taxpayers or did all of that float over his head? I ask him again to support this Bill in, as he said, the common interest we share for these struggling families, to allow it go to Committee Stage and to allow action after four years of inertia, denial and a disregard for those families.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	552	In respect of the banks, which have caused so much damage to our economy and society, Fine Gael and the Labour Party in particular have talked the talk but have failed miserably to walk the walk. Speaking only last month, the Taoiseach described the refusal by some banks to cut interest rates as a "very serious matter", and said it would not be tolerated. He said: "We are not happy nor is it acceptable that you should have a position that banks are charging mortgages and mortgage holders a much higher rate than they are able to borrow right now." His contribution to this matter is, "We are not happy". Increasingly, the Taoiseach acts as if he is a spectator or a commentator on the major political issues of the day. He is the Taoiseach. He is supposed to be in charge. Recent research from the Central Bank shows that home owners in this State are paying well over the odds for standard variable rates compared to other EU states. The average rate on outstanding standard variable rate mortgages here is 4.24%, compared to an EU median mortgage rate of 2.8%. The interest rate for new mortgages in Ireland, at 4.26%, is the highest of all the states that were analysed. The eurozone average rate is 2.1%, while in Ireland it is 3.42%. The current situation, whereby some mortgage holders are being ripped off while person next door, on a tracker mortgage, is paying the market rate is unacceptable and unsustainable. This is not a normal banking environment.  The banks have created a situation and the Government has tolerated it. For all its protestations, the Government allows it to happen. It is bad for householders, it is bad for families and it is bad for the economy.There is no more pathetic a sight than watching Ministers whinge and whine about the failure of the banks to act fairly and then do nothing about it. Ministers and Government Deputies bleat about the great sacrifices of the Irish people. They praise, laud and applaud the great sacrifices the people have borne but at the same time, they cut child benefit and other social protections for the most vulnerable of our citizens and they have taken on the power to do this. They were not mandated to do it. They also have the power to instruct the banks to act fairly and that is what they were mandated to do. That is the type of positive action the people wanted when they elected them in 2011. They wanted a Government to act in their interests and not that of the banks. That is why they got rid of the other crowd; they were perceived as having created and tolerated the entire mess. The Government's approach of going cap in hand to the bank in regard to mortgage rates has got absolutely nowhere. This Bill is a very reasonable and measured response to the scandal of the very
high standard variable mortgage interest rates in this State, which are causing so much distress. I commend Teachta Pearse Doherty for bringing it forward. For the first time, under this legislation, the Central Bank will be able to set a cap after considering the likely economic and social effects. This is an exceptional Bill for exceptional times. It is not a permanent plan. Competition and other reforms are still needed in the banking sector. We have sought to limit the proposal at this stage to those banks which the citizens bailed out; in other words, the banks that we are supposed to own, the banks that the punters are supposed to own and the banks of which the people are supposed to have ownership.  It is very clear that the current situation, which could be at least rectified to some degree by this Bill, is going to be tolerated by the Government. The Minister for Finance said that the types of measures Sinn Féin proposes in this Bill will be considered in the budget, if they are still needed. If it is good enough to be in the budget, it is good enough to do now. That is what mortgage holders want. Banks have a moral obligation but they are not run on the basis of morality, no more than most politics, but they have to be encouraged and legislated into giving something back to a society and an economy to which they have done so much damage. They need to be forced to end the rip off of hard-pressed mortgage holders. That is what this Bill will do and I urge all Deputies to support it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	553	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for the opportunity to raise this important issue. It goes without saying that we all welcomed the end of milk quotas on 1 April. It provided an opportunity for the dairy industry to expand and reach its undoubted potential, given Ireland's natural advantages in grass production, know-how, technique and climate. This is a new era for production but, unfortunately, a legacy of the old regime has seen quite a number of farmers being badly hit by steep superlevy bills. The total cost to the industry is approximately €69 million, a significant sum that will ultimately come out of the production cycle in the dairy sector. Varying amounts are due to be paid. With the European Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, the Minister has endeavoured to provide a facility whereby the bills can be paid over a three-year period, but I have discovered that the superlevy bills of a number of farmers are such that three years would not be adequate to meet their needs. Many of these farmers are in heavily borrowed situations, having expanded in anticipation of harmonising with the new regime from 1 April, and they now find themselves with exceedingly large bills. I was a Deputy when the milk quota regime was introduced in 1983. Its restrictive impact on the expansion of the dairy industry over that time is known by us all and has been articulated many times in this Chamber. In a European context, the amount of overproduction in Ireland is relatively modest. I do not have the statistics in front of me, but I suspect that other member states are under their production thresholds. There must be a case for revisiting this issue with the Department and then with the Commission, having regard to the serious and profound implications for a sizeable number of dairy farmers across the country. My information is based on the experience of several producers in the north east. They are genuine producers that started on a small scale, expanded rapidly and are now significant enterprises. If the future sustainability of these enterprises is jeopardised by large superlevy bills that must be paid over a relatively short period of 36 months, the issue must be revisited.I exhort the Minister to speak to his former colleague in this House, Commissioner Phil Hogan, to see whether this matter can be revisited in the overall context of some over-production in Ireland and some under-production in other EU member states. There is a very strong case to be made for such an approach. It is certainly worth trying. If the Minister succeeds, he will do a great service to the many farmers who will be seriously adversely affected by an excessively demanding superlevy bill.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	554	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and thereby giving me an opportunity to provide the House with an update on this important issue and clarify a number of aspects of it. The milk quota regime ended on 31 March 2015. The overriding sentiment throughout the country from farmers to processors and along the value chain is that the abolition of the milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector. While it is obviously unwelcome that producers will face a superlevy bill in respect of the final year of the milk quota system, it is unavoidable at this stage. The first thing I would like to clarify in terms of the Deputy's issue as it has been outlined is that revisiting this issue is not possible. The rules governing the imposition of a superlevy were set by regulations agreed at EU level. It is not possible for me to adjust the superlevy rules on a unilateral basis. In the years leading up to quota abolition, I proposed action at EU level on numerous occasions to mitigate the impact of a superlevy. The mechanisms I proposed included an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, a front-loading of quota increases, a reduction in the superlevy or a type of EU flexi-milk arrangement which would have operated as long as overall EU production was within quota. The last of those proposals involves the kind of thing the Deputy has just outlined. In light of the opposition of a significant number of member states, it became clear as we approached the end of the quota era earlier this year that there was no realistic prospect of any agreement on these proposals. I assure the Deputy that we pushed this in an aggressive way at Council of Ministers level to try to achieve what we were seeking. We had a majority of countries supporting us but there was a blocking minority of countries insisting on no change. In the absence of any agreement among member states on my proposals, my focus switched to mitigating the effects of the superlevy by facilitating staged payments by farmers in a year in which cashflow would be of utmost importance due to expansion costs coupled with current market pressures. In this context, I welcomed the agreement of arrangements with the Commission, following consistent requests from Ireland and other member states, to allow member states on a voluntary basis to permit the payment by milk producers of the superlevy liability in three annual instalments without interest. The first instalment must be collected by the milk purchaser in the normal way and paid to my Department before 1 October 2015. The two subsequent payments must be paid by the same date in 2016 and 2017 respectively. I recognise the burden that is being placed on milk suppliers because of the high superlevy levels. For that reason, I have decided to avail of these new voluntary arrangements here in Ireland. Officials in my Department are finalising procedures for the collection of the first instalment before the end of September 2015 and the introduction of a scheme to collect the remaining instalments at the end of September in 2016 and 2017. I expect to announce the details of the scheme in the near future. The Deputy can read for himself the remainder of the answer, which comprises a broad assessment of where the dairy industry is currently at. Of course I recognise that many farmers are under pressure on this issue. It is also true to say that many farmers have already paid a significant portion of the superlevy fine that will apply to them. It has been collected by their co-ops as they have delivered milk over the last 12 months in anticipation of the development of a superlevy problem. Many farmers have paid a significant amount of the superlevy fine already. Others will now be able to plan on the basis of three interest-free instalments over the next three years. They are working with their co-ops to do that in a way that makes sense from a cashflow point of view. Having spoken to those involved in the industry at processor and farming levels, I believe we have made the best of a difficult situation in terms of superlevy pressure.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	555	I thank the Minister for his response but I have to say I am disappointed with it. I note from his script that it is intended to bring in new regulations to cover the three instalment payments. I put it to the Minister, on the basis of the figures I have seen on a number of individual farms in various circumstances, that a three-year period will be simply inadequate for them. I ask him to go back and see if it is possible, at a minimum in the extreme cases, to get a much longer period for these repayments. If he can achieve this, he will do a very good service for a number of progressive, hard-working and expanding dairy farmers in this country. It would be a good day's work for the future of the dairy industry. This problem is not confined to the north east, it is found across the country. While the number of individual cases is not huge, I am aware of people who are concerned that this will push them over the cliff. If that happens, it will do a great disservice to the industry as a whole.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	556	I come from the southern part of County Cork, which is one of the dairy heartlands of the country. I have spoken to many dairy farmers about this issue. We need to be honest about a couple of things here. The superlevy is not a surprise. Farmers knew it was coming. Many farmers factored it in last year in the context of the price they were then being paid for milk. They calculated that they would have to pay some amount of superlevy in the context of their expansion plans. Many farmers who were being paid over 40 cent a litre last year, by the time bonuses are taken into account, factored in a superlevy fine of 28 cent a litre for some of the extra milk they were producing beyond quota. Obviously that is a much more difficult prospect now because milk prices have come back substantially since then. I recognise that. Of course there is an obligation on co-ops to work with dairy farmers who were expanding, investing and factoring in the cost of the superlevy, but are now under some pressure, to ensure they manage their cashflow in a way that makes sense for the repayments they have to make and the superlevy they have to accommodate over time. My understanding is that such arrangements are being reached within co-ops at the moment to ensure those farmers who are encountering difficulties have a plan to work those difficulties out within their co-ops. Rather than telling people what they want to hear, I have to be honest with them. The deal we have now, which was outlined by the Commission and into which countries can buy if they want, involves a three-year interest-free staged payment. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has to pick up the tab for financing that deal so that farmers can actually manage it on an interest-free basis. That goes way beyond what the Commission has ever done before in terms of facilitating a superlevy. I would have liked the Commission to have gone further. It has been suggested that months after this decision was made, we should fundamentally change it now just for Ireland. I do not see that happening without getting a significant number of countries to support it, which I do not think will happen at this late stage. I suggest we should focus on the practicalities that are now facing farmers. They are trying to work through those financial practicalities with their co-ops to make sure nobody goes out of business.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	557	This is an old chestnut: overcrowding on the train service from Dublin to Ballina, Castlebar and Westport. Regularly at weekends there is overcrowding, people are standing and sitting all over the place. It does not seem to be a very safe or satisfactory service for Iarnród Éireann to deliver. The most recent big flare up was at the June bank holiday weekend when many people were travelling to Bloom and other festivals. There was a severe case of overcrowding on the train leaving Heuston Station. Listening to people’s complaints I have to think there must be a better way to manage this. Will the Minister intervene with Iarnród Éireann and ask it to do something about it? It does not seem to consider putting on extra carriages or to factor in online bookings. I am told that many bookings are made online but Iarnród Éireann does not seem to cater for these passengers. It might be possible to provide a bus service for the people at Heuston. Some may be going to Athlone but there are many on the Mayo train, who are elderly and so on. It really is not satisfactory. This may seem to be a small point to bring to the Minister’s attention but it reflects the value placed on the service that the number of the platform for the Ballina-Westport-Castlebar train goes up only ten minutes before the departure time. It is platform No. 7, which is way down the station. There is a stampede down the platform although people could have been notified earlier. Staff have raised this issue. These are practical measures that could be taken to address what has been complained of for forever and a day. From a health and safety point of view people pay to travel on the train but they are not being facilitated. They should be dealt with in some shape or form better than they are now. There is one early bird service from Mayo, through Castlebar. That train ordinarily arrived in Dublin at 8.30 a.m., which was good for people going to meetings or medical appointments and all the other appointments they come to in the city. It has now been pushed back by ten minutes and many people regularly use that train, including those who drive from my town, Ballina, to Castlebar. People find it difficult to make the deadlines they made before. The service has been pushed back to accommodate an express service out of Cork. There is a service every hour from Cork during the working day and into the night whereas there are four trains out of Mayo and back. People feel that they are being treated as second-class citizens, that the focus is on a high-speed train out of Cork and the Mayo train has been pushed back to convenience a further service for Cork. People from Ballina have to drive 25 miles to the early bird train from Castlebar although there is a train station in Ballina that links to the Castlebar station. Why do they not get a service directly from Ballina instead of having to head to Castlebar? They are willing to use the train service. Is it now policy to have unmanned train stations, because this seems to be happening in Castlebar? Do people have to buy tickets from a machine and if there is a problem with the machine and they get on the train, will they be booked for not having a ticket? Is there a facility to buy a ticket on the train? I understand there is only a driver on the train now. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport might address some of these issues in the interests of equity for Mayo passengers.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	558	The provision of rail services is an operational matter for larnród Éireann in conjunction with the National Transport Authority. As the matter had been raised by the Deputy, I contacted the NTA on this matter. The NTA has entered into a public service contract with larnród Éireann for the provision of rail passenger services. The contract specifies the service and capacities to be provided for intercity, commuter and DART services. Intercity services generally operate over regional distances, while commuter services serve commuter belt areas with a greater stopping frequency. There are key stations on the rail network where passengers are able to avail of either an intercity or commuter rail service. larnród Éireann continually manages the capacity of its services on both a short-term and a long-term basis to ensure it provides the optimum capacity on all its services through the timetable for the company's customers. Earlier this year, there was significant pressure on capacity on Friday evening services from Dublin to Westport in particular, and the company responded by increasing the seating capacity by 200 seats on Friday through adding extra carriages on the 17.10 Friday service only. This service alone now provides in excess of 300 additional seats for Westport line customers on a Friday and on the 18.15 Heuston to Westport service on Fridays. The company therefore maximises available capacity on Fridays, including public holiday Fridays. However, there can be occasions when there is demand in excess of seating capacity, and the company regrets any inconvenience this causes for customers. All trains are designed to accommodate standing safely and are certified to do so by the Railway Safety Commission, RSC. In urban rail services internationally, including Ireland, full loading is the norm at peak times. However, it is accepted by larnród Éireann that it is desirable from a comfort point of view that those travelling longer distances outside the commuter area should have a seat for their journey. Furthermore, some intercity services also serve commuter stops, serving a dual commuter and intercity purpose. For example, the 17.10 Heuston to Westport service on Fridays serves Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin and Portarlington, among others, and the 18.15 service has high demand from Tullamore and Athlone daily commuters. Pressure on capacity eases significantly after commuter customers alight at these stations. The NTA will continue to monitor and review the loadings on rail services through the Dublin commuter belt with a view to identifying whether service adjustments are necessary to achieve a more balanced passenger distribution across the various services. In particular, a review of the last annual rail census will inform the adequacy of the current train set configuration in relation to passenger loadings on the network. The NTA is undertaking a review of its public service contract with larnród Éireann. As part of this review, the performance regime is to be reviewed and consideration given to the feasibility of including specific passenger capacity targets that limit the number and frequency of passengers standing on the network.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	559	What I described to the Minister goes beyond the item set out as a Topical Issue matter. The service does not compare with the Cork service.I understand all passenger services are subsidised. People in County Mayo are entitled to have an early bird service arrive in Heuston Station at the scheduled time in order that they can conduct business in Dublin. They should not be delayed because their train is required to make way for a new train service from Cork, which is already well serviced. The general attitude appears to be that certain services are secondary.  In some circumstances, passengers must stand on a train for the three or three and a half hour journey to County Mayo. The problem is not confined to commuter areas. While there is pandemonium until commuters disembark, people still cannot secure seats further west than the commuter towns on the route. Iarnród Éireann should address the problem in a better fashion. If the company does not have sufficient capacity, it should be able to deal with passengers turning up to board a train rather than loading them on like cattle.  Will the Minister ask Iarnród Éireann to explain the reason it cannot schedule the early bird Cork train, rather than the Mayo train, to arrive ten minutes later? I do not know of any good reason not to do so, other than that the company intends to provide a premium service to one area and not to another area.  Is Iarnród Éireann pursuing a new policy of leaving stations unmanned? This problem is occurring in Castlebar. What happens when people who are unable to use ticket machines at a station board a train and are found not to have a ticket?  I ask for equity in the train service to County Mayo as I do not wish to raise these issues again and again.

On the knock-on effects of changes in the Cork service and the early service from County Mayo, as the Deputy will be aware, I do not determine the arrival times of particular train services. This is a matter for Iarnród Éireann to decide and it does so in response to demand. However, I will refer the matter raised by the Deputy to the company. I accept that when trains arrive later than 9 a.m., it affects the ability of passengers to attend meetings or arrive at work on time. I will ask Iarnród Éireann to respond to the Deputy on the point she raises in this regard.  There has not been a change in Iarnród Éireann's policy on the manning of train stations. When it is appropriate and feasible the company's preference is always to have personnel present at train stations. If the Deputy has information to indicate a recent change in the manning of a station in her constituency, I will refer it to Iarnród Éireann, with a view to obtaining some clarity on the matter for her.

As the Minister will be aware, NoWDOC has provided out-of-hours general practitioner, GP, services in County Donegal since 2001. Two years ago, when the out-of-hours service was threatened with closure, Caredoc started to provide GP out-of-hour services, while Nowdoc continued to provide the Health Service Executive back-up service for the out-of-hours service. In recent weeks, Caredoc has proposed changes to the service, under which two of the current three centres would close for what is known as the "red eye shift", which extends from midnight until 9 a.m. The doctors in question would then be redeployed to a centre in Letterkenny, which would cover an area stretching from Gweebarra Bridge to Malin Head, which is probably larger than most counties. This has created serious concerns about the level of service that will be available to people in the relevant areas, especially west Donegal and the Inishowen Peninsula, and how the service will be managed. Caredoc has claimed the changes are being made because an insufficient number of doctors is available to cover the so-called red eye shift. I believe the proposal is a cost-saving measure aimed at reducing the overheads in running the service. NoWDOC's call-out ratio and service indicators are very good and it provides a service in a timely fashion to those who urgently need care. People are concerned that this excellent out-of-hours general practitioner service will be undermined and further reduced in future.

However, users are now confident in and happy with the service. Any proposal to change the delivery of a health service causes considerable concern and anxiety among its users. Three general practitioners currently provide an out-of-hours service in the region, one each in Carndonagh, Letterkenny and Derrybeg, respectively. It has been proposed to reduce the number of GPs operating the service to two and base both in Letterkenny. As a general practitioner, the Minister will be aware that when someone is struck with a serious illness between midnight and 8 a.m., time is of the essence. Deputies Thomas Pringle, Pearse Doherty and I all live about one hour's drive from Letterkenny hospital. Moreover, there are inhabited islands off the coast of Donegal. Tory Island has a population of 200 and Arranmore has a population of approximately 600. There is no doubt, therefore, that if the proposed changes are implemented, the level of service in County Donegal will be reduced.  Deputies Pringle, Doherty and I all attended a public meeting last Monday night. All those in attendance were apprehensive and concerned. It was significant that the four general practitioners present did not express confidence in the proposed new service. As the specialists working at the coalface, their views should be taken into consideration before any changes are made to the service.

The Minister should not lose sight of the significance of Deputies McGinley and Pringle as well as myself speaking with one voice on this issue, as it is rare that this occurs in the House. This issue goes to the core of services to rural communities. Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked me to express his support for the position the two previous speakers and I are taking on this matter, which affects west County Donegal and the Inishowen Peninsula. Under the current proposal, Derrybeg and Carndonagh will lose a permanent general practitioner service from midnight until 9 a.m. in two phases. In the first phase, the service will be lost from Sunday until Thursday, while in the second, which would be implemented in the summer, the service would be lost completely.  This issue goes to the core of the type of service people want to maintain in their area. They do not want the current service to be diminished as it would result in many people waiting for 45 minutes for a doctor to arrive. The Minister has visited west Donegal. In winter months, the main road to the area is frequently closed due to frost and so forth. People in the area do not want to take risks.  The out-of-hours general practitioner service also serves island communities. I wrote to the Minister and chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive in February welcoming an intervention of the HSE in appointing an interlocutor to negotiate between Caredoc, the HSE and general practitioners on the unfolding crisis in the out-of-hours service. The problem is that Caredoc was about to withdraw from the out-of-hours service in February.GPs say one of the big problems is that the HSE removed the financial support that was there to fund these doctors during the red-eye shift about five years ago. Caredoc is losing a huge amount of money as a result of this and, therefore, wants to reduce the number of doctors from three to two. It will have its own version of the story. I have been dealing with this since 2011 and raised it umpteen times in the Chamber. I want to say go mbeidh sé inglactha ag pobal na Gaeltachta agus pobal Inis Eoghain má théann sé seo ar aghaidh. Beidh go leor daoine agus go leor agóidí le feiceáil ar na sráideanna má théann sé ar aghaidh. Tá súil agam go n-éisteoidh an tAire. I hope the Minister listens to the concerns of the public and does not wash his hands of the matter by saying it is an issue for the HSE. This is an issue concerning services to rural areas. I could tell the Minister stories about lives that were saved as a result of the NoWDOC service being very close to the individuals involved. I hope a solution can be found to this problem.

I am taking the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is on Government business elsewhere. The NoWDOC GP out-of-hours service is a partnership arrangement between the GPs affiliated with the NowDoc service and the HSE. The service provides out-of-hours GP care to patients in the north-west catchment area. In November 2013, the GPs engaged with Caredoc Ltd. to manage the GP out-of-hours services in Donegal, south Leitrim and north Roscommon on their behalf. The HSE entered into discussion with Caredoc and the GPs regarding a formal service arrangement in November 2014. A number of issues were discussed to facilitate the development of a sustainable and efficient service into the future. These included further development of the clinical governance structures, ICT development, liaison and monitoring arrangements, GP deployment arrangements and funding. An independent facilitator was put in place in early 2015 with a view to having a memorandum of agreement signed by the parties by the end of May 2015. It was also agreed that the issues of GP deployment and funding could only be addressed through a comprehensive review of the current call activity and GP resources. The Caredoc GP clinical lead reviewed the available data and in recent weeks and the HSE has validated this to ensure that call activity data is accurate for the agreed review period and reflects the predicted call activity levels. The completed review indicates that there are few calls after midnight on the red-eye shift and that the current level of GP resources allocated to this period could be safely reduced while maintaining the service response times in line with the current performance standards and well within the response time standards of the Royal College of General Practitioners. The review also indicates that the red-eye GP resource in Carrick-on-Shannon and Mountcharles would remain as per the current arrangements, with the potential to reduce the duty GPs in the north Donegal area by one during the red-eye period. This measure is also being considered in the context of providing GP cover arrangements that are sustainable into the future and to assist in addressing difficulties that currently exist in recruiting sufficiently qualified and vocationally trained GPs to cover red-eye shifts. The possibility of having such a reduction implemented over two phases has also been considered to allow phase 1 to be analysed in detail before proceeding to phase 2. The arrangements for phase 1 would see a reduction in cover for the five weekday nights only, as these are not as busy. Following the review, the GPs and Caredoc have indicated their intention to submit a formal recommendation regarding GP deployment in the out-of-hours service. As part of the consultation process with stakeholders, the HSE, the GP clinical lead and Caredoc personnel met with Oireachtas Members and Donegal County Council members of the Western Health Forum last Friday to discuss the review process and possible outcomes. The HSE, GPs and Caredoc continued their discussions today. All parties will now reflect on the contributions from elected representatives to ensure that agreement can be reached on service delivery arrangements so that services continue to be provided in a safe and efficient manner. All services will remain as per the current arrangements until this process is concluded.

The one thing that was missing from the reply was that while we met with Caredoc and NoWDOC last Friday to discuss the service, there was no consultation with any service user on the changes that are taking place. It is outrageous that health services would envisage such a major change that changes the whole structure and functioning of this GP out-of-hours service without that consultation. The GPs have a contract to provide an out-of-hours service to their clients in a certain way, but they do not bother to consult with them in relation to it. The service must be maintained as it is. The Minister refers to the call-out figures. If one looks at the numbers, it may not justify it, but what value are we going to put on the fact that one person could be saved? I have never had an accident driving my car, but it does not mean I stop wearing my seat belt. The service must be provided and security must be provided to the community. This must be figured into the consultation process that is taking place. I am sad to say it is lacking from the consultation so far. The service must be maintained, as must the confidence of the public in Donegal.

There was very little consultation with users, public representatives or others. Even members of the health forum, on which five Donegal members sit, were not aware of the changes being proposed. Does the Minister agree that the delivery of a health service affects and concerns everyone and that there should be far more consultation? I would like to get the Minister's view of the fact that there will be a serious reduction in the level and quality of service if this goes ahead. Deputy Doherty has already said that NoWDOC has saved lives. Deputy Doherty and I know that, unfortunately, people from our own area have passed away on the way to Letterkenny. All of these things must be taken into consideration. While the Minister says discussions and negotiations are continuing, I hope the views of the Members here, the people we met last Monday and of people in general and, in particular, of the GPs will not be overlooked when the final decision is arrived at.

With no disrespect to those who were present at the meeting, it was a box-ticking exercise. The reason the meeting took place was that Deputy Pringle and I, among others, including the public, were raising concerns in the media for a number of weeks in relation to NoWDOC. We had a structured, normal quarterly meeting with the HSE at which this item was on the agenda. We were then told this was part of the consultation. Does the Minister know that in 2011 NoWDOC made the very same proposal to the HSE? The HSE then appointed a three-person panel to review the safety of the proposal and that panel rejected it on safety grounds. I got a letter from the HSE saying that when the GPs agreed their proposal with Caredoc, it would be independently assessed on a health basis. I asked the acting HSE manager who would carry out the review and was told that the meeting on Friday with us, the elected representatives, was part of that independent assessment. How the hell can I as a public representative assess the safety of reducing the NoWDOC service from three doctors to two? There are two things I ask the Minister to do. First, I ask him to clarify whether the HSE is providing any funds to fund GP cover out of hours anywhere in the country. Second, I ask the Minister to ensure that an independent safety audit is done in relation to the NoWDOC proposal outside of the GPs, the clinical lead, Caredoc, and the HSE, who have been involved in that tripartite discussion since February.

I understand that there is always anxiety when there is any change to health services, even where the change is for the better or results in a higher quality service. The HSE provides funding for out-of-hours services all over the country.

I am familiar with the NoWDOC service, having spent an evening providing it when I did my undergraduate GP training in Carndonagh a long time ago. It is a very good service. It is important to bear in mind that GPs are a scarce resource and their time must be used efficiently. It does not make sense to have a GP up all night seeing one or two patients when the next day there is no one to see the 12 or 15 patients he or she would have seen had he or she been rostered during the day instead. It is particularly difficult to get actual qualified GPs, vocationally trained GPs, to cover the red-eye shift. What happens instead all over the country is that people who are not fully qualified GPs, who are other types of doctor, fill in at night time and that is a quality issue as well which needs to be borne in mind. It is better to have one or two properly qualified GPs providing a service than to have three who are not actually GPs but are doctors without a general practitioner qualification. Of course this is ultimately a local matter and has to be resolved by agreement of KDOC, the GPs in Donegal and the HSE locally. It is not a decision that is subject to ministerial approval, sign-off or a veto.
