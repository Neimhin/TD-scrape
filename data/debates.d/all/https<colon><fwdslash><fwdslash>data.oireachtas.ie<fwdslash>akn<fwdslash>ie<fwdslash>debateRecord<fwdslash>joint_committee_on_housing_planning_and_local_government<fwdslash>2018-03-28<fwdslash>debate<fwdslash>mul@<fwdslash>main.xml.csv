Deputy Mick Barry is substituting for Deputy Ruth Coppinger. I propose that we go into private session to deal with a couple of housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1	At the request of the broadcasting and recording services, members and visitors in the Public Gallery are requested to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile telephones are turned off completely or switched to airplane, safe or flight mode, depending on their device. It is not sufficient to put their phones on silent mode as this will maintain the level of interference with the broadcasting system. No. 5 is resumed detailed scrutiny of the Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016. I remind members we will have two sessions today. In our first session we will resume scrutiny of the Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016. I welcome to our meeting Mr. Roger Harrington and Mr. Conall O'Connor from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Dr. Anne Marie Mahon and Dr. Róisín Nash from Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, and Dr. Kevin Lynch from the National University of Ireland Galway. Before we begin I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee. If, however, they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Witnesses will have four minutes to make their opening statements. I invite Mr. Harrington to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting the Department here today to contribute to these discussions. As the committee will be aware, marine litter is a persistent problem affecting all regions of the world which needs to be urgently addressed. Plastic, in all its forms, is a particular problem. Due to its buoyancy, it can easily be carried by currents or blown by winds from land or seaborne sources. It persists in the environment for an extremely long time. It breaks down into secondary microplastic particles and there is now a growing body of strong evidence that plastics and microplastics are impacting on marine fauna. As well as being created by the breakdown of larger items, microplastics are also entering the marine environment directly in a wide variety of forms, such as fibres and lost raw material pellets or through tyre wear. Some marine microplastic litter is also caused by microbeads used in cosmetics, cleansing products and detergents. A legal prohibition on microbeads has been the subject of two recent Private Members' Bills in the Oireachtas and in these debates the Department committed to drawing up legislation on this issue. I know that members of this committee are passionate about the marine environment and all issues connected with it as evidenced by the contributions made to those recent Oireachtas debates. As with many areas of the public service, the Department has faced very considerable challenges across all of its areas of operation in meeting its critical business objectives and priorities with limited levels of human resources. Addressing the prohibition of microbeads through primary legislation is a policy priority for this Department, but staff resource issues coupled with a wide variety of other urgent marine environmental policy demands has meant that progress has been slower than anticipated. As well as overseeing the implementation of the marine strategy framework directive monitoring programme and programme of measures and the general implementation of the OSPAR Convention, Ireland has a lead role in a number of actions under the OSPAR Convention regional action plan to address marine litter. These include developing regulatory and economic recommendations for measures to reduce the impact of single-use items on the marine environment; identifying marine litter hotspots in the north-east Atlantic; examining wastewater and storm water as pathways for marine litter, including microlitter; and developing measures to reduce the impact of expandable polystyrene in marine and coastal environments. The Department is the lead Irish partner on the OCEANWISE INTERREG programme to reduce the impact of expandable polystyrene as marine litter. We commission, support and are involved in the oversight of an array of monitoring and research programmes related to marine litter. We are also working to develop an integrated national approach to the marine litter problem with other Departments and State agencies and are working to develop a number of measures with key stakeholders. The Department is supporting a wide range of awareness-raising and citizen activation measures such as An Taisce's world-leading clean coast range of programmes and the green schools global citizenship marine environment programme and we are working to incorporate marine litter awareness into mainstream anti-litter programmes. However, it must be remembered that marine litter represents just one aspect of our marine environmental work. For example, we need to make progress on developing environmental spatial protection measures such as marine protected areas and also need to commence preparatory work for cycle two of the implementation of the marine strategy framework directive, MSFD, such as revising our initial assessment of the environmental status of the maritime area including targets and indicators. However, I am pleased to inform the committee that additional staff resources have now been made available and will be employed shortly on a full-time basis on marine environmental legislation with the legislation on microbeads prohibition being the priority item. Proposals to prohibit the sale and manufacture of certain products containing plastic microbeads are included in our 2018 legislative programme and a memorandum to Government will issue within a month seeking permission to draw up heads of a Bill. It is expected that the heads will be published by the summer. The Bill will be put to the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity thereafter. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has indicated that he wants to see the Bill become law this year. However, this may require choices as to which legislation is prioritised. I should point out that the Department has done some work on this issue. In February 2017, the Department launched an online public consultation process on the proposed legislative ban. We received more than 3,000 responses. The volume and diversity of responses demonstrates the concern of civil society and stakeholders and these submissions are now informing our policy and legislative development. In relation to the Prohibition of Micro Plastics Bill 2016, our primary concern is that the legislation which will be required is technically more complex and challenging than is drafted in this legislation. As an example, as well as ensuring we have robust and future-proofed definitions of microbeads and plastic, we have to work out how the prohibition can be enforced, who will enforce it and what staffing and financial resources will be required to do so. We are very concerned about the confusion between microbeads and microplastics in this proposed legislation as microbeads are only a small subset of microplastics. As has been highlighted in previous Oireachtas debates, a national prohibition of products containing microbeads will have implications for the principle of free movement under the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. European Commission approval will be required to obtain derogation from Single Market rules. We are working on the development of a robust justification for our proposed national ban, which will have to be evidence-based in tandem with the development of the legislation. In January, the EU plastics strategy was announced and it proposes an EU wide ban on microbeads and other problematic plastic products under REACH regulations. REACH is an EU regulation, adopted to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals. REACH applies to all chemical substances and places responsibility on industry to manage the risks from chemicals, to provide information on the properties of their products and to register this information in a central database. However, this ban may not come into effect for several years. We will continue to work with the Commission on this issue but will do this in tandem with progressing our own national legislation. However, to keep this in context, addressing microbeads is only one small aspect of the overall marine litter problem. Also, while it is a priority, marine litter is only one of many categories we must address under the marine strategy framework directive and the OSPAR Convention. These include pollution and contaminants, biodiversity and habitat loss and a wide range of other potential threats to the sustainability of our seas. In conclusion, the Department is fully committed to addressing the issue and we look forward to the advancement of microbeads legislation within the timeframe that I have outlined.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	3	I thank Mr. Harrington. I now invite Dr. Anne Marie Mahon to make her opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	Today, I am just going to talk about microbeads in the context of plastic litter. It is a big problem. The G7 summit in 2015 highlighted that this is a global challenge directly affecting marine ecosystems and potentially human health. We are all familiar with the sight of littered beaches. Let us look at microplastics in the context of marine litter. They are small fragments of less than 5 mm and greater than 1 µm and by weight, in some of the most polluted areas of the oceans 25% of the total mass of plastics are microplastics.It sounds like it is a lesser problem. However, the number of particles microplastics produce by comparison with macroplastics is much greater, as can be seen from the circulated graph. This is significant because of the size of the microplastics. They absorb, release and interact with pollutants that already exist in the environment much more than larger plastic particles because of the large surface-volume ratio. Also, they release other chemicals that are inherent to microplastics, be they the monomers that make up the polymer or the additives themselves. I have circulated among members a graph showing the pathway of microplastics, or plastic litter, in time. As time progresses, the litter breaks down into smaller particles. As it does so, there is an increase in the ability of these particles to absorb and interact with organic contaminants. There is also an increase in the bioavailability of microplastics. I refer to how many compartments of the environment they can penetrate and how many organisms they can penetrate. Going down into the nanometre scale - there is, of course, a continuum - it is a matter of how many compartments of each organism can be penetrated. Can it penetrate the circulatory system? Can it penetrate a cell? These are very different in terms of impact. Let me refer to the types of microplastics. Litter, such as the litter at beaches, breaks down into fragments. There are plastics generated by machining by industry. It could be a medical devices industry, a recycling industry or another. Such an industry produces a lot of microplastic litter. Synthetic fibres in our clothing are microplastics and they produce over 2,000 per wash. This is a big input. Astroturf pitches and roads are giving off fragments. We are doing some work on this at present to determine the output. The construction industry demands a lot of plastics. There are many different plastics for insulation and piping. This is a more diffuse source but, most likely, a large contributor. The more primary types of microplastics are the microbeads. Some estimates suggest that 2% to 3% of the total microplastic loading would be due to microplastic beads. It is difficult to say. Also to be considered are the nurdles that are used for microplastics to convert into other plastic products. What have we been finding in the environment? We have not been finding a lot of microbeads. We are mostly finding fibres. We are finding fragments. The graph on this subject indicates, by way of grey dots, that in our first study we found 96% fibres and 0.2% microbeads. Another large study, outlined in the slide with the red triangle, shows a figure for microbeads or spheres of 4%. Another study, which examined the stomachs of fish, found no microbeads at all. However, there are some freshwater studies that show more microbeads. I refer to the Rhine and the Manchester basin. It might be that microbeads are more concentrated in freshwater environments near high-urbanisation zones. Most of the microbeads are plastics and are channelled through the wastewater treatment system. We find that most microplastics end up in the sludge, but some of the lighter ones go out into the receiving waters. We know of some impacts on biota, especially in laboratory-based trials. A range of different polymers make up microbeads. Some are more toxic and hazardous than others. There is a large size range. Included are bulking agents and glitters, which do not sound so necessary in many cases. I have an example of some microbeads from a toothpaste for children aged up to two. I will pass it around to members so they may all see what it is. There are up to 95,000 particles in one tube of the toothpaste. Microbeads are in personal care products and detergents. These contribute 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes of microplastics per year. Paints, coatings and abrasives contribute 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes per year. This shows the volume produced by personal care products by comparison with more industrial sources. There are alternatives. Some companies are already using alternatives to microbeads to show they are not always completely necessary.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	I thank the committee for the invitation. I am here today representing both myself and Dr. Audrey Morley. Unlike Ms Mahon, we are not experts on microbeads. I am a coastal geomorphologist and Ms Morley is a climate scientist. Our interest in this is that we have had a number of MSc projects on this topic over recent years. This is based on interest among our students and a more general interest in microplastics and in understanding that pollution is a problem. When we began to examine this problem, we obviously read the literature to determine whether there was anything of note in an Irish context. Our first study was in 2015. Prior to 2014, there was really no published work on the Irish coastal waters or coast in this area. From that point on, Dr. Amy Lusher, Dr. Mahon and the team in GMIT have published quite a bit of work on microplastics in the water column and in the stomachs of fish and seabirds. There was nothing in some of the fauna that could potentially eat these. I refer also to the shellfish. It was very obvious that this was a problem internationally. There is a lot of evidence that it is a problem internationally so we wanted to see whether it was a problem in Ireland. Around 2015, a UN Commissioner responsible for food was visiting. We brought her to a beach in Renvyle in County Galway to carry out an ecological survey. When we were there, the level of pollution on the beach was very obvious. As we were walking we said the sand looked interesting. When we bent down and picked up some of it, we noted it was not actually sand but 100% microplastics. Therefore, the sand on the beach is composed entirely of microplastics. The students were very interested in moving into this area. We were happy to supervise their projects. The rest of my presentation is really an exposition of their work. Mr. Jake Martin and Dr. Audrey Morley worked on a project in which they examined marine sediment. On one of the cruises on the Celtic Voyager, they collected box cores, which are short cores of the sediments on the seabed, to investigate whether they could find any microplastics there. Members will see from the map on the slide the location from where the samples were taken. Dr. Amy Lusher from GMIT developed a set of protocols based on international best practice on how to identify microplastics.These are just a few examples of what Mr. Jake Martin found. Essentially one has to look under a microscope and identify every individual microplastic in a particular sample.  The images on the slide on display are a representation of the box cores he collected. The little blue ones at the top are the water column, and then one can see the sediments. What the team found was that there were microplastics throughout the sediments down to a certain depth, which correlated quite closely to the initial production of microplastics in the 1950s and onwards. As there is a certain amount of mixing in the surface layers due to trawling and ocean processes, the exact dates cannot be identified. From this it can be seen that microplastics are in the sediment and in the water column. The quantities in this area are in single figures for the most part; such as eight, nine, ten or 11 or that sort of quantity.  The type of microplastics was also looked at. The most common types are fibres and fragments. These are essentially secondary plastics from the breakdown but they might also be primary microplastics, such as for example microbeads. That is just a broad idea of what Martin et al. found.  As part of a separate project this year, Christine Loughlin and Audrey Morley went out and surveyed the same areas to check for the robustness of this particular methodology and found statistically similar results. That was really a check on the earlier work. The earlier work was also published in Nature magazine, which is one of the highest impact magazines in the area. It has been peer reviewed.  As the sediments and the water column both have microplastics one might expect that fauna in these areas would ingest them, either accidentally by mistaking them for food or, if filter feeders, they might suck water out of the water column and ingest whatever happens to be in that water. They cannot differentiate between plastic and non-plastic. The next couple of projects were designed to directly sample some of the fauna. This slide shows a Dublin Bay prawn. Sonny and Morley had a look at these creatures, and took samples from the fishermen who caught them. I should point out that Dublin Bay prawns are also present in Galway, off the Aran Islands, and these samples came from areas that were similar to those from where Mr. Jake Martin took his sediment samples. Microplastics were found to be present and a percentage of each type of microplastic was identified in each individual sample. Fibres again were by far the most prevalent. For some reason there was a variation through time, and so it was not quite a straightforward process. The earlier study I mentioned was also carried out off the coast of Iceland as part of this study and considered many more variables, including the ocean current, the sedimentology of the substrate, the presence of vegetation etc. to see which variable impacted the deposition of the microplastics from the water column. There are many variables involved.  The message to take away is that they are present in the nephrops. In terms of the depuration process, the microplastics are found in the intestinal tract, which is normally not eaten, so for this particular species that perhaps is not a serious problem. However, there may be problems caused by toxins going into the muscle fibres of the nephrops themselves.  The next study considers blue mussels, which are eaten whole in that anything within the shell is eaten. This study was carried out in inner Galway Bay. The sample sites are shown on the slide. It was carried out close to Mutton Island, which is a wastewater facility and treatment outlet, as well as further along the coast in a special area of conservation, SAC, in Rusheen Bay. In 20 samples - which does not show up particularly well in these slides, which are screen grabs from the identification process - the plastic can clearly be seen when examined under the microscope. Going by the protocols, the number of plastics can be identified. To validate this information would require more work in infrared spectrophotometry, which costs a lot of money and so is not available to our students. It was not carried out in this case but is something that would need to be done at a later stage. Many microplastics were found in the 20 samples. There were over 5,000 individual microplastics identified by Ms Joanne Casserly in the 20 samples from this area. That could be a very serious issue, and perhaps the Food Safety Authority should look further into that. It could be a problem, and we would be concerned about that. I should have mentioned that the samples were also composed from off-the-shelf mussels. They were available for sale; Ms Joanne Casserly went to a shop and bought them. The wild stocks actually had more microplastics per gram because they are smaller individuals than the farmed stocks.  In summary, the evidence I have presented here suggests this could be a serious problem in our marine environment and should be looked at. It is likely to pose a risk to human health and habitat quality, based on international research and evidence at an international level. The evidence strongly suggests that we should be trying to reduce microplastics entering the environment. We support the Bill, notwithstanding some of the issues Mr. Harrington pointed out earlier regarding the terminology used to describe beads and microplastics. 
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	6	It is my Bill and I have many questions but I am conscious that I am a guest of the committee.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	We are a very relaxed committee.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	I thank the members. I thank the officials and the academics for their attendance today because I believe that having this opportunity to interact with them is a crucial part of the legislative process. I view it as a free tutorial, for which I am very grateful. I also thank the Chair and the members of the committee for facilitating the discussion this morning. The key point that emerges from the evidence before us is that there is no doubt but that there is clear evidence of the presence of microfibres and microbeads in sea life and on land, having been washed ashore. The witnesses have presented clear evidence of that today. The Dublin Bay prawn presented is a very distinct piece of evidence to that effect. I believe this makes the legislation all the more worthwhile in that sense.  I appreciate the point being made about the legislation I have introduced. It deals specifically with microbeads that, according to the presentation, represent a small fraction in sea life and flora and fauna. However, my Bill is a first or a second cut. This is an iterative process and I am not tied to the fact that it should deal only with microbeads. I am quite happy for it to be amended in any way to reflect the realities of the science presented before us. If that means dealing with microfibres or any other particles present that fall into the general microplastic group, then I have no qualms about that whatsoever. The key thing is that we are at a juncture where we are acknowledging there is a need to legislate on this issue. It needs to be done post-haste.  My first question is to the officials, namely, Mr. Harrington and Mr. O'Connor. They mentioned that the heads of a Bill will come before us or that a Bill is being worked on. Can they be more specific on when that Government Bill will come before the House?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	Yes, I can give the Deputy a sense of that. To recap on the remarks I made, my unit recently has been given two additional posts. They are being appointed to marine environmental legislation with a focus on prioritising work on microbeads legislation. The first of those resources will be arriving next week and it is aimed to have the second one within another five to six weeks. They will be specifically employed on this particular legislation. I aim to go to Cabinet within a month to seek approval to commence this work. I hope that by the summer, we will have drawn up the heads of a Bill which will outline further our approach and our thinking in respect of this legislation.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	I appreciate that and that is clear evidence of action by the Government in this regard. While this not a remark directed at the officials per se but is more a political statement, I must state that this legislation has been in gestation since 2016. I had hoped we would be further along the line at this stage because I have always expressed my willingness to withdraw my Bill were more robust legislation to come along. This is a non-partisan and a non-political issue. I want to take a bipartisan approach to this matter. I still feel the need to ensure my legislation is kept on the books until such time as I see evidence from the Government as to the seriousness of its intentions. That is notwithstanding the additional resources which have been allocated to this.  I refer back to the originator of the legislation, who is Senator Grace O'Sullivan. We are only taking up the cudgel on this. However, we do need to see this Government legislation sooner rather than later. I welcome the fact that Mr. Harrington is seeking permission within a month to draw up heads of a Bill. I am anxious that the clock might tick down on the lifetime of the Government or that its mandate may expire. It is a Private Members' Bill. I am conscious that if Mr. Harrington is talking about the summer months for this, it then will not be long until we are into the autumn and then into 2019. We do not know what is going to happen then. As I understand it, my Private Members' Bill falls on the ending of that mandate.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	11	If I can comment on the Deputy's remarks, yes this has been ongoing. The Deputy is absolutely right. Resources have been sought internally within the Department on a number of occasions to progress this in a more timely fashion. I need, however, to give the committee today a rounded picture of the work we undertake. It is also included in the briefing note that we supplied to the committee. I refer to other important work ongoing in the marine environment space. We work closely on other research projects with organisations such as An Taisce. That is important work in respect of raising awareness. I would like to reflect on that. While this legislation is not where we all would have hoped it would be, it is not that no work is being done in this particular area. On the timescale issue, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has said he would like to see this legislation become law this year.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	In 2018?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	He is alive to the fact that we may have to make choices in priorities around legislation but that is clearly his intention in this regard.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	I appreciate those comments. I recognise Mr. Harrington is speaking for the Minister here. However, we will have an opportunity to talk to the Minister directly about this as well and kick the tyres on his commitments. I will return briefly to the science again, just for a moment. The scientific rigour that has been applied here shows us that the research in an Irish context is nascent in the grand narrative of things. It is from 2014 I think. I acknowledge the witnesses probably have all been working in this area prior to this. Can I get a sense from the witnesses as to where the Legislature needs to go on this issue? That is pulling them from the realm of pure academic research into the realm of politics. I am directing this at Dr. Nash. If she was designing legislation or a response to the scourge of microplastics and microbeads, this plastic pollution that is killing our flora and fauna and being ingested by human beings, where would she go, where would she start or what would she do? It is a tough one but I just want to get the perspectives of the witnesses on it because I think it is vital.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	My perspective is that we have seen much of the Irish research that is going on. We are also involved in EU projects like BASEMAN. We are only now developing methodologies to standardise sampling microplastics in order that the studies can be compared. I am looking at it from a larger perspective. If we go with the legislation as is, we are missing the point in one sense. I will use an analogy. Everyone here has been at a GAA match. The legislation is focusing on the umpire on the sideline as opposed to what is actually happening in the game. It is such a small part. It is important and I do not disregard it. We could go home and everybody will recognise a microbead and everybody knows that it is bad. However, by focusing our legislation on that, we are missing a huge element of the issue. We need to have more evidence. A lot of research is coming on board and within the next 12 months, we definitely will have a huge amount more that we can put towards the legislation. We do not know, with confidence, where to identify all the sources, their quantities, the locations of the hotspots or how we can mitigate against it. If we put in this legislation, we will miss a lot of mitigation that essentially could stop it down the line. We just recently have-----
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	Forgive me, does that mean more time is needed to design the legislation? If the legislation is to be designed in a robust way, does it need a stronger scientific and research basis? Is Dr. Nash stating that industry needs to be involved because the generators of these plastics need to be involved? Is she talking about a more holistic approach?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	I think so. Looking at the evidence that has been supplied here on the fragments and the potential sources, if we focus only on microbeads, we will be missing a whole element that will feed into it. I know a lot of effort goes into these Bills and getting them forward and it is definitely going in the right direction. However, I think we need it to be a little bit more all-encompassing and more robust going forward.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	Just-----

#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	21	-----so I understand where the witness is coming from. I was very happy with the umpire, the referee and the outcome. Normally, we ask all our questions, then go back to the witness and then go back to the Deputy. I have been flexible because it is Deputy Sherlock's Bill and he is more informed on a lot of the questions and how to ask them. Is Dr. Nash saying that the Bill, as it stands, is too narrow?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	22	Yes.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	23	However, Deputy Sherlock has said that he awaits the Government heads of Bill and is happy to encompass his within that. Is Dr. Nash saying that it is too narrow as it stands and we need to include more within that?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	To be helpful, I recognise that Dr. Nash is saying that it is too narrow and that microbeads, based on the evidence put forward from Nephrops norvegicus, were only something like 2% of the content and 75% was microfibres. That makes the legislative proposal before us here quite narrow.We could legislate for microbeads, but the point is we need legislation with much broader scope because, based on the evidence before us, microbeads only represent a portion of the plastics used. In that sense, the legislation is quite narrow.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	25	Absolutely. We might also consider marine debris which is made up of larger objects that end up as microplastics. There is a huge amount of research that has not yet been published. Studies of seabed integrity are under way. They are looking at the invertebrate animals that live in the seabed to see if they are affected. One such study is ongoing in trawls. We have found microplastics in several spider crabs, or normal harbour crabs. A lot of information to be released in the next eight months will make the case a lot more robust.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	As I am conscious of time and the format being used, I am happy to stop and come back in at the end of the process, with the Chairman's permission.
#GraceOSullivan	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-party	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-dob	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	I thank the delegates for their presentations. What concerns me listening to Dr. Mahon is not only the issue of microbeads and microplastics but also the releasing of contaminants. We are not just talking about a marine littoral problem. We are also talking about pollution, contaminants, the impact on biodiversity, habitats lost and the effect on the sustainability of the seas. Without a doubt, this is a serious problem. In 2016 I introduced legislation to deal with microbeads and microplastics and start building an awareness of this issue. Two years on there is no legislation before us other than Deputy Sean Sherlock's Bill. The delegates have given us the evidence from their research in Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT. Evidence is emerging around the world and the GMIT research has been really significant. However, we must consider the entire coastline. This is only a sample. I wonder what is happening in the Irish Sea, my area around Tramore and Waterford and along the northern coastline. We need more evidence. There must be greater support for the institutes in order to build the evidence required and we need this to be written into the legislation. That is what my Bill would have provided for. It would have provided for monitoring in order that the relevant information would be available to us on an all-island basis. In addition, I note that this is a transboundary problem. What is the Department doing on an international level? Are officials working through MARPOL, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, and the various international associations in pursuing this issue from an Irish perspective?  For me, legislation is not coming quickly enough. I understand the Department needs resources, including human resources, to develop legislation. However, we have a problem with macro and microplastic pollution, contaminants such as polymers and the impact of toxins in the food chain. It is a serious issue and we must have legislation to deal with it. When I introduced my Bill, the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, said he would have to talk to the European Commission because of Single Market rules. We now know that that did happen and that the Minister sought a derogation which we have not seen either. From my perspective, the evidence is stacking up that we have a serious problem which potentially is impacting on human health. As I said, there are so many aspects to it, including pollution, contaminants, habitats lost and the impact on biodiversity and sustainability of the seas. We are, therefore, not moving fast enough and I am asking the Department to move with greater urgency. Two years have passed. We have Deputy Sean Sherlock's Bill, but if the Department has something better I ask that we be allowed to see it and soon. We must take into consideration not only microbeads and microplastics but also the collation of data, which will mean supporting the institutes in order that we work proactively as well as retroactively to deal with what is an ongoing problem.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	28	I thank the Senator. To reassure her, one of the reasons we are so stretched is that we are working very hard to deal with the marine litter problem generally. It is the central marine environmental concern, although loss of biodiversity and habitat is also a very serious concern. In many respects, it is the new climate change problem. People are realising we have created an enormous problem with this wonder substance that was developed in the 1950s. It has the tremendous property of being able to last forever and is water resistant, etc. It is used on a disposable basis. These are, however, the very properties that make it problematic in the environment. We now realise the marine and other environments are replete with this problem. The marine strategy framework directive includes specific targets to deal with marine litter. We are required to achieve what is called "good environmental status" using the different criteria included in the directive. We are also working under OSPAR, the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, and on different actions to deal with this problem with the OSPAR intercessional group on marine litter. It is a constant iterative process and new evidence is emerging all the time, to which we are responding transnationally and nationally.  The legislation to address microbeads will deal with one aspect of the problem, but a range of other measures will have to be put in place in the coming years. They will have societal implications and affect how we live and deal with things across Ireland, Europe and globally. For example, dealing with microfibres will be problematic because in washing artificial fabrics microfibres are generated. The plastic ropes used in plastic nets break down into fibres. The measures that will ultimately be needed to deal with things such as this will have societal implications. We will have to bring society along with us globally.  We fully accept what the Senator is saying. As I said, one of the reasons we are so stretched is that we are trying to deal with so many measures, but we are happy that we now have the resources to work on this specific legislation.

We are talking about fossil fuels and complete societal change. My objective is to build momentum.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	30	In our briefing document we have outlined some of the measures we are supporting and taking and on which we are leading in a transboundary context. They are only part of a range of measures being looked at. With reference to sediment, we have actually taken samples from subtidal and intertidal zones around the country. We are about to seek tenders to have these samples analysed. That is just one of the things we have done.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	It is important that we differentiate between sources. There are terrestrial sources of plastics pollution, one of which is manufacturing, within which there are dispersed sources. It is the manufacturing side of the problem that we are looking at today. If we try to tackle all of the problems in one go, we will never find a solution to tackle all of them. We will have to proceed through introducing pieces of legislation. That is why a piece such as this is good. The need for evidence is clear, but there is also a need to invoke the precautionary principle; in other words, we do not need specific evidence on every part of the coast to say this is a problem.As we know from international research that it is a problem, we should move, rather than wait for evidence, but in saying that we also need to know if the legislation will be successful. We must monitor it as we go along to see if it is working. Mr. Harrington has said he has two new staff resources to work on marine and environmental areas. There is, of course, the likelihood that the priorities for the people in question will change in time such that they will be moved from particular areas such as dealing with this legislation and microplastics to foreshore legislation which has been sitting there for a while. Marine spatial planning is coming into force and we are working on putting it together on a national scale. We have also been waiting on marine protected areas for a while. Therefore, I can see the new staff being overwhelmed very quickly. If we can get focused legislation like this through in a timely manner, we could start to work on some of the other problems we face.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	I thank the delegates for the presentations and again acknowledge the work of both Deputy Sean Sherlock and Senator Grace O'Sullivan. If the departmental officials take anything from this meeting it is that there is a very strong consensus in the committee that we want to see something being done in a timely fashion. One of the values of engaging in pre-legislative scrutiny is that it allows us have these conversations to ensure the final legislation - be it from the Opposition, the Government or an amalgam of the two - will be the best possible. I welcome all of the comments made. Mr. Harrington is overstating the potential problems from a European Commission perspective when he says there will be implications for the principle of free movement. In its engagement with the British Government on this issue, for example, the Commission explicitly stated this might not be the case and that there could be circumstances where a ban on certain products for environmental reasons could be consistent with internal market rules and that, therefore, a derogation would not be required. It is important to note that it is not as hard and fast as Mr. Harrington's choice of language suggests. As we know, the French have passed legislation dealing with microbeads and the British Government is progressing its own. There are some reflections at EU level on how EU policy in this area fits into global policies. Notwithstanding that, I am interested in Mr. Harrington expanding a little more on two comments made in the presentation. What are his thoughts on including "robust" and "future-proofed" definitions of microbeads and plastics? Will he expand a little more on the information contained in the briefing note? He spoke about working out how prohibition could be enforced. If there are even initial thoughts on that issue, I am interested in hearing them.  I was quite taken by Dr. Nash's comments on the umpire analogy. The straight question from our perspective is what would she like to see added, taking account of Dr. Lynch's point that we cannot include everything in one piece of legislation. Could certain things be added at this point before returning to others? This is not just about substances to be banned; there is also the concern about mitigation, on which I am interested in hearing further comments. As a side point, last week we were considering another piece of water-related policy - the revised EU drinking water directive. It is about trying to take a risk-based approach to removing things from sources of drinking water. We have spoken primarily about the marine end of the microbeads issue. Is there any research or consideration from the science or Department end in terms of the implications for drinking water? It is something we might need to consider in the context of the revised EU directive.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	33	I will respond first to Dr. Lynch and then Deputy Eoin Ó Broin.  Dr. Lynch has certainly outlined what is a challenging work agenda for us in the Department in dealing with these matters. What we intend to have is separate stand-alone legislation dealing with microbeads. We are not anticipating including this piece of legislation with any other legislation such as legislation to deal with the maritime area or the foreshore (amendment) Bill.  Dr. Lynch mentioned maritime spatial planning. We set up a separate unit within the Department that is advancing work on that matter. We have recently published a roadmap in that regard. Again, it will not have any real impact on our achievements. The resources we are receiving will be prioritised to deal with the microbeads Bill. I do not see any particular change to what I have set out.  Dr. Lynch mentioned marine protected areas which are also of great interest to the committee. It is an area for which we want to provide a legislative basis. Initially, the priority again will be dealing with microbeads. I thank Deputy Eoin Ó Broin for his helpful remarks. As I mentioned, I am getting a clear sense of the interest of the committee and the Oireachtas in this area. It has been clearly noted. I also thank the Deputy for his helpful comments on the engagement between the United Kingdom and the European Commission. I was reflecting the initial legal advice we had received, but as we go into the matter in some depth, it may move to the scenario described by the Deputy. We have been advised on an interim basis that there is a need for engagement with the Commission, which has stated it wants robust justification in that regard. We are all agreed that we are not going back to first principles in providing an evidence base for the Commission. Some of our colleagues have given the results of their research. As I see it, it is about the collation and distillation of the research and analysis that has been undertaken. It is about saying to the Commission that there is a problem and evidence to represent the problem before proposing a legislative solution.  I will ask my colleague to make some brief points on the other questions concerning the definitions of plastics and enforcement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	34	The robust and future-proofed definitions of plastics arise from some of the feedback we have received in our consultation process. We want to ensure whatever definition we will have will encompass any potential plastic microbead in order that we will not miss something. We do not want a manufacturer to be clever and find a synthetic polymer that could be harmful to get around the definition which we want to be all-encompassing, if possible. We also want to take in polymers that may not yet have been developed. That should be straightforward enough. The UK definition is not that bad, but we are looking at the issue with our own national experts. Before moving to enforcement, I will respond to one of Dr. Lynch's points about monitoring. Under the marine strategy framework directive we must identify the good environmental status of our waters and set targets and indicators. We must then put a monitoring programme in place. That is extremely important. Much of our research and the work of the Environmental Protection Agency will heavily inform what we will choose to monitor. We need to identify the ideal candidate species to monitor and the ideal locations, etc. in order that we get a picture of what is happening with microplastics and marine litter in general.We would envisage that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, would have a role in enforcement and that we would create the standard authorised person. There is much legislation that provides a model for this where people can go out and take samples, look at things, analyse, investigate and so on, and then prosecute if necessary. That would be the role but there would obviously be a financial cost attached to that which we need to factor into our considerations.

Five or six EU member states have banned microplastics to date, including those that have introduced a ban from the start of this year. Has the European Commission given any negative response to those?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	36	We got some unofficial feedback on this. This is more what we are picking up from the air than what is formally available. The European Commission recognises that the train has left the station with regard to microbeads. Concerns have been expressed that all of these solo actions by member states on various different things are being potentially corrosive to the Single Market. It is not that they are not justified, just that the Commission would prefer a unified step forward. If somebody has taken this step beforehand and been at the vanguard of getting a derogation from the Commission, it makes the job easier for people following on.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	37	I thank the witnesses for all the expert opinion that we have heard. It has been a very interesting discussion. We will be fully supportive of a ban on microbeads but I hear the point that has been made by experts and academics today, that microbeads represent a small fraction of the problem and the issue is far broader than that. There are two ways in which one can deal with that. One is to broaden the Bill so that it deals not just with microbeads, but microfibres and microplastics more generally, or second, it can be a first step which opens the door and is followed quickly and rapidly with extra legislation which tackles microfabrics and microplastics. I have an open opinion as to which is the best way to go. The basic point is that the broader picture must be addressed with urgency, but comprehensively and in a robust way.

#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	46	The idea that there is a potential impact on human health is obviously of real concern and I imagine the situation here is cumulative. There is a large quantity of microplastics intersecting with marine life. It is growing. Is there a tipping point? Maybe that is a point that could be addressed. Is it just a case of quantitative changes or does it turn into something more serious at a certain point? I take on board the point that has been raised by Dr. Lynch that there is a very significant presence on our coastlines in Ireland. I welcome the Bill and that the Government is no longer opposing it. I thought the initial reaction from the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was depressing and deferred to business interests, the cosmetic industry and the European Union. It is clear that change on this issue is unstoppable. The debate has started, many people are engaging in it and there is a mood for change. Some European governments have introduced legislation and the US will have a ban within two years. Is that correct? I think the UK is doing something similar and maybe the witnesses could clarify that. It is important that Ireland does not lag behind on this. It is clear that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, did not want Ireland to be a pioneer on it but change is under way now and it is important that Ireland does not lag behind.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	47	For the record and for clarity for the committee, I do not think the Minister, Deputy Coveney, ever indicated that and he said that he was quite happy to work with the author of the Bill and to progress it. That is for clarification.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	48	Was his initial reaction not one of opposing the Bill?
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	49	His initial reaction was that he would engage with the proposer of the Bill and in the process. From the committee's point of view, we have always taken this Bill in good faith and sought to work in the best way possible with it. That is just for clarification. It probably does not matter for today but we want to move forward with the Bill in the best possible manner.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	50	I note that there has been a change in the Government position from an initial stance of leaning strongly towards opposition to one of saying that it will not oppose it. I think that is public opinion and that the debate that has opened up has been a factor in that. That is my view.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	51	I would interpret that differently.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	52	As the originator of the Bill, the Deputy is correct in the sense that the initial mood of the Government and the speech that was distributed to us on the night of the Second Stage debate was in opposition to the Bill. There have been some discussions with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to his credit and he decided subsequently to come on board. I think Deputy Barry is correct in that sense.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	53	From the committee's point of view, we have always wanted to proceed in the best possible manner with this Bill. Does Deputy Barry have further questions?
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	54	No. In essence, I am looking for a bit more information about what is coming down the tracks with regard to the changes in the US and the question as to whether the build up of microplastics is something which has a potential tipping point beyond which it becomes more serious.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	55	Before I go back to our witnesses, because we are supposed to finish by 11 a.m., are there any further questions that members would like to ask?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	56	I am again conscious of time. My Bill is very simple and it deals with a bespoke element of the entirety of the challenge - microbeads. I am very happy to change the title of my Bill to call it the prohibition of microbeads Bill 2016 or such. This is where the scientific research has been invaluable to us. It really explains to us just how large the scope is and the methodology that one needs to underpin all of the research, and that work is ongoing. The wording of my Bill is "any cosmetic containing micro-plastics is guilty of an offence". I allow for summary offences. It calls for penalties if one manufactures, sells or imports. I also set out what would be actually banned. These are all what I would call products of conspicuous consumption. They are not necessities. They include a "personal care product including but not limited to a facial scrub, soap, lotion, shower gel, sunscreen, make-up, deodorant or toothpaste". We are not banning those products but we are banning products of that nature that contain microbeads. We have a scientific definition of microbeads. My Bill is very simple. Notwithstanding the Government's intention, I cannot see what it is that the committee will produce that is more robust or comprehensive than this if we are dealing specifically and only with the issue of microbeads. That is the point I really want to make. I welcome this interaction and the bona fides of the Department officials. I recognise the challenge. Maybe the wording of my Bill needs work and I acknowledge that. One could amend my Bill to say that microbeads or microplastics means plastic particles of less than 5 mm in diameter, for instance.In one fell swoop, the legislation would remove an array of products for which there is incontrovertible proof that they find their way into watercourses. That could be done in a very short time. That was also the intention of Senator Grace O'Sullivan's Bill before it was opposed. I do not see why that could not be done at an early juncture while working on the wider issues of marine litter in parallel. The witnesses came here with the issue of marine litter very firmly in their sights. Finally, I return to Senator Grace O'Sullivan's point that the funding for research on this is something that needs to be looked at. I will go to Science Foundation Ireland and will speak to the Minister and the Marine Institute to see if there is a mechanism. It may be that there is a mechanism for researching this area in terms of societal challenges through Horizon 2020. I was at the negotiating table for Horizon 2020 and recall that this was looked at as one of the societal challenges and that there should be funds available for this. It would not take a lot of money to buttress the research that the witnesses are doing which is vital if we are looking at the entirety of the coastline of Ireland.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	57	I thank Deputy Sherlock. We are under some time pressure. Does Mr. Harrington wish to come in?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	58	I will first respond to Deputy Mick Barry. We have had a discussion on microbeads, microplastics and microfibers and what we will include in the legislation. I agree with one of my colleagues from GMIT who said there will be a need for ongoing legislation in this particular area. Our thinking currently is that we should proceed with the microbeads element in the first piece of legislation. Much work will have to be done on microplastics and microfibres, specifically on what we will prohibit. We must be very careful about those definitions. If we can expand the legislation we will try to do so but we are currently going to hold on in the area of microbeads. I do not have any specific information on the Deputy's query relating to the US, but I will get some information and return to him with it.  I appreciate Deputy Sherlock's bona fides on this. We have a number of issues with the Bill to which he referred, which we outlined at the time. I am not sure if it is a simple matter of changing the definitions. There is much more detailed and robust work which needs to be done in developing this legislation. If the Chairman and the committee wanted to invite us here again when we are more advanced in the development of our own legislation to discuss this issue again, we would be happy to oblige.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	59	I thank Mr. Harrington and will give the last word to Dr. Nash.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	60	I will answer Deputy Barry's question on the impact of bioaccumulation because I do not want anyone to leave this meeting having decided not to eat fish. Humans can pass microplastics so we are fine. When one buys fish, it is gutted and that is where all the microplastics are contained so they are quite safe to eat. There are other issues around nanoplastics which are a whole other area. On bioaccumulation, we can see that sea birds have died but that it is mainly as a result of macroplastics, which they cannot pass. We are specifically not looking at nanoplastics, which refers to chemicals being absorbed, but it does bioaccumulate and go up the food chain with fish eating insects, but when the guts are removed they are quite safe for us to eat.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16548	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	61	We can also keep eating the Dublin Bay prawns.

#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	64	There is no scaremongering here. I thank all the witnesses and officials for coming before the committee. In Deputy Sherlock's words, I found it to be a great tutorial. It was far more in depth than what I had read initially, so I appreciate the detail that was brought to the committee. Deputy Sherlock's Bill remains on our work programme but we will work in tandem with the Department if it has a Bill. We would be happy for the officials to come in at any time that it has the information available. We look forward to further engagement.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	65	The second item on the agenda is detailed scrutiny of the Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill 2017. I welcome Dr. Richard Manton and Mr. John Bailey of Engineers Ireland; Mr. Peter Hynes, Mr. Richard Shakespeare, Mr. Pat Nestor and Mr. Séamus Murphy of the County and City Management Association; and Mr. Paraig Cantwell and Mr. John Commane of the Institute of Clerks of Works. Before we begin, I wish to draw the attention of the witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given. They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The committee normally gives witnesses approximately four minutes for each opening statement, but there is a fair bit of flexibility. I invite Dr. Manton to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	66	I thank the Chair for the invitation to address the committee. I am the policy officer with Engineers Ireland. I am joined by Mr. John Bailey, who is a chartered engineer and a fellow of Engineers Ireland. Both of us are representing Engineers Ireland at this meeting. Engineers Ireland is one of the oldest and largest professional bodies on the island of Ireland. We have over 25,000 member engineers. Our membership incorporates all disciplines of engineering, from consulting and contracting organisations to the public service, semi-State organisations and academic institutions. Engineers Ireland awards the professional title of chartered engineer, which is the gold standard for engineers working in Ireland. This professional badge of excellence is awarded following a rigorous assessment and is recognised internationally and in Irish law. We acknowledge the work done by the joint committee and its advisers on building standards and controls. I refer, for example, to the Safe as Houses report, which was published last December. It is clear that we would all like to see an increase in the supply of safe high-quality housing that provides value for consumers, particularly in the ongoing climate of housing shortage. Therefore, Engineers Ireland welcomes in principle this Bill, which endeavours to increase the delivery of much-needed units of accommodation. We agree that bringing vacant properties into residential use, if done correctly, will help to address the housing shortage and to revitalise villages, towns and cities. We commend the move towards co-ordinated building permitting, which we believe should be applied to all building projects. However, we believe the Bill as drafted will have little effect on the availability of accommodation in the short or medium terms. While we do not question the intent of the drafters of this Bill, we are concerned about its potential unintended consequences. We would like to raise three main points, the first of which relates to building standards and safety. The Bill proposes to replace the statutory requirement for a fire safety certificate, a disability access certificate and compliance with other parts of the building regulations with a works permit. The effect of this would be to introduce a third system of building regulation compliance documentation, following SI 9 of 2014, which is known as BCAR, and SI 365 of 2015, which is known as the opt-out. Since its introduction, BCAR has promoted a greater awareness of the need for proper design and inspection of fire protection measures. An unintended consequence of the proposed Bill might be to relegate this awareness to a works permit scenario, with a consequent lesser emphasis on the importance of the fire safety certificate and disability access certificate documentation. The Bill proposes to revise the technical guidance documents. It should be noted that building regulations are minimum performance standards that are set for the safety and comfort of occupants and the general public. We have particular concerns relating to fire safety. If buildings approved under this system are perceived as being built to lesser standards, this could further distort the property market. The second point we would like to make relates to the proposal in the Bill to impose a time limit of two weeks on a local authority to revert with the results of a pre-application assessment. No time limit is proposed for the local authority to deliver a decision for the subsequent one-stop-shop application. We note that no provision is being made for the local authority to seek an extension of time for the determination of the application. There is no provision for comment from a third party. No provision is being made to allow the local authority to seek additional information from the applicant. We believe the failure to provide for first-party or third-party appeals of decisions could give rise to a constitutional challenge. If the desired effect of the Bill is to be achieved, the processes needed to accommodate the above issues need to be faster and less cumbersome than the existing processes. All the while, the time required to assess a design proposal will not be affected by this Bill. Our third point refers to authorised persons and local authority resourcing. The Bill outlines the role of authorised persons in enforcing building regulations and proposes the creation of a new register of such persons. It is absolutely essential that these authorised persons are qualified and competent professionals, and that they are approved for specific activities. For example, a structural engineer would not be competent to review an electrical engineering design. Furthermore, the number of competent persons needed to carry out design assessments and conduct site inspections are simply not available currently in the public sector. We would also question how the qualifications of authorised persons would be vetted before they are placed on a register. It is probable that most, if not all, of the assessments and inspections would have to be contracted out to the private sector where there is an emerging shortage of competent professionals. Therefore, to populate a new core of independent inspectors, and achieve the timelines outlined in the Bill, significant additional resourcing of local authorities would be required. We challenge the assertion that the Bill would not entail a direct cost on local authorities or the Exchequer. Engineers Ireland commends the work of those who drafted the Bill and the committee. We believe that moving towards a co-ordinated building permit system and a greater inspection and enforcement capacity in local authorities would assist in the efficient supply of safe and high-quality housing. However, we do not believe that the Bill can achieve this objective. We look forward to continuing our engagement with this committee and with the Government in order to develop solutions for consumers and the wider public.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	68	Ba mhaith liom ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh an coiste agus mo buíochas a ghabháil as ucht an cuireadh a bheith libh. I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee. I am accompanied by my colleague from the land use and transport committee of the County and City Management Association, CCMA. Mr. Richard Shakespeare, who is seated on my left, is the assistant chief executive of Dublin City Council. We are also accompanied by Mr. Seamus Murphy, chief fire officer with Mayo County Council, and Mr. Pat Nestor, senior building surveyor with Dublin City Council. I wish to confirm that the return of currently vacant or under-utilised upper floors to residential use is a high priority for the CCMA. We strongly support any initiative which will assist in the regeneration of urban areas and, in particular, our small towns and villages. That said, we have concerns regarding the current proposal that I would like to share with the committee. The objective of this Bill appears to be the smoothing of procedures currently in place to support the provision of residential accommodation. The main procedural requirements that the Bill proposes to replace with a single, one-stop-shop process are: planning consent; fire safety certificates; disability access certificates; commencement notices; and certificates of compliance. Local authorities are committed to facilitating the provision of residential accommodation and measures which support this goal are very welcome. The general welcome for the provisions of the Bill from Deputies and Senators who have spoken or contributed to the debate so far are noted. There is clearly a perception that the current regulatory controls in place in terms of obtaining planning permission or demonstrating compliance with the building regulations are onerous and excessively time-consuming. We do not share that perception. We consider that the proposals may not confer advantages in terms of delivering projects and will introduce significant risk for developers in the event that their applications ultimately fail on the completion of projects. We have included two comparative tables in our submission, one which illustrates the existing planning and building control provisions and a second which outlines the timescale for the proposed system. We suggest that the existing systems can deliver more regulatory certainty at a faster pace. The Bill proposes to legislate for entirely different functions within a single statute. Notwithstanding the comments on combining regulatory and building control systems, the provisions of the Planning and Development Acts and the Building Control Acts were set down for entirely different purposes. While the Building Control Acts focus on standards in buildings and construction, the Planning and Development Acts have a much broader environmental and social role beyond the built environment. The one-stop-shop panel of authorised persons is expected to reach a conclusion on proposed projects compliance regarding all aspects of the building regulations in two weeks or less. We are of the belief that this is not an adequate period in which to consider complex construction technology issues. While a building may well have been correctly designed and significant time taken by the designers to consider these matters, it is the local authority that is expected to approve the designs as per the provisions of the proposed Bill. This is an onerous undertaking and a fundamental departure from long-established principles and existing provisions of building control. If there are difficulties with compliance issues and these are not resolved upon repeat inspection, a development will be deemed to be unsuccessful and the developer must revert to the established planning and building control procedures. This would appear to place the developer in an almost impossible situation. Having entered the one-stop-shop process in good faith, a developer could be left with a completed building which cannot be occupied. It is our view that the proposed system carries little, if any, advantage in terms of the time necessary to gain approval for a project as against existing procedures and, in addition, transfers significant risk on to the owner of the works, the authorised person from the one-stop-shop panel and the local authority. Having approved, inspected and signed off on the works, the local authority cannot expect to be immune from responsibility and liability if there is a failure in the building that results in harm to occupants, firefighters or others. I again thank the Chairman and the joint committee for the opportunity of presenting today. We are happy to respond to questions as best we can. The two tables to which I referred earlier outline the comparison in respect of the existing system, which, since the Bill was initially promoted, has been greatly improved by the February 2018 schedule of exempted development. The latter has taken a large chunk of the problem on the planning side out of the equation. The comparison speaks for itself and I would be happy to go through the tables with members.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	69	I thank Mr. Hynes. I call on Mr. Cantwell, from the Institute of Clerks of Works and Building Inspectors in Ireland, to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	70	I am the chairperson for the Institute of Clerks of Works and Building Inspectors in Ireland. I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. John Commane, who holds the position of secretary. We both work as clerks of works and building inspectors with different local authorities. Our organisation has members throughout the country. We thank the committee for the opportunity to comment on the proposed Bill. We welcome the proposals contained in the Bill because they address the issue of vacant properties and propose their return to much-needed residential use. Many units are located above shops and offices and they will provide a challenge in the context of being converted into or refurbished as habitable spaces. Last year, the Government announced a repair-to-lease scheme to tackle similar problems. The progress of this scheme has been poor to date. We see the concept of a one-stop shop as a model which should be tried. It is a good proposal to streamline the process and create a one-stop-shop situation in local authorities. As a previous witness has said, three different timelines are associated with the certificates and permissions and three different Departments are involved. The proposal seeks to reduce the amount of bureaucracy involved and make it easier for owners to renovate their properties. The proposed works permit will raise some questions, particularly in the case of residential property to be refurbished above shops or offices. It will be a challenge to comply with the proposals regarding disability access certificates, fire safety certificates and technical guidance documents. Towards the end of the 1990s and in the early 2000s, the number of clerks of works engaged in inspection greatly decreased. The reduction was due to the uncontrolled self-certification by developers and builders of their construction work. Defects were overlooked or ignored, resulting in many seriously sub-standard developments nationwide. It is the view of the Institute of Clerks of Works and Building Inspectors that had competent clerks of works been employed, most of the current problems would not exist. This assertion was supported as recently as last year in a reply given to Deputy Boyd Barrett during Leaders’ Questions when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, correctly identified a lack of inspections and the absence of qualified clerks of works on building sites as the main contributory factor to defective work and non-compliance with building regulations during the boom years.It is a fact that in this country local authority inspections of the built environment are not at as high a percentage as in other countries. We should learn lessons from the Celtic tiger years, particularly well known cases such as Priory Hall and others that had serious infrastructural and structural issues. Despite the fact, presumably, that the work was signed off by others we still had problems. We foresee that the problems will still exist due to a lack of independent oversight. For that reason, we, the Institute of Clerk of Works and Building Inspectors in Ireland, are of the view that more independent inspections from local authorities are needed to carry out these inspections. We support more independent oversight and inspection by appropriately trained and competent personnel employed in the local authority services.  At present clerks of works are employed on major construction projects throughout the country. Some are directly employed by the client, local authorities, health boards, Department of Education and Skills and other agencies. Others are employed directly by architects and consultants.  It is important to emphasise the importance of additional resourcing by local authorities at administrative and technical levels as such staff will be required for the implementation of this Bill.  Clerks of works have been a core element of local authority teams over the years as well as playing an important role within the HSE, Department of Education and Skills and other such bodies on very complex projects.  Concerns have been raised by other bodies about the competence of authorised persons who will carry out the inspections under the system. The authorised person regime has been in place since 1992 and is the basis for all local authority building control inspections. This objection makes no sense. If the Bill is not passed, the same regime will continue to apply. Local authority building inspectors do not have to be registered under the Building Control Act 2007 as assigned certifiers do.  On inspection by an authorised person, we, the Institute of Clerks of Works and Building Inspectors in Ireland, understand what is meant in terms of the powers they have, more so than someone who is working under Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, or SI 9. The numbers of inspections dictated by BCAR are at critical milestone points in construction before work is closed up. Who better to carry out these inspections and report back to architects, engineers or surveyors than a clerk of works who is based on site or calling to sites at different intervals? We are after all working together to ensure a good quality of work is achieved using correct materials and procedures.  The potential of this authorised person regime would give a local authority a panel of people who would be appropriate to the needs of whatever the inspection was and who could be ticking off the same list. In some cases, it might be checking if there is an operational fire alarm; in other cases, it might have to call in a specialist to do something more complex. This would effectively streamline the various processes which are all doing the same thing.  The recommendation that local authority building control be reviewed and resourced in the Safe as Houses report would align with an increased role for authorised persons as contemplated by this Bill  It follows that for a clerk of works to be an “authorised person” under the Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill 2017 they must either be an employee of a local authority or a public body or be specified on the list.  It is the Minister by way of a statutory instrument who will set out the criteria to get on the list. Membership of the Institute of Clerks of Works and Building Inspectors in Ireland has been for many years and currently is recognised as a pre-qualifier by local authorities and other Departments for a post of clerk of works.  There must be no compromise on quality or safety as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 will still apply. 
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	71	I thank Mr. Cantwell.
#PatCasey	unknown-#PatCasey-party	unknown-#PatCasey-dob	unknown-#PatCasey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	72	I thank all the witnesses for their presentations. I will make a general comment before I focus on the presentation by Engineers Ireland. I wish to stress that the purpose of this Bill is never to minimise fire or disability standards and I stress this every time I speak on the Bill. The purpose of the one-stop shop is to try to harmonise three different processes into one. The fire and disability standards remain exactly the same as they are under the Building Control Regulations today. There is no deviation in standards but we are trying to harmonise planning exemptions, fire certification and disability certification into a one-stop shop process where one can go into the local authority and get the whole thing done and dusted rather than going through three separate processes, the way it happens at present. At no stage are the fire and disability certification standards being put at risk. The current building control regulation applies to this work, the very same as it applies to SI 9. On the issue of the local authority not having time to seek the time extensions, we are looking at existing building and from a planning process perspective, there is no public consultation. We are not looking at redesigning the exterior of the building; we are literally talking about the reconfiguration of the interior of the building. In relation to the planning process and third party appeal process, we have to start looking at realistic ways of how we get these buildings back into use. We do not think there is a need for that. Equally now the Government has come along with SI 30, which is almost identical to what this Bill is proposing, which removes most of this from the planning process also.  On the local authority trying to seek additional or further information, let us look at what we have done for the development of 100 houses. They must go through a pre-planning process with An Bord Pleanála and it is during that process that the detail is thrashed out. Then once one submits the application there is no further information or anything else after that, but the board must make a decision in a set period. It is in the pre-consultation period that all the work must be done. There is an indication coming from that process that the pre-planning process does work in the development of 100 houses. We might need to tweak this as we go forward, but the intention is to try to get this done and dusted. On the issue of the "authorised person" and the qualification of such persons, we can take some information back on this. Equally we look at the building control regulation, the qualification that applies to the assigned certification process and how those people qualify. They come from different backgrounds and they can qualify to sign off on certification. We are looking at the same type of person here. We are not trying to deviate from it. We may have to work on that aspect of it.  On the point that the public sector does not have the resources, that is correct. That is why we said that a framework agreement could be entered into where people who have these skills are engaged by the local authority through a framework agreement.  On the cost to the Exchequer, an assigned certifier costs money, an authorised person costs money so we would see a similar fee would apply. It is up to the Minister to decide on that. That would not be a cost on the Exchequer and the developer would have to pay for the certification process. I think they are the main points. In the submission from the County and City Management Association, CCMA, the CCMA raised the issue of the different functions in respect of planning and development and building control. The functions are different but they are carried out by the one local authority and the personnel in that local authority. I do not see why there should be an issue with joining those two functions together as one function in the future, in the interest of trying to streamline the process. Section 4 of the Building Control Act allows the building control authority to grant dispensation or relaxation of the requirements of building regulations. This Bill acknowledges that, but equally it is seeking technical guidance documents to be produced by the Department to address this issue. At present, we have 32 local authorities, each with its own interpretation of the dispensation or relaxation in respect of fire or disability certification.This Bill is asking the Government to produce a technical guidance document to facilitate the refurbishment of existing buildings into habitable dwellings.  In terms of the executive function, I would have no problem if there was to be a requirement that the chief executive had to sign off on this. We all know, from our work with the local authority, that the planner or fire officer makes the decision and that the chief executive only signs a document that is presented to him at the end of the day. If there is a feeling that this Bill is weaker because the signature of the chief executive is not required, I have no problem with addressing that.  The point was made that the developer is exposed at the end of the day if the authorised person will not sign a works permit. That is no different from what is happening under building control at the moment if the assigned certifier will not sign a certificate of compliance on completion. They are the very same processes. I believe the building control regulations, BCAR, are weak in this respect. Disability and fire planning all has to be agreed before builders go to site. Currently, under BCAR, if I am converting my building I can send a seven-day notice and even if I have no fire certificate or disability certification, I can start, providing I have applied for those certificates. We are dealing with old buildings here, so once work commences the first certification, or the disability certification, might not arrive for two months. The work might be completed, and it is possible that none of it is compliant with BCAR. I believe the system we are proposing is better because all of these issues are dealt with upfront, before builders go on site. At the moment there is a weakness in BCAR in that builders can go to site and commence construction without having a fire certification or a disability certification. We are dealing with older buildings, which are more dangerous and more complex in terms of both of those items. Fianna Fáil's Bill is much stronger on that issue. Since this Bill was introduced the Minister has signed off on Statutory Instrument No. 30 in February, so the whole planning process has been exempted from both of these situations. There is a question of liability here, and an additional piece of work on this might be required, but we would see this as being very similar to how BCAR operates at the moment, where the public liability lies with the assigned certifier, or in our case the approved person. They are the professionals and they sign off on that. In my time in the Dáil I have continually pushed for independent inspection. I believe that the country needs to go in that direction. I can ask a local authority what percentage of buildings it is inspecting. The system in place at the moment relies on self-regulation, where the builder is paying the assigned certifier to sign off on his own work. This Bill seeks to move towards independent inspection. We strongly believe that this is the way it should be for everything, not just in this respect. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	73	I believe we are ad idem on most items. It is a very good idea to have a full design completed before we get to site. That does not happen at the moment because there are cost implications, and detailed design tends not to get done until statutory approvals have been obtained. The Deputy mentioned an analogy between the authorised person and an assigned certifier. We have very strong reservations about the position of assigned certifiers at the moment. The reason for that is that we are not jacks of all trades. I am a very specialist structural engineer and I am simply not competent to look at an electrical design or heating and ventilating. Therefore, to ask a single assigned person - the assigned certifier - to sign off on all aspects of those technologies is not realistic at all. We feel that if that was to be done for authorised persons they should be split into specialties, the same way as engineering and architecture are. This Bill has many good points, particularly the idea that everything is signed off through a one-stop shop and having designs completed before getting to site. They are no-brainers. In fact, we would like to see those aspects of the Bill extended to all construction projects in the State. We certainly agree that independent inspection, and indeed independent assessment of the designs before commencement, is a no-brainer as well. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	74	The only reference we would be concerned about is the inspection regime. Where would the clerk of works come in? It would lead to more inspections on site. We have some members who are assigned certifiers, but even outside that we feel that there are not enough inspections on sites. That is our main concern.
#PatCasey	unknown-#PatCasey-party	unknown-#PatCasey-dob	unknown-#PatCasey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	75	We agree with that, and that is why this Bill equally says that when the one-stop shop approval is secured, that process can dictate the number of inspections to be carried out on a project. We all know the type of work we are talking about might be a very simple or very complicated piece of construction work. Some might not involve any construction work at all; perhaps a fabric change is all that is required. Other projects might require detailed and numerous inspections. This Bill offers that required flexibility. The number of inspections that has to take place during the process will be indicated on the final approval.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	76	We agree with the Deputy on that point.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	77	I note the opening remarks about the minimising of standards. I presume that the intent is that there would not be any compromising on standards. That in itself is perhaps part of the problem. Compromise and flexibility are sometimes part of the same discussion, and part of the difficulty of dealing with existing structures is shoehorning them into standards which were written after they were constructed - sometimes centuries afterwards - without requiring fundamental change to the existing structure. While the intent not to minimise or compromise standards at all is shared, it may be that some of the issues may require flexibility in these standards. That is a topic that needs to be ventilated and should be part of the discussion on technical guidance documents. Perhaps this Bill is not the arena for it. We have to figure out what is acceptable, what combination of flexibility is acceptable, and where local discretion should be allowed to vary very stringent requirements to meet common sense situations as they arise. Even the intent not to compromise standards is not as straightforward and simple as it might appear on first reading. On the question of decisions in our system currently, decisions are made when the final document is signed. Decisions are not made by planning officials or by fire officials but rather by the delegated person when that signature is made. That gives rise to a concern about the liability that may accrue to certain personnel under this Bill. We share absolutely the ambition to harmonise and streamline the processes in the best possible way. The processes are significantly different. There is a limit on the extent to which they can be handled by a multiskilled team. As a previous speaker said, the skill sets are extremely specialised and are dependent on training and experience. They are not easily transferable from one to the other. We would share the ambition on pre-planning and pre-planning discussion. We have considerable experience in different areas. If one looks at examples of best practice around the country where the planning process seems to deliver on the ambitions and objectives we all share, one will see that pre-planning is a big part of that. We welcome the ambition to produce technical guidance documents on dispensations. We would welcome the opportunity to contribute to that discussion. It might take some time, but we welcome that ambition. The key concern at our end relates to what is agreed before work starts on site. How can it be confirmed that what has been agreed and accepted is delivered? Part of that relates to inspection regimes. If we take this route, an inspection regime will need to be built. That has resource and cost implications. The question of whether those costs would be borne by the public purse through central or local government, by the developer or by the consumer is one for another day. Costs and resources will be required to provide for an independent inspection regime, regardless of whether this work is done in-house or is outsourced.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	78	I thank Deputy Casey for his comments. I take his point that his intention in proposing this Bill is not to reduce standards. It is intended that in the awarding of a works permit, standards will remain the same. However, I would be uncomfortable with the replacement of the requirement for a fire safety certificate. I will make a point about the current operation of the seven-day notice. We share the Department's characterisation that the replacement of the fire safety certificate requirement would be a highly retrograde step in this new system of building control regulation. For good reason, it currently takes quite some time to assess an application for a fire safety certificate. There are many considerations to take into account in the refurbishment of vacant buildings. I will not go through them all, but they include the means of escape, the types of material, the spread of smoke and compartmentalisation. The risk that is currently associated with the operation of a seven-day notice is that someone will go through the process of being awarded a fire safety certificate at a later stage following a rigorous assessment. We would not like to see any compromise in fire safety regulation. We would have concerns about the awarding of a works permit if the inspection regime that is currently proposed were not up to the same standard.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	79	I will allow Deputies Casey and Cowen back in.
#PatCasey	unknown-#PatCasey-party	unknown-#PatCasey-dob	unknown-#PatCasey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	80	I suppose this goes back to the intent of the Bill. We might have to look at the exact wording. We are saying that the works permit will include a fire certificate and a disability certificate. This means that the very same process which is gone through today will have to be gone through under the system we are proposing. I will take on board the point that it is probably not realistic for this to be done in two weeks. When we interact with people about the vacant properties all over our towns and villages that are just sitting there, we are told that the process is very complex and drawn out. It takes a period of time. We are trying to harmonise that without changing the standard. Our intention is that the works permit we are proposing will include within it the current fire certificate, disability certificate and exempted development certificate. I will take on board what the witnesses have said about time. I appreciate that fire safety is complex and not straightforward. It is more complex when an existing building is being retrofitted than it is when a new building is being constructed. I would like to pick up on some of the points made by Mr. Hynes. He spoke about different skill sets. Local authorities are responsible for the approval process anyway. They show they have the skill sets we are talking about when they implement the approval process. Fire officers, disability officers and others are using these skills every day of the week. They are there at the moment. We are not bringing anything extra to the approval process, but the inspection process is different. This is where it is said that there could potentially be a cost to the State. I remind the witnesses that builders and developers currently have to pay assigned certifiers, and we are saying that the authorised person charge should still fall to the builder. Where is the extra cost to the Exchequer? We have acknowledged that the expertise is not there and that some of this might have to be part of a framework agreement. Such an agreement would be done with a local authority which would appoint an independent assessor to a project to oversee independent inspection. That is where we probably want to get. The Minister has given a commitment in respect of the technical guidance document. That piece of work or process has already started. Although the Bill we are proposing would not do anything different from what is provided for at the moment, we are clearly putting our hands up and saying there can be 31 or 32 different interpretations of "dispensation". I appreciate that flexibility will be required in certain cases, but perhaps there should be less flexibility in this regard. If the local authorities had technical guidance setting out how to refurbish existing building stock - perhaps showing how to take a number of models and develop them out - it would be much easier for them to follow than it is for fire officers to interpret how relaxed they should be in respect of one building or another. I am saying all of this as a quick response to what we have heard from the witnesses on this Bill.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	81	I thank the witnesses for their contributions. I acknowledge Mr. Bailey's point that we are ad idem with regard to the intent and the thrust of this Bill, which is being proposed because the existing systems are not serving the people we represent as they were intended. He mentioned the vacant house refurbishment scheme, which was introduced by the Government last year and under which it was intended that 800 applications would be approved. If the existing systems were serving the people adequately, we would have had 800 approvals under that scheme, but instead we had none. We have a housing emergency and crisis. The guidelines pertaining to the development and progression of vacant units, including over-shop units, so that they enter into the market are restrictive. Perhaps the valid point made by Deputy Casey addresses the concerns of Mr. Hynes with regard to liability. Mr. Hynes and his colleagues are not served well by the fact that there are no guidelines for existing buildings. It is not right, proper, fair or appropriate that the guidelines which apply to new builds have to be used. This must be addressed forthwith. I am surprised that it has not been addressed to date. It has been confirmed here that, as Deputy Casey alluded to, it is intended to bring together all the resources of the local authority, which is responsible for issuing these certificates, in order to ensure we no longer have all the delay and prevarication that exists at present. As public representatives, we hear in no uncertain terms on a regular basis that things have to change. The point that needs to be made about the system of certification is that self-certification cannot continue. We know all about the ramifications and the lessons we have learned in that regard. In the future, the certification would ideally be done by the local authorities. If they had the resources and the personnel to facilitate this sort of independent certification, and were in a position to charge appropriately, it would give them an income stream, if nothing else. They would be independent almost in the same way as the Revenue Commissioners. This will not be possible in the absence of certification, however. That is what we have to strive towards. In the meantime, we are saying that the only way in which this can move forward is for it to be contracted by the local authority to assigned certifiers with relevant qualifications that make them suitable to meet the demands placed on them.The end game from our party's perspective is to move towards independent certification run and led by local authorities and that the costs associated with it will not be as severe as they are in the marketplace today. If one looks at the costs associated with such a system in the UK it is very favourable in comparison with the situation down here. In order to get to that end game we have to play our part in so far as we can in improving the system. That is why I brought forward a Bill. That is why we invited stakeholders such as the witnesses with expertise and professionalism to have an input into it so we can instruct Government in the hope it adopts it as policy and that it is enacted. That is the way the democratic process works, as frustrating and slow as it is. If we can speed it up, it is our duty to do so and that is what we want to do. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	82	I will respond very briefly. We all share the aspiration to get vacant, older units back into use, none more so than rural local authorities. It is true the further we get from the skylines of the greater Dublin area, which are crowded with construction cranes, to places where they are a threatened species and still have not returned after the migration.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	83	Ladders would do in places.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	84	We aspire to better than a ladder. We share the aspiration. It is a very important priority for local government to get people living back in our towns and villages. If we do not achieve repopulation, many of our smaller towns and villages will be on a downward spiral and it will not change any time soon unless initiatives like this take hold. We absolutely share the ambition and aspiration. If I understand what Deputy Casey said in his last contribution, the intent is that the processes of deliberation on fire certificate, disability access and exempted development, which has by and large been simplified since February, would be dealt with within two weeks. That is an ambitious aspiration. I do not think it is realistic in any system to expect things to be that radically transformed. If the Bill was simply asking for the streamlining of systems to deliver those certificates as they stand in a timescale that is set, there may be a realistic deadline which we could discuss and agree and deliver on but what is set is set. If it is set at a week, we will endeavour to deliver. We would be happy to have that discussion. It is a bit like the health care system. The services delivered in ear, nose and throat care are radically different to the services delivered in cardiology care. Would we want the two combined if we had problems in both areas? The members can make their own choices on that. We would certainly welcome a discussion on it. On the question of technical guidance documents for existing buildings, a great deal of progress can be made on it. We would certainly welcome the opportunity to input on it. There is always a balance between strict conformance with standards. When a standard is set, it is a standard; it is not a standard less 10% or 20% with the discretion left in the hands of the operative to make the call. It is a tricky balance. Technical guidance documents for existing buildings is an area where we could make some progress.  The transfer of liability for ongoing inspections to local authorities is quite a significant change from the current regime. It will have resource implications. If the resources are available it can be made to operate. If that is where the Bill takes us, we will obviously try to make that work. While we share the ambition, we have concerns around the timelines that have been set. If the clarity that we have heard is that the same systems apply to more rigorous timelines, that certainly can be made to work and we would be happy to have an ongoing discussion on it. 
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	85	Do Mr. Cantwell or Mr. Bailey wish to add anything?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	86	We welcome the idea of local authorities taking on more staff to carry out more inspections, particularly more clerks of works. I can see where Mr. Peter Hynes is coming from. It would be a big financial burden under the current set-up with taking on local authority employees. The issue of technical guidance documents for existing buildings is definitely a good idea but, as Mr. Hynes said, we should draw a line so there will not be grey areas. It would have to be very clearly defined which technical guidance documents one would work to for existing buildings. They are our main ideas. 
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	87	Does anyone else want to add anything?
#PatCasey	unknown-#PatCasey-party	unknown-#PatCasey-dob	unknown-#PatCasey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	88	I thank Mr. Hynes for his contribution. We all have the same overall objective. Technical guidance documents would assist the fire officer to deal with the certification of applications. It comes back to the fundamental issue of independent inspection and assigning an independent inspector. It should be throughout the whole construction period. We sometimes question whether we should review the opt-out clause in inspections. Every building should be independently inspected. I will ask Mr. Hynes a tricky enough question. What percentage of buildings does each local authority independently inspect? I do not think it is happening. I think if they are reaching 15%, that is all they are doing. That is why the thrust of everything we are doing here is moving towards independent inspection that is controlled by the local authority, either through a framework agreement or direct employment. Most of the cost would be borne by the developer who has to pay for the service himself. He is employing his assigned certifier but we believe the local authority should assign an independent inspector and the developer should pay that fee to the local authority, not to the assessor.
#MariaBailey	unknown-#MariaBailey-party	unknown-#MariaBailey-dob	unknown-#MariaBailey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	89	I have a number of things I would like to raise. I do not question the bona fides of the Bill in any shape or form although I disagree with most of it. In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, Mr. Cantwell said inspection and the absence of qualified clerks of works on building sites was a main contributory factor to defective work and non-compliance with building regulations during the boom. During the boom time many of the problems came to fruition and we are now dealing with the consequences of that with regard to a number of standards we have had to rightly bring forward. Under the Building Control Act 2007, local authority building inspectors do not have to be registered as assigned certifiers do. That is staggering to me. It is something that would have to be included in the Bill. It would have to be changed in the Bill. I have a real fear around the liability it would incur in local authorities. I have a real fear around the one-stop shop. I do not think it has been thought through properly. In my local authority in Dún Laoghaire any appointments that have been asked for in the Department on the delivery of housing have been sanctioned. I do not see taking on staff being a problem in the delivery of housing but it has to be independently certified. We need to go back to the original status where the clerk of works was involved.As Mr. Cantwell said, due to the many specialties that exist under the “clerk of works” umbrella, in his statement: Clerk of works are employed on major construction projects throughout the country. Some are directly employed by the client, local authorities, health boards, the Department of Education and Skills and other agencies while others are employed directly by architects and consultants.If we want to amend the Bill in any shape or form or send it back to the drawing board, we must address the question of independent assessment and certification, and ensure there are no consequences for the standard of building and development, be those projects retrofits or new builds. People must be able to move into or purchase a property knowing that it has been built to the highest possible modern standard as opposed to the standard of some of the buildings built during the boom when we did not have proper regulation. I have grave concerns about the Bill, although I understand its intent and acknowledge its bona fides. I will explore the Bill further. Does anyone among the witnesses wish to respond to my comments?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	90	I echo the Chairman's comments on the qualifications of assigned certifiers under SI 9 of 2014, known as BCAR. Individuals with such qualifications are registered construction professionals, for example, chartered engineers, which we as Engineers Ireland award, registered architects and chartered building surveyors. It is imperative that whoever assesses designs and conducts inspections on site is qualified to an appropriate level. As the Chairman recognised, these are complex building projects and are becoming even more complex for good reason, that being, to ensure the highest safety standards. Therefore, we would not like to see any step back from that. Related to that is the type of inspection regime. I would be concerned if there was any step back from the current level of inspection. A point was also made about independence, but we can revert to that at another time. The current BCAR inspection regime is based on risk assessments and assures that there are inspections at key, critical moments in the building process. We do not want to see inspection only being carried out at the end when the key building components have been covered up and it is otherwise difficult to see what has happened on site.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	91	I will briefly address a couple of the points and the direct question that was asked. I do not have the numbers with me, but I confirm that Dublin City Council has an inspection rate of 80%, which is probably top of the class. The target is 15% and I understand that some counties are in the 20% to 40% range. Mayo meets its target of 15%. The numbers form part of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, performance indicators. They are available, so I will be able to get them for the committee if that was the intent of the question. The point about there being less than a 100% inspection rate is taken.
#PatCasey	unknown-#PatCasey-party	unknown-#PatCasey-dob	unknown-#PatCasey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	92	If a site is only inspected once by a local authority, that will be included in the percentage even though the site should be inspected a number of times. There should be a number of independent inspections, not just one.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	93	Mr. Shakespeare might address that point.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	94	I can only speak for Dublin City Council. Throughout the life of a build, we will inspect it up to five times. That gives a fair indication.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	95	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	96	Although levels of development have returned to what they were previously when that number of inspections might not necessarily have happened, the assigned certifiers and the liability that attaches give us greater confidence now. From our point of view, that type of inspection regime is about giving the occupants of the building confidence that it has been built to a standard. As to our number of visits, we risk assess depending on whether a building is for habitation, office work, etc.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-03-28 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	97	Local authorities do not have an issue with taking on liability – we carry lots of liability as matters stand – provided we have the appropriate inspection regime and proper control and sanctions when required. They are part of the same equation. On the question of small towns and villages, which are of particular concern for rural authorities, other factors need to form part of this discussion. Trying to get our small towns and villages repopulated is partly about some kind of financial incentive to make it more attractive to move to the core of a town rather than to undertake a self-build on its edge, which has been the norm for at least two generations. Quality of life issues also need to form part of the thought process, although I acknowledge that they cannot be addressed in this Bill.
