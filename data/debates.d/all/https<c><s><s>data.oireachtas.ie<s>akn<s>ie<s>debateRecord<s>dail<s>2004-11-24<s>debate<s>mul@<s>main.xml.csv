#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach to publish the Goldman Sachs report on the future of Aer Lingus and I am glad the Government saw fit to publish it last night. It is evident from the report that the Government received clear warnings at the beginning of October about the loss of the management executive of Aer Lingus, and that this was a threat. The report stresses the importance of the current management team. At no point does it indicate that the management group was driven by greed or avarice. On page 5 the report states that investors will want to ensure that the senior management team is retained and motivated to perform, while on page 42 it states that retention of the management group is an important objective in the overall process. The report further states that in any situation it would be appropriate for the Department to involve management in any process.The executive team led by Willie Walsh was sent into Aer Lingus with a very difficult brief and it played to win for Aer Lingus. The report does not state that the team was driven by greed or avarice. It was very difficult for the team to work with the company, the customers, the workers and the unions involved. There was a call for 1,300 redundancies and there were 1,600 applications. As the report pointed out, far from involving the management team, the Government has dithered over the future of Aer Lingus with the result that €200 million has been wiped off its market value, the executive team has gone and the company has been left in a state of suspended paralysis for the foreseeable future.Will the Tánaiste accept that the Fianna Fáil wing of the Government has completely dominated this debate and has been unable to make a decision on the future of the company? Does the Tánaiste accept the warnings given clearly to the Government a few weeks ago in the Goldman Sachs report and that it is now clear that the Fianna Fáil element of the Government does not want to make a decision about Aer Lingus until after the next general election?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	2	It is clear from the report that Aer Lingus needs investment. The report urges private investment, a view I share. I do not accept that there has been a delay on the part of the Government. We received this report six weeks ago. Given the nature of the decision involved, it is natural that we should consider all the implications. The Government has indicated that it will make a decision before Christmas on an investment option for Aer Lingus. Under all the circumstances, that is satisfactory. As I said on other occasions, the turnaround in Aer Lingus has been incredible and great credit is due to all its workers who are ably led by a capable management team.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I do not accept the Tánaiste's assertion that the Government did not delay on this matter. On a radio programme last Sunday, the Tánaiste indicated that the Government reshuffle might have been the reason for the report not being examined by the Cabinet sub-committee of which she is a member. The Tánaiste also said on the radio programme that she understood that the report made a list of recommendations. When did the Tánaiste first read the report? Is the handling of this matter an indication that the Government is already tired and jaded and unable to make a decision on the future of Aer Lingus, a decision brought forward by an executive team which played to win for the company while the Government dithered to lose for the country?Does the Tánaiste support the attack by the Taoiseach on the Aer Lingus executive team of Willie Walsh and his partners when this report points out that there was no indication of that team being driven by greed or avarice? Does the Tánaiste support that outburst by the Taoiseach?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Following the discussion at the Cabinet sub-committee on Monday, has it begun to form a view on what should be done with Aer Lingus now that the executive team has gone, the horse has bolted, €200 million has been wiped from the company's market value and it has been left in a state of suspended paralysis for the foreseeable future? What is the Tánaiste's party view within that sub-committee of what should now be done with Aer Lingus?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I do not accept that there were unnatural delays. I said that there had been a Cabinet reshuffle. Obviously the new Minister needed time to consider all the issues, and that is natural in circumstances of this kind.My advisers and I had access to the report a couple of weeks ago, shortly after it was submitted to the Department of Transport. A consensus is emerging in the Cabinet sub-committee. That was clear to me at the meeting on Monday. The Minister for Transport will bring forward a memorandum to Government before Christmas so that the Government can make its decision. Clearly we must have a chairman and management team in place but the Government must also make its decision clear so that the uncertainty can be removed.I admire the manner in which the company has been led by the management team and the board over the past few years. If one reflects on the debate in this House, there were many gloomy predictions on the opposite side of the House in September 2001 with regard to Aer Lingus. I am delighted to say that those prophets of doom did not see the gloom arise. They were confounded, as they will be on this occasion. Aer Lingus needs, and will get, equity so that it can expand its fleet and its services on behalf of all the people, grow employment in the airline and give us access to more new routes both for tourism and business.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The Tánaiste went on radio last Sunday and told the people that we now had the highest level of medical card cover since 1995. She knew that was untrue and was engaged in deliberate deception of the people.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The entire case I wish to make is that deliberate deception is not acceptable — that is my entire point. The Tánaiste knows people are measuring it against the expectation of the Government promise that 200,000 additional medical cards would be made available. She knows, by way of answer to a parliamentary question, that 101,000 cards have been taken out of the system since the election. Some 300,000 cards are required to make up the Government's promise. What she has done is provide 10% of that, 30,000 medical cards. There is a net reduction of 70,000 medical cards on the position as at the 2002 general election before we get to the 200,000 promise at all.The Tánaiste has provided "yellow pack" cards which are for doctor visits only. The services normally associated with a medical card are not available to people who will get the "yellow pack" card. For people in destitution and in terrible, difficult circumstances, it may be welcome but it is not a medical card and the Tánaiste is not entitled to mislead people into believing she has provided a medical card.Will the Tánaiste set the record straight? Parents, who are fearful that they will not be able to afford to bring their child to the doctor, think that when they get medical advice from the doctor, the associated services will be available on the card. That will not happen because these are not medical cards as we know them. This is a device which the Tánaiste's spin doctors have come up with to make believe that she is meeting the commitment made by her predecessor and reiterated so many times, that is, that an additional 200,000 full, proper medical cards with an entitlement to the entire range of services will be provided to people who so badly need them, which is not what has happened.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I listened very carefully in this House over the past number of months to the pleas of Deputy Rabbitte when he questioned the Taoiseach about medical cards. I have a few quotes from Deputy Rabbitte but I will not quote them now.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Tánaiste should do so.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Deputy Rabbitte asked the Taoiseach if he could not ensure that at least people could take their children to the doctor without worrying about the cost.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Deputy Twomey, on behalf of Fine Gael, came out with a policy proposal that we should consider doctor only medical cards and that under a Fine Gael-led Government, the medical card would only be extended to doctor only visits. I am not making political points about that; I am simply saying——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Allow the Tánaiste to speak without interruption.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	16	In regard to the doctor only visit, to which I referred on Sunday, almost 1.4 million people will now be able to go to the doctor without worrying about the cost. That will be the highest number since 1995, notwithstanding the fact the average take home pay has gone up by at least €10,000 in the meantime. In a country where unemployment is down to 4.4%, 1.4 million citizens will have a medical card at least entitling them to access to the doctor. Furthermore, the initiative has been very well received.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	17	By whom?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	18	It has been well received by many representative bodies, except the Labour Party. It is a bit like Aer Lingus, it seems to want a Robert Mugabe-type solution where it can call the aeroplanes off the tarmac.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	19	That is even below the Tánaiste's normal comments.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Those in the Labour Party are the only ones who want no private investment in Aer Lingus.The medical card has been very well received.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Tánaiste must be likening the Taoiseach to Robert Mugabe.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Government could have chosen to go down the traditional route and have given 75,000 more medical cards. We did a combination of things which, in all the circumstances, are right. Furthermore, if anybody is in particular hardship, there is discretion to grant a medical card. Some 70,000 people have medical cards based on the fact there may be illness in the family for a particular period which prevents them from having any earnings, or earnings sufficient to their meet needs. In all the circumstances, what the Government did was right and I am surprised Deputy Rabbitte does not support it given all his calls to the Taoiseach to ensure people were not worried about going to the doctor.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Of course I have called on the Taoiseach to deal with situations where parents are afraid to bring their children to the doctor because they will not be able to afford food for the rest of the week. I do not understand the point the Tánaiste made or the point she made about how much average take home pay has increased. Does she know what the thresholds will be after her 7.5% increase from the new year? A married couple with two children on €285 per week, a married couple with four children on €360 per week and a single person on €155 per week will not qualify for a medical card.What is the point quoting average take home pay figures and stating how much they have improved since 1997? A couple with two children in a very low income job and in receipt of more than €285 per week will not qualify for a medical card, yet the Tánaiste states that the thresholds are higher for her "yellow pack" card. I will tell her what they are. A married couple with two children on €360 per week will not qualify for GP care. Somebody earning €360 per week and who now, thanks to the Tánaiste, will be able to go to the doctor with the doctor only "yellow pack" card, will not be able to get a prescription filled and will not be entitled to any of the other services associated with a medical card. The Tánaiste knows that because she has also increased the drugs refund threshold to €85 per month. She has increased the cost of an overnight stay in hospital by €10 and increased the cost of a visit to an accident and emergency department by €10.Whatever about her Robert Mugabe jibes, which would be more appropriate to the Taoiseach's outburst last week than to me, does the Tánaiste have any appreciation, on her income or on the incomes of the deadbeat Ministers beside her, what it is like to live on €360 per week and still only qualify for a "yellow pack" card?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	24	If Deputy Rabbitte is quoting statistics, he will know that if the people in question pay rent or a mortgage of over €25 per week, all that is added to the income. If he is quoting figures, I would like to make sure he quotes them accurately. Some people who earn €500 or €600 per week will still get a medical card because of rent——

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	27	For people who pay rent or mortgages or have travel to work expenses, it is all added to the income level. That is why so many people have access to medical cards.

Deputy Rabbitte is entitled to hear an answer to his question. The Chair will have to take appropriate action if the interruptions continue.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	30	All expenses over €23 per week to travel to work and all expenses over €25 per week for rent or mortgage are added to the income. Often people do not need to go further than their GP and do not need prescriptions or medication. They will also have access to blood tests. They want the reassurance of the doctor.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Has the Tánaiste visited a GP surgery in a working class area?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	33	It is preferable that people should at least have access to a doctor without worry. Deputy Rabbitte will appreciate that we cannot do everything.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	35	All of this requires significant resources. The GMS will receive increased funding of more than €200 million, or 12% next year. That is a considerable resource. We must have priorities and make choices. Giving as many people as possible access to their GP is reasonable in all the circumstances and removes a significant worry for many parents, particularly with regard to their children.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The Government has more respect for horses than for people.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Before the Estimates were published last Thursday, I asked the Tánaiste whether the Government's policy with regard to overseas development aid was changing. There was some speculation that it might, including from the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan. The Tánaiste said the Government was still committed to its target and there was no change in this regard. I believed her and took this assertion at face value. I am sure Deputy O'Donnell also believed her.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I doubt it.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Why would the Tánaiste not be a person of her word? She will recall the commitment made on 6 September 2000 when the Taoiseach clearly stated to world leaders that:The statistics of poverty and inequality in our world are shocking and shameful. Half the world's population is struggling on less than $2 a day and more than 1 billion on less than $1. Today, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, I wish in this forum to publicly make a commitment to fully meeting the United Nations target of spending 0.7% of GNP on official development assistance.Budget day coincides with World AIDS day. Will the Tánaiste take that opportunity to reinstate the target of 0.7% of GNP? Will she recall, in considering this issue, the words of Mr. BobGeldof when he said: "A promise made by the strong to the weak and hungry must be kept. Anything else is a sort of discreet bullying"? Is the Tánaiste happy to be called a "discreet bully" on behalf of the Government? Will she keep the promise she made that if the commitment to the world's poor were broken, as her colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, tells us it was, that she would resign from Government? I understood she was sincere when she made this commitment. What does she now propose to do? Will the 0.7% target for ODA be reinstated by budget day?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I said in this House a few weeks ago that we needed to move to a multi-annual budgetary situation for ODA in order to provide certainty.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Does the Tánaiste agree with Deputy O'Donnell in this matter? It is a straightforward issue. It is clear that a promise was broken. The Taoiseach made a clear commitment, there was no speaking out of both sides of the mouth. It was straight down the line that 0.7% would be given by 2007. The Taoiseach repeated this assertion again in September 2002 when he said:Significantly increased ODA is essential to meet our goals. The decline in global ODA in the 1990s is shameful, indefensible and inconsistent with the commitments given at Rio. I reiterate Ireland's absolute commitment to achieving by 2007 the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA.

Does the Tánaiste agree that it has been broken? If so, does she also agree that the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, was foolish in caving in? I share Deputy O'Donnell's view in this regard. The Tánaiste has already seen the Taoiseach break his promise. Will she now also break her promise and stay in Government after its solemn commitment on this issue has been broken? She made a commitment that she would not stay in Government if such a promise were broken.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.The latest statistics from the CSO relate to the period 1 January to 30 September 2004. There were 5,147,0000 overseas visitors to Ireland in the first nine months of the year with an estimated expenditure of €2,555 million. This compares to 5,009,000 overseas visitors in the first nine months of 2003 with an estimated expenditure of €2,542 million.There were 4,779,000 overseas visitors in the same period of 2002 with an estimated expenditure of €2,439 million. It is estimated that there were just under 6.4 million overseas visits to Ireland by non-residents in 2003 with an expenditure of €3,198 million.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I tabled these questions to the Taoiseach for oral answer having tabled them on a number of occasions to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. When we have a debate on almost a monthly basis with the Minister we hear those figures are not available to the Department. The availability of such figures is an essential aspect of the debate on tourism. I cannot understand why we have to table a question for written answer or a question to the Minister for oral answer to get answers to questions that are paramount to the debate on tourism. Is it feasible that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism would have available the answers to these types of questions so that we would not have to table questions to the Taoiseach on an ongoing basis to create debate on tourism in another Department?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I agree with the Deputy that figures are crucial in planning in tourism. I will raise this matter with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. Some of the figures show where we need to do more work. One statistic shows that while the number of tourists from the UK has improved, the figures from 2002 to 2004 show a slight decrease of 0.6% in the current quarter which we have just completed. As a result of the findings of those figures the Department is conducting a major marketing campaign to promote tourism, in particular in the UK and further afield. I agree with the Deputy's point and will convey his views to the Minister. However, in terms of overall figures, overseas visitor numbers have increased by 25% from 5 million to 6.2 million since 1997. The Minister was given an increase of 8% in the recent Estimates. Therefore, the Government is conscious of the need to invest more money in marketing.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Following on from Deputy Wall's question, does the Minister of State understand that these figures are plucked out of the air for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism? He believes that rip-off Ireland is a myth. What is the extent of money allocated to promotion of Ireland in America where Fáilte Ireland——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	131	That question does not arise out of these questions which are purely statistical and deal with the Taoiseach's Department and the Central Statistics Office. The question the Deputy is asking is more appropriate to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Do we know the numbers of American visitors who are contacted directly through databases by Fáilte Ireland? Given the state of the American economy, there will probably not be any change in value of the dollar for the next two years, and we are facing the possibility of incurring serious losses there.Is the Minister of State aware of reports that have been published for a number of years saying that up to 5 million extra visitors from Britain would visit here if circumstances were right? What elements of visitors from Britain were Irish returning here on holidays, for weekends or to visit family members? Does he know the element of the British visitors who are English and visit here on holiday as distinct from Irish persons returning here for weekends or for other reasons? Where is the emphasis in Government of promoting Ireland in Europe? Is the emphasis on Italy, Germany, France or Spain?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	133	The Deputy's last question would be more appropriately addressed to the Minster for Arts, Sport and Tourism.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I will rephrase it. Can the Minister of State give a breakdown of the number of visitors who came here from Italy, France, Germany and Spain?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I will be as helpful as I can and I am conscious we are dealing with statistics. I will ask the Minister to give the Deputy precise marketing figures in terms of moneys being invested in tourism promotion in the US and Canada. I can give the Deputy figures for the number of overseas figures from USA and Canada and this relates to the questions tabled. The figures are 675,000 for January to September 2002, 719,000 for January to September 2003 and 781,000 for January to September 2004. Those figures are encouraging in that they show an increase of 15.7% from 2002 to 2004 and an increase of 8.6% from 2003 to 2004.Regarding the Deputy's second question concerning the UK, Tourism Ireland has been mandated by the Minister to focus on and promote tourism in the UK. The Minister is conscious of the need to do more there and the increase in the Estimates will allow him to do that. In compiling these figures, when the staff of the CSO interview people they specifically cover the Irish person travelling to Manchester United or to London or Brussels on business. Those people are recorded in the statistics as Irish people going abroad for business. They are not seen on their return as a tourist. That was the point the Deputy raised.With regard to Europe, it is described in the figures as "other Europe". That means the European Union and beyond, the Europe of 25 members states plus the greater Europe, so to speak. Under the remit of the questions tabled, the figures for Europe show an increase of 12.9% from 2002 to 2004 and an increase of 4.4% from 2003 to 2004. Those figures are encouraging. I stated to Deputy Wall that there is an issue regarding the UK, but it only arose in the last quarter. The Minister is aware of it and we will be focusing on it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Of the number of American visitors who come here, does the Minister of State, and I realise he is not the Minister with responsibility for tourism, have the number of those visitors who came here via London? Are such visitors counted as visitors from England or visitors from America? What is the percentage of the number of American visitors who travel here by way of direct flight to London and who then take a further flight here?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I understand the figures are compiled by carrying out surveys at the airports and ports and collecting data from airlines, travel agencies etc. Percentages are derived based on the overall figures. I understand that CSO staff would have figures from travel agencies and airlines which would show the precise fact pointed out by the Deputy, namely, that visitors travel here via Heathrow in London. I will confirm that to the Deputy if my answer is inaccurate.

Are there plans to provide a more detailed breakdown of visitor figures such as the number of people who visit Ireland to walk here? Fáilte Ireland figures show that the number of walkers have decreased during the past 12 years. If we were able to better identify such categories in the figures, we might be able to tackle the rot that is beginning to set into our tourism industry.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	139	A breakdown of the reasons for journey is given in the figures. One category is holiday, leisure and recreation. On the basis of the questions tabled requesting comparative figures for 2002, 2003 and 2004, the figures are encouraging. The figures for 2002 to 2004 show an increase of 6.6%——

Another category is visits to friends or relatives. Business is another category, the figures for which show an increase of 9.4% for the period from 2003 to 2004. I presume such visits would be related to business-——

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	143	——conferences etc. Walking would come under the category of leisure activities and recreation. If there is a further breakdown in this regard I would be glad to inform the Deputy of it. When CSO staff ask people questions at the ports and airports they probably ask general questions with regard to why they are here, whether on holidays or business. I will put the Deputy's suggestion to them.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The Minister of State partly answered the question I intended to ask. I wish to ask about the sizes of the samples surveyed. How often, when and where are they sampled? The Minister of State mentioned interviews. Are other methods also used to determine the reliability of the figures?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	145	The data are based on the tourism and travel quarterly survey. This is done every three months and the first period is January to March, inclusive. The surveys are carried out at ports and airports. Other data are derived from the household travel survey, which is done through the post. Overall, the data are collated on a quarterly basis and are collected at ports and airports.The household travel survey shows an increase of 10% in the number of domestic holidays in Ireland. There is also an increase in the number of people going abroad. In July to September 2004, 1.75 million people went abroad. This was an increase of 9.8% on last year. The household travel survey is also used, showing an increase in domestic holidays and in the number people going abroad.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Can the Minister of State comment on the statistics recently published by Tourism Ireland which show that passengers from the United States spend more time in Ireland if they access the country through Shannon than if they access it through Dublin? This is particularly true of the number of bed nights and benefits to the region as a whole. The figures also show that 73% of passengers who come through Shannon Airport hire cars in Shannon, compared with 30% in Dublin. These figures should be borne in mind in the negotiations on the bilateral agreement.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	147	Deputy Breen is keeping his eye on the bigger picture. Access to Shannon is a major issue for the Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism and Transport and for the Government in general. I will be glad to convey Deputy Breen's views to the relevant Ministers. Growing business in Shannon and attracting more tourists from the United States, whether they come directly to Dublin or, as Deputy Kenny said, throughLondon, are major issues for the Government. We must attract more people here. I agree that it is important to expand the use of Shannon. This is an important issue for the area.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The Minister of State is on side in that case.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	149	My question relates to the same issue as Deputy Breen's. Does the Minister of State have information regarding whether American tourists choose to go to particular regions of Ireland on the basis of whether or not there is an accessible flight? I understand discussions are opening on the bilateral agreement between the United States and Ireland on the transatlantic routes. Will statistics on the relevance of accessible flights be used in the forthcoming discussions in determining regional tourism balance?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I do not have figures on that issue. Such data do not emerge from the tourism and travel quarterly survey or the household survey. Such data would be relevant to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and I will raise the question with him. I will check and revert to Deputy O'Sullivan. Her question relates to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. It would be useful for him to have such data in planning for Shannon. Some of the issues Deputy O'Sullivan raised are the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and I will convey her questions to him. My remit is the CSO figures for 2002, 2003 and 2004. I will share any data I can with the Deputy and I will convey her views to the two relevant Ministers.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	152	The surveys show the reasons for travelling, under the headings I mentioned to Deputy Gogarty. They do not deal with specific locations.

Would the Minister of State agree that there might be a distortion of the figures for visitors to Ireland from Britain? He has indicated a possible decrease in those numbers. Would he not agree that many may access this country through the Belfast airports or the port of Larne and go on to enjoy visits to various locations throughout the country? I ask that he address the question of whether or not there is a distortion. There is a need for a reflective set of statistics for the whole island of Ireland in line with the work of our promotional agency, Tourism Ireland.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The figures I have quoted relate to our own jurisdiction. The Deputy's point is a valid one. Tourism Ireland is developing tourism for the island of Ireland. In the context of the peace agreement, the resumption of the North South Ministerial Council and co-operation between the various Ministers, North and South, it is important that we extend co-operation and share data. Access to Belfast is clearly important for the overall tourism of the island of Ireland. The question is a valid one and should be pursued in the context of the restoration of the institutions in Northern Ireland and of the Assembly itself.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	156	The answer is, no. I revert to what I said earlier about the categories covered by the "reason for journey" heading. Deputies are making good suggestions and I will be glad to pass them on to the CSO. How far can one go in questioning people at ports and airports? How far should one go without impinging on people's privacy? I will convey the Deputy's views.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	157	The Minister of State wonders how far one can go in asking American tourists in Shannon where they are going.

Did he express horror or joy, did he ring Deputy Healy-Rae or did he simply shrug?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	168	The vital statistics on tourism are excellent.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	170	The Minister and his predecessors have managed to double the tourism budget from €47 million in 1997 to €123 million in the recent Estimate. The budget for front line marketing has gone from €12 million in 1997 to €35.8 million. The increase of 8% in the recent Estimate shows that the Minister and the Government recognise the importance of tourism. That record is one of which the Minister can be proud.

I have not heard questions producing such reaction for a long time. Through the good offices of the Minister of State and of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I hope the problems of tourism can be addressed. I hope the figures will be made available to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism so that they can be debated by the spokespersons in the House. Like many others, I will have an interest in such a debate.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	174	As the Minister of State said, figures are only as relevant as they are useful. The categories into which figures are placed could be more useful if, for example, they were broken down not just in terms of activity but also for the number of tourists who get lost in this country due to poor signposting which is a frequent cause of complaint. The cost of signposting which B& Bs are complaining about because the rate base means they cannot afford to erect signs, is giving rise to a cohort of dissatisfied tourists, which comes to the point of returns.

Major businesses place a huge emphasis on such return tourism business and the Government should do so also. Can the Minister of State indicate how many of the tourism figures relate to return business, or is there any plan to monitor the level of return business? Is it a case of saying "good riddance" when tourists leave the country and do not wish to return because of high costs?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	177	My understanding is that will emerge in the data and I will double check it for the Deputy. As regards signposting, I will convey the Deputy's remarks to the relevant Minister.

The budget has gone from €47 million to €123 million for 2005. The front line marketing budget has gone from €12 million to €35.8 million. With regard to overall productivity and the impact on the economy, tourism affects so many people with regard to employment in so many sectors. I am simply quoting figures I got from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.

Can the Minister of State confirm that numbers are down in the west? As regards access, given that some 20 million people come in through Dublin and Cork airports as against a projected 400,000 through Knock Airport, does the Minister of State think it would be much better to invest the €40 million in Knock Airport, which is necessary?

It is not my responsibility, but my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, will try to do something about that. The figures I have are formed on a national basis. If there is any additional information following the queries that have been put to me today, I will be glad to share it with Deputies.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	216	May I ask for a statistical response so that we can have the evidence for the argument the Government made to the people? That is all I am asking. I want the figures.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	217	There is a Bill being debated in the House later on this very issue and the Deputy can raise the matter then.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	218	So the Minister of State does not have the figures.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	219	There is a decline.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	220	Well done, Tánaiste.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I call Deputy Boyle, followed by Deputy Burton.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The Minister of State should check the CSO figures. Perhaps the Minister of State can pass them on to the Minister who does not have them. He told us that on Committee Stage.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	223	There is a decline. I will obtain the figures for the Deputy.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I am sorry, Deputy Costello, but I have called Deputy Boyle so perhaps you would allow him to submit his question.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	225	Are statistics being gathered as regards tourists who access the island through the Belfast city airports and through Larne ferryport? Is the Central Statistics Office engaged in surveying visitors who are touring the whole island, having accessed the country at those particular points?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	226	As I said in an earlier response, that is a matter for North-South co-operation, which should pertain with regard to the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and the sort of North-South ministerial co-operation we had in the past.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	227	So we do not know, basically.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	228	No. Clearly, these figures are based on our own jurisdiction. In the context of tourism information being shared on a North-South basis, that will be part of the agenda moving forward.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	229	When CSO officials are interviewing people at airports and sea ports do they ask visitors about their experiences with regard to prices, signposting and other issues? If so, does the Minister of State have any statistics on the responses? If not, will he supply them to us by separate cover?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I am repeating myself. The facts and figures I have pertain to the reasons for travelling, including holidays, business, etc. I have no further details here.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Are they asked about those issues?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I presume that many other surveys are undertaken on those issues. It would be necessary to do so. I will revert back to the Deputy on that matter.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I thank the Minister of State.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The Minister of State's predecessor was kind enough to give me statistics on the number of Irish people who are married to non-nationals, particularly from countries outside the EU. As a result of the interviews that are carried out, does the Minister of State have statistics on the number of people coming here for family visits, by visa, from areas such as the Indian sub-continent, Africa and the Far East? How many people are being allowed to visit Irish families or their families of origin now living in Ireland? I am sure it will be a surprise to the Minister of State that most Deputies are besieged by people who are living in this country because, even when grandchildren are born here, no allowance is made for their grandparents to visit them.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	235	That does not arise out of this question, which is purely on the statistics.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Some months ago the Minister of State's predecessor was kind enough to give me the earlier statistics for last year. Could the Minister of State comment on the matter?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I would be happy to follow up on any information the Deputy wants. I come back to the point the Deputy and others made about the kinds of people surveyed. In this survey we are talking about overnight visitors. The Household Travel Survey by the Central Statistics Office defines an overnight visitor as follows:An overnight visitor is a visitor who stays at least one night in collective or private accommodation in the place, county or country visited . . .  Consequently the following are excluded:Short-distance local transport and commuting i.e. more or less regular trips between place of work/study and place of residence.Routine or regular visits e.g. visiting parents every weekend.For visits of more than 12 consecutive months, a traveller will be considered a resident of that place (from a statistical standpoint).Migratory movements for work purposes.It goes on to outline those excluded from domestic travel. I would be very happy to follow what was done by my predecessor, Deputy Hanafin, in supplying any information the Deputy requires.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	238	While this is no reflection on the Minister of State, from the point of view of satisfaction, I ask the Ceann Comhairle whether the line Minister could come to the House to answer the statistical questions and the related questions, which the Minister of State is now attempting to answer second-hand.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	239	As this is purely a statistical question, that matter does not arise.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	240	As Deputy Wall has said, it is important for the line Minister to answer the statistical question and the related detailed questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, could answer.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I would be delighted to answer, if I could.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I was referring to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	244	On the Committee Stage of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill last week, I asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to supply the figures for the numbers of tourists, as described by him during the referendum campaign and since, who had come to Ireland specifically for the purpose of having an Irish-born child and to get Irish citizenship. He stated that he had no such figures. I ask the Minister of State whether any such figures in the survey would have been of use to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We are about to take Report Stage of the same legislation and the Minister will have made this statement on numerous occasions in public as justification for his referendum and his new legislation, for which no scientific basis seems to exist. Does the CSO survey contain any such figures?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I do not believe, and if I am wrong I will come back to the Deputy——
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I do not believe him either.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	247	——that any of these figures would be of help to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as they are very much tourist related. The question tabled by Deputy Wall related to tourism and I have done my best to answer it. I have already given details of some categories of people who are excluded. The report also states:The following are excluded from International travel:Persons leaving the country as migrants, including dependants accompanying or joining them.It refers to people leaving and coming in. The kind of information the Deputy seeks is not contained.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	248	In that case the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would have had no formal scientific basis for his statement.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	249	While I am not trying to do the Ceann Comhairle's job, I presume these are questions the Deputy can put to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ascertain the kinds of data he has.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not need a scientific basis for anything he says.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of urgent public concern, namely, the necessity for the Minister for State with responsibility for housing to make a statement outlining his Department's position on the proposals by Dublin City Council to extend the right to purchase provisions to flat complexes and to inform the House whether he will withhold agreement to those proposals until necessary legislation and/or regulations for the management of apartment complexes in the public, private and voluntary sectors is introduced.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	255	In accordance with the terms Standing Order 31 I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and significant matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the need to conduct a regional economic impact study on the effect of any change to the gateway status of Shannon Airport before entering into bilateral negotiations with the US Government on transatlantic aviation.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate a matter of national importance, namely, the serious deterioration in law and order in County Donegal and the latest atrocity where a 74-year-old deaf pensioner has been beaten almost to death in his home and at present is recovering at Letterkenny General Hospital.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of extreme importance, namely, the urgent need to ensure the retention of all-year-round direct transatlantic services through Shannon Airport, together with a guarantee from the Government, in light of its recent announcement that immediate negotiations will be sought to progress an EU/US open skies agreement, that it will put forward a special case for Shannon in those negotiations.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	259	It is proposed to take No. 1, motion re referral to select committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with EUFOR; No. 21 Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill 2004 — Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; No. 3, Health Bill 2004 — Second Stage (resumed), to be taken not later than immediately following the conclusion of Private Members' business tonight and the order shall not resume thereafter. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (i) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.; (ii) No. 11a shall be decided without debate; and Private Members’ business shall be No. 43, motion re roads infrastructure (resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m.

Is the proposal for dealing with the late sitting agreed? Agreed.Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11a, motion re referral to select committee without debate, agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	261	While I do not have any problem with the proposal, on 9 November the Government authorised the Minister for Defence to proceed with this matter. What was the reason for the long delay in the UN Security Council passing a resolution in this regard? The Tánaiste will be aware that 12 members of the Permanent Defence Force are serving in the SFOR headquarters and that UN approval is not required for up to 12 members. This is what is known as a Chapter 7 mission, which allows the use of force for the protection of our forces and the international civil presence. While there is a UN resolution relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina, what is the Tánaiste's view on Irish troops being prevented from serving in Macedonia in a similar mission because China blocked the Security Council resolution? Does the Tánaiste have a view on changing the triple-lock mechanism, which seemed to be responsible in this case?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	262	That matter does not arise. We are dealing exclusively with No. 11a. I call Deputy Rabbitte.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	263	It does arise, as they are both similar missions.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	264	We will hear from the Taoiseach after we hear from Deputy Rabbitte.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I would be happy to hear the Tánaiste's reply.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	268	The Green Party is concerned that this represents a breach of the precedent established in this House that where the Dáil is asked to approve a contingency like this, with which we have no problem in principle given the UN endorsement of the operation, there would be a debate in the House. That was the case before sending troops to Liberia. The debate on the triple lock mechanism has focused largely on the role of the United Nations but the role of this House is equally important. If the approval of Dáil Éireann is to be sought, it must be an informed approval based on a debate in the House. This is too serious a matter to hive it off to a committee and bring it back without a debate in this House and we ask that the matter be given time for debate, as has happened in the past.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I support Deputy Sargent, the proposition should be brought before the House. We are seeking approval and if it is an urgent requirement for Bosnia Herzegovina, an emergency debate should be necessary. It is important to take on board the financial aspects outlined in the briefing note that would have us understand that there is a cost involved yet previous Ministers have told us that EU referral policy has no financial implications and does not involve increases in defence spending. There may be conflict on the information now presented in the briefing document and previous responses by Ministers for Defence. The only way this can be properly aired is in a full debate in this House. I support the view that it should not be taken without debate and that such matters are substantive items for address by all Deputies.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	270	It is proposed that we refer this to committee but that sets a bad precedent. I have no objection in respect of this mission but, generally, when we are sending troops abroad on such a mission, it ought to be done by a decision of the full House. I ask the Tánaiste to address that point.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The mission requires a motion to be approved by the full House and that will be forthcoming.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	272	Approved with debate.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	273	We are open to that. Government approval was subject to a UN mandate and the Security Council only passed a resolution on Monday, 22 November, which explains the delay between the decision and this matter coming before us now.We take part in these missions under a UN mandate so if a country like China objects, we cannot participate. There are clear inconsistencies, as I have said before on the stance we have taken on some foreign policy issues. As time moves on, I hope we can debate these issues and come to a resolution that requires us to be able to act more independently on occasions where circumstances merit our participation.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	279	Thinking of the talks in Downing Street, that we hope will be successful, some legislation is dependent on the outcome of those talks and the re-establishment of the institutions. Given that there is no publication date for the legislation for a register of people considered unsafe to work with children or the Foyle and Carlingford fisheries Bill, can the Tánaiste indicate if those Bills are ready should it be possible to take them in the event of a successful outcome to the talks and the re-establishment of the institutions in the North?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	280	That matter is not dependent on the talks, although there is a North-South element to the proposal and the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has appointed an implementation group to advise in this area.

When can we expect the fines Bill to allow for the payment of fines through indexation?

Can she be more specific than 2005?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I cannot be more specific, I can only say it will be published next year. There has been major legislative change in recent years to update the law on financial services and to strengthen the regulatory powers of the State in this area. This is a continuation of that work.

When will the information equality authority Bill be published? Since the current Health Bill is being unnecessarily rushed through this House, can the Tánaiste guarantee that there will be a two week period between the publication of this Bill and its introduction so Members and interested parties outside the House can see it and consult on the establishment of the information equality authority?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	291	It has not been put on the long finger. To expedite the new management and administrative regime we will put in place, we removed it from the Health Bill. I will publish the heads of the Bill and give at least two weeks to ensure there is widespread consultation.

With three weeks left in this session half of these Bills still have not seen the light of day. Given that debate time will be taken up with the Social Welfare Bill and legislation already in the system, will the Tánaiste indicate how many of these Bills will remain unpublished when the House rises in three weeks time?

The disability legislation is a priority and that Bill has already been published. The Health Bill is before the House and the Report and Final Stages of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill 2004 are scheduled for today. Has the Deputy a specific Bill in mind?
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	301	There is particular legislation, such as the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill, the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill, the Registration of Deeds and Title Bill and the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Bill.

This is a momentous decision and could affect the entire western part of the country.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	314	It is not correct that the Government has given the go-ahead for the renegotiation of the Ireland-US aviation agreement. It agreed that some preliminary work would be done at official level with the United States to establish the state of play as regards this whole area. As the Deputy knows, competence in this matter is now at EU rather than the domestic level. Clearly, the Government is anxious because of the strategic importance for Ireland of aviation contacts with the US, to have as much information available to us as possible. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has briefed the Government on the current state of play and there will be discussions with the US authorities at official level over the next while. This is a matter which is appropriate for discussion in this House, either at committee level or in some other forum.

Will the Tánaiste confirm again whether the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, who is sitting behind her, is the Minister with responsibility for e-government, since a question I asked him last week about open-sourced technology was referred to the Minister for Finance? It should come within the remit of a Minister of State with responsibility for e-government, if we had one. The former Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, used to answer such questions.

I refer specifically to Members' rights because serious inconsistencies exist as regards decisions being made. A priority question of mine was disallowed today, for example, because it pre-empted discussion on the Estimates, I was told. Three other questions, however, which directly relate to Estimates, Questions Nos. 8, 39 and 64, were allowed. I want to know what protection Members such as I have when we table priority questions every five weeks or so which are ruled out of order.

Amendment No. 2 is in the name of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and arises out of proceedings on Committee Stage. Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 16 are related. Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 7, 9, 10 and 16 will be taken together.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 3, line 7, after "1956" to insert the following:"AND TO PROVIDE FOR RELATED MATTERS".These are issues we discussed in some detail on Committee Stage. I, along with my colleagues, Deputy Costello in particular, felt we had made a compelling case for some amendments to the Bill. We had hoped that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, might have given some consideration to those arguments in the meantime, and perhaps have been willing to reconsider the rather hardline approach he adopted on Committee Stage. He is not here today, but I hope he might have left a briefing instruction for the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, which would enable him to at least give full consideration to some of these amendments.Amendment No. 2 is a formal amendment. If amendments are passed that go somewhat beyond mere amendment of the 1956 Act obviously the long title should refer not only to the amendment of the 1956 Act but to the fact that this Bill will also provide for related matters. However, that is a technical formality.Amendment No. 3 is a proposal that:Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall publish the guidelines which are applied by the Department of Justice in determining whether to grant leave to remain to the non-national parents of an Irish born child.The problem is that in many issues arising by way of application to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform people are applying in the dark. They are not sure what standards they are expected to meet and what guidelines there are, if any, by which their applications will be judged. During the earlier exchanges on the Bill, both on Second and Committee Stages, it emerged, somewhat unbelievably, by way of admission from the Minister that there are no guidelines. That is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. If we are applying a system where basic rules of justice should apply, people should know the rules. That is the reason I am anxious that within a short time after the passing of this Bill the Minister should publish guidelines to be applied by the Department in determining whether to grant leave to remain to the non-national parents of an Irish born child. I would like to see such guidelines for all applications to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.We have a whole system for non-nationals whether they are applying for a visa — a tourist or holiday visa — permission to visit their relatives, permission to stay a while, permission to play rugby during the winter season for a club, applications for work permits, temporary or permanent applications for naturalisation after a period, because of long residence or a blood connection with an existing Irish person. I see the whole system as being a total mess. There are 19 different Acts covering all that area and there are countless regulations. Apart from the structure being all over the place, there does not appear to be any clear guidelines for those who wish to apply under the system.This amendment is particularly focused on the position of non-national parents of an Irish born child. The Minister will be aware that prior to the Supreme Court decision early in 2003 there was an understanding that parents of an Irish born child had, virtually, an automatic right to stay here to mind their Irish child. The decision of the Supreme Court in the L and O case turned that on its head and, effectively, decided there was not such an automatic right. Those parents who were here before the Supreme Court decision are in one category. Those parents of Irish born children who have been here since the Supreme Court decision, up to the referendum on 11 June, are in another category and there are parents of Irish born children, where the child has been born since the referendum on 11 June. That third category includes such parents who have children born up to the date of the passing of this legislation. There are three separate categories and there is no clarity on their position. There should be clarity as those people are in limbo. The Minister, under some cross-examination, admitted on Committee Stage he does not even know how many people are involved. He referred to figures of 9,000, possibly ranging up to 16,000 if the more recent parents, as opposed to the parents affected by the L and O case, are taken into account. He referred also to problems that may arise if family-related applicants were given permission to stay. It is important, given that we have the opportunity to deal with this matter, that there is clarity for those people. It is not fair that some of those who have been here for years are left in limbo. The purpose of this amendment is to ask the Minister to agree to establish those guidelines immediately after the passing of this Act.The other amendments with which I am directly involved under this grouping are Nos. 9 and 16. Amendment No. 9 proposes an amnesty for the non-national parents of Irish born children where such children were born before the Supreme Court decision of January 2003. A case can be made for rights of residence to be extended to any parent of an Irish citizen. That is a starting point. A particular case can be made for the parents of Irish children who were born before the Supreme Court decision in January 2003. The reason I suggest an amnesty should apply to such non-national parents is that they came here in the legitimate expectation that if their child was born here they would be entitled to remain in Ireland, which was the law of the land as it stood at that time. I will not go into the issue of whether that was right or wrong. That was the legal position as everybody understood it. The legitimate expectation at the time was that parents of Irish born children would be automatically allowed to stay in Ireland. I do not know the numbers involved but the Minister thinks the figure of 9,000 is a rough guesstimate, he does not know. I take it the ballpark figure is somewhere around that. We are not talking about an enormous number of people. In fact we are looking for people to come into the country at this stage because of a shortage of labour.We now have an attitude which is very different to that which obtained when the door was virtually closed on anybody coming into the country. Surely the new attitude should apply in particular to the non-national parents of Irish children, especially those who are in this country based on the legitimate expectation that they will be allowed to remain here. They have a very strong case.I was greatly disappointed to learn from the Minister in earlier Dáil exchanges that he had already deported 37 non-nationals with Irish-born children. He did not explain why, which is another problem. Apart from the case I made regarding their having an Irish connection, there is a very strong humanitarian case for allowing them to remain in the country. Some of them have been here for three, four or five years and some have a number of Irish-born children. They are virtually part of the communities in which the reside in so far as they are allowed to be, given that they are still affected by the fact that they are only allowed limited residency rights and are not allowed to work. This problem needs to be and should be tackled immediately. The case for an amnesty is very strong, particularly for the non-national parents of Irish citizens born in Ireland before January 2003. Cases regarding children born subsequent to January 2003 must also be dealt with in a humanitarian way. The case of those who came here in the legitimate expectation that they would be entitled to stay here is particularly strong.Amendment No. 16 provides for the establishment of an appeals committee. I worry about a system that is totally closed, has no guidelines pertaining thereto and in which applicants for asylum status are virtually on trial without knowing the rules or who is doing the trying. A book that made a strong impression on me when I read it was The Trial by Kafka. To a degree, the system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in all these areas is Kafkaesque. There is no openness or transparency, which is wrong.There is no provision for appeal in the system and therefore the third string to my present bow is the proposal that there should be an appeals committee whose function would be to hear appeals of non-national parents of Irish-born children against decisions of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to refuse leave to remain in respect of one or both parents. The appeals system I propose would be reasonably, if not fully, independent but the Minister should have a representative of his Department on the committee. It should also comprise a retired member of the Judiciary and a member of the Human Rights Commission. The latter, or somebody nominated by him or her, would be the chairperson of the committee. Maurice Manning currently holds the position of president of the Human Rights Commission. The committee would provide an independent appeals system to ensure the necessary transparency, openness and fairness in determinations regarding residency status. We should bear in mind that such determinations affect the lives of people who came to this country in the reasonable expectation that they could stay here. Some who are on the verge of being turfed out have been here for four or five years.Amendment No. 16 also provides that in the determination of appeals, "the primary consideration of the Appeals Committee shall be towards humanitarian aspects of each person's case." I would not want an appeals committee to consider only the economic benefits of allowing non-nationals to reside and work in Ireland, bearing in mind that such benefits would exist if the applicants in question were allowed to work.I have outlined the three legs of my approach under this group of amendments. I would like to hear other Members of the House speak on them and related amendments.

It is now clear that citizenship in this State is no longer based on birth. I disagree with this but accept the result. We must move on. As the previous speaker pointed out, thousands of people are living in limbo and do not know what their future holds. A measure of any nation's degree of civilisation is the way in which it treats the less well-off and marginalised. Despatching these people to purgatory is not good enough for Ireland in the 21st century.We need to treat the people in question with some humanity, compassion and coherence. I therefore suggest that we allow the parents and siblings of any child born in the State prior to 1 March 2003 to have the right to reside in the State. We had the Supreme Court judgment on 23 January 2003 and we continued to accept applications for several weeks thereafter. We need to have some clarity for those affected. If we used 1 March 2003 as the cut-off date, it would acknowledge the status of those concerned and clarify their future.The worst thing in the world is to be stuck in a limbo without knowing what might happen to one. I find it absurd that there is some official in the Department busy every so often issuing passports to children who are about to be deported along with their parents in the dead of night. It is absurd that the State of which I am a citizen deals with the marginalised in such an appalling way. One small step in addressing this is to grant a right to remain in Ireland to the group of people in question and their immediate families. They require some recognition, acceptance and welcome.I am not sure if the term "amnesty" is appropriate in this debate. Rather, "recognition" should be used. An amnesty in not needed because the people in question did nothing wrong. The only problem is that they were born in this country to parents who were not citizens of Ireland. They themselves are citizens of Ireland. Original sin does not apply in this case and given that the children's parents have done nothing wrong, they should have a right to remain in this State. It is absurd that the State should consign them to limbo for days, weeks, months or years.Many people say to public representatives that they just want a decision on their cases and those of their children to clarify whether they have the right to remain in Ireland. Bruce Morrison stated quite eloquently that Irish immigration policy is a mess. Let us clear up the mess, introduce clarity and move on from our present position. I do not understand why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, seems to be set upon sitting on the fence forever. The purpose of the two amendments I have tabled is to ensure some clarity and closure for a group of vulnerable people who should have a right to remain on this island and grow up as Irish citizens enjoying the protection, support and recognition of the State.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	345	We all tabled similar amendments on Committee Stage, which have the same intent and thrust. While I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on his appointment, it is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who should be here because we are dealing with a fundamental issue such as the outcome of a referendum and the legislation that will put that on a statutory basis.The issue with which we are dealing concerns thousands of people born here. We are saying on this side of the House that it is time for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government to make a decision in regard to these children and their parents who are in no man's land. Deputy Cuffe said that Bruce Morrison stated Irish immigration policy is a mess but, even closer to home, Deputy O'Donnell described it as a shambles, which is another apt description of Government immigration policy.This is something we can deal with and on which we can make a decision. It has been around since the L and O decision in January 2003. Virtually every case covered by the Supreme Court decision is still in the pipeline two years later. The Minister issued 37 deportation orders but how many people did he allow to have residency status here? These are the deportation decisions but what about the other cases, of which I understand there were very few? The Minister of State might provide these statistics. It appears the Minister put everything on hold until after the referendum and the enactment of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill. He then tells us to leave it with him, he is a decent, generous and practical man and he will make the correct decision. So far he has shown no indication of doing anything of that nature.It would be appropriate to make a decision at this time. We are moving into a new dispensation following the referendum and it is time to tidy up all the outstanding loose ends since we are dealing with parents, children and families. A clear-cut decision arises out of the referendum which is now being translated into legislation. It is important to take people out of their misery. They have been living in limbo for too long. They do not know whether they will be allowed to remain in Ireland permanently or whether they will be taken into custody and deported. A number of people are allowed to remain in custody awaiting deportation for a considerable period, particularly in Clover Hill jail. These people have not committed a crime. They have not been convicted of an offence, nevertheless, this is the detention place for many people awaiting deportation. The Minister of State might address this issue.There are sufficient grounds for regularising the situation and giving the equivalent of an amnesty to all those waiting in the pipeline. As Deputy Cuffe said, they have not committed a crime, therefore, we should not even think in terms of giving an amnesty. What we need is regularisation of their situation in terms of their entitlement to reside here and eventually become Irish citizens if they so wish. Prior to the L and O decision, a scheme was in place, recognised by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Messages were communicated to non-national parents of Irish citizens that they embark on a particular procedure rather than going through the asylum process. They moved into a different channel to have their cases processed. That ended a few weeks after the L and O decision and people had to revert to the asylum process. It may not have been statutorily recognised but that scheme was a formal recognised mechanism. There were reasonable expectations that anyone with an Irish born child would be entitled to residency here, which is what had happened prior to the L and O case. There is every reason to accept that argument, continue with the principle enshrined in the mechanism, and to provide people with the necessary status that would have been given if the L and O case had not been dealt with.I do not understand why we cannot examine this matter in a rational manner and deal with it on a collective basis. If we deal with the issue on a non-collective basis, as the Minister is currently doing, I cannot see how progress will be made. It will mean thousands of people in the pipeline awaiting a decision on their entitlement to reside here. Most people to whom we refer have been here for several years. There are very few people who have not been three to four years awaiting a decision. The old adage that justice delayed is justice denied applies. We have all dealt with people who have been here for an inordinate length of time. As I said on Committee Stage, I am dealing with a parent of a nine year old Irish born child who has no indication when his case will be dealt with. It is impossible to get information from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, other than one or two line responses that the case is in the pipeline, which is not acceptable.It is not acceptable that the Department operates in that fashion on our behalf. We must remember that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is an arm of the Government, and it is taxpayers' money which pays for the good civil servants, some of whom are with us here today. However, the Department has an air of secrecy and there is lack of accountability. There is an in-house mechanism for dealing with applications. This includes the applications commissioner, the appeals tribunal and there is no independent mechanism to verify what is going on. There must be some quirk in a system that results in people being more successful following an appeal than they were in the first instance. Anyone in his right mind would think that if one makes an application for something, the likelihood is the application will get a fair hearing in the first instance and be refused or accepted, but when it goes to an appeal, a much smaller number of cases will be upheld subsequently. However, the reverse is true when it comes to dealing with refugee applications. This is a question the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not answered.It is time there was an independent monitoring mechanism along the lines suggested by Deputy O'Keeffe in regard to Irish born children. This is necessary across the board so that we can see what is going on in terms of an external body. There have already been problems regarding the internal Garda complaints mechanism. The Minister is about to address those by appointing an ombudsman because accountability and transparency are so important. When thousands of people do not know what is happening regarding their cases, it is all the more important to have an independent external body to oversee matters.The lack of statistics has bedevilled this debate from the beginning. This morning the Minister of State at the Department to the Taoiseach, Deputy Tom Kitt, answered questions on behalf of the Taoiseach on the number of tourists coming here. I have not seen the questions that were asked, but there was a fair degree of clarity regarding why people come here as tourists, how long they spend here and the purpose of their visit. However, when we asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give figures relating to the number of citizenship tourists, which he proclaimed loudly and often in the run-up to the referendum, he was unable to give any. He stated that it would be very difficult to obtain such figures.The first question is whether he has tried to get those figures. He has given guesstimates, but he spoke mainly about the difficulty of getting figures, even though he was so certain prior to the referendum that he had figures that showed clearly that citizenship tourism was overwhelming this nation. Now he cannot give any figures. Apparently he has not checked the CSO figures on tourism.It should be possible to examine the figures on a computer database and relate the number of people who come here to the numbers who go to the maternity hospitals and from there go to register their children and obtain birth certificates and passports and then leave the country. Surely there is a tracking mechanism the Minister can follow to obtain figures when we are talking of something as fundamental as changing our Constitution for the reasons given by the Minister.Even at this late stage, I would have expected the Minister to come up with some figures. He has not. His failure to do so puts in question the bona fides of the arguments presented by the Government side in the run-up to the local and European elections to get out the vote in a manner that will certainly not improve race relations on this island.I spoke earlier about the reasonable expectation that people have, which is enshrined in law. In addition to that, there is a constitutional entitlement to family life. That is given a very strong position in Irish society. Irish born children of immigrants would be entitled to all of that, to the benefits of having their families around them, living in Ireland in the society into which they were born, with Irish citizenship as their birthright. Now it has been decided that these families can be removed from the country. They could leave their Irish citizen children behind. However, if they did that it would disrupt family life. Under this legislation all the Irish born children who are citizens will effectively be deported; if their parents are deported they, being babies, will also be deported.The Minister will say he is not statutorily deporting any child. However, what he is doing is effective deportation. Furthermore, the country to which these children have been deported may very well be a Third World country where the level of education, social and health services may be such that their development is severely stunted. When they reach the age of 18, they can come to this country as Irish citizens claiming their birthright, which is not just the right to live here but the right to everything else that goes with that. These include rights relating to their development, education, health services, their future careers, all of which will have been stunted, possibly forever, because of a decision to deport their parents. They, as children in arms, have no say in the matter. They cannot make a decision to stay here, and there is no context for them to stay here without their parents.These are problems that may arise in the future. It is another reason for coming to grips with the problem now rather than leaving it for another generation to deal with, a running sore in the body politic. Let us make a firm decision to deal with it once and for all. We are making a fresh beginning regarding how we treat children born here since the referendum and this new legislation. We can and should grasp the nettle and deal with this issue now, and we should deal with it generously.

We should first have comprehensive immigration legislation and then address this issue if required. Since I was elected, I and others have asked the Minister to produce such legislation. On each occasion we have been told it is in preparation and would be brought forward at some stage. We still have no indication when it will appear. It is, therefore, difficult for me to deal with the legislation before us in any way other than to ask that it be withdrawn.I have tried to table amendments to regularise some aspects of immigration that are being discussed inside and outside this House. This legislation is premature. We should not deal with it at this stage. We should deal with the other issues in comprehensive immigration legislation covering all aspects of immigration. If we had such legislation we might not need the legislation we are debating today. The Minister bandied figures about and indulged in scaremongering in the run-up to the referendum. He said in his Second Stage speech that our asylum system is used by people who do not have a genuine need for protection under the Geneva Convention, as a vehicle to gain entry to the State in circumvention of normal immigration controls. He did not produce figures to support that. It was a wild assertion to create a scare within the State. It was a repetition of his approach to the referendum. From my party's point of view, we lost the referendum and we must deal with the consequences.However, if the Minister had concentrated on providing the figures to the House and being reasonable rather than making pronouncements and soundbites to the media, we might have been able to deal with specifics, which we have not been able to do. That said, if people are abusing our immigration laws, the abusers should be dealt with, not those who have complied fully with the laws, the legislation as it pertains and the international conventions. Instead of targeting the abusers the Minster is introducing a blanket approach which is not the proper way to deal with legislation.Given that the Minister is a Minister for inequality who proclaimed that he believes in inequality, what else can we expect of him? I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will change that attitude and will become a Minister for equality. If he and the Government believe in equality, their only option is to withdraw the Bill. It has been found to be contrary to the best interests of the child, a matter on which a detailed note or observation was drawn up by the Human Rights Commission. I will return to this issue because it is related to the amendments before us.While we are discussing Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment concerning the sub-title, my amendment seeks to amend the Title which explains that the Bill intends to deprive people of equal rights to citizenship. My amendment No. 10, is slightly different from the amendments of other Members in that, as I argued on Committee Stage, it seeks that the removal of citizenship from children born in this country would be effected after the Bill has been enacted rather than on the date on which the court decided or the date of the passing of the referendum. The logical date is the date the Bill comes into effect. If we accept that date, we would regularise the situation of the parents of Irish citizens born before or after the L and O case but prior to the enactment of this legislation.

The amendments deal with the right to remain of parents and siblings of Irish born children.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I am speaking on amendment No. 10 which calls for the regularisation of Irish citizen children born before and after the L and O case, before the referendum and prior to the enactment of this legislation. I seek to ensure that these child citizens' equal rights to the care and company of their parents and to remain in the country of their birth is secured, whatever about the rights of children born after the Bill is enacted. The Bill recognises that all those born before should retain citizenship rights. I ask for nothing less than that the Minister should give citizenship and entitlements — other Members called it an amnesty — up to the date of the enactment of the Bill.The legislation cannot be retrospective and cannot deny people their citizenship before it is enacted, which is what the Minister stated as his intention when he refused to contemplate any formula in regard to the child citizens born here of non-national parents. Since the referendum, the Minister has accelerated the deportation of parents of Irish children, which means he is not even complying with his own legislation and is trying to ensure that perhaps 20,000 people cannot enjoy their rights as parents of Irish citizens.The Human Rights Commission made a submission which questioned certain aspects of the duties of the State to protect against all forms of discrimination. If we pass the Bill, we will discriminate against children who should be Irish citizens prior to the enactment of this law. The State has ratified the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which means the Government has undertaken an obligation to ensure and to demonstrate that any legislative initiative does not impact in a discriminatory fashion on any group in society. This group, namely, Irish children of non-national parents, would be discriminated against in this way.Article 2.1 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights sets forth the general obligation of the state parties to guarantee protection of rights at the national level and also outlines the concept of unlawful discrimination in the enjoyment of human rights. Article 2.1 states:Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.It is set out in black and white for the Minister that there should be no discrimination on the basis of birth, which would happen if the Minister is not willing to accede to my amendment. Article 26 of the covenant states:All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.Birth is again referred to in this instance.Article 2.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is not dissimilar to that which I have already quoted and prohibits discrimination of any kind against any child in the state parties' jurisdiction, irrespective of the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race, colour, etc. The Bill, if introduced in this format without the recognition of the status of Irish children to the care of their parents on this island, would be discriminatory and in breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 22 of this convention supplements the principle of non-discrimination by requiring states to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status of his or her parents, legal guardians or family members.The Human Rights Commission's document refers to Article 8.1 of European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees the right to respect for family and private life. Article 8.2 of that convention states:There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.The Government should not counter, clash with or breach that Article in accepting this legislation without amendment. The State has obligations to respect family life under Article 8, to extend positive obligations to protect, as well as negative obligations not to interfere arbitrarily in family life.Certain figures were bandied about by the Minister. In a submission by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Ms Aisling Reidy noted that if one accepted what the Minister alleged, that women were presenting late in pregnancy to hospitals in Dublin and were thus in his eyes abusing our system and laws, the figure of 116 late pregnancy non-national presentations to the Coombe Women's Hospital represents only 6.7% of births to all non-national women in that hospital. There are approximately 1.8 million people born outside Ireland who would be entitled to Irish citizenship. If one were to take it that 6.7% of those citizens would apply for Irish passports for reasons of convenience, that would come to more than 120,000 people, a far greater number than those who were allegedly taking advantage of this country by giving birth in hospitals in this State.As Deputy Costello said, the entire debate is being made very difficult because the Minister has not proven the case. He has not given us the facts and figures. He has not shown that he has even done his homework. When one does not do one's school homework, one cannot proceed. We should not be proceeding in this matter because we are moving into a blind alley as we do not know the effects of this legislation. We do not even know if it is required. Any cursory look at the wild figures thrown around shows that they do not stand up to scrutiny.What we have needed throughout this debate is facts and figures. It is very easy to extrapolate how many people will be affected by this legislation by looking at the birth rate in our hospitals, by making a phone call to check the figures in our registry office in Lombard Street East. All the relevant offices are computerised so that only the press of a button is required. It might take a week or two for all the figures to be tabulated but the Minister began demanding last March that we deal with this issue urgently. More than seven months later we are still awaiting facts and figures from the Minister.It is disgraceful that once again the Minister has not bothered to be present when a major aspect of his legislative programme is being discussed. He is demanding that this matter be rushed through the House and he has put pressure on us. This is not the first but the fourth or fifth time since I have been elected that the Minister has told us that we must rush forward certain legislation, his own little hobby horses, yet he has not bothered to turn up in this House to listen to and partake in the debate. It is no slight on the Minister of State present today, but this matter is the Minister's baby and he should be here to listen to and answer the points made by Deputies.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	349	There are many foreign nationals in my county, some of them seeking asylum and citizenship. Currently we have a doctor practising in this country for the past nine years, and living with his wife and family. Six months ago he applied for citizenship. I was lucky enough to make contact today with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but I ask those on the other side of the House how I might contact the Department when I am in my office in Ennis and want to make an inquiry about citizenship for one of my constituents. For the past two and a half years I have only been able to get in touch with an answering machine. If I am attending the Dáil I may be lucky enough to be put through but I cannot make contact when in my constituency office.A young lady has been attending Coláiste Mhuire in Ennis for two years. With the support of her teachers she wishes to stay in this country until she can sit her Leaving Certificate exam. Last week she was served with a deportation order. She merely wants to sit her Leaving Certificate exam and then return to where she came from.This Bill wishes to ensure that immigration policies include provision for permanent residency status and the conferring of citizenship on residents in order that immigrants may freely enjoy the same security rights and entitlements as Irish and EU citizens living in Ireland. The Bill appears to be more liberal than similar Bills in other EU jurisdictions. However, it highlights the fact that in respect of entitlement to Irish citizenship of children born in Ireland to non-national parents, at least one parent must be living in this country for three years. That does not take into account the length of time a person may have been seeking asylum, which it should do. Asylum seekers' applications must be made but that does not interfere with or exclude a child's right to citizenship.Women come to my office who have two children and are expecting a third. They have been in this country for five or six years and now they are being served with deportation orders even though they already have two children born in the State. Before they are served with deportation orders those people should have the right to make reasonable representations to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding citizenship in this country. That is not happening. If we grant the right to citizenship to these parents and their children born in Ireland, that may encourage them to contribute more to our democratic society and promote an effective integration, harmony and mutual respect. We have highly qualified people who want to contribute to the coffers of the State and are not allowed do so.Can the Minister of State tell me, in the name of God, when or how I can get through from my office in Ennis to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? It is impossible to do so and equally impossible to do so from my office in this House. Perhaps some of the officials present might be able to advise me.

It is important to have reasonable debate but some of the contributions today have not been reasonable. It is also important when discussing this Bill that we stick to the subject at hand. We are not talking about immigration policy today but about citizenship. Many of the issues raised, in particular by Deputies Cuffe and Ó Snodaigh, were the same as those put forward by them and others in the referendum. The referendum is over.

However, Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment No. 9 seeks, in a blanket way, uncritically, to reverse the effect of the L and O case for both of those families and for others whose presence in the State has been, and continues to be, unlawful. Deputy Cuffe's amendments Nos. 4 and 5 and Deputy ÓSnodaigh's amendment No. 10 would go further and include all the siblings of the Irish child whether they have ever been in the State.Some of the parents of those children have a lawful basis for remaining in the State. I have in mind, for instance, a person who sought entry to the State on the basis of an employment permit, was granted permission to be in the State on that basis and continues to have both employment permit and permission to remain renewed on a regular basis. Any parents who have this, or a similar basis, for being in the State may continue to remain in the State for as long as that basis applies.Other parents have no lawful basis for their presence in the State. Notwithstanding that they are unlawfully in the State, the law does not empower the Minister to remove them forthwith. The Immigration Act 1999, which has been pilloried by certain commentators as a draconian measure, protects the presence, although unlawful, of such persons in the State until the carefully devised processes in that Act have been exhausted. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot order their removal. He must observe due process by giving such people notice of the fact that deportation is being considered, setting out what their choices are and giving them the opportunity to make representations to him, if they wish, as to why they should not be removed.Each case must be examined by reference to all the factors set out in section 3(6) of the 1999 Act, that is, the guidelines Deputy O'Keeffe wants published in his amendment No. 3. If after that examination, the Minister decides — he makes all these decisions having first considered the thorough, preparatory work done by his officials — that the person should be removed, he may make a deportation order. If he decides not to make a deportation order, he gives the person permission to remain in the State. I see no profit whatsoever, except an additional delaying tactic for those who refuse to obey a lawfully and carefully arrived at deportation decision, in applying another layer of appeal, as Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment No. 16 would have us do, on top of the two-stage independent asylum process, which many of these parents enter but withdraw from and are now re-entering as a last resort. There must be closure.The process of deciding these cases is not routine. The Minister must not only observe the processes set out in the statute but must also bear in mind the strictures of Mr. Justice Hardiman in the L and O case in these Irish child cases. He made it clear that any case of potential deportation of the parent of an Irish child "requires the specific consideration of the Minister who must reasonably be satisfied of the existence of a grave and substantial reason favouring deportation".It is clear there is a structured way, ordained by statute, to deal carefully with each case on an individual basis. This is not the mass deportation process spoken of by some seasoned political commentators who should know better than to frighten the people whose interests they claim to represent with cheap and utterly misleading headline catching phrases. It is a managed immigration process which is dealt with under the correct legislation for this type of matter. The issue of immigration has no place in this Bill which is concerned exclusively with determining, in accordance with law, the future acquisition of Irish nationality and citizenship as identified in Article 9.2 of the Constitution.There are no proposals to legislate for the blanket granting of permission in the way Deputies propose in their amendments. The Minister made that crystal clear in his contributions on Committee Stage. The Minister will keep an eye on matters to see how they develop in the wake of the implementation of this legislation and will take a sensible view on what might be done once that is in place. However, I disabuse Deputies now of the notion that there will be uncritical and indiscriminate regularisation of the irregular. People have railed against the spectre of mass deportation decisions in circumstances where there can be none and have clamoured for individual consideration of each case as if it was not already happening, as required by law. The Minister is being asked to move away from individual consideration of each case and to make a mass decision that everyone can stay irrespective of the rights or wrongs of particular cases, but that will not happen.As he stated on Committee Stage, the Minister will look at the entire situation in a decent, sensible and pragmatic way once this legislation is enacted. Deputies observed in committee that, in saying so, the Minister was asking them to take him on trust. That is exactly what they will have to do because they need not expect from me or from the Minister any further statement that might be misread either by those who might take false hope from such a statement or those who would seek to gain some angle of advantage out if it. That will not happen.I turn now to some technical aspects of the amendments tabled which display a somewhat naive view of the phenomenon and its effects. One effect of Deputy O'Keeffe's proposal in amendment No. 9 to make everyone lawful would be if, for example, the non-national father of an Irish born child, such child being born prior to January 2003, were to leave the family and move to another country, that person would, nonetheless, be deemed by operation of the law as proposed in the Deputy's amendment to be lawfully present in the State even though he was patently not in the State. I doubt if this was the intention of the Deputy in framing the amendment but that is what its effect would be. The non-national father would in effect not be subject to immigration control at all. For example, if this father were to stay away for 20 years, he would still be entitled to return and live here whether or not the mother and child were residing here. This would apply even where, for instance, the non-national in question had been involved in the most serious criminal activity. I cannot accept the amendment.Deputy Cuffe's and Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendments would extend a right to reside to siblings of an Irish-born child. This is based on a serious error of judgment. Consider the case of a Canadian academic who comes to Ireland on a one-year research project, taking a sabbatical from her university duties and leaving her husband and three children at home so as not to interrupt their schooling. Before she leaves, she discovers she is pregnant and duly has the child in Holles Street Hospital in February of her year here. By the logic of the Deputies' amendments, the fortuitous fact of that birth in Ireland is to give mother, father and the three Canadian children, who have never been here, the right for ever more to reside in Ireland. There is no moral case that can be made for such a situation.Moreover, there is no moral case to be made for parents or siblings in any other circumstances to be given by statute an entitlement to come to Ireland for as long as they please, simply and solely based on the chance factor of having a child, brother or sister born in Ireland. The Deputies may use high-flown talk about family reunification but the sensible form of family reunification in the Canadian case that I posit is for mother and child to go back to Canada where the rest of the family is settled. Why should it be any different if the child has a parent and three siblings living in Bucharest or Abuja?I conclude by restating the position that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, made clear on Committee Stage. He undertakes to deal decently, sensibly and pragmatically with the situation once this legislation is up and running. The Minister is committed to dealing with the cases that are pending in a most humane way. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has made the case for such an approach succinctly today. There is no issue regarding figures or anything else. Some 10,584 non-national parents of Irish-born children were granted residency in the State on the basis of their children's Irish birth between 1996 and the date of the Supreme Court decision on the L and O case. We abolished the separate procedures for theacceptance of Irish-born child applications on19 February 2003, on which date we stopped accepting new applications. At that time, there were 11,943 applications from non-national parents on hand. There is no lack of transparency or puzzle as to the number of people involved.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I accept that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot be here today because he is in London. However, this Bill should have been taken yesterday. It was not taken because the Minister, like an over-grown schoolboy, gathered the resources of the State, including cars and helicopters, in the Phoenix Park so he could play the role of one who is doing something. The purpose of this excursion was to announce his plans to establish a traffic corps notwithstanding that he has no extra men or equipment to assign to such a service, nor will have for some 18 months. This was the urgent reason he was unable to take the Bill yesterday.There are a number of issues to consider. The Minister wants us to take a leap in the dark and rely on his humanity, decency, sensibility and pragmatism. We are asked to place total trust in a Minister who has done nothing to warrant that trust. Prior to the L and O case, 37 people had already been deported. No grounds were given for these deportations. We cannot put our trust in a Minister who will not supply such information. Likewise, we are asked to set aside the concept of an independent appeals process. Under the system, people are informed by the Minister that they are to be deported. They can then make representations about which the same Minister makes a decision. There is nothing accountable or transparent in such a system.My colleague, Deputy Pat Breen, observed that not alone is there a totally opaque system but nobody can even discover what is happening with regard to any applications. Members of the House cannot find out such information. Deputy Pat Breen cannot even get a response to his inquiries on behalf of constituents. Six months ago, I proposed to this common-sense Minister that he establish an Oireachtas helpline. I made the same proposal to his colleague, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, who dealt with work permits in her then capacity as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This would have represented a simple, straightforward step to alleviate the problems with the system by providing a point of contact for inquiries regarding applications. This suggestion has been ignored.That is one example of incompetence. Another relates to the position of a person who applies for naturalisation and must wait two years for the application even to be considered. What type of hopeless, helpless incompetence is that for the Minister to display to the House and then to ask us to accept that he will look after all these problems with common sense, decency and pragmatism? He must earn his credit by at least showing some element of competence in doing his job before we could accept that. We have had nothing but total incompetence from the Minister.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	366	This Bill is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's baby in more ways that one. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said, we cannot take what the Minister says to us now on trust when we have received so much misinformation and when it is impossible to get any direct information in reply to queries. It is almost impossible to make contact with the Department on such matters. The Department is only available for certain hours of the day and one spends hours on the phone attempting to get through.The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, referred to the amendments of my colleagues and ruled them out one by one. Perhaps he is indicating that he will accept my amendment. In many ways, this amendment is the most acceptable in terms of what the Minister, Deputy McDowell, has been saying. I make no reference to siblings, citizenship or any prior legal status. All the Minister has to do with regard to my amendment is to grant a right of residency. After that, people can apply for citizenship, deal with siblings and so on. Such a change would recognise the family unit and ensure there would be no effective deportation of Irish-born children who are citizens.I am delighted to hear that the Minister has given us numbers which we did not have before. If I correctly understood the Minister of State, he said that 10,584 non-national parents of Irish born children were granted residency between 1996 and 2003 following the L and O case. Since that time a further 11,943 applications are outstanding. Is the Minister of State telling us that no applications have been processed in the period between February 2003 and now? Is there another group of non-national parents whom the Minister has not mentioned — in other words, those whose applications have been processed in the past year and ten months? Has the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform not done anything since the L and O case other than deport 37 parents of Irish citizens? Will the Minister of State clarify those figures?We have exact figures for the first time on the number of successful applications by the parents of Irish born children. We have also got a second figure which, from what the Minister of State said, appears to be the rest of the applications outstanding since early 2003. That figure is 11,943. The Minister said he had a figure of 11,000 plus 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000. Has that figure gone out the door, so to speak? Can he clarify the number of applicants who have been successful, the number of applications still outstanding and if any person has had his or her case processed successfully since the L and O case?

As others have said, he has not done anything to earn our trust on this issue. When it was first broached in terms of a referendum, he made a promise to us, and the four Members in the Chamber were present at that time, that if the referendum was passed, he would deal with what he acknowledged was the outstanding issue of Irish citizens born to non-national parents at that stage.The Minister of State has quoted figures. We are dealing with Report Stage of the legislation, which will have a major impact on many of our citizens and it is ridiculous that we are only getting these figures now. When we dealt with this issue on Committee Stage last week, the Minister could not tell us any of these figures and now the figures are being bandied about. That shows this debate is ridiculous. There has been a lack of time allocated for the debate. The Minister said that some of the amendments were naive in their effect. One of the reasons they might show some degree of naivety is that we are in a rush to try to deal with this issue. We have not had the time to properly deal with it. If we had, we would take full cognisance of the effects of our amendments.The Minister has not taken cognisance of the full effect of this legislation. If passed, this legislation will have to be amended at a later date to take account of the Chen judgment. The Minister did not mention it. It is as if that judgment had not been given, whereas in the run up to the referendum the Minister quoted it at every opportunity. It is disgraceful that the Minister is not present to deal with this issue. If he is in London, that is fine, but this debate should have been deferred to another day to ensure that the Minister responsible for rushing through this legislation would be here to directly address these issues.The Minister of State mentioned the situation concerning a Canadian student who, I believe, has a moral case. Prior to this legislation being enacted, a child born here is an Irish citizen. Based on the Chen case, such a child is entitled to the care of his or her parents in this State. Following that judgment and in recognition of one's entitlement to family life, that Canadian student's siblings or partner should be entitled to join her, if she so wishes. As a student she might wish to return to Canada to enjoy Canadian life rather than live here, but it would be a choice for her and her family. At a later date, her child who is an Irish citizen could return to Ireland to enjoy citizenship at any stage or the family could move here.The Minister of State mentioned that Deputy McDowell, would deal sensitively, humanely, pragmatically and decently with the outstanding cases. At the rate he is going, it will be 20, 30 or 40 years before he addresses the 11,000 outstanding cases never mind the subsequent applications made on the basis of children born here since the L and O case. In these amendments we ask that the outstanding cases be dealt with once and for all as quickly as possible to ensure that the logjam in the system is moved.

Most people who voted in favour of the citizenship referendum on 11 June believed the constitutional amendment applied looking forward and that the cases prior to that date would be dealt with in a compassionate and humane way. That is what the Minister of State said and what the people of Ireland thought, yet those people are still living in limbo.I do not feel proud to be Irish but ashamed when I see Irish citizens being deported in the dead of night. I feel ashamed to be Irish when I see young children and babies being put on a plane with their parents and those citizens being removed from this country. That is why I want to see an element or an ounce of compassion from the Minister. This is not about opening the gates; it is about listening carefully and compassionately to a small cohort of people who should be released from the uncertain future they face. I agree that the people have spoken as regards future cases, but I refer to a group of people who were in Ireland along with their families before the end of March last year. Those cases should be heard and considered compassionately and those people should be allowed to remain here.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I have nothing further to add to what I said except to clarify the position for Deputy Costello. The Deputies will note that the figures I mentioned have a common denominator, apart from the immediately apparent fact of the parents having an Irish born child, namely, they had all made an application to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for residence in this State on the basis of the birth of that child. There were cases where no such application was made. These were cases where the parents arranged birth in the island of Ireland to secure Irish citizenship for the child. These parents may have been resident in their country of origin or perhaps in another EU member state, whether legally or illegally. If a parent's tenure in that EU member state ceases, it would be open to such parents to travel to this jurisdiction to seek residency on the basis of the Irish born citizen child. This could arise in a case where the child was born here five years ago but the parents never made any application for residency on their own behalf because they were living in another country. The child would of course have Irish citizenship.Take, for example, the child born to Mrs. Chen, who was the subject of the Chen case. Mrs. Chen never sought residency in this State prior to February 2003 even though her child was born in September 2000. This was because she was living and wished to continue to reside in the United Kingdom. However, who is to say she will never seek residency here in respect of her child, who was born two and a half years before the L and O judgment?Let us take the example of a person employed here on foot of a work permit who has his or her family here. Approximately 850 of the 11,493 applicants fell into this category.

The Government has used and is continuing to use all avenues open to it to urge action in addressing the humanitarian, security and political challenges that exist there.Despite all the considerable international attention focused on Darfur and some recent political progress, the security situation there has deteriorated in recent weeks. This was confirmed in the most recent report of the UN Secretary General's special representative, Jan Pronk. Mr. Pronk reported increased violence impacting on civilians. Of particular concern have been reports of Government attacks against camps sheltering internally displaced persons and of clear attempts on the Sudanese Government's part at forced resettlement, contrary to earlier agreements.Humanitarian aid delivery has also been jeopardised in recent weeks by the escalation in security incidents across many parts of Darfur. Sustained international pressure, therefore, needs to be maintained on all the parties in Darfur to honour their commitments and work to improve the security situation there. The Government of Sudan must be pressed to accept its responsibility for security and the protection of its citizens by disbanding the Janjaweed militia and bringing all those responsible for serious human rights violations to justice. There must also be an end to attempts at forced displacement of internally displaced persons.The rebels, for their part, must cease all attacks and ceasefire violations. All sides must co-operate fully and constructively with the international presence in Darfur, including the UN, the African Union and all engaged in the humanitarian effort. The African Union is performing a crucial role in efforts to resolve the Darfur crisis, both through its ceasefire monitoring mission and its mediation of the peace talks between the Government and the rebels taking place in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria.Ireland and the EU have welcomed the African Union's plans to strengthen its mandate and substantially expand the size of its mission in Darfur to about 3,320 troops by the end of next month. It is hoped that this expanded mission can help to improve the security situation on the ground and create suitable conditions for the safe and voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced persons.The UN Security Council is continuing to follow closely the situation in Darfur and held a special session in Nairobi on 18 and 19 November to discuss the crisis. I welcome the Security Council's continuing close involvement and the adoption of Resolutions 1556, 1564 and 1574. It is clear that sanctions remain an option if the Sudanese Government fails to meet its obligations.Ultimately, there must be a political resolution to the crisis in Darfur. I welcome the recent progress achieved in the Abuja talks and urge all sides to work for a speedy, final political agreement when these talks resume on 9 December. The commitment signed in Nairobi on 19November by the Government of Sudan and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement to conclude a comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan by 31 December 2004 is also to be welcomed. Such an agreement can only facilitate a resolution to the conflict in Darfur.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	382	Everyone has been appalled by the television pictures we have seen, particularly the reports by Fergal Keane, on the awful situation in which the people of Darfur find themselves. Does the Minister of State agree that at this stage the helpless people of Darfur not only need humanitarian aid but also military protection? Does he agree that the UN Security Council seems unable to take effective action? It is nice to hear rosy words contained in resolutions but the situation in Darfur demands effective action. Will the Minister of State explain why the UN resolution of July this year stated that 30 days would be given to the Government of Sudan to disarm the rebel groups terrorising people in Darfur when no such objective is contained in the most recent UN resolution? Will the Minister of State explain why that element of the July resolution has been dropped? Will he also explain what steps are being taken by the United Nations? It is obvious that the Security Council is paralysed by the threat of a veto by China on this issue. Are the people of Darfur to be abandoned because of the physical checks and balances within the Security Council?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I do not wish to be drawn into making too much commentary about how the UN system operates and, particularly, the operation of the Security Council. However, the Deputy and others are aware that the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has initiated a high level group that is examining the Security Council's balance of power and how it should be exerted. In the meantime, pending that report and any reforms it may produce as to how the Security Council works, we must live with the current rules. Deputy Allen has outlined some of the issues arising from the current rules governing the operation of the Security Council.I was happy to discuss these matters with Mr. Annan during his recent visit to Iveagh House to meet the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Some interesting proposals have emanated from the high level group examining reform of the Security Council and its membership.The UN Secretary General's special representative, Jan Pronk, presented to the Security Council on 4 November his latest 30-day report on the situation in Sudan. In summary, Mr. Pronk told the Security Council that the situation on the ground had regressed and was more tense than at any time since July. While there had been some progress on the political front, it was too slow and might come too late to stop the situation in Darfur from becoming unmanageable or ungovernable. Mr. Pronk said the character of the conflict was changing and it was possible that Darfur would soon be ruled by warlords if this negative trend was not reversed. More efforts needed to be made, he said, both at the negotiating table and on the ground.Mr. Pronk outlined three steps that need to be taken to prevent Darfur from descending into complete and outright anarchy: the African Union force needed to be deployed speedily in all insecure areas; the negotiating process in Abuja, Nigeria, must be speeded up; and all political leaders must be held responsible for ongoing violations of the ceasefire and of international humanitarian law and human rights. Mr. Pronk also added that the international community needs to ensure that momentum is sustained and should consider what further steps it should take if the parties do not make more progress.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I am sure all Deputies share the concerns about large-scale military operations being launched in a built-up area. The decision to launch the operation to regain control of Falluja was taken by the Iraqi Government, which made clear its view that regaining control of such areas is a vital prerequisite to holding elections and restoring stability to that country. Although most of the population is said to have left the city before the operation began, it seems clear from the scale of the fighting and from initial reports that there will have been civilian casualties.It is essential that any military operations in Falluja or elsewhere should be conducted in conformity with international law and with full and careful regard for the presence of civilians, that the use of force be kept to the minimum necessary and that every possible effort be made to avoid civilian casualties. We hope that all such operations are quickly brought to an end. This position has been expressed by the Government on more than one occasion.While it is evident that the insurgent forces show no regard for international law, it is essential that the forces of the Iraqi interim Government and those of the multinational force assisting the interim Government under a mandate from the UN Security Council should operate according to the highest standards.We are therefore concerned about reports from Amnesty International and others alleging possible violations of the Geneva conventions during the fighting in Falluja. It is still too early to be certain of the basis in fact for these allegations. While the reports coming out of Falluja are mixed and unconfirmed, it is clear that serious questions need to be answered. I would repeat the Government's call on the multinational force to take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties to the maximum extent possible and to ensure that operations are conducted in full conformity with their obligations under international law.My understanding is that the US military authorities are investigating an incident, which occurred involving a wounded Iraqi militant. At this point, we look forward to a full investigation by the US authorities of the allegations made about the conduct of some of their forces. Deputies will recall that the Government earlier this year made strong public statements and representations to the US authorities about the treatment of prisoners in Iraq.I urge all responsible authorities to take every necessary action to address the humanitarian needs of the population of Falluja affected by the fighting. We would like to see the International Red Crescent and other aid agencies allowed access to the city as soon as possible. I understand that the Red Crescent is holding discussions with the multinational force on this issue. While we are aware of reports that the Red Crescent has not been allowed to enter Falluja, we are aware also of reports that it has acknowledged that the city is still too dangerous for it to enter. I hope that it will be able to do so as soon as possible to assist the local population.

Did the forces in Falluja impede the Red Crescent or not? It is not a matter of hearing reports from both sides; it is a matter of the Red Cross and the parallel organisation, the Red Crescent, being allowed to function under the Geneva Convention. Have we made any representations on that matter?I have asked a straightforward question about interim Prime Minister Allawi's statement that there had been no civilian casualties in Falluja. Does the Government accept this ridiculous statement when photographs have been taken of children lying on stretchers within Falluja?On the other matter of compliance with the Geneva Convention, it seems the Government has not made any inquiry through any international agency as to the conditions under which prisoners are being held under the Geneva Convention. For example, prisoners involved in combat are affected by the Geneva Convention and non-combatants are affected by international law. With respect to the Minister of State, who knows I mean nothing personal in this, his answer might as well have been written by the United States public relations office in Falluja. In reality, the Red Crescent was blocked.The Minister of State said the Red Crescent was in discussions. What proof does the Government have that Zarqawi was ever in Falluja? The Minister of State might remember that the assault on the city had been justified on the basis that it was Mr. Zarqawi's headquarters, that those who supported him were principally the people inFalluja and that no citizens were left in the city. What about the conditions in the refugee camps? The people who managed to get away have their own set of problems. Does the Government seriously believe that no civilians remained in Falluja, that the Red Crescent imagined that people had been injured and that it would be acceptable to wait some weeks before distributing emergency water, medicines and food?In his answer the Minister of State referred to "assisting the interim Government under a mandate from the UN Security Council". No mandate exists to justify this action. I presume the Minister of State was referring to the UN resolution on the reconstruction of Iraq, the logic of which is to raze the city to the ground and then appeal internationally for money to build it up again with US and British contractors fighting over who will get the job. It is quite scandalous. We either accept Prime Minister Allawi's statement or not. By the way, Mr. Allawi does not represent the Iraqi Government but the interim Iraqi Government.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I will first deal with the Deputy's second supplementary question. The United States authorities are well aware of the Government's view, which we have expressed many times, including in answer to previous parliamentary questions, that all military operations in which civilians are at risk in Falluja or elsewhere should be planned and conducted to keep the use of force to a minimum and make every possible effort to avoid civilian casualties. In the case of Falluja where material damage has been extensive, reports are conflicting as to the possible extent of civilian casualties. The priority now is to bring the remaining fighting to an end and ensure that the humanitarian needs of the population, whether in the city of Falluja or the surrounding area, are met. Many people are in tented villages in the surrounding area.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	390	As I said in my reply, some reports from Falluja, if confirmed, would give serious rise to questions about possible violations of international humanitarian law. I understand the specific case, which has given rise to so much public comment, is under investigation by the US authorities and the soldier in question has been removed from the area.The Deputy also asked about——
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I did not build my case on that incident at all. There are several others.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I will address each point individually and will do my utmost to answer as clearly and as openly as possible. The Deputy asked about the Red Crescent. I have seen the report that Red Crescent supplies were allowed into the outskirts of Falluja but not into the centre. However, I have also seen reports in which Red Cross spokesmen accepted that conditions were still too dangerous to enter the city of Falluja and they could only do so when US forces could guarantee their safety. As the fighting dies down, this problem should become less severe and we hope that the Red Crescent, on behalf of the International Red Cross, could enter the city of Falluja as quickly as possible to assist the local population and give them all the humanitarian aid possible at this sad and difficult time.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	393	Is it compliance with the Geneva Convention to say that the Red Crescent will only be allowed to distribute medicines, water and food to those in need when the United States forces declare it to be safe? That is clearly a breach of the convention. The Geneva Convention on behaviour at times of war affects combatants and non-combatants, which means that the relationship of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent is entirely with the wounded. It is entitled to have access to those who need medicines. I have received descriptions from people who were in Falluja and have written about those lying waiting for the medicines and about the doctor who was delivered new desks by the forces invading Falluja. She said she did not need a new desk but the right to distribute medicines. It is not reliant on one of the sides in a conflict to decide the terms under which the Red Cross or the Red Crescent can function under the Geneva Convention. In reality, the Government does not have the courage to tell the United States and Britain they are breaking the Geneva Convention right, left and centre, and especially in Falluja under the gaze of the world.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	394	With respect to the Deputy, the Government has both courage and respect. We have the respect of the international world in all our diplomatic dealings, all our political statements, all the negotiations we conduct and all the representations we make. We have raised this issue with the United States on a number of occasions. This is a crisis situation within a conflict. We must respect the professional judgment of the Red Crescent on behalf of the International Red Cross. We must be guided by some people who are in charge there at least as regards the safety of those going in to assist the unfortunate people involved in this conflict. Ultimately we must have a balance and be reasonable to ensure that there are no civilian casualties and, in particular, that those who come to assist civilians are not victims of their own efforts.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	395	Immigration controls and procedures represent a highly sensitive issue in the United States, especially since the tragic events of 11 September 2001. We can anticipate a vigorous debate in the US Congress on any measures proposed to regularise the circumstances of undocumented people.The House can be assured that the ambassador and officials in the Embassy in Washington monitor closely the debate on immigration reform. Initiatives in this regard have been made by President Bush and certain members of Congress. While some of these initiatives might offer undocumented Irish people the possibility of obtaining legal residency, none of them involve amnesties.The Minister believes that these initiatives reflect an awareness of the importance of addressing the situation of the undocumented people in the US in a way that is both constructive and sympathetic. He also welcomes the comments made in recent weeks by senior members of the US Administration that immigration reform will be a high priority during President Bush's second term and that they will work closely with the US Congress in this regard.Realistically, it is unlikely there will be further concrete developments until the new year when the new teams are in place in the US Administration and the US Congress. The Minister will continue to monitor closely the situation and will raise the issue in his contacts with the US Administration and Legislature.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	396	This is the second time I have raised this issue since I entered the Dáil. No one knows the number of Irish illegal immigrants in the United States but I have defined a broad category who would be eligible for an amnesty —anyone who is working, has held down a job for five years in the United States and who admits that he has been living and working illegally.The American Government owes this to Ireland because we have left our airports open to US troops. When I visited Capitol Hill with the Ceann Comhairle in June 2003, I asked congressmen from all sides about legalising Irish immigrants and they were all sympathetic. It is sad, however, that our sons and daughters in the United States cannot come here to visit. My daughter-in-law is married to an American citizen and has recently given birth but she cannot come home.These people were in America before 11September. A period of five years would not include those who were there when the last amnesty took place. Green cards will be granted to people living here this year but that should not happen until all of the illegal Irish immigrants in the US are legalised. The Government should make a greater effort because people cannot come home even when there is a death in the family because they are afraid they will not be let back in. Will the Minister make a genuine effort to secure legal status for the thousands of Irish immigrants in the United States?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I appreciate the Deputy's sincerity on this issue. We all want to ensure the best possible conditions for our citizens no matter where they are. The Taoiseach and the Minister forForeign Affairs raised this issue during President Bush's visit this year and President Bush was very sympathetic. The election is over in the United States and the new Administration and the President will be sworn into office on 30 January. In the spring it will be for the President and his Administration to consider the situation in the context of the millions of illegal immigrants in the United States, of whom the Irish form a small percentage. If account is taken of one particular group, that decision must equally apply to all other groups.Against that background, we will do what we can in every way possible at the highest level politically and diplomatically, through the ambassador and his staff in Washington and in constant consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Department. I have met the American ambassador three times and discussed this situation with him. I know of people in my area who are in the situation alluded to by Deputy James Breen and I assure him we will do our utmost to make progress in this area as soon as possible, taking into account the complexity of the situation.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	398	The European Union's objective, as stated in the European Council conclusions of 17-18 June 2004, is that both Romania and Bulgaria should conclude negotiations in 2004, sign the accession treaty as early as possible in 2005 and accede in January 2007, if they are ready. Negotiations will be concluded on the same basis and principles which applied to the ten new member states which acceded on 1 May 2004.On 6 October 2004, the European Commission published its annual report on progress towards the EU accession of Romania, as well as an overall strategy paper on progress in the enlargement process. The Commission makes clear in its report that Romania has made good progress this year in its preparations for EU accession. Romania has three negotiating chapters to complete.The formal conclusion of negotiations with both Romania and Bulgaria is on the agenda of the European Council in December and the Council should be in a position to take a positive decision.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	399	The response given is similar to that given in October and I accept the assurances that everything is moving according to schedule, the negotiations will finish in December, the accession treaty will be signed next year and accession take place in 2007. Will the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania conclude before negotiations open with Turkey?The Council report mentioned by the Minister of State expresses serious reservations about three issues — the ability of the anti-corruption laws to deal with widespread corruption inRomania, the independence of the judiciary from the executive and the ability of the media to act as an independent voice for the people. In what respect have these reservations been addressed by the Romanian authorities in the most recent negotiations?

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	402	The drafting of a common accession treaty, which began in July, is already at an advanced stage. As the Commission reports make clear, both countries are on track to sign the treaty early next year. Bulgaria and Romania are being dealt with together and we are optimistic that there will be positive progress.Justice and home affairs issues have been one of the most sensitive areas of accession negotiations with all of the countries involved in the enlargement process and the final negotiations with Romania on these issues are very important. Ireland, the other member states and the Commission, which has a lead role in the negotiations, will ensure that Romania delivers on the commitments needed for EU membership and is supported in its efforts to do so.The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 decided that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria applied to other candidate states. The Copenhagen European Council in December 2002 made the clear commitment that the European Council meeting in December 2004 will decide——
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	403	With due respect, I know all of that already. I asked if negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania will conclude before the opening negotiations with Turkey. My specific questions were about the ability of the anti-corruption laws to deal with widespread corruption, the independence of the media and the reservations in the Council report about the independence of the judiciary. Those were the three major reservations in the report to which the Minister of State referred and I would like to know what progress has been made since October on these three core issues.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	404	Progress has been made. Decisions have been taken in Romania that will make progress in the judicial situation and the situation in the media has been greatly improved. Negotiations are moving forward.The Deputy asked if negotiations will conclude with Bulgaria and Romania before negotiations open with Turkey. They have until 2007 and it is expected that they should be able to join by then. It will be a matter for the European Council in December to decide whether negotiations will be opened with Turkey and when, in the event. I cannot say whether that will be before the conclusion of negotiations with the other two accession countries. However, I would surmise they might be conducted in parallel or perhaps negotiations with the first two might have concluded before talks with Turkey begin. That will depend on the progress reported to the European Council meeting on 17 and 18 December. These reports will be made available and then the Council will take a decision based on the facts before it and the recommendations being made to it.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Ireland attaches the greatest importance to the achievement of the eight millennium development goals which set time-bound, measurable targets in areas such as reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty, achieving universal primary education, combating maternal and child mortality and fighting the scourge of AIDS-HIV. The United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, will conduct the first major review of progress in the implementation of the MDGs in 2005. He has expressed the view that greater effort will be required on the part of the international community if the millennium development goals are to be achieved. He also has highlighted the need for special support for many sub-Saharan African countries where most of the development indicators show little improvement over those of ten years ago.I share the Secretary General's concerns about the achievement of the millennium development goals in sub-Saharan Africa. Our development co-operation programme has its chief focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Some 85% of our bilateral programme country assistance is spent there. We intend to maintain this focus and to expand our assistance to the region as the aid programme grows.As the world's largest aid donor, the EU has a major role to play in the achievement of the millennium development goals. During this country's recent Presidency of the EU, our partners agreed to Ireland's suggestion for a stocktaking exercise aimed at providing a consolidated EU contribution to next September's United Nations high level meeting on this subject, which will review the achievement of the MDGs and the implementation of the millennium summit declaration, in which commitments were also made in the area of United Nations reform. The aim is to ensure that the EU provides strong leadership and a well co-ordinated contribution to the MDG stocktaking exercise.Ireland, with other EU member states, has submitted a report to the European Commission on progress being made to implement the goals. The report emphasises that we are fully committed to the achievement of all the millennium development goals and explains that we have adopted their achievement as the overarching framework for our development co-operation programme.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	406	In submitting its report to the Commission did Ireland say that the Taoiseach was about to reverse his commitment given solemnly in September 2000 before the United Nations that we would reach the 0.7% target in overseas development aid by 2007? He was so committed to it he repeated it in September 2003 before the 58th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York. Does the Minister of State refer in his report to the Commission to the breaking of its commitment by Ireland? Is he aware of Ms Eveline Herfkins, the former Development Minister in Holland who was appointed by Mr. Kofi Annan to implement the eight millennium development goals and review progress as regards their achievement? Two days ago Ms Herfkins expressed her deep disappointment over Ireland breaking its commitment.If the Minister of State looks at each of the eight goals which were the focus of my question, will he accept that this commitment was made in September 2000 and later at the conference in Johannesburg, where countries were asked to commit to their achievement? The programme for the elimination of AIDS-HIV accounts for less than 50% of the budget that is necessary. Looking at my notes on this subject, 23 million people died as a result of war out of the total number of deaths in the 50 year period 1945-95. However, 150 million died as a result of TB, malaria and AIDS-HIV. Is it not incredible that the countries of the world are not meeting their commitments given in Johannesburg and is it not an incredibly bad example that Ireland is using the excuse that it became too rich? One excuse is that gross national product grew so much that we could not afford to meet our commitments. That is the logic of it.The Tánaiste made a disgraceful statement this morning that there were other claims on Government expenditure such as disability, putting the disabled into competition with the poorest of the world as regards TB, malaria and the 1.3 billion people on the planet who live on less than a dollar a day. We made this commitment solemnly. The Taoiseach and his agents canvassed for votes, particularly from Africa, so that we could be elected on to the Security Council. Does the Minister of State not feel a sense of shame or did he not put it in the report to the Commission? Perhaps he said that in so far as the Taoiseach was in favour of keeping his promise as late as September 2003, maybe it was another bolt from the blue, like the socialist blast he got, that made him break his promise. Did the Minister of State report to the Commission? Is he aware of Eveline Herfkins's comment on behalf of Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, to the effect that they are deeply disappointed Ireland is not keeping its promise?

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I had three meetings with Mr. Kofi Annan in Iveagh House, one over dinner, where he praised Ireland as the model UN country, both in terms of our contribution to the UN in general and crucially as regards the overseas aid commitments we have undertaken.

That is a remarkable achievement for this and previous Governments. As regards the specific matter raised by the Deputy about the report on the achievement of the millennium development goals, our commitment to the 0.7% is not part of this, but rather part of our country commitment. As regards the report that was furnished to the Commission, which is about the consolidated EU strategy, that was furnished and sent prior to the recent Estimates process. I remind the Deputy that the recent allocation of Estimates is the largest in the history of the State and involves the spending of €1.8 billion in the next three years. These are record increases in the level of Ireland’s overseas development aid.For what it is worth, as regards Mr. Kofi Annan's welcome and praise for our contribution of overseas development aid-——

It is a highly respected charity which welcomes the size and magnitude of the awards sanctioned by the Minster for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Taoiseach and the Cabinet as regards the recent Estimates.

The Scandinavian countries, Norway and Denmark, meet the 0.7% target at present. One can dance all around the bushes, but the reality is that the Taoiseach made a commitment in 2000, as stated in An Agreed Programme for Government and the social partnership agreement, and repeated it in September 2003, but it has not been met.Does the Minister of State realise that when the commitment was made in 2000 to achieve it in 2007, the mid point was 0.45%? It is likely that the figure he has quoted of 0.5% in 2007 will probably be approximately 0.45% or less, so that he will fairly achieve the mid-point figure. Why did he find it necessary, in seeking to deflect flak from the broken promise, to attack the money spent on advocacy by the non-governmental organisations and try to suggest a year long review when there had been a published review by the review committee on overseas development aid?

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	426	The Minister is delighted the funds available to emigrant services will once again rise substantially next year. The Estimates for Public Services include an overall allocation of €8.267 million to support our emigrants in 2005. This is a doubling of the 2004 Estimates figure. Even allowing for the additional funding which was made available to emigrant services in late 2004, this figure of €8.267 million represents an overall increase of 63%.The task force on policy regarding emigrants, which was established by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, produced an excellent report. It provides all those involved with emigrant services with a key framework that covers the full range of issues associated with our emigrants. It makes clear that these issues can best be addressed by a collective effort involving governmental and non-governmental agencies. We are making positive progress.We have increased substantially funding to the voluntary organisations that assist our emigrants. The significant rise in funding has been warmly welcomed by emigrant representative bodies such as the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants and the Federation of Irish Societies, whose director described the increase as "an incredible boost for the Irish community in Britain". The funding will in large part go to groups providing front line services to our emigrant communities in Britain, and especially the most vulnerable Irish people there. There will also be significant increases for emigrant groups providing similar services in the United States and Australia.This significant increase reflects in the clearest possible way the strength of the Government's firm and sustained commitment to our emigrant communities. Our commitment is both immediate and long term, and the substantial allocation for 2005 will be built on progressively in the coming years. Our commitment is also reflected in the establishment of a new dedicated unit, the Irish abroad unit, which has been warmly welcomed at home and abroad by everybody who has the interests of our emigrants at heart.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Will the Minister of State say what proportion this €8.267 million is of the money asked for by the task force to which he referred? We should remember that the task force dealt with Irish emigrants in Britain who are living at the margins. When people do their retrospective stints here, they do not refer to the fact that 55,000 people left Ireland in 1955 and almost 60,000 left in 1959. There was no year in the 1950s when less than 45,000 emigrated which amounts to more than a quarter of a million people. As the task force reported, these people would like to come home. They cannot come home to the speculator's paradise that is Ireland because they will not be able to get shelter. They need assistance. They have often been exploited by some of their own in substandard accommodation. When the task force reported and made 23 recommendations it put a figure on what it needed for 2004-05. Why did the Minister of State not give what was sought? What proportion is his €8.267 million of that which the task force sought to implement the recommendations it presented to Government?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	428	The task force produced a fine report. As with any report and group of recommendations of this kind, the Government has to make its own assessment of priorities. That is the duty of Government.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	430	Our major priority is Britain and to help the most vulnerable Irish there. We also need to build up the outreach capacity of the front line organisations wisely and progressively. The substantial increases we have achieved are exactly what is required. They will make a huge qualitative and quantitative difference and the positive reaction of those agencies on the ground to the increases is especially welcomed and appreciated. The task force included wide ranging conclusions, covering the full range of emigrant needs. Its recommendations were far reaching and varied and their implementation will be, by necessity, on a phased basis over several years. That is as anybody with a reasonable understanding of the position would expect. Our long term goal is to ensure that if a person emigrates from Ireland he or she does so voluntarily and is fully prepared for the challenges and will prosper in his or her new country of residence and be able to maintain links to home. Our immediate priority is to ensure that the agencies that provide front line services to assist our vulnerable and elderly emigrants are funded and helped in every possible way. Action is under way on more than two-thirds of the recommendations in the report. I shall give a few examples.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The argument rejects phasing. Without delaying the House, I suggest the reason and ask the Minister of State to comment. The 1950s represent a crisis point on emigration. These are the people the task force identified as being particularly at risk in Britain. Some 55,000 people left Ireland in 1955 and 59,000 two years later. Each year during the 1950s approximately 50,000 people left, all of whom are at a particular age now. The whole focus of the task force report was to be able to address the needs of a huge bulge in emigrants who emigrated during that decade but who are in distress of a different kind and are elderly. There is some case to be made for phasing a future policy but there is no case to be made for refusing to put the expenditure in place for those who already need it.

The task force recommended a figure of €34 million.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The amount allocated falls far short of the recommended figure. Does the Minister of State recognise these people have contributed hugely to this country? Their absence means we have a demographic bounce, so to speak, in terms of health care because they are being treated in Britain. A great deal of money has been saved because they are living in Britain and yet the Minister of State is so parsimonious and stingy with the money. He has neglected and betrayed these people and is turning his back on them and it is disgraceful.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I am absolutely shocked. It is typical of the Opposition to suggest that if money is thrown at every problem it will solve itself.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	438	That is the Government's policy.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	441	Since we returned to Government in 1997 we have increased the budget for our emigrants by 850%. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, when Minister for Social and Family Affairs, introduced pro rata pensions for all those who emigrated in the 1950s and they are now getting €72 million per annum from the Exchequer to assist them. If one adds that to the €8 million, it brings the figure to €80 million, which is nearly two and a half times the €34 million sought. We must ultimately examine the applications, agencies, capacity and the ability to deliver to our people. We must also provide capital commensurate with that policy.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	442	In the Government's decision on decentralisation announced by the Minister for Finance on 4 December 2003, it was provided that the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs would be relocated to Limerick. My Department has been working closely with the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works on the implementation of that decision. In accordance with the recommendations of the Flynn committee, my Department prepared a decentralisation implementation plan and submitted it to the committee for consideration. The Flynn committee submitted a further report to the Cabinet on progress to date on decentralisation, including the sequencing aspect. The contents of the report are being studied. My Department will continue its planning to ensure implementation of Government policy on decentralisation and will take every measure necessary to ensure that the development programme will continue to operate effectively in the new location.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	451	Is the Minister of State aware of a report on this matter that is to be published in the international journal of the Royal Irish Academy? In her annual review of the aid programme, which is to constitute the report, Professor Helen O'Neill states that the plan to decentralise will damage the integrity of Ireland's foreign policy and fossilise its development work. She also states that the decentralisation of key staff will make Development Cooperation Ireland remote from the policy-generating activity of the Department and that staff will waste considerable time travelling to and from Dublin.Will the Minister reconsider the decision made to decentralise in view of the findings of the annual review of the aid programme? On 2 August 2004, The Irish Times outlined Helen O’Neill’s view that severe damage will be done to DCI and that: “any move is likely to lead to ‘a haemorrhage’ of middle and senior-ranking staff that could irreparably damage the linkage between DCI and those working overseas”.

It has also expressed reservations on the decentralisation plan. My Department and officials are working very hard to ensure that there are no risks associated with the move.There are 124 positions available for people who wish to move to Limerick. As the Deputy knows, Development Cooperation Ireland is moving to Limerick in its entirety. I only received the Flynn report at 12.30 p.m. today and have not had time to peruse it fully. My Department will be in the first wave of officials and Departments that will move under the decentralisation programme. The plan is that Development Cooperation Ireland will move to Limerick in the first quarter of 2007. It is a serious issue.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	455	That was not my question. It concerned how many of the 124 staff agreed to be moved under decentralisation.

The overall position is that 124 positions are available in Limerick. From the entire civil and public service we have had 144 applicants for the 124 positions.

Thirty-one people from the Department of Foreign Affairs itself have expressed interest in moving to Limerick. For reasons concerning staff relations, their identities are confidential. The Civil Service Commission obviously keeps the expressions of interest and applications to itself. However, we will find out who the 31 people are in the next few days. I am not in a position to enlighten the Deputy further on their ranks. The 31 people will know exactly the position they hold in the foreign affairs structure in the next few days. When the information becomes available, I hope we will be able to use it effectively to expedite the move to Limerick.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	487	Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, there has been a progressive tightening of US immigration controls and procedures. New procedures known as US-VISIT have been introduced for entry to the United States. These procedures, which include the taking of fingerprint scans and digital photographs, are intended to enhance the verification of the identity of visitors to the United States and to ensure the integrity of the US immigration system. Similar procedures are being put in place at points of exit from the United States.These procedures, which take up relatively little time, are most unlikely to impact on visitors to the US from Ireland. However, as the new procedures serve to better assess compliance with the terms of entry of a visitor to the US, they undoubtedly exert further pressure on the undocumented Irish living there.The House can be assured that the circumstances of undocumented Irish people in the United States is raised on an ongoing basis in our bilateral contacts with US political leaders, including when the Taoiseach and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Cowen, met President Bush earlier this year. Various proposals on emigration reform were made by President Bush and members of Congress. These initiatives reflect an awareness of the importance of addressing the situation of the undocumented in a constructive and sympathetic way.Proposals for reform will have to be considered in detail by the US Congress in the new year. The information and advice the voluntary organisations in the US make available to our community there is of particular relevance at this complex time of change. This year's funding to these organisations from the Department of Foreign Affairs reached €500,000, which represented an increase of 70.5% on last year. We are pleased to have secured a substantial increase in funding for emigrant services in the current Estimates. This will enable us to ensure that these groups receive a further significant increase next year.Given our contacts with figures in the US Administration and Legislature, the House can be assured that we will support measures that would help to alleviate the situation of undocumented Irish people in the United States.

Deputy Higgins referred to the people who emigrated in the 1950s. I refer to the latest cohort of people to leave in the 1990s. Does the Minister agree that, at a conservative estimate, 50,000 young Irish men and women, our kith and kin, have not been regularised for various reasons? Is he aware that the new regulations cause Irish people to be detained for weeks and months? A constituent of mine who was in the United States on holiday arrived home a few weeks ago after being detained for five weeks and deported. I received a letter from a girl from Arranmore Island who made a cry from the heart. She is in the United States since 2000 and wanted to come home to marry, but she knows if she comes home that she will not be allowed back into the United States.Does the Minister of State agree that because of the Government's understanding with the United States authorities, he should be able to obtain some concessions from them? What is the position on the legislation promised in January by the US President to provide these people with temporary visas? Does the Minister agree that if we treated US citizens in this country as our citizens are being treated in the United States, we would probably have the marines coming to Shannon and remaining there?This is a serious matter and I do not think the Government is giving it the priority it deserves. These are our people and they depend on us to do something for them. They left this country because they had to. They are in the United States and they are prisoners in the country of their adoption. The girl from Arranmore said she feels trapped. I want to know what is being done in this regard. When will the temporary visas be introduced so that these people can make a life for themselves in the United States? These people are not a burden on the country. They contribute to the United States because they were not given opportunities in this country. There are approximately 40 million Irish-Americans in the United States, a country with which we have a special relationship. If what is happening in the United States happened in China, we would be outraged. Members of this House and the emigrants want answers.

The Irish organisations estimate that the figure is in the region of 9,000 to 10,000. I am in touch with the situation because I know people in the same situation to which Deputy McGinley referred. The Taoiseach has taken up the matter with President Bush and the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, did so heretofore. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has had discussions with officials in the American Embassy. I met the ambassador on three occasions about the situation.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	501	Elections for a new Kosovo assembly were held on 23 October. They were monitored by a Council of Europe observation mission, which included four Irish observers. The elections were organised by the Kosovo authorities and there is widespread agreement that they were conducted in a free and fair manner in line with international standards. Following the tragic violence in Kosovo in March, it was important that the elections and the election campaign took place in a peaceful atmosphere. It is regrettable, however, that almost all the Kosovo Serb community decided not to participate in the elections on the grounds that their security has not been fully assured.The political parties in Kosovo are engaged in discussions on the formation of a coalition government and an announcement is expected soon. It is essential that when a new government is formed, it should demonstrate clearly its commitment to working with the representatives of minority communities in Kosovo with the objective of building a peaceful and stable multi-ethnic society. Kosovo has been under UN administration, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1244, since the end of the conflict in 1999. The EU fully supports the UN mission in Kosovo which is working with the provisional institutions of self-government to implement European standards in the rule of law, human rights and the protection of minorities in advance of consideration of the constitutional status of Kosovo. The EU has stressed the importance of the early formation of a government following the elections which will continue to work towards the review of progress on the implementation of standards which will be carried out in mid-2005. If the outcome of the review is positive, it will be followed by a process of negotiation to agree the status issue. These negotiations will inevitably be complex and difficult with implications for the western Balkans region.The European Union remains firmly committed to a multi-ethnic, democratic Kosovo in which the rights of all communities are fully protected. The ethnically motivated violence in March this year was undoubtedly a major setback for Kosovo. Some 19 people were killed and widespread damage was caused to property owned by members of the Kosovo Serb community. Work is under way on the reconstruction of property and it is essential that its early completion remains a priority for the new government.The security situation has stabilised since March, although it remains tense. There are 213 Irish troops serving with KFOR, the UN-mandated peacekeeping force in Kosovo. I underline the deep appreciation of the Government for the key role being played by members of the Defence Forces in ensuring security and stability in Kosovo.During Ireland's EU Presidency, the European Council and the General Affairs and External Relations Council paid close attention to developments in Kosovo. The situation will remain high on the agenda of the Council in the months to come. The EU will continue to work closely with the UN mission in Kosovo, and especially with Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen, the special representative of the UN Secretary General, in preparation for the crucial review of the implementation of standards next year. The EU will also remain in close contact with the US and the wider international community to ensure the eventual process to address the question of Kosovo's final status will also contribute to the stability of the western Balkans region.

Will the Minister of State inform the House of his views on the possible appointment of Ramush Haradinaj as prime minister in Kosovo? This man is believed to be under investigation by the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. How can his elevation to the post of Prime Minister tally with the so-called progress being made in recent times?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	503	Following the election, the largest party in the new Kosovo assembly will be the Democratic League of Kosovo, the LDK, which is led by the current President Ibraham Rugova. The LDK received 45% of the vote, winning 47 seats. The Democratic Party of Kosovo, the PDK, to which the current Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi belongs, received 29% of the vote and won 30 seats. The largest of the smaller parties, the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, the AAK, won eight seats.Discussions have been taking place between the political parties in Kosovo on the formation of a coalition government. A framework agreement for a coalition government was reportedly reached last week. It is expected that a new government will be announced in the very near future. There have been widespread media reports that President Rugova will remain as president and that his party will enter coalition with the smaller AAK. It has been reported that the leader of the AAK, Mr. Ramush Haradinaj, will be appointed prime minister, but no official announcement has yet been made. Mr. Haradinaj is a former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the KLA. He has not been indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, but representatives of the tribunal asked to interview him recently in relation to the killing of Kosovo Serbs in the late 1990s. He agreed to the interview which took place in Kosovo on 11 and 12 November. The Government fully supports the work of the tribunal and expects the fullest possible co-operation with the tribunal from all persons and administrations.The European Union and the international community will work with whatever government is formed as a result of the democratic elections in October last if it is committed to a truly multi-ethnic Kosovo where the rights of all communities are fully protected. The year ahead will be crucial for all of the people of Kosovo. It is essential that the Kosovo Serb community has the confidence that it can participate in a meaningful way in decision making and that its security is assured.

In accordance with Resolution 1244, Kosovo remains under UN administration pending resolution of the final status issue. The international community has given its full support to the UN mission in pursuing the "standards before status" policy. This involves working with the provisional institutions of self-government to implement, broadly, European standards in Kosovo in areas such as human rights and the protection of minorities in order to create conditions in which the final status issue can be resolved.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I propose to take QuestionsNos. 12, 22, 42 and 105 together.I refer the Deputies to my answer to Priority Question No. 4, answered today which was as follows. I am sure all Members of the House share our concern about large-scale military operations being launched in a built-up area. The decision to launch the operation to regain control of Falluja was taken by the Iraqi Government, which made clear its view that regaining control of such areas is a vital pre-requisite to holding elections and restoring stability to that country. Although most of the population is said to have left the city before the operation began, it seems clear from the scale of the fighting and from initial reports, that there will have been civilian casualties.While it is evident that the insurgent forces show no regard for international law, it is essential that the forces of the Iraqi Interim Government and those of the multinational force, assisting the interim government under a mandate from the UN Security Council, should operate according to the highest international standards.

When and to whom did the Government express concern after the assault on Falluja? When did it contact the British Government? Did it contact the United States Government? Did it contact Acting Premier Alawi? To whom did it address its concern? When was it expressed? In what form was it in terms of compliance with the Geneva Convention?

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	515	There have been several contacts and communications between our officials and the officials of the American administration pertaining to this situation.

He mentioned in reply to a previous question that the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, had met President Bush. I want to know whether representations have been made at ministerial level in respect of the attack at Falluja.The Minister mentioned that the insurgents had little respect for international law. Does the Minister believe the soldier we saw on a videotape which was broadcast around the world who shot an unarmed person in a building had respect for international law or for the Geneva Convention? Will he condemn that outrageous act here in this House?

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Approximately 850 of the 11,493 applicants fall into the category of persons employed here on foot of a work permit who have their families here. The reason such persons sought residency on the basis of the Irish born child was that the terms of such residency were seen to be more advantageous in that the non-national in question would be free to work without an employment permit. However, it is likely there are parents who have never applied but who may apply if their employment permit runs out.The separate application process for Irish born children, to which some Members referred in their supplementary questions, ceased with effect from February 2003. No applications were made under that system from that time onwards. Notwithstanding this, the Minister estimates that approximately 6,000 non-EEA national mothers gave birth in the State since then. For example, 110 women who proclaimed themselves to be pregnant claimed asylum in the offices of the refugee applications commissioner in September and October of this year, that is, 40% of the female asylum seekers of child bearing age. This figure is based on self-certification and I have no idea of the number who may have been pregnant but who did not avert to this. Neither do I have any idea of the number of women who may have entered the State illegally and who did not claim asylum but had a child here. For example, an asylum seeker in the United Kingdom might be reluctant to claim asylum here because under EU rules, the UK is the proper place to have the claim determined and the Eurodac fingerprinting system would identify her as a double claimant.Another issue is that of family members resident outside the State who will seek residency as soon as their parents' residency is settled. There are literally thousands of what might be termed Irish born child families who have other children in their country of origin living with grandparents, relatives or otherwise. A recent examination of the family situations of 555 Irish born children in my Department indicated that they had 428 non-national brothers or sisters outside the State and 248 non-national brothers or sisters in the State. This does not take account of parents or other relatives who may be here or abroad. I hope this foregoing illustration gives an idea of the complexity of the situation with which we are dealing and shows that there are no easy answers to some of the issues raised in the debate.

While I accept that he is on official duty abroad, I have had no explanation as to why the Bill did not go ahead yesterday. That the Minister, like an overgrown schoolboy, put on a show in the Phoenix Park while launching the traffic corps is not a reasonable explanation for sidelining the Bill given that he specially arranged to be in the House yesterday.

He asked us to agree this when we were on Committee Stage last week. He wanted to complete Committee Stage last Thursday morning so that he could take the Bill on the following Tuesday, yesterday. He then had a brainwave about undertaking a political stunt in the Phoenix Park. Like an overgrown schoolboy, he gathered together the resources of the State, including at least ten Garda cars and four or five Garda motorcycles, at a heavy cost-——

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	536	——-by announcing a traffic corps that will become operational in 2008? Leaving that aside, the Minister is not in the House and it is clear the Minister of State has no instructions or authority to yield to the legitimate points made by the Opposition.Does the Minister appreciate there is genuine concern on the part of the Opposition with regard to the parents of Irish children? To a varying degree, depending on whether the children were born before or after the Supreme Court decision, there is a genuine feeling among Members that Irish citizen children who were born here should not be forced out of the country. It is fine for the Minister to state they are not being deported but while babies or children are not being deported, if their parents are deported the practical effect is that the baby or child goes also. That this has happened in some 37 cases, on the Minister's own admission, causes genuine concern in the House, as does the position of the parents involved.An important point that has not been taken on board by Government is that this issue relates to a finite number of cases. We are not looking for an open door policy given that we do not have an immigration policy. Although that is another issue and I will not stray down that path, that there is not an overall immigration policy forms a backdrop to this. The particular issue is limited and finite. It will not arise again because when the law is changed, there will not be new cases involving non-national parents of Irish children because citizenship in this regard will be defined by the Bill.I accept the Minister's point that the issue is not simple or straightforward but complex. I have been long enough in the House to know that for every complex problem there is a simple solution that does not work. I am not saying the answer must be a simple amnesty. However, I cannot accept that the answer is to leave the matter to the Minister. That would be a huge leap in the dark and requires us to take the Minister totally on trust on this issue. We would be expected to do so under a system that does not have any external, objective evaluation of the situation. It is all within the Department and the Minister's office, which is a problem.It is clear the Minister is running an utterly chaotic system that is incapable of dealing with the situation. Applicants are hanging around for years waiting for decisions but nothing happens. Most tellingly, Members cannot even get a reply on the telephone from the section of the Department dealing with these issues. A reasonable case was made to the Minister for a helpline to deal with queries from Oireachtas Members, but it could not be done. I requested it six months ago. We have a system which is within the Minister's control, including what might be called the appeals system. Under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister issues a notice of intention to deport. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, points out that there are options open to the recipients after that. They can consent to the making of the deportation order, and leave the State before the order is made or they can make representations to the person who gave them the notice to leave the State, namely, the Minister.If an effort is being made to suggest that this is by any standards a fair, just, equitable, open, transparent and accountable system, that is laughable. That is why I suggested there was a role for an appeals committee comprised of retired members of the Judiciary, a nominee of the Minister, which would at least dilute the Minister's total control of the situation, and a member of the Human Rights Commission. This seems a reasonable approach. I am open to an alternative suggestion, but what I have tried to do, as I did with the proposal for an amnesty. is to raise the issue with a view to finding a sensible, fair and just solution. I would be open to an alternative proposal from the Government for a better and more accountable system, but the shutters are down, the Minister has control and he keeps it. If it takes two years to get a reply to one's letter, so be it. That is what has happened under the Minister's watch. People were officially notified under the citizenship Acts to wait two years for a possible reply. That is how the Minister runs his ship, and we are expected to have some reliance on that utter incompetence.On that basis I cannot accept the bona fides of the Minister in this matter. His utter incompetence in dealing with the situation to date does not inspire confidence on my part. I cast no aspersion on a personal level on the decency or sensibility of the Minister. I speak of him with his political hat on, and my political charge is that I do not have confidence in him. Accordingly I intend to press the amendment to a vote.

In page 3, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:"‘mental capacity' means, in relation to a person, incapacity by reason of a mental condition to manage and administer the person's affairs;".While the Minister is supportive of the principle of Deputy Costello's amendments Nos. 13 and 33b, I will oppose them and ask the House to accept instead the Government amendments which achieve the same end.The amendments in the Minister's name address the substance of Deputy Costello's amendment, which is to import the notion of acts being done on behalf not only of those who are under age but on behalf of persons who are suffering from a lack of capacity by reason of mental infirmity. I again express the Minister's thanks to the Deputy for bringing the issue forward on Committee Stage. These Government amendments deliver on the Minister's commitment given then to take on board the substance of what the Deputy proposed wherever this issue arises in the Bill.During Committee Stage there was discussion on the different meanings and contexts of words and phrases such as "capacity", "lack of capacity" and the cognate expression "disability" as used in other statutes. For instance, in the Prize Bonds Regulations "disability" includes not only mental incapacity but also bankruptcy, a concept not really relevant to the entitlement to Irish citizenship by birth on the island of Ireland. In the criminal law context, "full capacity" is taken to mean something quite different, where a child under the age of seven is doli incapax, which literally means incapable of wrongdoing, and a person under the age of 13 is presumed to be doliincapax unless the contrary is shown. That is not what anyone would want in the context of citizenship law.Turning to the Statute of Limitations, we find that the concept of a person "under a disability" includes a minor, a "person of unsound mind" in that now somewhat anachronistic phrase, or a convict subject to the operation of the Forfeiture Act 1870. This should have no bearing on a person's entitlement to citizenship by birth in Ireland. The situation gets more complex when we take into account that the disability concept also encompasses disability in the special circumstance of a person who has been sexually abused in childhood such that he or she is unable to initiate civil proceedings arising out of that abuse; it is likewise a notion of incapacity far removed from the acquisition of citizenship.There was consensus in Committee that the intention should be to cover incapacity of mind only, whether arising out of illness or physical damage and, accordingly, the Minister required parliamentary counsel to prepare suitable amendments that encapsulate that notion.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I thank the Minister for taking on board the substance of what I proposed in the amendment I tabled on Committee Stage. Section 3 refers to a person who is not of full age and is therefore incapable of doing what an Irish citizen is entitled to do, in other words, to apply for citizenship. The legislation would be defective if some provision was not made for those who are not of full age and also for those who would be incapacitated in terms of doing what an Irish citizen is entitled to do.The thrust of amendment No. 6. is to include the definition of "mental incapacity" however that comes about, whether through illness or a learning disability. I question if the Minister's description in amendment No. 12 is accurate. The amendment proposes the substitution of the following words, "in the case of a person who is not of full age or who is suffering from a mental incapacity". Rather than the words "suffering from a mental incapacity" the words "experiencing a mental incapacity" might be a more neutral way of expressing what is proposed. Amendment No. 19 also refers to a person who is suffering from a mental incapacity. This seems to imply that mental incapacity is related to illness only. Normally we do not use the expression "in relation to a learning disability", but the Minister might reconsider this wording to include a more appropriate form of words. However, the thrust of the amendment is welcome and it improves the legislation.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	553	The definition of mental incapacity is dealt with in amendment No. 6. It encompasses everything that is required by the Deputy.

It proposes that "‘mental incapacity' means, in relation to a person, incapacity by reason of a mental condition to manage and administer the person's affairs;". The words "suffering from a mental incapacity" occur in amendments Nos. 12 and 19. A more appropriate form of words might be "a person who has or experiences mental incapacity" rather that including the rather loaded word "suffering" which implies something further that is not required and it seems to refer more to an illness than a learning disability.

In page 4, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:"3.—The Minister shall make provision for the giving of permission for the non-national parents of Irish born children to remain in the State where such children were born in or prior to February 2003.".

In page 4, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:"3.—The Minister shall make regulations for the application to non-marital partners (as defined by such regulations) with such modifications as are in the opinion of the Minister appropriate of such provisions of nationality and citizenship law as relate to spouses.".We had some discussion on this matter on Committee Stage when I introduced the concept of non-marital partners, which is not part of the legislation. I proposed that this concept would have a similar interpretation to that which applies to spouses. This would imply, therefore, modifications that would be appropriate in the opinion of the Minister would be to made to the provision of nationality and citizenship law to take cognisance of the new concept of non-marital partners.This concept is becoming a matter of discussion and debate in respect of other legislation with the changing nature of Irish society and the percentage of Irish citizens and non-nationals involved in relationships not formally bonded in marriage. Nevertheless, they are substantial and often long-term relationships, for life in many cases. There are also strong same sex relationships that cannot be bonded in marriage at least at present, but recognition is not given to people in such a relationship under our citizenship laws or nationality law. Quite considerable post-nuptial benefits are conferred under the legislation to date, which are not available to non-marital partners. I know this cannot be grasped by the Minister of State with alacrity but it needs to be examined. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with other Departments and the parliamentary draftsman, should consider how inroads could be made into this category of people, which now constitutes a significant group. Some people in this category recently resorted to the High Court to seek recognition of their relationships.Given that Irish citizenship is so prized, that there are so many ways of gaining naturalisation and that one of those is marriage, there should be some discretion in the matter. The Minister has discretion in various areas to grant citizenship. Discretion with regard to association or affinity with Ireland, descent or blood, is not specifically stated. This is a new concept and one which has merit in being recognised. I would like to see it incorporated in the legislation. There should, at least, be a reference to and recognition of the fact that a long-standing relationship can infer entitlements. This recognition should not be confined to spousal relationships, which might not be as strong as a partnership relationship.

It is important that our legislation should be reflective of those developments. We are not talking about a passing fashion or whim. We are talking about a developing trend in our society which is likely to grow. Deputy Costello is right to raise the issue of how we react to non-marital partnerships in the context of immigration and citizenship law.There have been political developments in this area in recent times. My party colleague, Senator Sheila Terry, issued a comprehensive document on civil partnerships last year. I was glad to note that the new caring Taoiseach recently recognised that there is a problem here. He may also be thinking there are a few votes in the issue, which I presume will be the motivation behind most of his actions henceforth. Last weekend, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform acknowledged this issue.The approach suggested by Deputy Costello would be best dealt with in the context of a broader debate on civil partnerships, along the lines proposed by Fine Gael. Before one could give formal legal rights there would have to be a formal legal arrangement. For that reason, the civil partnership approach of Fine Gael is the one I recommend to the House. If we were to adopt that approach I would be supportive of a proposal along the lines of Deputy Costello's amendment, which could be incorporated into a discussion on the establishment of a civil partnership arrangement.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	559	This amendment is opposed. It seeks to empower the Minister to make regulations covering the citizenship of non-marital partners and is flawed in a number of very important respects.If the Minister were to table a Government amendment in the same terms as this one he would be roundly and properly criticised for attempting to arrogate to himself a wide and undefined power to decide the rules for applying the provisions of the 1956 citizenship Act to non-marital partners. I am confident that the movers of this amendment do not actually wish to vest such a power in the Minister of the day and have tabled this amendment simply to secure an opportunity to debate an issue which has acquired some topicality in recent weeks and months.The amendment bespeaks only opportunism and displays a failure to make any effort to get to grips with the problem on which it touches. If its movers had any genuine interest in furthering the matter, they would not have tabled this woolly and sweeping wording. They would instead have looked at the provisions of the citizenship Acts that deal with spouses and come up with some proposal setting out how they should be amended to apply to non-marital partners, the expression used in the amendment.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	561	The provisions in question are primarily those dealing with naturalisation of the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen. The Deputy's amendment does not make any suggestions as to how they might be modified to apply to non-national and non-marital partners of Irish citizens.The amendment does not even attempt to say what sort of partnerships Deputy Costello has in mind. I can surmise that he would at least encompass same sex lifelong partnerships of the nature concerned in the recently commenced judicial review proceedings on taxation law. Does he also wish to include opposite sex partnerships where the parties have chosen, presumably deliberately, not to avail themselves of the complex of rights, protections and duties associated with the legal status of marriage, and who, if that is the case, clearly do not want the law to impose any such rights, duties or obligations of the type for which the Deputy would want to make regulations? Does he wish to include partnerships where the parties would like to marry each other but cannot because one or both of the parties is already committed by publicly declared vows of marriage to someone else?These are not easy issues. Undoubtedly it is in the nature of the human condition that people in a wide variety of situations will come to a wide variety of arrangements, whether formal or informal, which they think suit their particular circumstances. The question has become topical in recent weeks and months not just because of the High Court proceedings to which I have referred but also because of two other developments.First, I refer to the publication by the Law Reform Commission last April of its consultation paper on the rights and duties of cohabitants. It is interesting to note that the commission's provisional recommendation, at paragraph 9.23 of its paper, is that there be no change in citizenship law in this regard for the present. This recommendation is based on the acknowledged evidential difficulties of proving that a couple have in fact been cohabiting, particularly where that cohabitation is asserted to have taken place abroad. Deputy Costello's amendment would of course require the Minister to jump the gun on the commission's consultation process.The other topical development is, of course, the recent invitation extended by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to the public to offer views on the provisions of the Constitution dealing with the family. Deputies will appreciate the irony of an amendment requiring the Government to pre-empt debate in that forum being tabled by a party which was most vocal in its accusations that the referendum proposal giving rise to this Bill was just such a pre-emption. Deputies cannot have it every way.In certain aspects the law as it applies to same sex couples needs to be reviewed. There may be a case for recognising such couples in taxation and pension law and, possibly, in other aspects of the law as well. There is also a case for looking at the situation of opposite sex couples who choose not to marry. However, it is not right to pre-empt the Law Reform Commission's consultative process or to pre-empt the consultation process put in train by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. This sketchy amendment does not have any basis for going forward.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	563	Yes, it is my amendment, but if somebody else wants to come in they are very welcome. The Minister of State is withering in his condemnation of the amendment, which, as he knows, was introduced only to be of assistance to him and to the Minister. The Minister of State says we cannot have it every way but we trust him and have provided him with some leeway in this amendment, which states:The Minister shall make regulations for the application to non-marital partners (as defined by such regulations) with such modificationsas are in the opinion of the Minister appropriate . . .Therefore, we have given the Minister some scope which he is always asking us to give him. He is always asking us to take him on trust. Now, however, the Minister of State throws it back in our faces and says he has been given too much scope. He does not want his opinion to be put into legislation. It must be about the only place in which he does not want his opinion to go.The purpose of the amendment was to open up the debate and give some idea of a lacuna in the legislation. As it stands, the legislation makes special provision for spouses of Irish citizens. A person is entitled to make a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship if he or she has been married to an Irish citizen for at least three years. The description is that the marriage must be valid and subsisting, and the couple must be living together as husband and wife at the time of the declaration. That will be changed somewhat but that is the substance of how the declaration operates. That provision can be transferred entirely to a long-term partnership, that is, a relationship that is the equivalent of a spousal relationship or a married relationship except that it is not a marriage. In some cases it cannot be a marriage because it involves a same-sex couple and that is not allowed here.In other cases it is the culture of quite a large segment of the community that a partnership is the way to go in society. The nuclear family based on marriage is no longer the norm in many areas of the country, as we all know. So the changing nature of Irish society is what is being referred to here and it would not tear the Bill apart, or require major changes in tax legislation, in order to incorporate it. We have seen the situation that operates already concerning social welfare benefits where the Government is quite able to take into consideration the fact that people are in a partnership relationship and it works accordingly. We could have made some progress in this area but I know the Minister of State will not accept the amendment. I did not really expect him to accept the amendment as it stands anyway but I hoped he would have been able to adjust its substance so that it could be incorporated into the legislation.

In page 4, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:"3.—The Minister shall make regulations for a special naturalisation procedure for children born on the island of Ireland who are deprived of their jus soli citizenship rights by virtue of sections 3 and 4 of this Act.".This amendment relates to recommendations made by the Human Rights Commission. The commission recommended creation of a special procedure to allow for the accelerated naturalisation of children born in Ireland to minimise the chances of the creation of an under-class of Irish children with fewer rights. The commission's submission to the Minister stated:The commission believes that if there is to be a restriction on the automatic right to citizenship of children born in the State, there should be some recognition of the special relationship with the State of children born here, with the presumption in favour of their naturalisation at a determined point.The commission pointed out that children born in Britain, for instance, are legally entitled to citizenship after ten years' residency, as opposed to being entitled to apply for naturalisation, as would be the case when this Bill is passed. Furthermore, under the relevant British legislation, children born in the state are entitled to become citizens if either parent becomes a citizen within five years.The commission was also of the view that a separate naturalisation system appropriate for such children should be developed as part of a comprehensive review of the existing system of naturalisation. It recommended that the Minister should consider making provision for citizenship, as of right, for a child whose parents have continued to reside legally on the island after the child's birth and who subsequently acquire the three-year residency requirement. The commission also recommended that the Minister should consider making provision for citizenship for children whose parents are granted temporary leave to remain in the State or whose mothers subsequently give birth to an Irish citizen child under the terms of this legislation.For once, the Minister should take heed of the proposals from the Human Rights Commission and grant an accelerated process of naturalisation for children who come under the categories I have outlined.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I support the amendment. It is outrageous that the Oireachtas and the State should contrive to have two classes of person born in this country. Children who are born at any time in this State should be Irish as of right and they should be treated as such. In that context, some of the treatment of Irish children in this country is appalling. I will cite one such example. Two years ago, an Irish child born was born to its Nigerian mother living in Wexford. Quite recently, the mother was invited to come to Dublin to meet the immigration authorities and was given an appointment. When she travelled to Dublin, however, she was arrested without warning and brought to Mountjoy prison along with her child. The child was then brought to local social workers who put it into care down the country. When I made inquiries about this case, I discovered that it is a regular occurrence for Irish children, whose parents are non-nationals, to be treated in this way. They are put into care while their parents are imprisoned for no apparent reason other than that they are non-nationals. Is that the way we should treat Irish citizens? Is that the level of degradation we should mete out to our children? After all, we pride ourselves on treating children fairly and according them dignity. I question seriously how the Minister can stand over such behaviour.When the Minister of State responds, I hope he thinks of the generations of Members of this House who over the decades have appealed to the American authorities to give special status to Irish illegal immigrants in the US by allowing them to stay and work there, to come home and return later, and by giving them American status and allowing their children have American status if they married somebody there. We have made such appeals to the American authorities as backbenchers, front benchers and in some cases Ministers.We now have a minor difficulty here and we bring the rigours of the law to bear on all those people. I ask the Minister of State to step back and think again carefully about how children born here are treated. They should be treated in a fashion of which we can be proud and over which we can stand so that we as legislators can say that the children of the nation were treated equally. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	570	The amendment is opposed. Deputies will be aware that we have a comprehensive naturalisation process and the conditions applicable to this process are clearly set out in sections 15 and 15A of the 1956 Act. Section 16 of that Act gives the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform absolute discretion in certain cases to grant a certificate of naturalisation where some of or all the conditions for naturalisation have not been complied with although this discretion is being circumscribed in the context of amendments in the Bill relating to the former investment-based naturalisation scheme.Amendments to section 15 of the 1956 Act being made by section 8 of this Bill specifically countenance the possibility of a non-national child who was born in the State having an application for naturalisation made on his or her behalf. The normal conditions set out in section 15 of the 1956 Act will apply to such applications and the waiver conditions of section 16 can be called into play in suitable circumstances so the Deputy's amendment is, to that extent, unnecessary.I take issue with one aspect of the language in the Deputy's amendment. No person who before this Bill had a right to Irish citizenship will be deprived of that right by the Bill's coming into effect, whether that be a right deriving from birth in Ireland or from birth in some other place to an Irish parent. The Government committed itself to that principle in the draft Bill published in the context of the referendum proposal. The drafters of the Bill were at pains to ensure that commitment was adhered to in the Bill now proposed and the Government does not propose to break faith with the 80% of voters who supported the referendum, or indeed the other 20%, by reneging on that commitment.The Deputy is referring to a different area of law that has nothing to do with the amendment in question, which deals with people who are not Irish citizens. The example cited by the Deputy relates to an Irish citizen and is covered in entirely different legislation.

We will have a class of children with fewer rights who might not be able to access the full benefits of our educational system because their naturalisation has not been processed owing to a backlog or bureaucracy. They might not be able to get the benefits of our health service — what few benefits they could enjoy — with other rights to which they might be entitled. While the Minister of State might take issue with the wording, the effect of the Bill is to deprive children born on the island not perhaps of their citizenship, but of their rights.One of the rights of a citizen is to be afforded the care of his or her parents. The Chen judgment recognises this and international law requires us not to discriminate on that basis. This legislation takes away those rights, as happened to ten Irish children who were deported with their parents to Romania in the past week. Let us not forget that Romania is in the middle of negotiations, to be concluded in 2007, to join the EU, which means their parents will be entitled to come back here within three years. This is how silly this legislation is and how stupid is the process of deportations embarked upon by the Minister.A Polish citizen deported in February was able to return on 1 May. The Government needs to get real. When proceeding with a deportation order the Minister needs to consider the person being deported and the benefit to the State of such deportation. The main point is that we need provision for an accelerated naturalisation process. As other Deputies said, at the moment the whole immigration process is bogged down. All these issues will go into the bureaucracy and remain there forever unless the Minister accepts the need for acceleration in all aspects of this legislation.

The effect of the Deputy's amendment, taken in conjunction with the deletion of section 6(4) of the 1956 Act provided for in section 3(c) of the Bill, would be to confer Irish citizenship automatically on all children born on the island of Ireland to foreign diplomats. This would be contrary to accepted international custom and practice.Persons with diplomatic immunity hold unique positions in their receiving state. They are entitled to privileges which are not available to the general population, citizens and non-citizens. For example, they hold tax-free status, have immunity from being brought before a court and giving evidence, and other privileges that protect the proper functioning of an embassy. Their purpose in the receiving state is to represent the interests of their own state, including their own nationals, in that state.Recognised limitations exist in international law to the granting of citizenship of the receiving state to the children of diplomats. International instruments such as the Hague Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws 1930 and the protocols to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 provide that the children of diplomats do not have an automatic right to acquire the nationality of the receiving State if they are born there. This international position was reflected in Irish citizenship laws since at least 1935. Section 2(7) of the 1935 Act excluded the children born in the State to foreign diplomat parents from Irish citizenship. In the 1956 Act, the original section 6(5) provided a similar exclusion.This was the position until the 2001 changes to citizenship law, which implemented the changes arising out of the new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. The wording of the new Article 2 was such that the exclusion could not as a matter of constitutional law continue in the Irish context and so the 2001 Act put in place a special procedure whereby the children of diplomats could if they wished exercise their entitlement to be Irish citizens by means of a declaration. With the change made by the most recent amendment in June, we are now able to revert to a large extent to the former position and section 3 of the Bill brings about that change.The purpose of the amendment in the Minister's name is to address a technical point to ensure that children of diplomats born before the enactment of the Bill retain the entitlement to Irish citizenship even where a declaration under section 6(4) of the 1956 Act asserting such entitlement is not made until after enactment. This is in keeping with the Government policy that the Bill would not remove the entitlement to Irish citizenship from any person who had that entitlement before its enactment. I urge the House to accept the Government amendment and reject Deputy Costello's amendment.

Before this legislation, the children of diplomats living in Ireland were automatically entitled to citizenship. We could not take that off them even if we wanted to. Why should we further restrict it when there are certain entitlements granted to diplomats in every country? In section 10, the non-national spouses of Irish citizens living in an embassy abroad will have their period of residence in the embassy counted for residency purposes. These are anomalies in the legislation which would not be allowed if the Minister was being logical. I do not say that diplomats should have extra privileges above those they already have, but this entitlement should be allowed. It is questionable to curtail existing entitlements and I see no reason for doing it. It is unnecessary and mean-spirited.

In page 5, line 14, to delete "person's birth" and substitute "date of the application".This is another anomaly in the Minister's thinking. He requires that anyone entitled to Irish citizenship should have a substantial connection with the country, in this case a four-year period of residency immediately preceding the child's birth. He does not, however, take into consideration any period of time after the birth. Why should it be exclusively a period of time prior to the birth? Why not include the period of time both before and after the birth or a period time after the birth? Why is it not possible to accumulate the time that the non-national would be resident in the country for the purposes of granting citizenship? It is mean-spirited that the period after the birth should not be included.Filipino nurses in Ireland on contract could end up with one child entitled to citizenship and another not entitled depending on the period of time before the birth. The Minister will say they can wait for five years and acquire the requisite residency time, but his or her employment contract might expire or be terminated. People working here on contract have little protection. It is logical to provide for a period of four years, with three years being the accumulated amount. If that principle remains valid, it is immaterial if the time is made up of a period before the birth or the period afterwards because it is a period of three years in which the person is connected to the country. Before or after the birth should not be a condition.

Even if we accept the Minister's argument, the exclusions he has proposed deprive three other categories of children whose parents have no demonstrable intention to exploit or otherwise abuse our immigration system. These categories have been pointed out to the Minister by the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, the Refugee Council and the Human Rights Commission.I propose a new section 6(B)(2)(a) which excludes from the calculation of the qualification period any time within which the child’s parent or parents were not legally resident in the State. As the Human Rights Commission pointed out, exceptional circumstances do and can arise whereby a person’s legal status in this State might lapse temporarily through no fault of his or her own. Parents’ legal status in this State might lapse temporarily through no fault of their own, and this situation could subsequently become regularised. This is especially the case under the present defective work permit system whereby the employer holds all the power. The Irish Human Rights Commission argued that there needs to be a provision to ensure that the rights of a non-citizen’s child cannot be compromised due to the action or inaction of an employer. It can and does happen, for example, that an employer fails to renew an employee’s work permit without his or her knowledge. Such a situation could be entirely the fault of the employer. Quite regularly an employer submits a renewal application for a work permit and, because of bureaucracy and the workload within the Department, it is not renewed on time. Somebody could be working in the hope that his or her employment situation would be regularised but his or her time here which permits qualification under this legislation might have temporarily lapsed.I will deal in further amendments with other occasions and categories that may arise. However, this is one category the Minister needs to allow for, where parents may find that, through no fault of their own and because of glitches in the system or an employer not fulfilling his or her duty with regard to work permit regulations, their period of time in the country has been broken.I know the legislation provides for a period of three out of four years. However, people have come to me for help in finding out the situation on their work permit applications, who have been waiting for replies for up to eight months and for whom the situation is not improving. It could soon happen that people will have been waiting for the Department to make a decision or progress work permit applications for longer than a year. This would break the qualification time limit which would mean they would end up outside the loop this legislation imposes on them.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	582	The amendments are opposed. The purpose of the proposed new section 6A of the 1956 Act is to lay down the general rule that a person born to non-national parents, either of whom has been lawfully resident in the State or Northern Ireland for at least three out of the four years preceding the birth, will have an entitlement to Irish citizenship. There is no question of such a person having to make an application for citizenship. If the parents satisfy the residence criteria, the child will have, by operation of law, an entitlement to Irish citizenship.Deputy Costello's amendment No. 17 is not only unnecessary, it appears to assume that before a person born in Ireland can acquire the entitlement to be an Irish citizen, there must be an application and that somehow Irish citizenship in these cases is in the gift of a Government body. That is not the case. It is Parliament and not some Department of State that will dictate by this law that it is being asked to pass which children born here will be citizens.The residence requirement being introduced by the Bill coheres with the minimum period of residence in Ireland required for the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen to be eligible for naturalisation. This period is sufficiently long to represent a substantial connection with the State but not so long as to act as an unreasonable limitation. The date of birth of the child is the most sensible reference point by which qualifying residence should be calculated and any other would only give rise to confusion and uncertainty. For this reason, I cannot accept amendment No. 17.Amendment No. 18 seeks to introduce into the rules for acquiring an entitlement to Irish citizenship by birth in Ireland the concept of ordinary residence as distinct from actual residence of the non-national parents in Ireland. The term "ordinarily resident" is generally used to distinguish the quality of the residential status of what might be described as a settled individual from that of an individual with a more fleeting presence. The Government has included in the proposed section 6B of the 1956 Act a comprehensive, objective and easily administered mechanism for determining these matters. In the case of a non-EU national who is resident in the State, for example, he will need to show immigration stamps covering a period of three out of the last four years. This period was deliberately chosen to allow for unintentional gaps in periods of residence. If the person in question has the required stamps, it will not be necessary for officials in the passport office, for example, to look further before issuing a passport to the person's Irish-born child. If Deputy Costello's amendment were accepted, it would be necessary for officials to determine whether the person with the required passport stamps could be deemed to have been ordinarily resident for three years. This would constitute an unnecessary complication in the passport acquisition process for an Irish citizen child. I ask the Deputy to accept that the formula in the Bill as it stands provides all the flexibility that is required and that it should be left as is.Regarding amendments Nos. 20 and 31 in the name of Deputy Ó Snodaigh, it has never been the case that a person who loses his or her job automatically forfeits permission to remain. The period of a person's permission to remain which has not expired is allowed to continue in force and a decision on extension is made taking all his or her circumstances into account. Employers do not decide who is deported from the State. With regard to the last amendment tabled by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, the main point is that the acquisition of Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is a privilege, not a right. The discretionary nature of the naturalisation process is in keeping with international practice. Thus it is not the case that a person who has been resident here has a right to naturalisation after a period or even an extended period. Since 1935, all decisions on naturalisation, even where all the statutory conditions have been fulfilled, are expressed as being at the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.A non-national's permission to reside in the State for an extended period is not contingent on the acquisition of Irish citizenship. There are many non-nationals resident here who have never applied for Irish citizenship, in some cases because to do so would impact upon their citizenship of origin. Section 15(d) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 provides that an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation must have a period of one year’s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, a total residence in the State amounting to four years. Section 16(b) of the same Act, as inserted by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001, includes a qualification to the effect that when calculating residence in the State in respect of an applicant for naturalisation who is required to have permission to reside in the State, no period will be reckoned where the applicant does not have such permission. Regarding amendments Nos. 20 and 31, I refer to what the Minister has pointed out on a number of occasions, namely, that the purpose of having a residence condition in this Bill expressed as three out of four years preceding the birth, is to allow for the gaps in actual and lawful residence that can arise in many cases.

The section provides that the parents must, for a period of three out of four years immediately preceding the person's birth, be resident in the island of Ireland. We are talking about the same two people who will be resident for a period, the principle being a period resident in the country. Why does it matter that the child would be born three years after the parents have been resident in the country rather than that the parents could spend three years in the country after the birth of the child? The principle is still the same. This is introducing an unfair element. Either we have the principle of residence or we do not. If one says one has a principle of residency but will operate it only prior to the birth of the child, then it is not a principle of residency and it violates the principle of residency.A Filipino nurse could come to Ireland pregnant but that child will not gain Irish citizenship because the parents were not resident for three years prior to the birth of the child. On the principle of residency, the parents cannot gain citizenship for the child. They will have to wait for a period and apply separately under a different principle. If they are here for two years and another child is born, he or she will also not be entitled to Irish citizenship. Will the Minister of State acknowledge his own principle and have it as aggregated or accumulated time, whether prior to or after the birth?

I am not sure of the origin of the three years or four years. Why is it not three out of five years or two out of three? If there was an explanation it might help.In regard to my amendments Nos. 20 and 31, the Human Rights Commission said:While, on the face of it, the general exclusion of time spent illegally in the State may be justifiable, exceptional circumstances may arise whereby a person's legal status in the State may lapse temporarily, through no fault of the person themselves, and subsequently become regularised. A typical example of such a situation would be where a migrant worker resident in the State on a work permit does not have that permit renewed by his/her employer. This may happen without the knowledge of the worker in question and be due entirely to the failure of the employer. In such cases, it may be necessary to consider putting in place exceptional measures to ensure migrant workers are not penalised for delays or inaction on the part of an employer.That can happen and probably more of this will emerge in later years. We have been dealing with the issue of work permits on a large scale only in recent years so we do not have figures on how often employers fail to renew employees' work permits and the length of delays. There have been a number of cases in my constituency where employees have experienced delays of eight months. There may be others who have experienced longer delays. If they experience delays of over a year, they will be outside the three or four years required. Will the Minister of State take heed of that, acknowledge that exceptional circumstances occur and allow for them in the legislation?

With respect to the point raised by Deputy Costello, I remind the House that the purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the citizenship referendum on 11 June. In its information leaflet published in April 2004, the Government indicated its commitment to the draft Bill and a willingness to support any amendments proposed which would improve the Bill, consistent with the Government's policy on citizenship. These amendments which Deputy Costello pursues seek to move away from the central provisions of the Bill which require non-national parents of Irish-born children to have been legally resident in the island of Ireland for three of the four years immediately preceding the birth of the child. There is a glaring contradiction in the proposal. Not only would this amendment, if accepted, be inconsistent with the Government's citizenship policy which clearly has the support of the majority of the people, it would create a climate of uncertainty in so far as it would give rise to an expectation that a person born in Ireland with no entitlement to Irish citizenship would, by regulation, acquire Irish citizenship.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	586	That is not true. How would it give rise to uncertainty? All it does is extend the period under which residency is determined. At present, under this proposal, residency can only be three of the four years prior to birth of the child. Why is one not allowed take in two years before and one year after the birth or one year before and two years after? This is residency of the parents, not of the child, and it on the former on which the right to citizenship is determined. There is nothing in the referendum wording put before the people to suggest there would be new regulations based on residency prior to the birth of the child. It is not in the explanatory memorandum. I do not see where the uncertainty arises. I do not accept there is uncertainty about the matter.My proposal makes the procedure more logical and underpins the principle of the new legislation outlined by the Minister of State to make citizenship dependent on connection or connectivity with Ireland on the basis of residency of the parents. The parents are resident for whatever period before or after the birth of the child. I argue that the period of residency after the birth of the child would have more to do with the connection with the country of the child. Why should the Minister say unilaterally it must be prior to the birth? That does not make sense. The opposite would be very much the case. The longer the child is in the country after birth, the greater the sense of connection and the greater the value of the citizenship. It is of benefit to everybody, and the child will have an opportunity to put down roots in the country so that citizenship is more meaningful.

In page 9, to delete lines 26 to 30.The amendment seeks to give children of students who are lawfully resident here the option to avail of Irish citizenship, which is ruled out under the new legislation. It is another discriminatory element of the legislation. The Minister said there is a logical structure to the legislation. However, there are many anomalies whereby people are ruled out for one reason or another. The time a student spends in the country is not acceptable as comprising the residency period. If students are allowed into the country, they are here for bona fide reasons such as research. To rule that they cannot in any circumstances have their time computed in order that their children obtain citizenship is wrong. This rule appears to be mean-minded and contrary to the spirit of the legislation.If there is a basic principle in the legislation, it is one of connection with the country. A student is dwelling, working, studying and putting down roots in the country. Whether these roots are put down in a university or academic setting or in a different category should not matter, they are residing and involved in the country. If people are studying as distinct from having a work permit or some other mechanism, I do not see why that cannot be computed as time spent in the country prior to the birth of a child.Amendment No. 23 seeks to include the words "unless refugee status is subsequently granted to the person". This would allow a successful refugee to backdate his or her period of lawful residence to the time of the original application. Again the principle is the same. It is a period of time valuably spent in the country and children of the family could equally have roots in the country. Children could be born during the period of the asylum process and may be going to school in the country. Surely this is a connection with the country. If the applicant is successful subsequently, what is the basis for the Minister of State's argument that this is not taken into account as qualifying residency for the child to be granted citizenship? Surely it is a successful refugee application.The process takes a long time because it is not streamlined. Nobody would deny that. It is slow and cumbersome. Even though there are fewer applicants at present, there is a huge backlog. Is it fair, given that many people have been waiting up to nine years for a decision, that only the period of residency after an application for refugee status has been fully and finally dealt with is reckonable? I do not know of anybody who has been waiting more than nine years, but I know of somebody who has been nine years in the country.Are we to take it on trust that what happened in the past will not happen in the future? Are we to take it on trust that, as soon as this legislation goes through, we will have a streamlined process for dealing with asylum seekers, that the initial application will be dealt with within a couple of weeks, that the appeals tribunal will deal with appeals and that the final decision will be taken within a few weeks or months? That is not the way it is now. It is not the way it has been in the past, and I am sure it is not the way it will be in the future.I will quote some statistics. I had hoped the Minister of State would give the House a full breakdown of statistics between those awaiting decisions and those whose cases have been processed. He informed the House that 10,584 parents of Irish-born children had their cases processed between 1996 and 2003 and that 11,943 applications received since February 2003 are still outstanding. The Minister of State gave another figure, and I do not know how it fits in, relating to 6,000 non-EEA parents who gave birth since 2003. There are other statistics he did not give. The Coalition Against the Deportation of Irish-born Children provided them to me. If they are inaccurate, perhaps the Minister of State would let me know. He did not inform the House that 465 applications of parents of Irish-born children have been processed since February 2003 under the new scheme, of which 45 were granted and 420 refused. The Minister of State informed the House that 37 applicants have been deported, but he gave none of the other figures. There will therefore be approximately 380 more deportations. Those figures mean that in the 20 months since the L & O case and the end of the scheme a few weeks later, the 78 people who have been working on these cases have processed 465 cases to finality. That is an average of six cases——

The figures I have given equate to a work rate of six cases in 20 months for each of the people in the Department who are working on it. That is quite a low work rate, if my figures are correct. These figures were given to me by a particular group of people and I would like to hear the Minister of State's response to them.The purpose of my amendment is to provide that, where an application for refugee status has been successful, the period of lawful residency should be reckoned from the time of the original application. There are grounds for doing that because the process is so slow and cumbersome as well as being unaccountable and non-transparent, given the difficulty of making contact with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to find out what is happening in individual cases. In those circumstances, is it not fair that a person whose application for refugee status has been granted should be allowed to date the period of lawful residency from three years prior to the birth of a child, irrespective of the length of time they have been an asylum seeker, for the purpose of acquiring citizenship for the child?

There are two aspects to be dealt with. The first, to which amendment No. 21 refers, relates to people who spent time here as students. The other, which is dealt with in amendment No. 32, relates to people who have spent time in the asylum process, including those applying for leave to remain here temporarily for humanitarian reasons. The proposed new section 6B(4)(b) excludes from the calculation of reckonable residency any time which the child’s parent or parents spent legally in this State on a student visa. The Immigrant Council of Ireland and the Commission on Human Rights have both raised objections to this unnecessary exclusion. It makes no sense. Students contribute to the economic life of this State, more in recent years than in the past. That foreign medical school graduates, whom we need to retain in Ireland to support our struggling health system, frequently decide to leave has a negative impact on our health care system in that we provide training for such students and our health care system loses when they decide there is no point in remaining here because the time they spend training will not be taken into account if they apply for naturalisation or citizenship.The Commission on Human Rights maintains that this provision in the Bill is not consistent with the standards of justifiable discrimination set out in the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They are the basic reasons for my amendment. I propose to strike this provision and make all time legally spent in this State for the purpose of study reckonable in any determination. Our economy needs well educated immigrants. I hope this will provide an incentive for those educated in the State to remain after they have completed their studies to raise families and continue their contribution to Ireland's social and economic life.Amendments Nos. 22 and 33 seek to include the time spent in the asylum process, including for those applying for temporary leave to remain for humanitarian reasons. Significant concerns have been raised by the Human Rights Commission, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, the Irish Refugee Council and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism regarding the proposed new section 6B(4)(c) which excludes from the calculation of a qualification period any time within which the child’s parent or parents were legally resident in the State pending determination of a refugee claim. I propose in my amendments to strike this section to allow for any time spent lawfully in the State to be reckonable in any determination. This exclusion also affects children born to parents who apply for and are later granted a temporary right to remain on humanitarian and compassionate grounds under section 3(6)(h) of the Immigration Act 1999.The Human Rights Commission, the National Refugee Council and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism have called for the Minister not to penalise the children of those who are legally resident in the State for long periods pending determination of applications. Those eventually granted such protection also have a recognised right to the protection of the State under the principle of non-refoulement. The Human Rights Commission maintains there is not reasonable justification for the exclusion of children of such persons from the rights of citizenship.I draw the Minister's attention to the commission's submission to him, where this issue is addressed. The submission states: "This exclusion is probably the most significant restriction on qualification for citizenship contained in the proposed Bill." While recognising the current six month target for processing asylum claims and the recent progress made in reducing processing times, the commission reminds the Minister:. . . significant numbers of asylum applications are still not processed within this timeframe [and] a significant proportion of asylum seekers who are ultimately granted a declaration of refugee status are granted that declaration after appealing an initial rejection of their claim. As a result, many asylum seekers remain awaiting a final determination of the claim for extended periods of up to a number of years.The commission reminds the Minister that "any person who is awaiting a final determination of their claim is clearly legally resident in the State and any failure to process their application in a timely fashion is ultimately the responsibility of the State and not the applicant." The commission concludes: "While it would currently be exceptional for a person to await a final determination for a period of three years . . . the vast majority of asylum claims should be processed within a three year period", as referred to in the Bill. Therefore, the exclusion in the Bill is not warranted.With regard to the children of a parent or parents who do not fit the convention definition of a refugee but who are ultimately granted leave to remain here on humanitarian or compassionate grounds, such parents may have a legitimate fear of ill treatment. As the Human Rights Commission points out, such discretionary leave to remain in Ireland's de facto system of complementary protection exists because the Minister has not yet legislated to introduce a formal system of complementary protection, which is much needed. However, the draft Bill makes no direct reference to persons who have been granted such leave to remain for humanitarian and compassionate reasons. Therefore, such persons appear to be subject to the general residency requirement which would only begin after the leave to remain is granted as the period of time spent in an asylum process is and would be excluded.The commission has called on the Government not to penalise the children of such applicants and, in putting my amendments, I repeat that call. How was the period of three years out of four decided upon? Why is it three years rather than, for example, four or five, or two out of four? Is there a specific reason the Government is hung up on this timespan? If so, perhaps the Minister of State will explain it to me.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	595	I dealt with the issue raised in the last question. It was the most suitable timescale. The amendments are opposed. Amendments Nos. 21 and 32 aim to alter the rules for reckonability of residence provided in the Bill for the non-national parents of children born here and for naturalisation by permitting time spent on temporary permission for study purposes to be taken into account.Arguments have been put to the Minister that many of those who come here to study go on to enter employment and put the qualifications they have acquired in our educational institutions to good use for the betterment of the Irish economy. While I accept that this sometimes happens, for the most part non-EEA nationals permitted to enter Ireland for study purposes are pursuing courses of short duration. Everyone who is in that position knows from day one that they are permitted to stay for the duration of the course of study and are expected to return home after that period is up. They know their status is temporary.A graduate who secures employment here on foot of an employment permit or, depending on the field of work in question, a work authorisation, starts from scratch whether the qualification was obtained here or in some other country. Having served as Minister of State responsible for labour affairs at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I know there is wholesale abuse of the laws by persons remaining here illegally, which is unacceptable.Given that a non-EEA student's stay in the State is always temporary, it makes no sense to have a temporary stay reckoned towards the residence requirement for one's child to acquire an entitlement to Irish citizenship. The principle underlying the Bill is that an entitlement to Irish citizenship should be available to the children born here of non-national parents who can demonstrate their commitment to life and a future in Irish society. Those who have been admitted for a purely temporary purpose and who know from the start that it is a temporary permission can have no expectation that it will be treated other than as a temporary stay. I cannot accept this amendment as to do so would be to go against that fundamental principle of the Government's policy on Irish citizenship law.The effect of amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 33 would be to alter the rules for reckonability of residence provided in the Bill for the non-national parents of children born here, and for naturalisation, by permitting time spent as an asylum seeker to be taken into account. Deputy Costello's preference in amendment No. 23 is that such time would only be taken into account if the applicant for asylum is granted refugee status subsequent to the birth of the child.We have seen how the Irish asylum system has been abused in the past by parents anxious to avail of Irish citizenship law by securing the birth of their child on Irish soil. The history of many cases is the same. Expectant parents arrive in Ireland either by entering illegally and claiming asylum within the State or by making a claim for asylum at the point of entry in circumstances where they would otherwise be refused admission on normal immigration grounds. Shortly afterwards the child is born and within days or weeks the asylum claim is dropped and the parents seek to stay here on the basis of being parents of the Irish citizen child. The Bill will make that process no longer an attractive proposition because the child born in those circumstances will not be Irish.Admission to the State for the purpose of making an asylum claim is strictly temporary. That has been a feature of Irish refugee law since the Referendum Act 1996. Asylum seekers are under no illusions about their temporary status. They are told that in advance in a language they can understand. The document which authenticates an asylum seeker's stay in the State is called a temporary residence certificate. In the case of Gonescu, which was determined in July 2003, the Supreme Court confirmed this fact. It stated:Persons who are allowed to enter the State for the purpose of making an application for asylum fall into a particular category and never enjoy the status of residents as such who have been given permission to enter the State as immigrants ... the very purpose of an application for refugee status is to seek permission to be allowed to enter and reside in the State as immigrants and benefit from such status.The sad experience of the Irish asylum system is that most claims turn out to be unfounded. I wish it were not so, but it is. This Bill makes it clear that if an asylum seeker in Ireland becomes the parent of a child born here, that child will not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless the parent is stateless as well as an asylum seeker, in which case the child will not merely be entitled to be an Irish citizen but will actually be one regardless. That is the only circumstance where that applies. No false hopes are raised that maybe by having a child here one might at some stage in the future be let stay. One will only be let stay in Ireland if it turns out that one is in need of the protection of the State.I am satisfied that the Bill at it stands achieves the correct balance as it applies to the children of asylum seekers on the one hand and refugees on the other, and that any apparent anomalies can in practice be rectified by the naturalisation process. Similarly, as far as amendments Nos. 32 and 33 seek to change the policy settled in 2001 regarding the reckonability of temporary periods spent in the State for study purposes or as an asylum seeker, the logic is precisely the same, as is the position of the Government. For that reason I cannot accept these amendments.

With regard to the amendment about the time spent by a student in this country being reckonable, it does not carry much weight to say that people stay on or have stayed on and are abusing the laws. We are talking of people who are legally entitled to be here, students with student visas who come to Ireland to study. If they abuse the law in some way and stay on beyond the agreed period, obviously they do not come within the remit of any amendment which I or anyone else brings to the House. We are talking of bona fide students in this country who have put down roots, who have entered into relationships and to whom children have been born. Moreover, our hospitals are by and large served by non-national doctors and surgeons who came to this country and studied in the Royal College of Surgeons or the medical faculties of our universities, then stayed on and applied for jobs.My second amendment relates to people who apply for asylum and then get refugee status. The Minister of State said that 90% of asylum applications are unfounded and that the asylum system is abused. Whatever the merits of what he says, we are talking purely of someone who made a bona fide application for asylum, for refugee status, and who has been granted it. We are blue in the face explaining to the Minister of State that people have been in the system for up to nine years. Under this legislation, that is not recognised in terms of the time.

He said that was the most appropriate period. Why was that so decided? Where did the figure of 36 months come from? It is not good enough merely to say that is the most appropriate period. There must have been some determination. Is it comparable to the period in other jurisdictions or did the Minister simply pick it out of the air?The Minister of State also raised the spectre of asylum seekers remaining illegally and abusing the system. I have always been of the opinion that those who abuse the system need to be dealt with by the system. In terms of this legislation and the amendments, we are looking at those who have managed to get favourable judgments, with the periods they have spent in this country being taken into account in getting their children's citizenship applications dealt with as quickly as possible and having those children accepted as Irish citizens. We must recognise that some students and doctors in this country have been contributing for a number of years so that their time spent here should be taken into account when they make a request for citizenship. Under this legislation it will not be considered.The Minister of State said that some people made asylum applications which they dropped once they became parents of a child born in this country. The majority of those who drop their asylum applications do so because of encouragement by the officials of the Minister of State's Department.

That is the length the courses take and that is a considerable period of time. When we talk of students putting down roots, entering into relationships and getting married, all that can take place in that period of time. If someone later specialises in cardiology, for example, that takes a further period of time. Such people are entirely ruled out by the Minister of State.I intend to put my second amendment to a vote if the Minister of State does not accept it. It relates to someone successfully applying for refugee status. If my amendment were accepted and the time spent in the process was reckonable for residency purposes for these people's children, the best result would be that the State would be pressurised into putting in place a streamlined process so that people would not be in the system for up to nine years awaiting an outcome. That would be in the interests of the Government and of everybody as well as being a humane way of dealing with the issue.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	600	On a point of clarification, regarding the example of a doctor given by Deputy Costello, there is a scheme involving students and professionals. From the time a non-national student becomes a qualified doctor he or she enters into a different classification where all the classes of professionals are covered as workers rather than students. That is the beginning of their reckonable period.I emphasise again that the number of those who apply to study in this country with no other reason than to gain access to the country is significant, as is the abuse in that area. We have to be very careful. The problem is people come here legally as students but have no intention of studying and wish to come in by the back door.

In page 10, to delete lines 16 and 17 and substitute the following:5.—Section 9 of the Principal Act is repealed.The content of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment No. 25 was discussed on Committee Stage, at which time the Minister indicated that he would examine whether section 9 of the 1956 Act is redundant. This section provides that a "child born posthumously whose father was, on the date of his death, an Irish citizen shall acquire Irish citizenship under this Act on the same conditions as if his father were alive when he was born". Having examined the provisions of the 1956 Act, in particular the amendments made in 2001 and those provided for by this Bill, we are satisfied that this section is redundant and can be repealed.

However, that this type of formulation was in place in the first instance is a poor reflection on the Department. We should not need to amend references to "father" to include references to "mother". This is not the way to gender-neutralise legislation. The Department must consider a different mechanism to ensure that legislation which comes before the House is written in a proper fashion, rather than reviving the outmoded method of stipulating that "man" also refers to "woman" and "he" can also mean "she", as utilised in Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment. I urge that a proper method for gender-neutralising legislation be introduced to give proper effect to our agenda to ensure that all legislation is properly reflective of society.

In page 10, line 20, to delete "infant" and substitute "newborn child".The purpose of this amendment is to bring clarity to the legislation by providing that the section is intended to relate to newborn infants who may unfortunately be found abandoned in the State. As currently drafted, the section could be construed as implying that any person up to 18 years of age could be considered as a foundling and thereby acquire an entitlement to Irish citizenship by operation of law. This amendment puts the issue beyond doubt.Legislation in other states makes similar provision. In the United Kingdom, for example, section 1(2) of the British Nationality Act 1981 refers to a "newborn infant who . . . is found abandoned". Section 5(3)(b) of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 refers to “a person who, when a child, was found abandoned in Australia”.

I understand the Minister's concerns in that regard. I wonder, however, if there is a danger that we have gone too far the other way in confining the protection to newborn children. This leads to a situation where every deserted newborn child first found in the State shall, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to have been born in Ireland to parents at least one of whom is an Irish citizen. The problem as I understand it is that there is no definition of a newborn child. It that omission a defect in the legislation? Essentially, a strict and literal interpretation of a newborn child would be a baby who had just emerged, as it were. What is the position in the case of a two-month old, a two-day old or two-week old baby? I raise this issue because it might give rise to problems. Was it in the "Importance of Being Earnest" that a baby was found in a basket in a railway waiting room, or is my recollection of Wilde correct? How old was that baby? What is the definition of a "newborn child", a phrase proposed to be inserted in the Bill?

The Minister expressed concern on Committee Stage about a reference to"infant" in terms of what exactly that word means and who is an infant. What age does one start and cease being an infant. Could one have a strapping big lad who is described as an infant? Who is a newborn child? There is the reference to newborn child in swaddling clothes. When is one a newborn child and when does one cease to be such? All the Minister of State has done in this regard is expand the dilemma and create further confusion with the reference to newborn child, especially since there is no such definition in the legislation. It seems there is a need to go back to the drawing board on this amendment to get greater clarification on what the new phraseology means.

The Minister of State's explanation does not bring such clarity. I accept that this is probably an issue that will not arise too often. I do not know how many foundlings, to use an old expression, appear in the State in any one year. I imagine it must be a rare occurrence. With vulnerable, young women, such situations can arise from occasionally. I have read reports in the newspapers where the Garda Síochána has pleaded with mothers to come forward. Therefore, such cases arise. I will not go to the wall on this amendment, but I wish we had a clearer, more lucid explanation from the Minister of State on this point.

In that way it would not be left to the common sense of those in the courts or anybody else to determine at some future date. We are the legislators after all and the more loose ends tied up before consideration of the Bill is finalised the better. That would be preferable to leaving it to the courts to make a decision on the matter, which would only compound the problem.

In page 11, lines 21 and 22, to delete all words from and including "a" in line 21 down to and including "if" in line 22 and substitute the following:", reference to Irish associations shall not include the making of an investment in Ireland but shall include circumstances where a person meets one of the following criteria".Under the guise of abolishing the passports for sale scheme, it seems we are considerably reducing the meaning of that historic phrase "Irish associations". We all know what the phrase "Irish associations" was interpreted as being. With the passports for sale scheme, Irish associations seemed to be so broad that virtually a friendly chat with somebody somewhere could almost create an Irish association. We hardly need dwell at this point on the abuses of that scheme that took place or were reported to have taken place. There are still question marks about the scheme and I welcome that we are putting an end to it once and for all. I compliment the Minister of State on doing that even though I am not as pleased that he does not provide any solid provisions in this legislation which would allow us to revoke any passports that have been acquired in a fraudulent fashion — that is putting it a bit strongly — or acquired where somebody subsequently may have engaged in criminal activity. I tabled another amendment that addresses that issue, but I am not sure if it is one of this group of amendments.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I wish to share my time with Deputies Wallace, Brady and Ellis.It may be obvious but it is worth restating that I am a Meath man. Pride in Meath runs through me like a message through a stick of rock. I am proud of Meath. Like everyone else in the House, my location and family place is a central point of reference in my life, in my mental map and my sense of heritage. The fact that I am a history graduate adds to my fascination with history, heritage and the past.Ireland, indeed Europe, has few sites as significant historically as Tara. It is part of our ethos, our memory and our archaeological wealth. It is part of what makes us Irish. Some may think that is over the top, but I do not. I would never and could never do anything or support a policy that would be to the detriment of Tara or its surrounds. I venture to say that no one from County Meath would do so. No one is more committed to guarding our heritage and our history. I speak not just for myself but for Meath people generally. I believe it is our collective duty to protect our heritage and our history in a way that serves the needs of our citizens in the present and into the future.The needs of the residents of Meath are not adequately served by our roads. The problem is simple. Towns like Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells are choked with traffic which does not move. This traffic delivers immediate and measurable health damage. Those towns are smothering in the fumes of cars, lorries and trucks which cannot move. We know the damage the fumes do to all of us, but particularly to our children and our older people. Our children and older people are entitled to clean air in their home place. That is a simple and fundamental entitlement which people no longer enjoy because of the necessary growth in the use of cars.The daily tasks of shopping, meeting friends and sharing neighbourhood information are all made more difficult and less pleasurable because of the level of traffic passing through these locations. The M3 will reduce the level of traffic passing through Dunshaughlin by 75%, Navan by 78% and Kells by 90%, bringing real and tangible benefits to the residents and the businesses in those towns.The problems do not only affect the people trying to go about the business of living in our towns, they also affect the people who are moving through those towns. It takes ages for drivers to go through and the time spent is fruitless, pointless and frustrating. It is not easy to measure the damage to the health of drivers but it is real. It is not easy to measure the economic cost of traffic delays but they are also real.The economy of Meath is being choked and suffocated. The lack of a proper road infrastructure has hindered the social, economic and tourism development of the county for decades. This cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. However, the Labour Party motion would mean that it would continue indefinitely. The proper, sensitive and speedy development of the M3 is vitally important for the development of County Meath. This development is urgent.Against that overwhelming and imperative need, the Labour Party motion must be seen as a definition of hypocrisy. The Labour Party has shown little interest in Meath until now. It cannot even get people elected to Meath County Council. The Labour Party's sudden involvement and interest in Meath does not demonstrate a passion for the environment, concern for the heritage of Meath or commitment to the real needs of the people of the area. It demonstrates in the most crudely obvious way a need to do something spectacular in Meath to try to make some impact at the upcoming by-election. It is no more and no less.

Labour Deputies talk about building bypasses around Dunshaughlin and Kells and leaving the bit in between. They want everyone to have another look at the bit in the middle. That runs so counter to good planning, on which we often get lectures from Deputy Gilmore and the Labour Party, that it should be remembered for all time as an illustration of Labour Party thinking and forward planning. It is cheap, opportunistic and highly illogical. It makes no sense whatsoever. One cannot build two ends of a road and then decide where to build the bit in the middle.

Improvement started in 1997 and will continue. A Fianna Fáil led Government started the building of roads in Meath which the county deserved and needed. The proposed new road is urgently needed. We committed ourselves to providing the infrastructure necessary for the economic development of Meath. That economic development has been badly hindered by a lack of infrastructure and by the absence of the necessary roads. Not only has Meath suffered because of that lack, so also has the north west, Cavan and other counties along the route of the N3. The Labour Party is trying to hinder the next necessary, essential and pivotal step in that progress, the proper, sensitive and speedy development of the M3. The Labour Party, which has little or no support in County Meath, has some neck in putting this kind of motion before the House.

#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	654	I am glad to speak to the amendment. The proposed M3, which is under debate, will provide over 60 km of motorway, to run from Clonee to north of Kells on the Meath-Cavan border at Whitegate. Before the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, leaves the Chamber I compliment him on moving the project forward while he was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Having been a member of Meath County Council for many years, I heard the recurring debate on traffic jams in my town of Kells, as well as in Navan and in Deputy Mary Wallace's area of Dunshaughlin.On numerous occasions in the past, successive Governments of various parties neglected to provide alternative bypasses for those towns. In 1997, following pressure from councillors in County Meath, including myself and Deputy MaryWallace, and from the public, the Government set about providing a proper roads infrastructure for the county, under the guidance of the Taoiseach and the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey.Between 15,000 and 28,000 cars crawl through the town of Kells every day, with traffic backing up at Navan and Dunshaughlin. County Meath has the fastest growing population of any county outside Dublin. The population has grown by more than 22% in the past six years. It now stands at approximately 135,000 and is expected to increase to 180,000 by 2012.Clearly, the present infrastructure can no longer meet the demands placed upon it. Even my colleagues in the opposition would agree that spending four hours a day commuting to and from work severely impacts on many people's lives and is unacceptable. The situation is causing hardship to many of my constituents in north Meath, as well as in counties Cavan and Westmeath.On completion, the M3 will enable motorists to bypass Kells as well as Dunshaughlin and Navan. The road will also cater for traffic from other towns and villages in County Meath. In this way, the M3 will make life better both for people living in those towns and for motorists using the roads. The M3 will provide safer, faster travel for approximately 22,000 vehicles a day.At the moment, there is a high incidence of road accidents on the N3, which is unfortunate, but the new road will reduce accident rates by up to 50%. I appreciate that Opposition Members tabled this motion based on their deep attachment to our Celtic heritage but, while that is commendable, I believe it is misguided. The National Roads Authority and Meath County Council, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, have taken every precaution under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004, which introduced new procedures for approved road projects.Fianna Fáil is committed to preserving our heritage. It was the party responsible for elevating the heritage portfolio to a Cabinet position. The Opposition has made much of the threat from the proposed M3 to the ancient site of Tara. The reality is that the new motorway route lies 1.5 km east of the limit of the record of a monuments-designated area, and east of the existing N3. In other words, as it passes through the Tara-Skryne Valley, the motorway will be a greater distance from the Hill of Tara than the existing N3 Dublin-Navan road.The Labour Party has severely criticised the route which was chosen after exhaustive research, taking into consideration safety, cost and technical issues, as well as environmental and archaeological sensitivities. For example, on the Dunshaughlin-Navan section of the scheme, which is closest to the Hill of Tara, ten potential routes were identified and considered. For this section, each of the ten routes was professionally evaluated with reference to the factors listed above and the impact that the road might potentially have on an area of immense historical importance. It was only when all these factors had been assessed by a team of professionals that the route was chosen.The route concerned was considered to be the best one, not only for servicing traffic demands but also regarding its impact on properties and local communities, in addition to its overall impact on the local environment.The chosen route was then considered by An Bord Pleanála as part of the planning process. The board conducted what was the most extensive oral hearing for a road scheme in the history of the State, lasting 28 days, before planning approval was finally granted. Perhaps the Labour Party is unaware of the extensive consultation and research that went into choosing the route. The party has proposed upgrading the existing N3 Dublin-Navan road instead, which is not feasible.As my colleague, Deputy O'Connor, pointed out in the debate yesterday, there are 62 house or farm entrances, 47 field entrances and two commercial entrances on to the existing N3 between Dunshaughlin and Navan. Closing these access points would require the provision of a series of local access roads, dramatically increasing the footprint of the road scheme and leading to increased severance and environmental impact. Widening the existing road would involve demolition and encroachment on the existing properties.Furthermore, there are 184 houses adjacent to the existing road between Dunshaughlin and Navan. Perhaps Opposition Members will tell us what they would say to local people who would clearly be adversely affected if this route were chosen.The Labour Party's newest recruit and by-election hopeful, Councillor Dominic Hannigan, provided his own solution to the roads infrastructure problem in County Meath, without even knowing what he was talking about. He suggested in the Irish Independent that the solution was to build bypasses around Kells, Navan and Dunshauglin, while a redesign of the proposed motorway could be undertaken. This is totally misguided and would double the destruction of the natural landscape, possibly including archaeological remains, when constructing the new roads as well as the motorway. It would double the cost by effectively building two parallel roads, in addition to doubling the delay.Does the Labour Party seriously think it would not take years to start designing new bypasses, purchase even more farmers' land by compulsory purchase order and then build the road? The M3 is ready to start, pending the resolution of archaeological issues. Labour's basic message would appear to be, "Double the misery for the people of County Meath and totally waste taxpayers' money."The M3 motorway is a much needed project, consistent with both the national development plan and the national spatial strategy. It is vital infrastructure which will contribute to the ongoing success of the local and regional economy, and will bring better balanced regional development, improving safety and access to and from Dublin, including the port and airport.The M3 project will result in reductions of through traffic of 75% in Dunshaughlin, 78% in Navan and 90% in my town of Kells. It is estimated that as traffic volumes continue to grow, between 30 and 60 minutes will be knocked off peak journey times between Kells and Clonee as a result of the construction of the scheme.
#JohnEllis	unknown-#JohnEllis-party	unknown-#JohnEllis-dob	unknown-#JohnEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	655	Having used the N3 for 20 years to come to Dublin two or three times a week, I was put off it in recent years by the volume of traffic and subsequent delays. I now use the N4 since the bypasses were opened at Longford and Mullingar.

#JohnEllis	unknown-#JohnEllis-party	unknown-#JohnEllis-dob	unknown-#JohnEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	657	The bottom line is that the bypasses work as far as the towns are concerned but traffic jams now exist in places like Clonard, Enfield and Edgeworthstown, which means that bypasses only represent a short-term solution to the roads problem.In my position as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, I propose to hear submissions from the various groups interested, namely, the commercial groups, the local chambers of commerce, local authorities and others regarding this road. The road affects my part of the country as much as anywhere else. Many people from south Leitrim use the N3 and its poor quality has been a deterrent to development in the north west. It is imperative on me as on other Members of the House to ensure we have a level playing pitch regarding the development of the country. This can only be brought about by giving each area equal access.Having been on the road today and seen the two and a half mile tailback going into Dunshaughlin at 5.30 this evening and the four mile tailback from the Columban Fathers residence in Dalgan Park into Navan, it is time somebody took action even if this means that some people's aspirations must be hurt in the process. For the development of the north west, including Cavan, Meath and south Leitrim as well as south Donegal, it is imperative that this road proceeds as quickly as possible.In the context of building roads, the progress being made on the M4 is testament to what can be done where there is a will. In this case certain people neither have the will nor the way to have the M3 built.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	658	Legitimate concerns exist over the protection of the Tara-Skryne Valley as well as the needs of our residents to get to and from work. In this debate we find these two competing, the people who object to the motorway out of their concern for the Tara-Skryne Valley and the people who do not want further delays on this much needed road. The commuters who sit in their cars for four hours every day do not want the road delayed further. The proposal has been on the table for more than five years. Even if construction begins in 2006 it will be 2010 before it is completed. In the meantime the Meath people who live on roads such as the Ratoath to Skyrne road are under siege from the traffic using this county road instead of travelling on the N3.Villages such as Kilbride, Dunsany, Kilmessan and Bective and the county roads that link them are all equally affected. These roads are not able for the volume of traffic bypassing the N3 and using county roads. The speeding of cars at 60 mph on these county roads puts local families and children in constant danger. Even though Garda checkpoints were introduced at the request of residents and the findings are that motorists are within the 60 mph speed limit, the impact for pedestrians and children on these county roads is enormous. These people deserve our representation in Leinster House. They are crying out for a resolution to the ongoing objections to the motorway so that they can have some quality of life and safety on their county roads.The Opposition proposals before the House would not help these people because further delays on the Dunshaughlin-Navan road would mean the commuter traffic would use the Skyrne-Ratoath and Dunsany-Bective roads, not to mention the difficulties, as outlined by Deputies Johnny Brady and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, that would be experienced by existing residents on the N3. The problem would be exacerbated for them by improving the road at either end while leaving the stretch of road in between in a bottleneck. Who wants to live at the beginning and end of a motorway without being able to get on to the road? This will happen to the residents who live between Dunshaughlin and Navan if we proceed with the proposal before us.At the outset I said that legitimate concerns exist over the protection of the Tara-SkryneValley and in moving the project forward it is important these issues are addressed. Meath County Council has applied to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for directions on carrying out the archaeological works associated with the M3 approved road project. It is important to take a very professional approach to protect our heritage and archaeology in the Tara-Skryne Valley. I am not unhappy about the fact that the full test procedures are being applied to the council and the NRA by An Bord Pleanála and by the heritage section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because the protection of our archaeological heritage is important to all of us.In his address here last night the Minister for Transport gave considerable detail of the test trenching process and other archaeological methods being applied. It is fascinating that work such as this adds long forgotten sites to our archaeological record and it is equally interesting that considerably fewer sites per kilometre have been found on the M3 route than on the M1, which is only a few miles away in east Meath. However, the people in east Meath have their road to take them to Dublin and the heavy traffic has disappeared from their county roads, while we continue to suffer in areas like Ratoath, Skyrne, Kilmessan, Dunsany and the areas to the east and west of the N3.The M3 motorway is a key part of the plan to upgrade the overall road network. It will significantly improve road transport connections commencing at the dual carriageway at Clonee and continuing to Kells. Deputy Ellis referred to the transport corridor that provides links to the north west. He said he left that road to join the other national routes to come to Dublin. At least he stays on national routes, for which we thank him, unlike all the traffic that comes up and down the county roads by my house and other roads in the Ratoath area.Our biggest problem in south County Meath is the sheer volume and speed of traffic on our county roads because they cannot travel on the N3. As a directly elected representative of the residents of the Tara-Skryne Valley I believe it important that I put across today the views of my constituents who sit for four hours per day in their cars. That takes from their quality of life and they deserve representation. Equally those locked in their homes because they cannot get out on county roads in safety have no quality of life. At the same time we all want to be sensitive in protecting the archaeological heritage of the Tara-Skryne Valley.The proposal by the Labour Party makes no sense to these people. It makes no sense to the commuters who spend four hours in their cars every day as they will just be caught in the bottleneck between Dunshaughlin and Navan. It makes no sense to the residents locked in their homes because of the danger of the speed and volume of traffic. It makes no sense for the protection of the Hill of Tara as it only moves the road closer to the Hill of Tara. The NRA proposal moves the M3 further away from the Hill of Tara than the existing N3 route. The Labour Party proposal would move it closer to the Hill of Tara.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	670	As well as the Labour Party suggestion that they stay in the bottleneck between Dunshaughlin and Navan, motorists continue to hassle people in my village of Ratoath as well as Skyrne, Kilbride, Dunsany, Kilmessan and Bective by travelling east and west of the bottleneck, which is unacceptable. We must find a better solution. Let us work together for such a solution. The suggestion put to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government by Meath County Council at least tries to move on, suggesting that we protect the Tara and Skryne area by carrying out the archaeological work associated with the M3 project. If that was undertaken, it would clarify the situation and move on the project, giving some quality of life to the people I represent in south County Meath.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	671	I commend the Labour Party and Deputy Gilmore for tabling the motion which the Green Party supports wholeheartedly.To respond to the Fianna Fáil Members from the area, no one disagrees with the need to change the prison people are in when they commute for four hours a day. That is not the argument; the argument is if we are prepared to destroy our countryside and archaeological heritage in the process. Do we have to do that? The Labour Party is right — we do not.Another reason for questioning this entire road development is that it simply will not work, it will not shorten the journey times that people are subject to. The National Roads Authority made a presentation in the Joint Committee on Transport last week which supported information from the EIS on the M50 road widening which clearly showed that almost from the opening of the widened road, which will have eight lanes, it will be completely congested. The head of the NRA said it will be so congested that we will need to start tolling access roads to the M50 or put traffic lights on it. No matter how wide we build a motorway between Kells and Clonee and no matter how super the roads in the country, I can tell the commuters in County Meath that it will not work, it will lead to a traffic light on the approach to the M50. They will queue there for the same four hours that they wait now. In transport terms this is madness and must stop.There is an alternative, one that would guarantee that people would not spend four hours commuting. If the Government built a rail line and ran a proper commuter service to Navan and points beyond, servicing those towns, and it was run along the same lines as the high quality public transport system that my constituents have in south Dublin, it would solve the problems of long distance commuters that have been created by our transport patterns. That is what we should support, not a road which will destroy one of the most important archaeological sites in Europe.We must assess transport not just on the basis of what the NRA can build but taking in environmental and social issues. A roads-based transport system is the most discriminatory transport system we could possibly have. Over 20% of households in this country do not have a car but Fianna Fáil does not care about them, despite the Taoiseach's recent nonsense about being a socialist.This is the first argument that people on this side of the House and those represented by our opinion will win. We lost in the Glen of the Downs, in spite of the fact that we were right — there has been no decrease in journey time for people using that road. We lost in Carrickmines as corrupt rezoning ploughed a road through a national monument. When it comes to the M3, however, we will win because of the political change in this State and the realisation that the roads-based policy does not work. We are not willing to lose our archaeological past or give up our sense of ourselves and from whence we come. The current political mood questions where we are now and the way the Government wants to move forward. It is bent on building roads and servicing the building industry at whatever cost. That is its idea of progress. It is not progress, it is destruction, it is bad transport and social planning and, for a party that wraps itself in a republican mantle, it is destroying the essence of our heritage and our ability to understand it.For those reasons, I commend the motion to the House. There is a real problem — people are unwilling to question the political idea that roads cannot be stopped and that the road-based transport system works. That attitude is changing.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	672	Sinn Féin supports this Labour Party motion. Mr. Joe Reilly, a Sinn Féin councillor on Meath County Council, has been vocal in his criticism of the decision to route the M3 through the Tara and Skryne valley. He has called on numerous occasions for the delayed Dunshaughlin, Kells and Navan bypasses to be proceeded with as a matter of urgency.The Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources stated that the construction of the three bypasses is not the best option. That would be correct in normal circumstances but given the catastrophe that the Department and the NRA have made of this project to date, the construction of the three bypasses at this late stage, following the complete lack of consultation and bad planning, is the only correct option.No matter how much the Minister for Transport and the NRA play down the impact of the proposed routing on the archaeological heritage of the Tara-Skryne Valley, the evidence contradicts these assertions. Archaeological test trenching proved that there are many more archaeological sites on the route of the proposed motorway than initially claimed. Eminent archaeological experts from Ireland and abroad have testified to the archaeological importance of the Tara-Skryne Valley and have spoken about their dismay at the proposed routing of the motorway.The Government got itself into this mess because it did not consult adequately with local communities or elected representatives. It should have learnt by now that taking time to consult in the initial stages saves time and money in the long run. The case has been made by many of those campaigning against the proposed route of the M3 that there are viable and realistic alternatives where both infrastructure and heritage can be accommodated. The single 64 kilometre construction contract for the M3 should be broken up into a number of contracts to ensure work on the bypasses and non-contentious sections of the route would not be further affected by archaeological concerns and delays in the Dunshaughlin to Navan section. The people of Meath and Cavan should not be forced to endure the current levels of traffic congestion because of the delays to one section of the proposed motorway. The best way to address the appalling congestion problems we have heard about from many contributors is to proceed immediately with the work on the bypasses.Commuters are irate that despite the fact that Meath County Council approved a plan for a bypass of Kells in 1999, nothing has happened to date. Public transport in County Meath is seriously underdeveloped. As well as proceeding immediately with the construction of the bypasses, the Government must commit the necessary funding for the reopening of a rail link from Dublin to Navan. Traffic congestion is inevitable in the absence of proper public transport alternatives. Navan is one of the fastest growing towns in the State and a commuter rail service is vital and would make environmental sense.It is proposed that this motorway should be constructed by way of public private partnership and should be tolled. The Government arbitrarily upgraded the road, which was to have been a dual carriageway, to motorway status just to apply a toll. Sinn Féin is opposed to PPPs as a method of infrastructure delivery. They do not make long-term economic sense and cost the State more in the long run. Road tolls are an additional stealth tax on motorists and the consequences of tolling this route for a person who lives in Cavan and travels to the southside of Dublin is that he will be ripped off three times — once between Cavan and Navan, a second time between Navan and Dublin and a third time by the Department's modern day highway men who are waiting to fleece him yet again on the M50 toll bridge.Will the Department and the Minister display common sense at this late stage and revisit the issue by breaking up the contract before this gets any more ridiculous?

There should never be a conflict between building motorways and respecting our national monuments. There is always a solution if people just open their minds and listen to constructive proposals.I welcome the construction of quality roads and the upgrading of the national roads network. That is why I ask the NRA immediately to consider other options for the proposed M3 and to discontinue its plans to route it through the Tara-Skryne valley. It would make sense and also protect valuable resources such as Tara.We need to address the current transport problems on this corridor by proceeding immediately with the Dunshaughlin, Kells and Navan bypasses, by other road improvements and the provision of a Navan-Dublin rail link. When will we wake up to the importance of rail links servicing the countryside and the Dublin area in particular? It would also lead to reduced traffic congestion in the capital. We need to invest in the railways and let them get on with the job of alleviating traffic reduction. If we do not act now, we will choke our capital city and destroy the environment. There does not have to be a conflict of interest between our transport needs and respect for the environment and archaeological sites.One can look to the future to come up with new and progressive proposals, but at the same time the past must always be respected. Anyone who damages Tara or its surrounding area is guilty of environmental vandalism. I urge everyone participating in this debate to think now before it is too late. We cannot allow 6,000 years of history to be wiped out. We must remember our culture, history, the children and future generations, while not forgetting the enormous economic benefits Tara brings to this area.In my previous day job as a teacher I must have brought hundreds of inner city Dublin pupils to this area on their school tours. There was always a sense of amazement and wonder when they visited sites they had learnt about in our school. These places make our history. They come alive and are an extremely valuable educational asset. This debate is more than just about roads. It is about sensible planning, quality transport services and our past. That is why I am supporting the motion in the House tonight. I urge all Deputies to support it.If the Government and the NRA are serious about the protection of our national heritage and the preservation of historical sites, then the views expressed tonight on this major issue will be taken seriously. I urge all Deputies, cross-party, to support this motion.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I support the motion in the name of the Labour Party and commend the party for tabling it. In my view the running of a road such as this through the greater Tara area would be a destruction of our national heritage and archaeology. This is one of the rarest archaeological sites in Europe, if not the western world, and in my view it should be unthinkable that a motorway would run through it.Representatives of the National Roads Authority recently attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport. It was quite clear from its presentation that Dublin will be surrounded in a few years time by a ring of steel called the M50. That ring of steel, which is currently tolled, will be tolled further, as will the roads accessing it such as the one under discussion tonight. Those roads will also have traffic lights on them, so it will not be possible to significantly reduce the travel times for traffic into Dublin.I believe that the priority transport system for access to Dublin, not just from Meath but from the entire country, should be rail. Rail lines should link all the major towns in the greater Dublin area to the capital and money and resources should be prioritised for that purpose.I have a serious difficulty as regards the National Roads Authority itself. There is a large democratic deficit in the way it operates and is building the road system. A question cannot be asked by a Member of this House without him or her being told that the Minister for Transport has no responsibility for the NRA. The notion that the Minister has no responsibility for the roads programme should certainly be changed.Finally, I object strongly to the section in the Government amendment which states that "the Government investment in our road network is essential to provide for balanced regional investment and is delivering shorter, safer and superior road journeys". In fact, the roads programme has been in the east of the country predominantly. The rest of the country, the south and west, have been bereft of any serious road development. In my own area, the N24, the bypasses at Tipperary town, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir have been on the backburner for years. If we want balanced regional development, roads in other areas of the country, apart from the east, should take priority at this stage.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	675	I am happy to support this motion and I thank the Labour Party for supporting me when I was suspended from the Dáil last week. I also thank my Independent colleagues, the Green Party and Sinn Féin for their support. However, I do not thank Fine Gael for abstaining. I thought it was bad form. I include my constituency colleague, Deputy Ring, who abstained as well. I cannot understand that. If the shoe had been on the other foot, I am sure he would have had plenty to say about it.I am pleased to support the motion which is both logical and commonsensical. There is much common sense in ensuring that there is a proper road from north to south on the west coast, but also on the east coast. This is logical. It follows that balanced regional development should be encouraged as much as possible. What the NRA has been doing militates against balanced regional development. If one looks at the mid-term review, the Indecon report on the National Development Plan 2000-2006, one sees that only 69% of the proposed spend was carried out for roads in the BMW area. This compares to 134% overspent for the south and east. It is obvious that there is a mis-spend here. I hope that will be rectified in the near future.Balanced regional development would help the entire country. Some 20 million passengers use Cork and Dublin airports. Consider the projected 400,000 people going through Knock Airport in 2004, after 18 years. Would it not make more sense to build proper roads to Knock Airport to ensure that people could travel to this really beautiful airport instead of trying to bring 20 million people into Dublin and Cork airports? The €40 million that is needed this year for Knock Airport should be invested, instead of the pittance that is going in there. I am glad to support this motion.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	676	In the two minutes available, I want to put on record my support for the motion before the House, with its emphasis on the hill of Tara national monument and its surroundings. I also support the assertion that current transport problems on this route should be addressed primarily by proceeding immediately with the provision of a Navan-Dublin rail link, as referred to by other Deputies, and indeed the long-awaited bypasses at Dunshaughlin, Kells and Navan.I fundamentally support the immediate discontinuation of the Government's plans to route the M3 motorway through the Tara-Skryne Valley. An alternative to this motorway is essential, and I hope the Minister will agree that another option must be decided on. Listening to Deputy Wallace and others on the Government side tonight, however, that does not seem likely.The plans of the Government and the National Road Authority to build a motorway through the Tara-Skryne Valley must be rejected. This area is a most important archaeological site. It contains in the surroundings of the hill of Tara the highest concentration of archaeological sites in the country. We are told that it is one of the largest and most important heritage sites in the world. Most of the sites are not even surveyed and will be lost forever if this misguided project goes ahead. It has even been alleged that when deciding on the route the National Roads Authority ignored its own archaeological consultants, who had advised that the road should be directed away from the area. If this is the case, then it is a disgrace and the Minister should reject the route now.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	677	I would like to share my time with Deputy Michael D. Higgins.Why is it that neither the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, nor any of his Ministers of State have not come into the House since the debate commenced? The Minister does not seem to be prepared to answer the debate in the time available to him.Tara is, because of its associations, probably the most consecrated spot in Ireland, and its destruction will leave many bitter memories behind it.The above is not a quote from one of the protesters against the proposed motorway through the Tara-Skryne valley. These words come from the London Times of 27 June 1902 and were written by none other than Douglas Hyde, George Moore and W. B. Yeats. Not since then has there been such an attack on Tara. On that occasion it was the British Israelites who were trying to dig up the hill looking for the Ark of the Covenant. Today we are defending the Hill of Tara from a threat much closer to home, an attack perpetrated by the Government parties who seem intent on ripping apart the Tara-Skryne Valley and destroying the intact and perfect landscape forever, employing the National Roads Authority as the instrument for its destruction.We have been accused of tabling this motion on the basis of emotionalism, yet the road will destroy the most valuable archaeological, literary and historical site in the country which is revered all over the world. Its destruction has been likened to cultural vandalism akin to "ripping a knife through a Rembrandt". This sorry saga began with the proposal for a badly-needed bypass for Dunshaughlin in 1999, but within a year the development had become a motorway. Meantime, the towns of Kells, Navan and Dunshaughlin filled up with more and more cars as the Dublin hinterland spread ever wider into the countryside, compliments of the zoners. Without the upgrade to the motorway and the huge delays, Dunshaughlin would be bypassed by now and the bypassing of Navan and Kells might have begun. Instead the hard-pressed commuters suffer more delays.We all have a natural emotional attachment to and empathy with Tara. There is not a person in Ireland who has not heard of it or who does not understand its importance. It is not just a County Meath issue. We have a duty to protect Tara, not only for future generations but for the millions of emigrants and all those who claim Irish descent.I have spoken before of our abandonment of the Irish who emigrated. Members of the Irish emigrant community have been moved to express their horror and disbelief at this proposal on thepetition organised electronically by the save the Tara-Skryne Valley group. One states:A highway through this is perhaps one of the greatest natural disasters ever contemplated, equivalent to destroying the pyramids of Egypt to erect a parking lot. I am astonished the project has been contemplated in any seriousness.A second is as follows: "Are you really going to send millions of tyres over the graves of the high kings?" The outrage at this motorway is not confined to Irish citizens or to the diaspora. Academics in the fields of Celtic studies and archaeology all over the world have objected to the development. In a letter to The Irish Times, the president of the American Institute of Archaeologists said:We appeal to the Irish authorities as a matter of urgency to move this section of the M3 away from the Tara/Skryne valley and to save this precious legacy from our shared past for posterity.Another letter, signed by 22 of the most eminent archaeological experts in the world in the discipline of Celtic studies, was also printed in The Irish Times. It states:Tara is a virtually intact archaeological landscape of monuments with the Hill at the centre. Driving a four-lane motorway through the valley will destroy the integrity of this ancient landscape forever.We urge the Irish Government to revoke the decision by An Bord Pleanála and to choose instead one of the other routes proposed for the M3. We also urge it to apply for World Heritage status for Tara so that it is preserved for future generations.A further letter, signed by 30 academics from various fields of modern and medieval history from all over the world stated:This . . . valley is one of the most culturally and archaeologically significant places in the world. Many monuments predate the Egyptian pyramids. It is precisely because it has remained intact, unlike many comparable continental sites, that it holds a special key to understanding the continuous progression of European civilisation.Is it possible that all these highly respected academics are wrong? Tara is as much a symbol of our national identity as the harp or the tricolour. It dates back 6,000 years and during most of that period it has been used as a the major sacred site in the country.The National Roads Authority continues the fiction that Tara is confined to the actual hill but this is not the case. It must be made clear and repeated to the point of boredom. The top of the hill that we call the Hill of Tara is only part of the much wider, integrated landscape that was used for thousands of years by our ancestors. We are all aware that motorways lead to development along their routes with a proliferation of housing, petrol stations and fast food outlets. Is that what we want for our premier archaeological and historical site?The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who refuses to come into the House for the debate, says he is taking advice from archaeologists but Tara is much more than archaeology. It is the heart that beats at the centre of all the early literature and history of the country. He should take advice from the experts and meet them as well as the National Roads Authority and Meath County Council archaeologists who will present only one side of the argument. He must listen to both sides before any decision can be made. It has been said that he is opposed to the building of a quarry in the Glen Ding Viking site in Wicklow. If a Viking site is worth preservation in his constituency, how much more important is the centre of our civilisation in the Tara-Skryne Valley?Recently the Taoiseach visited the area and on return told the House he could not see Tara from the route of the proposed motorway. I would like to know who brought him there. It could only have been the National Roads Authority. It did not point out to him that he was standing on Tara, or that he should view the area from the hill, or from the Hill of Skryne. For the best view, he should view it from his helicopter.The Taoiseach has declared himself one of the last socialists in the country and a republican. Let him also declare himself a man of cultural understanding who has the courage to be Taoiseach in the real sense of the word, that is, the leader or chief who defends Tara from its latest invaders. There is no doubt that the traffic problems in the counties surrounding Dublin are reaching crisis proportions and that decent roads are needed, but not this road. Why destroy Tara to save some undefined sum of money? Would we drive a road through Clonmacnoise or Glendalough or recycle the Book of Kells as scrap paper?What will be the cost of this destruction? Nobody knows because we have little enough idea of what is there. Six to ten routes were examined by the National Roads Authority but it ignored the preferred route of its experts and chose this one because of a cost benefit analysis. It all came down to saving money. What will be the difference in the cost eventually? What did the longer route cost and what savings will be made when the costs of delays and archaeology have been paid? The latest estimate for the archaeological work is €30 million and the engineer has said the road will not be finished until 2010. What will be the price of Tara? Will it be €20 million, €30 million or €40 million? It is an incredible waste of money on completely unnecessary excavations.We should learn from the mistakes made in other countries while we have the opportunity, including the dreadful mistake made by the British Government at Stonehenge where the road must be replaced by a tunnel at huge expense while it tries to row back on the damage it inflicted on its foremost archaeological and cultural landscape.We have the time and the opportunity to avoid this catastrophe. We must re-assess the position, including all points of view, from dissenters and protesters, landscape architects, roads engineers and economists, with a view to finding a proper alternative. A longer more expensive route would probably be cheaper in the long run. We ask that the obvious solutions be arrived at. The bypasses should be built first, the public transport system should be improved so that people are not forced to use their cars adding to traffic problems in the larger Dublin area, the old railway line should be reopened and the Minister should reroute the remainder of the motorway away from the Tara-Skryne valley.The bottom line is that we should not be here debating this motion. The Irish people should not have to defend Tara from an Irish Government. Future generations will blame this generation for the irreversible destruction of the landscape if this proposal goes ahead. Reacting to another proposal to build a road around Tara, Thomas Davis said:If they persist in this brutal outrage against so precious a landmark of Irish history and civilisation, then, frankly, I say that if the law will not reach them public opinion shall, and they shall bitterly repent the desecration.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	678	I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this important issue. I do so as a former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with responsibility for the built and natural heritage, which position I held between 1993 and 1997. I remember very clearly that the Discovery Programme, which was launched before I took office, was engaged in an investigation of the Tara archaeological landscape. I am sorry that Deputy de Valera, my successor, has left because she would confirm that Edel Bhreathnach's first volume of research on the history and literature of Tara was launched by me in 1995 when I was Minister with responsibility for heritage. Conor Newman's archaeological survey of Tara was launched by Deputy de Valera in 1997, the year I left office. These two fundamental archaeological works, which are definitive and scholarly, establish what is for any intelligent person the "Tara archaeological landscape". This entity cannot be reduced to sites discovered by the NRA in its work.Is it not extraordinary that neither of the aforementioned experts on the archaeology of Tara was consulted on the issue we are debating and on which we are deciding tonight? I listened to the Minister's speech with great care last night and noted the differences between his Ministry and my former Ministry. I introduced legislation dealing with national monuments when I was Minister and I tried to ensure that matters of culture and heritage had equal status with the matters of concern to other Ministries. During my four years in office, I had to take actions in defence of heritage that opposed the actions of some of my colleagues in Cabinet.The thinking on heritage at the time was such that the two respective Ministers responsible for the environment and heritage were equal, but that in a matter of heritage the Minister responsible for the latter would be the lead Minister. If the matter could not be resolved, one returned to Cabinet. This thinking became so offensive to the populist and philistine ethos of Fianna Fáil that it abolished the Department over which I had responsibility. Culture could not survive and was the first thing removed from the title of my Department. Afterwards, the heritage functions were transferred to the Department with responsibility for the environment such that it was clear that they would be under the thumb of the Minister responsible therefor. Everything has suffered as a result. The Chairman, for example, wrote to me to tell me that a question I tabled on the destruction of the species life of a river could not be raised in the Dáil as the Minister had no function in that area and that it was a matter for the Environmental Protection Authority. This is extraordinary in a democracy.Heritage suddenly became a phenomenon that might or might not be considered within the Department with responsibility for the environment. The Department of the Environment and Local Government demolished accountability to this House by establishing the NRA. On listening to the Minister's speech last night, I noted that it is not he who is presiding over the Discovery Programme or new initiatives in archaeology. The NRA is pounding on and as it discovers more sites and hires archaeologists to do impact assessments and so forth, it almost becomes the guiding archaeological authority in a country with thousands of years of history.It is not just ignorance but philistinism that allows one to conclude that the life-world, imaginative life and spiritual life of a people and the significance of Tara can be easily cast aside and that one can set up a false division between contemporary traffic needs and archaeological responsibility. This motion opens with a very clear recognition of the traffic problem of commuters and sets down different strategies by which it could be resolved in the short term without legal contest regarding the bypass. What is essentially wrong with this? It is not part of the grandiose thinking of the NRA, which is assigned the role of autobahn creator in contemporary Ireland. We must stand back on occasion and take account of the price of this thinking. The price is very serious in terms of our national heritage. People will examine the policies on this Government and state that heritage and consideration thereof has entirely expired.Let us deal with truths. The speech made by Deputy Olivia Mitchell was unfortunate. For example, she suggested that it was almost a rent-a-crowd that was objecting to the proposed road. I have given details of the two main scholars who were not even consulted on the issue. The independent authorities chosen by the NRA to examine and evaluate the different routes came down strongly in favour of protecting the archaeological heritage and suggested that an immense price would be paid if it was not protected.The operations of the NRA provide an example of imposition on the part of an unaccountable body using the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It is time I said in the House that the NRA will always find archaeologists who need to work. It is dividing the archaeological community. However, those who are responsible for academic standards, both in practice in the field and in consideration of the importance of different sites, have been unanimous in their opposition to what is proposed. They are asking those responsible for the proposition to stand back because it will not be possible to reverse their actions. The carrying out of the proposition would not just be a mistake or the wrong option but would have an irreversible, appalling impact on something that has been part of the life-world of a people for generations.As I have stated, the NRA's own independent experts issued an unequivocal warning about the route that is being recommended. They said it was an integral part of Tara's archaeological and historic landscape. I have some sympathy for those who posit Tara's importance in the spiritual life of people over long aeons. This is expressed in their culture and sometimes, but only in a limited sense, in their artefacts, and very much in their mythic understandings of themselves. Moreover, I sympathise with the concern that one would have in the Tara area a major floodlit interchange that would in turn invite a kind of development that is singularly inappropriate. That will be the badge of our times, measured against the long sweep of Ireland's heritage and history, be it mythic, spiritual or ecological. The Government that will be responsible for this should be remembered forever.When I as Minister launched the first report of Dr. Edel Bhreathnach, I was in awe at the quality of the research, as was my successor Deputy de Valera regarding the second volume of research that was published. Why do this research if its impact is to be ignored? It was important that we had the findings stated for all time. In this regard, I give credit to my predecessor who founded the Discovery Programme in 1992. The international position on the research published in 1993 was that Ireland was recognising, with its scholarship, the importance of a site of international significance. That is why the American Society of Archaeology and the British Society of Archaeology and every significant professor of archaeology in Europe are unanimous that it is a terrible insanity to proceed with the proposed road. It is simply wrong to say that, because the NRA is stating it will dig investigative trenches, it is acceptable to proceed. Incidentally, such trenches manage to miss much that is of archaeological importance and do not accord with best practice, as was contended last night.It is not a matter of some arcane notion of heritage standing in the way of progress. We can meet our transport needs responsibly without this appalling, invasive destruction of our heritage.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	679	I am fully aware of the rich archaeological landscape in County Meath, the importance of the Hill of Tara and its significance to our national heritage. Meath County Council and the National Roads Authority are also aware of the special place the Hill of Tara holds in the national consciousness, and of their responsibility to protect it and the cultural heritage of County Meath. A great deal of time and expertise has been given to this project and the route was carefully chosen to avoid the important core zone around Tara.I listened carefully to the various contributions to this debate. It is clear that there is general agreement on the need to upgrade the N3. The road is not capable of carrying current traffic volumes safely and the impact of the congestion and delays on local communities and road users is not sustainable. The solution the NRA and Meath County Council are pursuing to deal with these problems, namely, the full upgrade of the N3 along its full length between Clonee and Kells, has been developed following an extensive planning and consultation process involving detailed assessment of a range of transport, environmental, archaeological, safety and cost factors. The process culminated in approval of the project by An Bord Pleanála following an extensive oral hearing. Given the location of the project, archaeological considerations were to the forefront at all stages in project planning.Nevertheless, some continue to believe that the project should not be undertaken, that an alternative route should be used or local bypasses should be provided. The reality is that a total of ten route options in four broad corridors were examined as part of the route selection study for the Dunshaughlin-Navan section of the scheme and considered not feasible. Deputies referred to various options in their contributions. All these were assessed at the planning stage. For example, the on-line improvement of the existing N3 Dublin-Navan road is not feasible. There are 62 houses-farm entrances, 47 field entrances and two commercial entrances on to the existing N3 between Dunshaughlin and Navan. Closing these accesses would require the provision of a series of local access roads, dramatically increasing the footprint of the road scheme and leading to increased severance and environmental impact. In addition, 184 houses would be affected.A further route considered was a route to the west of the Hill of Tara. It would have a serious impact on the Hill of Tara due, in particular, to visual intrusion and was, as a consequence, ruled out. In addition, a western route avoiding the Hill of Tara would have been remote from the existing road network requiring long tie-backs to the existing road, with associated implications for the environment and severance of properties and farms.Deputies also referred to a route to the east. This route, east of the Hill of Skryne, would have a significant impact on the Hill of Skryne and its associated upstanding archaeological structure due, in particular, to visual intrusion impacts. An eastern route would entail a high level bridge across the River Boyne, giving rise to significant visual intrusion problems. It is clear that a wide range of alternative routes were considered. It is important to remember that a range of factors in addition to archaeology, all real life issues, such as the environment, impact on people and their homes, land severance, traffic, engineering and cost considerations, must be taken into account and balanced carefully in coming to a conclusion on the best route.Another issue raised in the debate last evening was the availability of the geophysical surveys. The results of these surveys were reported in great detail in the EIS and a full copy of the technical reports were made available to the national monuments division of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. It should also be noted that as geophysical surveys cannot identify all archaeological sites, a major programme of test trenching was carried out. This is the most effective method of identifying any archaeology that may be present.It is clear that a great effort has been made, and continues to be made, by the NRA and Meath County Council to mitigate the impact of the proposed road on the archaeological heritage. I ask that a number of key points be borne in mind in considering the issues involved, first, the proposed route is located well away from the Hill of Tara and, second, major resources are being deployed to ensure that the impact of the project on our archaeological heritage is minimised.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	680	I wish to share my time with Deputy Rabbitte.This Labour Party motion is a democratic opportunity and offering by the Labour Party to Fianna Fáil to give a second thought to what it proposes to do in regard to some of our cultural heritage which is irreplaceable. Someone referred earlier to the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera. It is difficult to know what the founder of Fianna Fáil, Eamon de Valera, would think of the proposal put forward by the party he led.The Minister of State said that all the options were examined, but I wonder is that the case. Anyone who is familiar with the route of the N3 and the daily traffic misery faced by many commuters who relocated to Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells will be aware of the sheer misery of the commuter trek which is visited on them. It is worth asking why is this commuter trek so miserable, particularly when one reaches the bottleneck of the M50, the Blanchardstown area and the Naval Road. It is because the Government fails to adequately consider the essential features necessary when building tens of thousands of new homes over a short period in what were once relatively small towns, and the absence of adequate public transport.We all know that inevitably many people will always have to use their cars because of their job commitments. However, many people living in Navan, Trim, Dunshaughlin and Clonee would welcome fast and first class public transport to get them from their homes in Meath to work in different parts of Dublin. If the Government were to consider the public transport solution two things would happen. There would be the development of quality bus corridors from all the towns to which I referred, together with a significant additional number of buses serving each of the towns. Many people from Dublin recently relocated to Trim. Deputy English knows what the commute is like to get to the permanent car park that is the N3 at Blanchardstown and the daily permanent car park that is the M50 from the Blanchardstown roundabout to the Red Cow Inn, and everything that entails. What will the Minister do?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	697	I thank everybody on all sides of the House who came in to contribute to this debate. In particular, I thank my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, for constructing this motion and giving Dáil Éireann the opportunity to discuss an issue whose importance is far beyond the building of any road.I am very disappointed that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, unnecessarily injected a sour note of contention into the debate by attacking the motivation of the Labour Party in putting down this motion at a time when the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, had just returned from the other House where a similar motion, the authorship of which is not the Labour Party, is being debated tonight.There is growing, widespread concern about the implications of what is under way. It is entirely unnecessary for Minister Dempsey to come to this House and explain the intolerable burden being imposed daily on commuters who come from Kells and through the intervening towns to work in this city. It is entirely unnecessary for the Minister to explain how industry is being choked as a result of the intolerable congestion and gridlock with which we are familiar. It is entirely unnecessary for him to explain the demographics of County Meath and how the population is rising, and the implications of that. We agree with all of that. Deputy Gilmore spelled that out last night. We agree that the situation is intolerable for commuters. However, we fundamentally dispute the proposition that all one has to do is go ahead with the present plans and the burden will be lifted from the shoulders of commuters and we will return to 1960s and 1970s comfort-style driving.That will not happen because the essential point, which Deputy Gilmore made last night, is that if we have learned anything it is that this route will be litigated for years. While the lawyers are down in the Four Courts the burden imposed upon and endured daily by motorists will not matter a whit. That is why this argument and the intolerance displayed by Minister Dempsey and other Fianna Fáil speakers is so wrong-headed.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	699	I accept there is frustration. I accept what Minister Dempsey set out in describing the nightmare of it all over the years. Since Albert plucked him from relative obscurity in 1991 he has had the opportunity to do something about it. I do not know why he is apportioning blame to this side of the House. Even before 1991 he was on Meath County Council. Deputy John Brady at least had the honesty to admit responsibility on the part of his Government and Meath County Council. He did not say Meath County Council was the author at the time of the proposal to put in the bypasses in the fashion recommended by Deputy Gilmore in this motion in order that we might get on with the issue while reviewing the route.Deputy Ruairí Quinn intervened in the debate last night and traced our experience from Wood Quay, through Luggala, Mutton Island in Galway to Carrickmines. Have we learned anything from that experience? That is the issue that confronts us. In claiming that the Labour Party motion will be the cause of indefinitely postponing the road, Deputy Noel Dempsey entirely misunderstands the situation. If the Government goes ahead with its existing plan, it will indefinitely postpone any alleviation of the plight of motorists. If we are seriously interested in alleviating that burden on motorists, we will avoid that interminable litigation that inevitably beckons.I do not agree with the conclusion of my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that because roads are not the solution to our transport problems — he is right about that — we should not build the road. Roads are part of the solution. The other part of the solution is public transport, and a commuter link from Navan is an essential part of alleviating burden on the shoulders of stressed motorists. I do not agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that we should not build the road. We want to build the road, and build it as quickly as possible, consistent with not getting bogged down in litigation. Deputy Noel Dempsey's ill-tempered contribution is difficult to understand because neither do I agree with another speaker in the House who was opposed to a public private partnership. I do not believe that is right in all circumstances. It depends on the particular circumstances.Fianna Fáil tried to turn this issue into an argument between motorists and those who are concerned with our heritage. That is entirely wrong. The suggestion that all motorists are philistines when it comes to heritage is entirely wrong. One has a sense of déjà-vu about this debate. I remember another debate with very similar resonance. It raises the question of the whereabouts of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. The motion was addressed to him. Deputy Michael D. Higgins has traced how heritage has become subordinated. Now we have a situation where the Minister who pestered us with the Glen Ding issue until a couple of months ago has suddenly gone underground. What have the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in common, apart from being two small ambitious men? What they have in common is that they were the authors of e-voting. We came to this House and pleaded with them not to proceed with the ill-considered and inadequate provision for e-voting-——

No time should be wasted by the new management of the health services delivering in that sector and the investment needed in it should be given priority. Most speakers made an issue of the fact that care of the elderly must be expanded and requires investment.There is a provision in the Bill concerning the sale of health board property. I specifically refer to the property surrounding St. Canice's Hospital in Kilkenny and other properties owned by the health board. The new executive should consider the fact that prior to the abolition of the health boards, a clear indication was given by some health boards that if property was sold, it would be ring-fenced for the health board which owned the property prior to the introduction of the new management system. The South Eastern Health Board discussed this issue and I am pleased to note the appointment of Mr. Pat McLoughlin to the new management structure. That board identified the use of St. Canice's Hospital campus for care of the elderly because a number of beds are needed for long-term care. The current facilities at Castlecomer and St. Columba's Hospital in Kilkenny are excellent but require investment. The number of beds in that service needs to be increased.I hope that when the incoming executive begins to look at the sale of property, it will remember the policies put in place by some health boards and will direct the spend of money generated by the sale of such property towards projects which the old health boards had in mind. In that regard, I remind the Minister that €1.2 million was being spent in St. Canice's Hospital as one part of a project for care of the elderly. When the property is sold and money becomes available, the second part of the project should receive investment. I commend the Bill and ask the Minister to take note of that aspect of my interest in it.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	724	I wish to share time with Deputies Enright and Naughten.This is an important Bill by any standards and I would prefer to be able to wholeheartedly welcome it. However, I cannot do that. On reflection, the public will see this is a bad deal for the health services. In my contribution, I will try to give an idea of what I believe are the main drawbacks and deficiencies in the Bill. There is a certain amount of deviousness in that this is not an honest Bill. We all know changes are needed in the health service and Fine Gael is all for the necessary changes which could, and should, be made. However, the public does not want cosmetic changes, of which there is no shortage in this Bill. People expect that changes made will provide better health care for their families and themselves and that it will be provided with dignity.Will this Bill produce the goods? I do not believe it will because its faulty foundations are built on sand. There has been no concrete planning for the future, which I will explain in a moment. I will also explain why I believe this is a dangerous Bill. Vast powers will be vested in the Health Service Executive. I have seen many such executives since I first became a Member of this House many years ago. Taking the National Roads Authority as the prime example, it was one of the greatest side steps of all time in so far as accountability to this House was concerned. Members of the House cannot ask day to day, procedural questions about what is happening with roads. We are told it is a matter for the National Roads Authority. The same will happen with the Health Service Executive because under the Bill, the new chief executive will be the accounting officer. As a result, we will not be able to table parliamentary questions or hold emergency debates and freedom of information requests will be severely curtailed. I do not like what I have read.It seems this huge change is being introduced on an  ad hoc basis. The Government is making it up as it goes along. It could not find a chief executive even though it spent all year trying. All it could do then was push the chairman in as goalkeeper to save the day. I have nothing against the chairman but he obviously was not the Government’s first choice or it would not have gone to the trouble it did to find a chief executive.I always believed the chief executives of the health boards were the driving force behind the delivery of health services. To my knowledge, 90% of them do not know where they will go after Christmas. There is no room for the most influential people as yet because nobody has thought this out. It is a "make it up as one goes along" strategy.With regard to the Hanly report, the Government is pulling the fastest stroke of all time. The new executive will implement the report because its members will not be brought on to the floor of this House to be accountable to the public. The Government will merely refer the executive members to an Oireachtas committee, which could take 12 months. When they appear before a committee on technical matters, they need only attend for two or three hours. There is no accountability in the system.If ever there were an opportunity to implement the Hanly report, it is now. The Government has silenced the entire array of political input. The provisions relating to the complaints procedure indicate that the executive members will complain to themselves and for themselves and nobody will take any notice. There is no statutory obligation on anybody to accept what they say or believe in. The public is watching this debate closely. It is clear that the Government will hide behind the skirts of the new executive and will use it as a ploy to claim that it has no responsibility in the matter and to wash its hands in a Pontius Pilate attitude. If this is the case, we are doing a bad week's work for the people. The birds will come home to roost and many people will be badly hurt at the end of the matter.No more thought has been put into this Bill than was invested in the formulation of the decentralisation scheme, which has come undone. That was another random notion just before last year's budget. Little more effort has been expended in devising this legislation. It is change for change's sake. There is no substantial thought put into it, good or bad. The legislation has been born as a weak infant and I do not predict that it will get any stronger.An important element of the Bill is the centralisation of power in the health service. If one considers an issue such as mental illness, a very reasonable proposal was put forward by the Western Health Board on the occasion last year when it became known that St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe was being phased out. Nobody can deny that much good can come from a centralising approach, up to a point. What was proposed in this case was that the proceeds of the substantial property attached to this hospital would be sold at public auction and allocated to the development of mental health services in north Galway. What will happen now that everything is to be centralised? It is possible that the funds from that hospital will go towards some other mental health facility elsewhere.I have severe reservations about this Bill. I hope I am wrong but I do not believe that to be the case.

I regret that there is such limited time to speak on this Bill and that the opportunity afforded to each Member is so brief. The Bill will be effectively finished nextFriday and it is a pity that such important legislation is rushed through in this manner.I wish to deal briefly with certain aspects of the Bill. With regard to section 2, I am somewhat surprised that advice can only be given to the Minister if it is requested. I may be told that this is always the case but that does not mean it should always be so. The right of the executive to offer opinion or give advice is limited to those cases in which the Minister asks for it. Furthermore, section 7(5)(c) stipulates that the executive must have regard to the policies and objectives of Government or the Minister. This provision is too broad and we have seen Ministers on solo runs in the past. This section is open to two readings. If the executive must have regard to the policy of the Minister, it may be entirely different in some instances from Government policy. In such a situation, to which policy should the executive afford chief regard? This is an issue that must be reconsidered.I have concerns regarding the proposed membership of the board, an issue I have raised with regard to other legislation also. The Minister will appoint all 11 members. From our knowledge of the interim board, there is a tendency to appoint people to run the health service from the world of business and banking. There have been some with health experience but it is an adequate number. It is clear what members cannot be. Deputies, Senators, MEPs and councillors cannot take these roles. However, the legislation does not stipulate what qualifications members should have. Guidance should be given as to how the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children will make her selections when the time comes. We are not told if the chief concern is a medical, administrative, accountancy, legal or education background. No guidance is given in this regard.Section 13 tells us how somebody may be removed from the board. Some of the reasons are clear and others less so. Again, there is no indication as to how members will be appointed to the board. I am concerned that the provisions that apply to other members will also apply to the CEO. This issue must be considered.Section 20 gives the CEO the role of accounting officer, which was previously held by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children. This is another concern. The CEO may be brought before an Oireachtas committee at its request to give an account of the general administration of the executive. However, the CEO cannot offer an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or Minister, even though the decisions he or she makes will be affected directly by those policies. If the Minister believes that the 11 board members are the experts who can run the entire show, they should surely be able to express dissenting opinions to the Government, Minister or Oireachtas committee. The ultimate decision will rest with the Minister but the board members should be able to make their views known to Members of this House.I share Deputy Connaughton's concerns with regard to the NRA. I come from a constituency that has had plenty experience of national roads coming through, particularly in Laois but also in parts of Offaly. I can recall members of the Government parties attending many meetings to express their frustration, concern and helplessness with regard to roads issues because the power was given to the NRA. Those members will come into the House next Tuesday like turkeys voting for Christmas and effectively vote for a similar situation with regard to the HSE. I shall see these same Deputies at meetings in a few years time claiming that the Government is powerless and all blame rests with the HSE. It is they who will vote to put the HSE in place and we will remind them of that when the time comes.The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was not present at a meeting I attended in Tullamore earlier this year when the Health Boards Executive was established. It was a lovely day out with presentations galore. The HeBE has rented a lovely building but one is forced to wonder what will happen to it now. Where will the staff who were put in that building at the beginning of the year go and what will be their role under this new system? Who made the decision to put this facility in place and fund it for such a short period of time in the knowledge of what would come downstream shortly after? The staff are extremely concerned about their future and about where they will be located. The staff in the Midland Health Board, who are located mainly in Tullamore, have similar concerns. They have legitimate questions that have not been answered.I also point to the position with regard to step-down facilities. Elective surgery in the orthopaedic unit at Tullamore General Hospital was cancelled recently because of a shortage of beds. Can the Minister guarantee that the new hospital to be opened in Tullamore will be fitted, staffed and opened on schedule, unlike the situation of the nursing unit in Birr District Hospital? I am worried that the issue of step-down facilities is not addressed in the Bill. Birr District Hospital is still awaiting the 20 extra beds that have been sanctioned. There has been no word of 22 extra beds for Riada House in Tullamore even though the relevant planning permission is three years old. Likewise, there is no word of the long-awaited extension to Uibh Fháilí House in Edenderry. What are the Minister's plans with regard to the provision of facilities? Who will take responsibility in ensuring these facilities are in place? I am concerned that these issues will no longer be the responsibility of this House. It is important that Members can ask questions not only on policy but on issues of concern to individuals because we are elected to ensure their voices are heard.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	726	Members want to speak on the single most important Bill we will debate during this Dáil, but it is farcical that the debate is being guillotined and the time allocated for it, published earlier in the week, restricted. That is typical because it does not give us the opportunity to highlight the pathetic system the Government has managed for the past seven years.Public dissatisfaction with the health service at present is at an all time high. The perceived service is worsening with bed shortages, lengthening waiting lists and pressures in accident and emergency units, the list continues. The Government has dramatically increased the health budget during the past seven years, but its members would have been as well off to sit in front of the fire and throw the money into it for all the value we have got from it during that period. There is a lack of accountability and transparency in terms of the results of the decisions made. This legislation will compound that problem.Most of the published health strategies paint a lovely vision of the future ideal health service but we have no realistic detailed roadmap of how we make this vision a reality. The Fine Gael Party welcomes health reform but this Bill is reform in name only. Where is the reform in the service delivery for patients? There is nothing about that in this Bill. The provision of health care should be to respond to all the people's needs in an efficient and fair manner, but sadly that is not provided in the legislation. We should focus on the issues of primary health care which can bring health services close to communities and help take the pressure off our acute services which are under such demand at present.All the Bill does is provide for another unaccountable quango, the National Roads Authority mark two, an agency that will have billions of euro to spend but can never be called to account in this House. Neither can the Minister responsible be called to account in this House for how those funds are spent. Matters are bad enough at present and I will give an example to illustrate this. I tabled a parliamentary question in early September, to which I received a response on 29 September. The question related to quarterly cervical smear clinics held in Roscommon until earlier this year. Two and half months later I tabled a second parliamentary question and was informed by the Minister that as of this week the health board is currently preparing a reply. Matters will get worse from here on in.What this Bill is about is a vehicle to implement the Hanly report. Health care should not be contingent on wealth or geographic location, but this Bill provides for such discrimination. The Hanly report constitutes a direct and fundamental threat to hospitals such as the County Hospital in Roscommon, Portunicula Hospital in Ballinasloe and many other similar local hospitals throughout the country. The report recommends that most local accident and emergency units should be closed or reduced to minor hospitals in each region, but the report is fundamentally flawed.On page 70 of the report, it is suggested that many of the main life-saving measures in emergencies are not affected by the immediate proximity to a hospital. What about the issue of the golden hour? The lives of people in Roscommon and those in similar circumstances throughout the country are being put at risk by the Hanly report. Research produced by Scientific American suggests that 30% of patients with major trauma die unnecessarily because of a lack of satisfactory care within one hour. Similarly, a study inMontreal showed that of 360 severely injured patients, those who failed to reach hospital within one hour had a threefold increase in the risk of dying within six days of admission compared to those who reached the hospital within one hour. What message does this send to the people of Roscommon and similar communities across the country? It is that the lives of the people of County Roscommon are worth one third of the lives of a native living in Ballsbridge. It is all well and good for the Minister and the Minister of State who live near major accident and emergency facilities, but it is difficult when one lives hours away from facilities down the country.The Government does not have a clue about health policy. It proposed legislation for the break-up of the Eastern Health Board to form three health boards. It claimed that would bring the services closer to the communities. However, big is not better. It is now rescinding that legislation and introducing legislation to establish an even larger agency because it believes that big is better. It does not have a clue what is going on. This is just the latest experiment on the health services. It must remember this is about people's lives and lives will be lost through the implementation of this legislation.My colleague, Deputy Enright, raised a number of queries about sections of the legislation, one being membership of the board. I will tell the House the criteria that will be used to appoint the 11 members of the board. Whether they are members of Cairde Fáil or carry membership cards of Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats, that is the qualification used for every board that has been appointed in the past, and that is the one that will be used for this one.

Its gestation has been long, beginning with the publication of the health strategy in 2001 and now as it faces into labour we can only hope it has a safe delivery, but the Opposition has already orphaned it.

The Bill aims to consolidate the fragmented structures that constitute our health service. I doubt anyone would not applaud and support such a radical approach. Few people want the health service to remain as it is, but clearly they all inhabit this House. I listened yesterday to the opening of the debate by the Opposition spokespersons and I was struck by the lack of passion in their contributions, a lack of passion combined with a lack of coherent or convincing argument in opposing the substance of the Bill. It was posturing for opposition for its own sake.We are all too well aware of the failings of the current system, a towering edifice of bureaucracy which successive Ministers for Health have toiled in vain to contain. The system has become something so large, unwieldy and impenetrable that no Minister wanted to take on the task of reforming it and shirked the challenge. It is fortuitous that we finally have a Minister with not just the courage but the ability and determination to bring order to the nation's health care service and to do what is necessary and right by it, namely, to put the patient at the core of services. Deputy Twomey put his finger on it last night when he referred to the Minister, Deputy Harney, as the Minister for reform.This Bill presents to an extent an enabling and enacting of the copious reports which were commissioned by the Department of Health and Children in recent times. It is high time that such reports, having been commissioned at such cost, were implemented, and that is exactly what this Bill sets out to do.The case for reforming the structures of the health service is compelling. We need a health service that is responsive and appropriate to the needs of the 21st century, that is accessible to all and that puts the patient first. If the structures and functions of the current system are not organised or capable of delivering the ambitions of the health strategy, it is time to change them.The measures in this Bill will provide for the consolidation and rationalisation of a multitude of agencies into the Health Service Executive. It will invest in this corporate body the authority to implement Government policy through a more streamlined system ending the fragmentation that characterises and undermines the current system. As the Prospectus report proclaims, a better planned and managed health system should deliver measurably improved health care to all its patients and consumers.The current health system has been in existence for 30 odd years and is creaking under the strain. Its inability to cope is best demonstrated by the absence of improvement in service or output despite significant increases in investment which the service has received in recent times. The introduction of this Bill is our opportunity to make massive strides in the provision of health care, to put in place modern management systems to extract greater efficiencies from the considerable resources the Government applies to the sector and to put in place a new system where the patient will be at the centre of service and where outcomes can be measured.The establishment of the HSE to replace the 11 health boards and bring 27 health agencies under one umbrella is welcome. Am I alone in not lamenting the passing of the health boards? Surely not. I did not enjoy the privilege of serving on a health board, and what a privilege it was. It was the most coveted of all the spoils the victors enjoyed in the post-election negotiations on the establishment of local authorities. Did a country of 4 million people really need 263 people on 11 different boards spread across the country to scrutinise policy? We do not have 11 different health systems——

The GP medical card is an imaginative response to the realisation that many families need the reassurance which a visit to the GP with a sick child can give and where cost may previously have discouraged them from making a visit. The Tánaiste reminded Deputy Rabbitte in the House of his own calls for such a service to be provided. He will have to learn to hold on to his beliefs. He has a tendency to switch parties with alarming frequency and I am sure this causes a certain amount of disquiet among his colleagues in the alternative coalition.

It follows from the many reports on the health service during the past number of years, particularly the Brennan, Prospectus and Hanly reports. All of these reports were commissioned because it has been obvious for some time that there are problems with the delivery of health care. The Bill is the distillation of the recommendations of those reports. I am delighted it has finally arrived in the House.I was amazed at some of the posturing of Opposition Deputies in recent days regarding the short time they have had to read the Bill.

#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	758	Until now, the management of health has been done on a very local basis via the health boards which grew out of the old administration based on the county boundaries. When the health boards first came into being 30 years ago, they were looked on with some trepidation because people were afraid that their old intimate relationship with the county health authority would no longer exist. Over time, the health boards have proved themselves.The board I know most about is the North Western Health Board. The pioneering work done by that health board has set a benchmark for the delivery of health care. Representing three of the counties furthest from Dublin — Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo — with an interesting mix of urban and rural populations, the problems which this health board faced in the delivery of health care are a microcosm of the problems facing the country. That the board managed to deal with these problems is testimony to the innovative methods it developed. I pay tribute to the staff who helped deliver such a fine service.If it is so good, why change it? The answer lies in a recognition that the Ireland of today is a different place from the Ireland of the past 30 years. Health and its delivery has become much more complex and the old divisions between health board areas are becoming blurred and unnecessary. Let me give an example of what I mean. Part of Charlestown, County Mayo — the part known as Bellaghy — is in County Sligo. The people at one end of a street in Charlestown live in County Mayo and are covered by the Western Health Board while those who live 50 yards away at the other end of the street live in County Sligo and are covered by the North Western Health Board. The range of services provided in the two nearest hospitals, Mayo General Hospital and Sligo General Hospital, are roughly similar, except that Sligo hospital probably has more specialties than Mayo. Some of those are now becoming available in Mayo. The development of both hospitals, which are roughly equidistant from Charlestown, has occurred without interlinking because they are in different health board areas. Does it make sense that people who live in the same street should be served by two different hospitals whose development and subsequent range of services have occurred without interlinking? It does not.Extrapolating my point from the local to the national scene, the development of all of our hospitals in a co-ordinated fashion is more suited to the demands of the 21st century. The establishment of national offices, whether for hospitals or for the delivery of services such as information technology, is a progressive and obvious step towards improving the service which the health agencies deliver.In the overall development of the hospital service, it is also important that modern well equipped and progressive hospitals, such as Sligo, Letterkenny and Mayo, are allowed to continue to offer the widest range of services compatible with their population catchment and their geographical location. These three hospitals are in an unusual situation because of their geographical isolation. While the population decreases of the past 150 years are now being reversed, the full range of services offered by Sligo General Hospital must be maintained and developed. In that regard, I was delighted with the reply Mr. David Hanly, chairman of the Hanly report group, gave me during the debate on the Hanly report in the Committee on Health and Children some months ago. He acknowledged that special consideration will and must be given to those general hospitals which are geographically isolated from the nearest tertiary hospital. Sligo is 90 miles from Galway and 130 miles from Dublin. My Oireachtas colleagues and I will continue to ensure that the future development of the full range of specialist services in Sligo hospital will continue under the national hospital office.I wish to deal with a point that has been made by some Opposition Deputies, namely, the supposed lack of local representation under the provisions of the Bill. However, in Part 8, sections 45 to 48, inclusive, it is clearly set out how the four regional health fora will operate as well as how local communities can become involved in advisory panels. In that way, the ideas of the users of the health service, that is, the patients, who are the most important people in the service, can be recognised.Another tier was alluded to by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and which Opposition spokespersons seem to shy away from. That is the increasingly important role of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. I would like to see the Health Service Executive appearing regularly before that committee so it can monitor how the executive is performing its duties.As Deputy Twomey outlined, a bureaucratic level is being removed from the health service. We will now know who is personally responsible for each of these new offices. The committee can get to the person responsible and obtain answers quickly and effectively. Perhaps the Opposition does not want that responsibility. Perhaps its members would like to sit on the sidelines and criticise without taking on the responsibility that is theirs. I assure the House, however, that Fianna Fáil Members on the Committee on Health and Children will be proactive in discharging their responsibilities. I was delighted to hear Deputy Fiona O'Malley of the Progressive Democrats saying the same thing. We all feel the same way. We will question, analyse and make constructive comments on how the health service executive is performing. If it is not doing its job, we will ensure that the views of the public are highlighted. I hope Opposition members will do the same instead of sitting on the fence and being negative.

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	770	The Health Act 1970 provided limited or full eligibility for health services through a declaration of means. It also provided for hospital inpatient and outpatient services along with general medical services, including services for mothers and children. There is nothing in the Bill before the House to provide for any such services. The Government is rushing this Bill through the House, having published it only seven weeks prior to the deadline for establishing the new health service executive on 1 January 2005. Thousands of health workers do not know what will happen to their jobs.The 1970 Health Act was dealt with differently. The Second Stage debate took place in April 1969 and adequate time for it was provided by the then Minister for Health, Mr. Erskine Childers. Did the Minister of State ever hear of him? He introduced the 1970 Health Bill. Following Opposition amendments, the Bill was passed in February 1970. Over a year was then given to establishing a new health framework which began operating in April 1971. Seven weeks are being provided for the Bill before us, while the 1970 legislation took two years to implement.The Health Bill 2004 calls for a centralisation of services. Section 9 states that there will be informal arrangements between the executive and local authorities. At one stage in Ireland, local authorities controlled the health services. The 86 sections in the 1970 Act will now to be replaced by an executive and a board consisting of 11 members. The executive will comply with any directive issued by the Minister under the legislation to be enacted. That is exactly what this Bill is about.The new legislation will include arrangements for public representation in the operation and development of health and social services. The 1970 Act, however, established health advisory committees, although they were abolished in the mid-1990s. It is now intended that there will be regional fora to enable meaningful and sustained dialogue and consultation between the executive and the public at local level. In plain language, they will be talking-shops with no power. So much for the Government's decentralisation policy. Power will rest with the Minister and the health executives. Will these executives be paid €400,000 a year to introduce the legislative changes and supervise their implementation? As no public representatives will be on the executive, I hope that general practitioners and the Irish Medical Organisation as well as the consultants will be represented. These are people in the front line of providing health services.Schedule 5 refers to the service plans prepared by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health board to be constituted as the service plan by the Health Service Executive. I presume they have already been done so will the Minister of State inform the House what the service plan for the southern region comprises?I was a member of a local committee in Mallow established to oppose the Fitzgerald report of 1968 which proposed to downgrade general hospitals, including Mallow General Hospital. The current public consensus is for the hospital to be within easy access and it has now been established that 90% of patients can be treated in the local general hospital. A recent general practitioners' report stated that "GPs provide 90% of referrals to hospitals from a significant gateway to hospital referrals". They are well placed to echo the views of their patients and understand where best value for money is provided. Mallow General Hospital gives support to the community by providing appropriate and cost-effective services. The 24-hour accident and emergency, medical, surgical and consultant services allow people in the area to access acute care within the internationally accepted "golden hour", which gives people a realistic chance of survival.Under Comhairle na nOspidéal the current radiology post in Mallow General Hospital is temporary and part-time, despite four years of promises. Having made a recommendation in 2001, Comhairle na nOspidéal has not followed up on the matter since then. In the past there was always a permanent radiologist at the hospital but that post has been vacant for three years. I want to record that since 2001 this great Comhairle na nOspidéal sat on its hands and allowed that post to be continued as a temporary one.It is worth noting that the Hanly group had 50 members, of which only one was a general practitioner. The weight of expert evidence and opinion against the Hanly report's proposals on accident and emergency services is overwhelming. Rural populations will be most adversely affected by these changes since they have the longest distances to travel to major centres. The number of patients treated at Cork University Hospital was 23,000 with an average duration of stay of 6.34 days and an average cost per day of €746. However, the average duration of stay at Mallow General Hospital was 5.3 days with an average cost of €475 per day, which represents a considerable difference.I regard the Minister of State as a very decent person and I hope he will encourage the Government to withdraw this legislation to give the people a chance of a good health service in the future.

I would like to focus on whether the changes proposed in the Bill will have any real consequences for those using the health services on a daily basis. The Bill will merely result in more quangos, more bureaucracy and anything and everything to reduce the accountability of the Minister in the House and prevent us as public representatives from getting answers about anything to do with health. I sometimes wonder whether the Government wants the Opposition to ask questions anymore. These proposals were mooted 18 months ago and now in the run-up to Christmas we have a few hours to debate this important Bill. I was elected to bring the views of the people of south Kerry to this House. I have ten minutes — and lucky to get those — to speak on the issues I want to bring from south Kerry. I do not believe we live in a democracy anymore — the sooner people realise that the better — I believe we live in a dictatorship.Widespread concern has been expressed on all sides of the House about the decrease in the level of public accountability in the new health service structures. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children has not made adequate provision for accountability and transparency in this legislation. Many Deputies on all sides of the House fear that the Minister for Health and Children will have a much reduced level of accountability in this House. While a number of Deputies have asked the following questions, they cannot be asked often enough. I hope that whoever replies at the end of this debate will answer them.Will we, the elected representatives, be able to obtain information from the Tánaiste and her Department in response to parliamentary questions? When pressed about a matter by a Deputy, will the Tánaiste or a Minister of State adopt a new mantra of claiming the matter is one for the HSE or the hospitals agency? When I submit a health matter for debate on the Adjournment, will I receive a note from the Ceann Comhairle stating it is not a matter for the Dáil but for some other body, as happens today with issues under the remit of the National Roads Authority? Despite what Deputies on the other side of the House say, it will not be possible to give local input into the services for local people and those of us representing the local people will have no say. One wonders whether the Health Service Executive and the other bodies will bring about any improvement for the health consumer. Will the people on trolleys in accident and emergency departments get a bed sooner or will the thousands on orthodontic waiting lists get to see a consultant?I refer to a number of deficiencies in the health services in my constituency which I hope will be addressed by the new Health Service Executive, although I doubt it. For example, Kerry General Hospital provides an outstanding level of service for the people of the county. However, it is facing underfunding and a shortage of capacity at present, particularly in the accident and emergency and maternity departments. The hospital is crying out for a new expanded accident and emergency department. The hospital submitted plans to the Department of Health and Children in 2002 but the Minister has not sanctioned the development which would provide an extension to the accident and emergency unit and a renovation of the existing unit. Regrettably, the Tánaiste chose not to include this much-needed development in her recent Estimates for 2005 under the capital programme. How much longer will we wait? Under the new proposal I believe we will wait a long time.The maternity department at Kerry General Hospital is in acute crisis at present. Births in County Kerry have gone up from 1,010 in 1994 to 1,446 last year, a 40% increase in a decade. However, the maternity unit has not been upgraded to deal with this increase. The hospital has a major shortage of midwives and services are under extreme pressure. The consultant obstetrician in the maternity unit has described this as potentially dangerous and the management of the hospital has indicated it may have to reduce the number of planned gynaecological procedures to ensure a safe service is available to all patients. As we all know consultants very rarely make such public statements.The Kerryman newspaper reports this morning that nurses at Kerry General Hospital with qualifications in midwifery are being asked to work extra hours to cope with staffing shortage in the maternity wards. How does the Minister respond to this totally unacceptable situation? Can she give any guarantees that the new National Hospitals Office, being established under the Health Bill, will ensure that facilities such as the maternity department at Kerry General Hospital will be adequately equipped and staffed to a level sufficient to provide fully for the needs of patients?According to a recent reply to me in a parliamentary question, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children advised me that the establishment of a project team to progress proposals for a new maternity unit at Kerry General Hospital is to be considered in the context of available funding under the capital fund for 2004-08. She is, therefore, admitting that it may be as late at 2008, four years away, before this vital project progresses. If the delays in progressing this work are as long as the delays in advancing the construction of a new hospital in Dingle or an extension to the hospital in Kenmare, the people of Kerry will be waiting a very long time.A few weeks ago in this House, I raised the major delay in sanctioning the new community hospital for Dingle, which has been delayed by Fianna Fáil representatives in my constituency for almost a decade. I have little confidence that the Health Service Executive or the hospitals office, which will come into being in the new year, will deliver on these projects given the track record of the health boards and the Government to date.I take this opportunity to refer to the mounting orthodontic waiting lists in County Kerry, which are not being addressed by the Government after seven long years in office. The average waiting time for orthodontic treatment in Kerry at the moment is four years. Some 875 patients are waiting to see an orthodontist in Kerry at present and 75% of those patients are waiting for more than a year. This is an absolute scandal. While orthodontics, by its very nature, requires early intervention to deal with dental deformities, especially in children, in Kerry it now takes an average of four years to get an appointment. Delays in getting orthodontic treatment represent one of the greatest problems in the modern health service, which has not received the appropriate level of funding or personnel from Government to meet demand. When the history of the modern health service is written, the scandal of the orthodontic waiting lists will go down as a major blot in the copybook.While I could speak at length about other issues, I have insufficient time. Why, for example, are we still waiting for the BreastCheck programme to be rolled out to the south west? While the capital funding has been allocated, it will be another three years at least before the programme is operational and the Government has made no current expenditure provision for its operation.How much time do I have left? Am I nearly finished?

No Government can be proud of that.Will the people of Kerry get the same services in ten years' time under this new executive? The only way we will get a good health service is to get the Government out of office. The quangos it will establish will not solve the problems so, while I hope there will be some improvement, I doubt it will happen.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	777	Every Deputy has put forward the case for improved health services in his or her constituency. That demonstrates the need for a national structure to give a national perspective on the problems and I warmly welcome publication of the Health Bill 2004. Health is the biggest political issue in the State and we have a primary role in dealing with the problems in the health service. The main issues highlighted by my constituents are delays in the accident and emergency departments and hospital waiting lists, although there are other matters of concern.I support the Government's view that the problems in the health services should be tackled by increased funding in tandem with reform — it is not a question of one or the other. The publication of the Estimates for public expenditure for 2005 clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to funding of the health service. Current spending on health will increase next year by €950 million to €10.5 billion, an increase of 9.9%.The public know, however, that it is not just a question of funding. The users of our hospital service witness the waste taking place every day and recognise that there is a serious problem with management. That is why I support the health service reform programme. The Government's decisions in this regard are based on the recommendation of three key reports, the Prospectus report, the Brennan report, and the Hanly report.The key elements of the reform programme are a major rationalisation of existing health service agencies to reduce fragmentation, including the abolition of the existing health board and health authority structures, the reorganisation of the Department of Health and Children to ensure improved policy development and oversight, and the establishment of a Health Service Executive which will be the first ever body charged with managing the health service as a single entity. The executive will be organised on the basis of three core divisions, the national hospitals office, the primary community and continuing care directorate and the national shared services centre. A health information equality authority will also be established to ensure that quality of care is promoted throughout the system. Supporting processes will be modernised so they will be in line with international best practice, strengthening governance and accountability across the system. There will be a reduction in the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, in line with the EU directive, and a reorganisation of the acute hospitals sector. The programme's priority focuses are improved patient care, better value for taxpayers' money and improved health care management.I welcome the Tánaiste's speech on Second Stage last night. She is a brave woman and this is historic legislation. We must make the best use of the tremendous resources we are applying in health to get clear value and results. Legislation governing the structure of the health service is outdated. We do not need 58 separate health agencies or 273 people on separate health boards in addition to the 166 TDs and 60 Senators managing and accounting for public health spending.I am a public representative in the Eastern Regional Health Authority district. The establishment of this authority led to the creation the East Coast Area Health Board, the Northern Area Health Board and the South Western Health Board. This structure did not work, it was a failed experiment. It took months or even years to put the appropriate managers and staff in place. It was often impossible to track down the section or staff dealing with a particular issue. That is no reflection on the staff in the health boards. They were the victims of a bureaucratic and cumbersome structure. It is only now that the managerial positions and staff are in place. Unfortunately, it never functioned properly because of its bureaucratic nature.I sat on the board of Beaumont Hospital for a number of years. Often we did not get our budget for the year from the Eastern Regional Health Authority until well into the year, a reflection of the bad management and the way in which the structure did not work for the hospital.This Bill will allow for the creation of a single, unified health service. It will establish the Health Service Executive on a statutory basis and provide for the dissolution of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, area health boards, health boards and other identified agencies. I welcome the fact that the accounting officer for the health service will be the new chief executive of the Health Service Executive. This is a departure from the norm and will bring greater efficiency to the procedure.I also welcome Part 9 of the Bill which puts a statutory complaints procedure in place. The public who use hospital services often have complaints to make and the structures in place at present are not adequate. The public must follow a cumbersome procedure and the outcome is not always clear. The public should be facilitated in making complaints.I welcome the action to improve accident and emergency services announced last week as part of the Book of Estimates. I deal mostly with the Mater Hospital and Beaumont Hospital and there are problems with accident and emergency units. Last week the Tánaiste announced the development and expansion of minor injury units, a chest pain clinic and respiratory clinics in hospitals to relieve pressure on accident and emergency departments. A second MRI scanner is being provided at Beaumont Hospital and acute medical units for non-surgical patients at Tallaght, St. Vincent's and Beaumont hospitals were announced. The Tánaiste made provision for the transfer of 100 high dependency patients to suitable private nursing home care, and the scope for using greater numbers of private nursing home beds to alleviate pressure on acute hospital beds will also be actively pursued. Negotiations will take place with the private sector to meet the needs of 500 people annually for intermediate care for up to six weeks. These are older people who are awaiting discharge to nursing home care or back to their own homes with appropriate support.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	778	The accident and emergency department at Kerry General Hospital is without doubt the most under-staffed accident and emergency department in the country and is struggling to cope with massive increases in patient numbers coupled with an unacceptable lack of resources. The reason it manages to operate is the hard working commitment of the staff and the assistance they receive from colleagues in other specialities in the hospital. Kerry General Hospital offers its acute services to the population of Kerry, which is approximately 132,000. It also serves parts of north Cork and south Limerick.When it was originally constructed, attendance at the accident and emergency department was 13,500 patients per year. This has now risen to 29,000 over the past two decades. To cope with this increase in numbers, one would expect that more staff, equipment and space should have been provided. However, in contrast with other acute hospitals around the country of similar size, this has not happened. The role of the accident and emergency department at Tralee has expanded over the years. The most significant change has been in the use of accident and emergency departments as a point of first contact with the hospital for all patients requiring emergency care and few patients who are ill are admitted directly to a ward, even when beds are available.This change occurred for a number of reasons, but primarily because of patient safety. The accident and emergency department structure is specifically geared for patient management and is ideally located to access all other areas of the hospital such as the X-ray department. Some changes have been made in recent years. Five junior doctors at senior house officer grade were appointed to the accident and emergency department four years ago. These doctors have limited experience and must work under the supervision of more senior medical staff. In October 2003, Dr. Sean O'Rourke took up the post of consultant to the accident and emergency department and in addition some internal building works have been undertaken to maximise limited space and provide two X-ray examination cubicles.The fundamental problem that affects the accident and emergency department is one of under-resourcing. For example, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland recommends that for each 3,500 patients there should be one SHO. The five SHOs at Tralee general hospital should see approximately 17,500 new patients annually. However, patient numbers are far above this level, at more than 29,000. There is approval for a further two SHO posts, but these remain unfilled. I understand there is an application to seek approval for an eighth post because of the increase in the number of patients. As I previously stated, SHOs are junior doctors with limited experience. When the accident and emergency consultant is not on call, the department has no registrars to turn to for advice in medical emergencies.Nursing levels are also a concern. With only 24 wholetime equivalent nurses in the department, each night-shift is covered by only three nurses. During summer months an additional night-time nurse is provided, but he or she is removed at the end of September. Bearing in mind that patients frequently present at the accident and emergency department late in the evening, and given that they have to wait longer to be assessed, the night-time is often as busy, if not busier than day-time. Given the pressures this degree of cover is simply not adequate.The hospital management submitted a brief to the Department of Health and Children in June 2002, outlining the facilities required to bring the accident and emergency department up to an acceptable standard. However, the hospital is still awaiting a response from the Department regarding these proposals. The majority of patients who attend the accident and emergency department have suffered injuries of varying severity. These patients are seen and treated by the accident and emergency doctor and nurse, with the majority being discharged. Patients presenting with conditions such as chest pain, stroke, pneumonia and asthma are the second largest group. Many of these patients are sicker and older and require speedy assessment and treatment. Their conditions need to be stabilised in accident and emergency departments prior to transfer to the wards. An acute medical unit is essential for this type of patient. This type of facility has been a resounding success in Kilkenny. However, it costs approximately €1 million per year to run such a facility. Such a unit in Kerry General Hospital, located next to an operating theatre and parallel with the accident and emergency department, would be of immense benefit to this important group of patients.There is an urgent need to increase accident and emergency medical staff to an appropriate level. The appointment of three additional SHOs and three registrars would reflect medical staffing levels in similarly sized units around the country. There is also the need to increase nursing numbers to reflect the continuing demand on the accident and emergency department in the hospital. Funding for the establishment of a properly functioning and acute medical unit should be prioritised and this should include approval for an increase in medical nursing and non-nursing staff.Approval from the Department of Health and Children for a new accident and emergency department in Tralee is essential and the funding to put this in place should be sanctioned immediately.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	781	I appreciate that. That is why it has been chosen. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I want to acknowledge the contribution made by the staff at the Kerry General Hospital, Tralee, in difficult circumstances.The Department of Health and Children has been aware since 2002 of a proposal to develop new accident and emergency infrastructure at Kerry General Hospital. It has not been possible for the Department in the intervening period to commit to this proposal in the light of competing demands generally on the health capital programme and given the significant capital and non-capital funding implications involved in this case. The proposed development has, however, been included this year within the new health capital investment framework 2004-08.The proposed scheme consists of renovation works at, and a new extension to, the existing accident and emergency department at the hospital. The Southern Health Board has prepared a draft brief. The issues at the hospital are being examined by the Department in the context of new capital commitments that can be progressed under the framework for 2005 or beyond, in line with overall funding resources available during the period 2004-08. The project team is expected to meet early next week to consider the draft brief submitted by the Southern Health Board.With regard to the pressures on accident and emergency departments generally, the Tánaiste has identified the delivery of accident and emergency services as a priority area for attention. Many of the difficulties and delays experienced in accident and emergency departments reflect systems-wide issues. It is, therefore, necessary to take a whole-system approach, involving primary, acute, and sub-acute care as well as community care in tackling the problems in emergency medicine departments.This Government has in recent years, introduced initiatives aimed at improving the delivery of acute services and alleviating the pressures on accident and emergency departments. Additional funding of €70 million has now been secured in new current expenditure in 2005 to implement a number of initiatives to improve the delivery of emergency services. These include improvements in the following areas: patient flows through accident and emergency departments by developing and expanding minor injury units, respiratory and chest pain clinics in hospitals; acute medical units for non-surgical patients; the physical environment for patients and staff, including cleaning and security measures; direct access for GPs to diagnostic services; the availability of acute beds for emergency patients by sourcing capacity in the private nursing home sector for those patients who have completed their acute phase of treatment; and expanded home care packages to support older people at home.It is expected that a high level steering group will now be established made up of representatives from the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive to implement the initiatives in 2005.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	782	A new community hospital on the grounds of the old Hospital of the Assumption, Thurles, is currently under construction. I welcome the fact that the building programme is on schedule for completion and that the facility will be fully operational in spring 2006. The new hospital will provide a wide range of services such as respite, rehabilitation and long-term care. The old hospital contained an ambulance station that served a large part of Tipperary. This station was always an integral part of the hospital. Everyone assumed there would be a new ambulance base facility as part of the new overall hospital plan.On making inquiries to the Mid-Western Health Board I was shocked and dismayed to discover that provision has not been made for an ambulance base. It is an astonishing omission that highlights the lack of forward planning and co-ordination on the part of the Department of Health and Children. A temporary ambulance base has been established in an old laundry building on the hospital campus. This building is dilapidated and totally unsuitable for staff and patients. The building has an asbestos roof, which raises serious health and safety issues. Male and female members of staff have to share one toilet. The present circumstances are totally inadequate and unacceptable. There are legitimate health and safety concerns for the emergency medical technicians and other staff.The Thurles ambulance station provides pre-hospital emergency services and patient transport for a large section of north Tipperary. It also forms part of the health board's response to any major emergency. Depending on demand, this station also provides cover to other areas, such as Roscrea and Nenagh. The Thurles station provides 24 hour cover. Two-person crewing on all ambulance vehicles has been implemented. This year so far, the crew from the Thurles ambulance station answered almost 6,500 calls. This temporary shack houses in excess of 15 staff who are entitled to and deserve a safe and healthy working environment to enable them to continue their life-saving work.According to the construction programme from the Department, demolition of the existing hospital, including the removal of asbestos will commence in early July 2005. As part of this demolition the current temporary accommodation will also be removed. Amazingly the Department of Health and Children has no provision within the scope of the hospital project for interim measures to accommodate the ambulance base.The Mid-Western Health Board has recently submitted a detailed proposal for funding to the Department of Health and Children to build a new modern ambulance base on the campus, the estimated cost of which is approximately €1.6 million. It would be commonsense and cost effective to sanction the construction of a new base immediately. The builders are currently on site and can undertake the essential building work with a simple variation to their existing contract. The Department of Health and Children must provide the necessary funds for a modern ambulance station as a matter of urgency. The facts speak for themselves. Quick responses save lives. Many of the 6,500 patients carried by the Thurles ambulance would not have survived if an ambulance had to travel from Limerick or Nenagh. The reality is that if the ambulance base is closed or funds are not provided to build a modern base lives will be lost in the Thurles and mid-Tipperary area.Without an ambulance base a person with a cardiac arrest in Thurles has almost zero chance of survival. A cardiac arrest patient must get immediate emergency medical attention to have a significant survival chance. This is only possible with a local ambulance base.I ask the Minister of State to inform the House if his Department will take responsibility for the potential loss of life arising from the present bungling with the ambulance station in Thurles. When funding for the community hospital was sanctioned why was a modern ambulance base not included in those plans? What proposals does the Department intend to sanction to secure a permanent ambulance base in Thurles? When will the Mid-Western Health Board be notified that it can proceed with the planned development of a new ambulance station.There has been a dramatic reduction in the level of health care delivery in north Tipperary. The status of Nenagh General Hospital is under threat from the implementation of the Hanly report. There is neither an accident and emergency or a cardiac care unit in Thurles. The provision of a proper ambulance facility is of vital importance to the delivery of adequate health care to the people of Thurles and mid-Tipperary.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	783	I thank Deputy Lowry for raising the issue. The report of the Strategic Review of the Ambulance Services 2001, forms the basis for the development of pre-hospital emergency medical services into the future. It identifies aspects of the current emergency ambulance service that need to be addressed to bring the service into line with best international practice to ensure effective and quality driven practices.The report recommended that the service be developed at a number of levels. Principal among the developments being put in place arising from the report are the elimination of on-call arrangements as a means of providing emergency cover, improved fleet reliability; and the roll-out of the emergency medical technician-advanced programme.The elimination of on-call arrangements is designed to facilitate further improvement in response times. Additional funding of more than €4 million was provided in the current year to facilitate the continuing phasing out of on-call arrangements in a number of regions. This is a programme the Tánaiste hopes to be in a position to extend.In the area of the ambulance fleet and equipment, the Department provided additional capital funding of more than €8 million in the past 12 months to assist the boards-authority with their fleet and equipment replacement programmes which are essential prerequisites for enhanced speedy and appropriate care. The Mid-Western Health Board ambulance service was allocated approximately €1million of this funding.In regard to the new Community Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles, a brief to replace existing institutional services for the elderly at the 150 year old Hospital of the Assumption was completed in recent years and construction commenced in April 2004.The scope of the development is in keeping with the objectives laid down in the report, The Years Ahead, and comprises accommodation and ancillary services for 72 inpatients and a day hospital. The need to replace the ambulance station on the campus was recognised in the brief and space has been protected on the site for provision of a new base. The original base, housed in an old gate lodge, was inadequate and has been demolished. The service is currently housed in temporary accommodation on site.The Mid-Western Health Board has reviewed its requirements for the new ambulance station and has recently clarified its proposals in this regard to my Department. These proposals take account of an option appraisal exercise and the implications of the current health reform programme. The current proposal recognises service development in terms of the elimination-reduction of on-call arrangements and the introduction of two-person crewing to all ambulances. The development as proposed is designed to provide the accommodation required to support the future development of the service. These proposals are currently being examined by my Department and will be considered in conjunction with the Mid-Western Health Board, in the context of overall capital priorities.The Government is fully committed to the development of our emergency ambulance service. Much has been achieved in the development of the service and I recognise that much remains to be done. It is essential to maintain the progress made and to continue the process of service development, so that effective pre-hospital emergency care is accessible to those who need it most, when and where it is required.

Described as the last dictator in Europe, President Lukashenko of Belarus made a speech last week covering a number of areas including the future of children affected by Chernobyl travelling abroad. This speech has created alarm and distress for the Chernobyl Children's Project and for the thousands of families in Ireland who host children from Belarus every year.President Lukashenko's announcement will become a decree, unless there is major intervention. That decree will say that foreign trips for rest and recuperation for children from the nuclear-contaminated zones in Belarus are to end from the New Year, because of the invasion of consumerism which occurs as a result. President Lukashenko has already stopped all foreign adoptions and now seems intent on preventing children in his country from availing of the therapeutic benefits of time abroad in countries like Ireland.There is fear now among the people who work with charities in this area that this is the thin end of the wedge. The president has been quoted as saying that, "Belarussian people should be recuperated in the Republic of Belarus. We have all necessary possibilities for it." There is concern that he will put an end to humanitarian aid convoys travelling from places like Ireland which bring aid to vulnerable children and their families. I spoke to Adi Roche earlier this week and I have been in touch with the Chernobyl Children's Project and they are appalled and shocked by this development. I know they have been speaking to the Minister in this regard and I look forward to his response. They are concerned that convoys of aid planned for the next few months may be jeopardised by President Lukashenko's pronouncements.The Chernobyl Children's Project is the only Chernobyl organisation in the world to hold official non-governmental organisation status and it holds the only NGO position on the UN scientific body, ICRIN, which deals exclusively with Chernobyl. Therefore, it feels honour-bound to speak on behalf of all NGOs working in the field about current events in Belarus and the impact they will have on their future work.As Ireland is the world's leading donor  per capita to the victims of Chernobyl, it would be appropriate for us to lead the response of the international community. This response needs to be urgent. We all know of families who welcome children from Belarus into their homes with great affection, and few Members of this House will not have had the privilege of meeting children from Chernobyl whose sheer happiness at the prospect of a few weeks in Ireland is obvious. Their coming to Ireland obviously has a beneficial effect on their health.The work in which the Chernobyl Children's Project is engaged includes the following: monthly visits of professional medical teams to work and train staff in mental asylums for children; cardiac surgery for children suffering from "Chernobyl heart", carried out by cardiac surgeons four times a year — the surgeons carry out 100 operations per year and if they are not allowed to operate, these children will die; refurbishment of an entire mental asylum for children; and craniofacial surgery for up to 80 children. There is concern that this essential work is in jeopardy and that children in Belarus will die if the country's President's policy is not resisted and reversed.Will the Minister engage at the highest level with his international counterparts to ensure that President Lukashenko's decree will not place in jeopardy the valuable work done by charities such as the Chernobyl Children's Project and that children from Belarus will continue to enjoy the greatly rehabilitative and health benefits of trips to countries such as Ireland? I understand the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been briefed on developments on this matter and I ask him to clarify his position and lead the international and European communities to ensure that President Lukashenko's statement does not become a reality.Ireland is the world's leading donor per capita to the victims of Chernobyl and is uniquely placed to pursue this important matter. Children will undoubtedly die and thousands more will have their lives shortened if the problem is not dealt with immediately.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	785	I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for making himself available for this important Adjournment matter. On Friday evening of last week, informal reports reached Ireland to the effect that President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus had made a speech in which he proposed the introduction of a new law by 31 December 2004 which would prevent children affected by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 from travelling abroad for medical treatment, rest and recuperation. I immediately phoned the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, through his Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and he promised to establish the full facts on the developments in Belarus as soon as possible.I was aware through my membership of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs that the political circumstances of Belarus were on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of the EU, scheduled to meet on Monday and Tuesday of this week. We agreed that this serious development could be addressed in that context. I am grateful to the Minister for highlighting this issue with his EU colleagues on Monday last and I hope he can lead a diplomatic offensive to have President Lukashenko's policy reversed. The prospect of a decree being introduced that will effectively prevent hundreds of child victims of the world's worst nuclear disaster from travelling to Ireland and abroad generally will be a cause of grave concern to many families throughout this country and to the affected children and parents in Belarus.Every community in the country has been touched by the good work of Adi Roche and the Chernobyl Children's Project as well as the other Irish charities in Belarus. There is hardly a town that has not been host to some of the special children in question. One thousand children are due to arrive in Ireland from Belarus during the coming Christmas period, which makes this evening's debate particularly urgent.It is understood that the Government of Belarus is concerned that Belarussian children will be exposed to the consumerism of the west. Therefore, we must communicate clearly to the President of that country that the only motivation behind the actions of the Irish charities is the health and well-being of the child victims of the disaster. I urge the Minister to use every available channel at his disposal to deliver assurances to the President that he has nothing to be afraid of if he allows children from his country to travel to Ireland or other countries. He should also be convinced that there is nothing to fear from foreign aid convoys and humanitarian initiatives in the hope of preventing the introduction of further decrees of a similar nature.Families throughout this country are devastated as a result of this development and are praying that common sense will prevail. Rest and recuperation in Ireland literally save lives. Enduring friendships between the families from both countries have been established. I wish the Minister well in his efforts to end the current uncertainty. Ireland is the world's leading donor country to the victims of Chernobyl and we must lead the diplomatic response. I hope very much that, through our contacts and the work of our diplomats in Moscow, we will be able to persuade the Belarussian authorities that we have no hidden agenda and that they should have no reason to be concerned. There is no political motivation behind the work of the Chernobyl Children's Project and similar agencies.Since the Chernobyl disaster, Ireland has developed incredibly strong links with Belarussians. We have learned from each other and it is in the interest of both our countries that these links be strengthened in the years ahead.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	786	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter and welcome the opportunity to share information on this issue and the approach I am taking. I thank Deputy Haughey and the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who contacted me late last Friday night when the developments in Belarus became known to the Chernobyl Children's Project. This allowed us to make initial inquiries on behalf of the project.There have been some indications in the past week that the Belarussian authorities may introduce restrictions on travel abroad by children for rest and recuperation, including children suffering as a result of the Chernobyl disaster. We established on Monday morning that, on 17 November, the Belarussian President, Mr. Lukashenko, made a wide-ranging address to the Belarussian Parliament. The occasion was an official ceremony to sign into law the constitutional amendment allowing him to seek a third term of office in the next presidential election in 2006. He highlighted popular support for his rule and stated that there would be no strategic change in the policy of Belarus.President Lukashenko said Belarus had to put an end to the lack of control over the recuperation of its children abroad. He stated the organisation of children's trips abroad for recuperation should be the prerogative of his state and added that if NGOs and religious groups want to provide assistance to Belarus, they should "transfer funds and have spending controlled from Belarus". He affirmed that modern medical equipment and good doctors who will perform operations are what are needed.This House is well aware that Ireland is among the states which have taken a lead in rendering humanitarian aid to Belarussian children to relieve the after-effects of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. At least ten other European countries are involved in this particular project. We in Ireland are familiar with the exceptional work of the Chernobyl Children's Project and quite a number of other agencies unconnected with Adi Roche. I have experience of the very real needs of the Chernobyl children and of the benefits that rest and recuperation brings to their lives. Any of us who have been in contact with children in this respect see how well they blossom as a result of the fresh air and good medical care available in Ireland.The House will share the Government's deep concern over the implications of President Lukashenko's announcement for the continuation of this admirable and constructive engagement with the people of Belarus.In the discussion of Belarus at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 22 November, I took the opportunity to raise the issue of Chernobyl children continuing to be able to travel abroad for rest and recuperation. I shared with my colleagues my strong concern at this development and pointed out that, if implemented, the new regulations would add a new and worrying dimension to the self-isolation of Belarus from the rest of Europe. I asked the high representative, Javier Solana, and my ministerial colleagues to share any information that might come to light in their countries to assist Ireland's efforts to clarify what exactly the new regulations will involve in practice. I emphasised that this is an issue which Ireland would wish to see pursued by the EU with the Belarussian authorities on humanitarian grounds with a view to encouraging them to modify their positionIn addition to raising the matter at EU level, I and my Department are taking all possible steps to pursue it through bilateral channels. On my instructions, the Irish ambassador in Moscow, who is accredited to Belarus, will meet tomorrow with the ambassador of Belarus in Moscow to seek clarification on my concerns. The Irish ambassador in London is arranging to meet the ambassador-designate of Belarus to Ireland. The ambassador-designate will present his credentials as ambassador to Ireland to the President next month. This offers a further opportunity to communicate our concerns and to press Belarus to modify its proposed position. On all occasions, we will express the hope that the Belarussian authorities, who have previously thanked the Irish Government and people of Ireland for providing substantial assistance in minimising the after effects of the Chernobyl NNP accident, will on humanitarian grounds continue to allow the Chernobyl children to travel abroad for rest and recuperation.I will also ensure that there is close ongoing liaison on this issue between my Department and the Chernobyl Children's Project. I indicated that I regard this development as adding a new and worrying dimension to the isolation of Belarus from the rest of Europe. Belarus is a European country of considerable potential which, tragically, has become increasingly isolated from the European mainstream. The policies pursued by the Government of Belarus, notably the lack of progress towards democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights, have prevented Belarus from taking up its rightful place among European democratic countries. Since 1997, the EU has restricted ministerial level contacts with Belarus. With the exception of humanitarian or regional projects or those which directly support the democratisation process, Community technical assistance programmes to Belarus have been halted since 1997. The conduct and outcome of the parliamentary elections and referendum of 17 October were another missed opportunity for Belarus. Having made very clear in advance that an unfair election would not be without consequences for its policy towards Belarus, the European Union duly reviewed its policy. It achieved an outcome which strikes a good balance and which highlights once again the willingness of the European Union to deepen its relationship with Belarus once the Belarussian authorities clearly demonstrate their willingness to respect democratic values and the rule of law.As it borders Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, Belarus is now an immediate neighbour of the European Union. As such, it has the opportunity to be an active partner of the Union in the framework of the European neighbourhood policy provided it reverses its present policies and embarks on fundamental democratic and economic reforms to bring the country closer to European common values. This, in a nutshell, is the EU's approach to Belarus and is clearly restated in the latest conclusions on Belarus adopted on Monday by the General Affairs and External Relations Council.At the same time, the Union is prepared to continue to intensify its efforts to assist Belarus to meet challenges arising from its self-isolation. Community and member states' assistance programmes will directly support democratisation and democratic forces in Belarus, notably by humanitarian, regional and cross-border co-operation. To co-ordinate this assistance, the Commission will organise a workshop in Lithuania with the participation of member states, other interested countries, NGOs and other relevant actors. At the GAERC meeting on 22 November, I recommended that the Chernobyl Children's Project, whose experience and expertise equip it to make a valuable contribution, should be invited to participate in this workshop. The initial contact and response from the Commission and the Council was positive.As I stated, this issue is of utmost concern to the Government. My Department will continue to monitor developments closely and to pursue the matter through all appropriate channels. I thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to put this statement on the record.

The most recent discussion took place in Brussels on 22 November at which my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, attended. The Council adopted conclusions which, inter alia, condemned the forced displacement of internally displaced persons, IDPs, welcomed the expansion of the African Union mission in Darfur, AMIS II, and the recent progress in the AU-mediated peace talks in Abuja, and expressed grave concern at the continuing humanitarian situation. The Council will further discuss the situation in Darfur at its meeting of 13 December while the issue is also expected to feature on the agenda of the European Council next month.The UN Security Council also remains closely involved and discussed the situation in Darfur during the special session which it held in Nairobi on 18-19 November. The Security Council is performing an important role in maintaining pressure on both the Government of Sudan and the rebels in Darfur to fulfil all the commitments they have made. Further steps such as sanctions will become unavoidable if clear evidence emerges that either side does not intend to comply.Security Council Resolution 1564 called on the UNSG to set up an international commission of inquiry which will investigate claims of genocide. The commission was established on 7 October and is due to report back to the UN Security Council in three months. The EU has also tabled a resolution on the human rights situation in Sudan at the current UN General Assembly in New York.Considerable planning support is being offered by the EU and the UN to the expanded AU mission in Darfur, AMIS II, which is currently being deployed and involves an increase in the strength of the mission to 3,320 personnel. The EU and its member states are also providing a substantial amount of logistical support to assist the deployment of AMIS II.Ireland has provided over €10 million in funding to Sudan to date in 2004. Over €6 million of this has been emergency assistance for Darfur. Overall, Sudan has received the greatest amount of Irish Government humanitarian support in 2004. There has also been generous and sustained support from the Irish people through their private contributions to aid agencies.The most recent contribution made by Ireland in response to the situation in Darfur is support of €500,000 to AMIS II. This funding will go towards supporting humanitarian and human rights monitors attached to the mission.I remain deeply conscious of the challenges faced by the vulnerable people of Darfur — challenges to their very survival. Ireland will continue to respond generously and swiftly to their needs in conjunction with our NGO partners working on the ground in Darfur.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	789	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 50, 58 and 72 together.I welcome the announcement by the Burmese Government on 18 November 2004 of the release a number of prisoners, including many political prisoners such as Ko Paw Oo Tun, who has been in jail since he led student protests in 1989, and a member of the central executive of the NLD, Mr. Win Tin. I hope this will lead to the release of other political prisoners in Burma, including Aung San Suu Kyi, who, regrettably, remains under house arrest.As I have stated to the House on a number of previous occasions, the Government has pursued a strong and consistent line in support of democracy in Burma. Both Ireland, and our EU partners, remain strongly critical of the continued detention under house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, other activists and a number of MPs elected in the elections of 1990. We have been critical also of the absence of political progress, serious and persistent human rights abuses and the lack of fundamental freedoms in Burma.The issue of Burma is raised in all our bilateral political contacts with relevant third countries, particularly Burma's Asian neighbours. Most recently, I raised the issue of Burma with Vice Premier Huang Ju of China during official talks on 16 November 2004. The Taoiseach raised our concerns about Burma at the Fifth ASEM Summit, which took place from 7 to 9 October in Hanoi. The Taoiseach, in his intervention, questioned why Aung San Suu Kyi has not been released, and why there has not been greater progress towards democracy in Burma.During our EU Presidency, the Government ensured that the issue of Burma was regularly discussed in consultations with interested third countries. I am pleased that this practice has been carried forward by the Netherlands Presidency, which has demonstrated a similar commitment to fostering democracy in Burma.Burma was high on the agenda at the ASEM Foreign Ministers' meeting, which my predecessor hosted in Kildare in April 2004, as well as at the preceding informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers held at Tullamore. There was considerable hope at that time that the Burmese regime was about to release Aung San Su Kyi and allow her party, the NLD, to participate in the national convention. Indeed, the Burmese Foreign Minister at the time, since dismissed, announced publicly that Aung San Su Kyi was about to be released. This optimism was reflected in the decision by EU Ministers at Tullamore to indicate that if Aung San Su Kyi were released, the NLD invited to participate in the National Convention and the Convention permitted to operate free from harassment, the EU would be ready to re-examine its engagement with Burma.Regrettably, the expected positive developments have not been forthcoming. Lack of support from our Asian partners meant that the EU was not able to prevent Burma's participation in the newly enlarged ASEM short of provoking the collapse of ASEM. Nevertheless, the EU used the recent ASEM Summit to make clear its opposition to the actions of the Burmese regime. Immediately following the summit on 10 October, the Union took the decision to reinforce sanctions against the Burmese regime by adopting a revised and strengthened Common Position. The Government has decided, given the lack of progress in Burma, to put the proposed exchange of ambassadors between Ireland and Burma on hold.The Government's continuing goal, and that of the EU, remains the release and restoration of liberty to Aung San Suu Kyi, the return of democracy to Burma, an end to human rights violations and the realisation of peace andprosperity for the long suffering people of Burma.

My Department, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance discussed the modalities of implementing this decision. While it is not possible to exempt the DVD and CD sales from VAT, a contribution equivalent in value to the VAT paid on purchases will be paid to the Band Aid Trust from the official development assistance programme based on sales figures, which will be available in early 2005. The proceeds of the Band Aid CD and the Live Aid DVD will be spent on humanitarian assistance, primarily in the Darfur region of Sudan.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	791	I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 36, 75, 80 and 102 together.Following the signature of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe in Rome on 29 October, it is for all member states of the European Union to ratify the European constitution in accordance with their own constitutional requirements. The European constitution sets a target date of 1 November 2006 for the completion of this process. Lithuania became the first member state to complete its ratification process when its Parliament approved the constitution on 11 November.It appears that referendums are likely to be held in 11 member states, including Ireland. While Spain will be the first member state to hold its referendum, on 20 February 2005, dates for the others have not yet been set. No decision has yet been made on when a referendum will be held in Ireland. In due course I will be publishing a Bill to amend Bunreacht na hÉireann to allow for ratification by Ireland of the European Constitution, and preliminary work is under way.The Government is seeking to foster the fullest possible national debate on the European constitution, building on the excellent work done by the National Forum on Europe and the Joint Committee on European Affairs during the European convention and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference. I welcome the intention of the national forum to focus its work on the European Constitution over the period ahead, and I also welcome the debates and seminars which are being organised by other groups and organisations.As an initial contribution to the debate, my Department has published an explanatory guide to the European constitution, together with a short pamphlet. Both of these have received wide distribution, and are available free of charge to any member of the public who requests them. Information, including the text of the European constitution, is also available on my Department's website.The Government will produce further information materials over the period ahead, including a full White Paper. A sum of €150,000 has been provided for in the Estimates for 2005. Information will also be sent to every household in due course. Exactly what form this will take is for further consideration. In this connection, I would also emphasise the role of the Referendum Commission, which, as was the case for the second referendum on the Nice treaty, will be set up in good time and with adequate resources to fulfil its dual mandate of informing the public and encouraging turnout.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	792	The Government does not have any information on casualty figures among civilians in Iraq, other than those estimates by various commentators which are available in the public domain. We have no means of assessing the accuracy of any of these figures. These have usually ranged from 10,000 to 15,000 persons. I am also aware of a recent study in the UK journal The Lancet, which by statistical extrapolation suggested a civilian toll of up to 100,000. The Iraqi Ministry of Health has now estimated that 3,800 civilians have been killed in the six month period to 5 October 2004.The Government's view, which has been expressed clearly since the outset of the conflict, is that the use of force should be kept to a minimum, and that every possible effort must be made to avoid civilian casualties.In this context, it is right that we should recognise also that very many Iraqi civilians have been killed or injured in bomb attacks against multi-national forces by insurgents, who seem indifferent to the loss of life they cause.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	793	I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 101 together.I regret that my response to these questions is given in the most tragic of circumstances. Last week, as the Taoiseach informed the House, all reports suggested that Margaret Hassan had been killed by her abductors, despite the hopes and prayers of everyone that she would be released. Deputies were unanimous in their condemnation of this appalling act and in their admiration for Margaret Hassan's life and work. There was unanimous praise also for the courageous and dignified manner in which her husband and family have dealt with their ordeal during recent weeks.I know that Margaret's family are very grateful for all the efforts made on her behalf since her abduction. Her husband Tahseen has said that he greatly appreciates the support of the Government, the Oireachtas and the Irish people over the past four weeks.Against this sad background, I will briefly summarise the efforts made by the Government on Margaret's behalf. From the moment we learned of her abduction, we established regular contacts with her family and provided liaison officers to assist them here in Ireland and in the UK. In addition to working closely with the British Government, diplomatic contacts were established and maintained with key Governments and organisations in the Middle East. Appeals were made for her release which secured widespread coverage in Iraq and the region around it. In this regard, I note in particular the Taoiseach's appeal made alongside Margaret's family when he and I met them here in Dublin on 2 November last.At all times, the Government was guided by Margaret's family and by those on the ground in Iraq, including Care International. It, too, has lost a most special and talented humanitarian, as have her fellow Iraqi people.Unfortunately, all of these efforts have not brought about a positive conclusion in this case. I repeat what was said in this House last week: if she has been killed, her family have one remaining wish, to have her returned to her family so they can bid her farewell. I join with them in this final appeal.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	794	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 67 together.The security situation in Iraq continues to be a matter of serious concern both to Ireland and to the international community at large. There seems to be no reduction in violent incidents, and I am very concerned that the situation may continue to worsen in the run-up to the elections scheduled for 30 January. It is the Iraqi people themselves who are suffering most from the continued instability, both directly and through the frustration of reconstruction work.Hostage taking continues to terrorise both Iraqis and foreigners. In this country we have been shocked by the reported dreadful murder of Margaret Hassan, following that of Ken Bigley.The interim Iraqi government is pursuing a three track strategy to try to end the violence. First, to encourage disaffected groups in the community to enter the political process. Second, to push forward reconstruction efforts to relieve the hardships affecting the Iraqi population, especially the poorer elements. Third, to advance as quickly as possible the recruitment and training of Iraqi security forces, not just to contribute to security efforts but also to advance the transfer of responsibility for security from the multi-national force to Iraq's own forces.The challenge facing the Iraqi government in these areas is very great, but I believe this is the correct approach to meet it. It is clear the elections will mark a crucial stage in giving the Iraqi government the authority it needs to restore stability throughout the country.Ireland and the European Union will continue to give every support we can to the Iraqi government in these efforts, especially in the areas of reconstruction and preparation for the elections. We will also continue to support the involvement of the United Nations in these efforts, which I believe to be crucial to their success.As well as these actions, the Iraqi government also recently decided that a military operation was the only way to regain control of the city of Fallujah, a step it regarded as vital if the elections were to be able to proceed. That operation, carried out by US and Iraqi forces, seems now to be at an end. I have commented elsewhere on the implications of that operation for the civilian population and on their resulting humanitarian needs. It is essential that the use of force in such operations be kept to a minimum, and they be brought to an end as soon as possible.

On 19 November, the Council adopted a decision formally appointing the Commission. Following the publication of this decision in the Official Journal of the European Union, the new Commission formally took office on 22 November.The Government's priority throughout the European Parliament's hearings process has been to see the early appointment of an effective Commission which enjoys the support of both the European Parliament and the Council. The Government welcomes the appointment of the new Commission and looks forward to working closely with it.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	796	Uganda's track record in poverty reduction and economic management over the past 18 years stands up favourably to comparison with much of Africa. The country has seen the development of key institutions of governance and earned a good reputation in some areas such as press freedom. The announced intention to move to a multi-party system offers the possibility of greater democratic change in future. However, notwithstanding many positive developments, there are concerns about some current trends in governance. On the economic front, macroeconomics stability is being maintained, although recent trends have indicated a fall in the levels of growth and some inequities in the distribution of its benefits.Continuing insecurity in the northern region of Uganda has caused widespread disruption and loss of life. The 17-year civil conflict, caused by the brutal campaign of the Lord's Resistance Army, LRA, involving atrocities against the civilian population and large-scale abduction of children, intensified in 2003, resulting in a humanitarian crisis with approximately 1.5 million people displaced. The ongoing tragedy represents a major challenge to the Ugandan Government, but there are recent indications that the conflict may be entering its final phase. While the Government is pursuing a military campaign against the LRA, it has also indicated willingness to seek a negotiated settlement and has introduced a successful amnesty process. Some indications have been given recently that the LRA is prepared to enter into peace talks aimed at ending the conflict. In response to these signals, President Museveni announced on 14 November a temporary ceasefire in designated parts of northern Uganda to provide an opportunity for the LRA to consult about entering negotiations with the Government. The donor community in Kampala and in Ireland, has been closely involved in supporting these developments which it is hoped can lead to a permanent ceasefire and peaceful resolution of this conflict.In the meantime, the humanitarian situation in northern Uganda remains fragile. In mid-September 2004, members of the donor community in Kampala, led by Ireland's Chargé d'Affaires, visited northern Uganda to send a message of solidarity to the people on behalf of the international community and to stress the international community's support for the amnesty process and for dialogue and reconciliation as a way to bring finality to the conflict. The chairman and vice-chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs also visited northern Uganda in late September 2004.On the domestic political front, Uganda has commenced a process of transition from its current "no party"— but one movement — democratic system to a multi-party system. On 22 September 2004, a White Paper was published on proposals for constitutional change which endorsed the move to multi-party democracy and the necessary changes in legislation required to enable political parties to operate. A referendum will be required to change the constitution and this is expected to take place during 2005. It is hoped that this process will culminate in multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections in 2006. While the move to multi-party democracy is welcome, proposals emerging from some quarters for a change in the Ugandan constitution, which would facilitate a third term by President Museveni, are viewed with concern by donors.The position of donors, including Ireland, is to continue close engagement with the Ugandan authorities with a view to ensuring that the process of constitutional change and the subsequent elections are transparent and free. It will also be important to ensure that the political space is opened up in sufficient time for an opposition to organise and contest the elections in 2006. An encouraging development in this regard is a ruling by Uganda's constitutional court on 18 November which has cleared the way for political parties in Uganda to take part in the 2006 elections.Respect for human rights is enshrined in the Ugandan constitution and Uganda has good policies and strong institutions in support of human rights, in particular an active and respected human rights commission. It also has a free press which plays a constructive role in highlighting abuses. An important step to promote press freedom was a ruling by the Supreme Court in February 2004 that journalists could no longer be charged with publication of false news. At the same time, donors are concerned about incidents of torture and illegal detention by security forces in 2003 and have kept the Government under pressure in this respect. In July 2004, the security agencies agreed to work together with the Uganda human rights commission and the director of public prosecutions to fight torture. This is a positive development, although concrete results will have to be awaited.In response to donor pressure, Uganda established the Porter Judicial Commission of Enquiry into allegations of illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the DRC. The Government has underlined its commitment to following up on the commission's findings and bringing to account those implicated in such activities. While there is still unresolved business, action has been taken against key people whom the commission found to be involved, including the army chief of staff, General Kazini, who was dismissed from his post, and the president's brother, Salim Saleh, who was removed from Parliament. In mid-September 2004, a number of donors, including Ireland, met with President Museveni to stress the need for the Government to reconfirm its political will to fight corruption and act accordingly.Uganda has also been playing a more constructive role of late in relation to the peace processes in both the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, and Burundi. An agreement was concluded in Kampala on 26 October 2004 between the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda to establish a tripartite commission aimed at resolving outstanding political and security issues, including completing disarmament of armed groups in eastern DRC with former links to both Rwanda and Uganda. The Ugandan Government has also participated constructively in the preparations for the Great Lakes Conference which took place in Dar-es-Salaam on 19-20 November 2004 and where agreement was reached on a declaration which it is hoped will provide the basis for a regional peace and security pact, to be adopted at a second Summit in 2005.

Nonetheless, there are two areas where legislation is envisaged at present.The first of these relates to the ratification of the European constitution. Under the terms of the European constitution, signed in Rome on 29 October 2004, member states have agreed to complete the ratification process by 1 November 2006. In due course, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution of Ireland to enable ratification of the European Constitution. The proposed amendment of the Constitution of Ireland will be subject to referendum. If the referendum result indicates approval of the European constitution, it will be necessary, before it enters into force, to amend the European Communities Act 1972, as amended, to reflect the changes which the European constitution will make to the legal instruments of the European Union.In addition, a Bill to amend the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts 1967 and 1976 is currently being drafted. Under the 1967 Act, the Government may, by order, make provision for international organisations and bodies and related persons to have privileges and immunities in the context of international relations. It is proposed to amend the 1967 and 1976 Acts in a way which would define these provisions, while not impinging upon the general prerogative of the Government to make orders. It remains possible that other legislation may become a priority in the coming years.

The exact date for the summit has still to be decided but I understand it will take place in Washington DC. No firm agenda has been decided as yet.The Washington summit will follow on from the successful EU-US summit in Dromoland Castle in June this year which demonstrated the continuing strength and depth of the transatlantic partnership.The Deputy may also be interested to know that President Bush has indicated that he plans to visit Europe in early 2005, possibly in February, with the aim of deepening transatlantic ties with European nations.

The decline in respect for human rights and the rule of law persists. Arbitrary arrests and political violence continue. Inflation now stands at over 600% and it is likely that a substantial proportion of the Zimbabwean population will require food aid in the coming months, notwithstanding the predictions of the Zimbabwe Grain Marketing Board, GMB, and the decision on the part of the Zimbabwean Government not to request international general food aid.A particularly worrying development in recent months has been the decision of the Zimbabwean Government to introduce new legislation to govern the operation of non-governmental organisations, NGOs. This repressive legislation, which is currently going through the Zimbabwean Parliament, will impose severe restrictions on the operation of NGOs, particularly those in the human rights and humanitarian fields, by requiring them to register formally with the Zimbabwean Government and prohibiting any foreign assistance to NGOs concerned with human rights. The European Union has made known its concerns about the new NGO Bill and has formally raised the issue with SADC, the South African Development Community, of which Zimbabwe is a member. The Government will be asking our ambassador to Zimbabwe to make clear to the Zimbabwean authorities Ireland's concerns over the possible implications of this new legislation on humanitarian organisations operating in Zimbabwe.The political dialogue initiated between the EU and Zimbabwe to address ongoing concerns was closed in February 2002 when it became clear that the Government of Zimbabwe was not willing to engage on any meaningful level. The lack of progress by the Government of Zimbabwe on these issues is reflected in the EU's common position on Zimbabwe, which was renewed in February 2004. The Council renewed sanctions on those individuals whom the EU regards as bearing the main responsibility for serious violations of human rights in Zimbabwe. The sanctions are targeted exclusively against the political elite and include a travel ban and assets freeze, as well as an arms embargo.Attention in Zimbabwe is increasingly focusing on the parliamentary elections which are scheduled to be held in March 2005. The Zimbabwean Government has publicly committed itself to abide by the principles and guidelines governing democratic elections, which were adopted by the SADC Summit in Mauritius on 17 August 2004. The Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, the main opposition party in Zimbabwe, has endorsed these principles as the basis for free and fair elections next March. So far, however, the level of political reforms signalled by the Zimbabwean Government does not in any way match up to what will be required if it is to comply fully with the SADC guidelines. This has resulted in a decision by the MDC last August announcing that it will not participate in any elections which are held outside the provisions of the SADC framework. The European Union will continue to press for and encourage full compliance by the Zimbabwean Government with the SADC principles so that free and fair elections can take place next March.One encouraging development which could help to improve the political environment in the run up to the parliamentary elections next March was the acquittal of the MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, on charges of treason by the Zimbabwean high court on 15 October. The EU issued a declaration welcoming this development and remains supportive of all efforts aimed at mediating and encouraging a resumption of direct political dialogue between President Mugabe's ZANU-PF party and the MDC.Ireland and our EU partners have continued to take the lead in drawing attention to the serious human rights situation in Zimbabwe. The EU has tabled a resolution at the current session of the UN General Assembly which underlines its deep concern at serious human rights violations by the Zimbabwean Government, including torture, unlawful detention and extra-judicial executions, and urging the Government to take all necessary measures to safeguard and protect human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. The resolution also urges the Zimbabwean Government to make all the necessary legislative changes to enable free and fair elections, in full accordance with the SADC guidelines, to take place.

Considerable progress has been made, the outstanding issues are few and the differences between the parties are, in my view, not insurmountable. If the remaining gaps can be successfully bridged, we will then have reached a comprehensive agreement on all of the key issues.Last week, the Governments outlined to the political parties a set of proposals we believe have the capacity to address all outstanding issues and thereby secure the required comprehensive agreement. We are confident that agreement on these proposals can bring about stable, partnership government within Northern Ireland; the resumed operation of all of the political institutions of the Agreement; an end to IRA paramilitarism; definitive, verifiable decommissioning of paramilitary weapons; and completion of the Patten project on policing. If accepted, they represent the best path forward for peace and political stability in Northern Ireland. We have urged the parties, therefore, to reflect very carefully on them.We have now reached a critical juncture and the time frame for agreement is narrow. Both Governments are convinced of the importance of securing agreement now and have emphasised this to the parties. All of our efforts are focused on making the current engagement work and conjecture regarding an alternative to a comprehensive agreement would not be helpful at this point. Whatever the end result in the short term, both Governments are committed to the Good Friday Agreement as the mandated framework for political progress in Northern Ireland.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	801	I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 79 and 99 together.I represented the Government at the funeral service for the late President Arafat. The funeral service was a major and solemn occasion, held in Cairo. The burial itself took place in Ramallah. The Palestinian leadership indicated that its preference was for the international community to be represented at the Cairo ceremony, and for the burial itself to be an occasion for the Palestinian people. As might readily be understood, the Palestinian leadership was under considerable time pressure in attending the service and proceeding directly to the burial in Ramallah. In consequence, it did not prove possible for it to hold substantive discussions with the representatives of the international community during its limited time in Cairo.I have been in correspondence, however, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Palestinian Authority, Dr. Nabil Shaath. Dr. Shaath wrote to me this week extending his deepest thanks to the Irish Government and people for the condolences offered to the Palestinian people on the death of President Arafat. He also informed me of the determination of the Palestinian leadership to pursue a smooth political transition and legal succession, including the holding of presidential elections on 9 January next.The House will know that I recently met Dr. Nabil Shaath here in Dublin. While the programme in Cairo did not permit me to follow up on this meeting with Dr. Shaath or his colleagues, I intend to avail of opportunities to keep in touch with him and other leaders as the situation develops. The Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting later this month will provide an opportunity.It is clear that the implications of President Arafat's death could be very significant. He was the leader of his people for more than a generation. He has been a unifying figure of unique importance. The loss of such a figure poses a challenge to the Palestinian people to maintain their unity. Hopefully, all factions will realise that the alternative would mean a further blow to Palestinian aspirations for a State of their own and could result in the spread of instability. The signs so far are good that the Palestinian leadership will be successful in handling the situation. Equally, I would expect that the Israeli Government will see the importance of easing the transition to a new, empowered and legitimate leadership and will facilitate the elections for President Arafat's successor.Looking at the future development of the peace process, my hope is that the death of President Arafat will lead to a refocusing of minds on the imperative need to get the peace process back on track. The road map offers the best opportunity of arriving at a two-state solution based on Israeli and Palestinian states living side by side in peace within secure and agreed borders. Ireland and our partners in the EU will continue to work for progress on the road map.

The conclusions of the meeting re-emphasised that the EU will spare no effort to promote peace and security in the Middle East, both in the short term and in the longer term, within the broader political perspective. The Union is determined to co-ordinate its efforts with the parties involved and with its partners, in particular the Quartet members.In its conclusions, the Council began by expressing its condolences to the Palestinian people on the occasion of President Arafat's death. The Council commended the approach of the current leadership in organising a smooth transition. The conclusions reaffirmed the EU's goals and policies with respect to the Middle East peace process. We called upon all parties to abstain from any provocative or violent action and to demonstrate the necessary courage and leadership in order to advance the peace process, as well as for an end to terrorism and hostilities.The Council reiterated the EU's commitment to the programme of short-term concrete actions endorsed by the European Council earlier this month. We concluded that immediate action is required to support the presidential elections, to improve the security situation and to provide financial support to the Palestinian Authority.We called on the Palestinian Authority to organise elections in accordance with international standards under the authority of an independent electoral commission and upon Israel to facilitate these elections. The Union is ready to assist the Palestinian Authority financially, technically and politically. We welcomed the Commission's intention to launch an election observation mission.Palestinian institutions and the economy should be strengthened. Israel and other members of the international community have a shared responsibility to facilitate this. The EU called on all donors and the parties directly concerned to meet their commitments and, where possible, to step up their efforts.I would hope the Euro-Mediterraean ministerial meeting next week in the Hague, at which I will represent Ireland, will provide a further opportunity for contacts both between the parties and with the EU.At the UN, Ireland and the EU have repeatedly reaffirmed their support for efforts to resolve the conflict, most recently through my predecessor's address to the UN General Assembly on 22 September 2004, and in the Presidency's statement on behalf of all member states including Ireland at the UN Security Council on 5 October, in which the EU deplored the disproportionate nature of Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip and called upon Israel to fully respect the Fourth Geneva Convention.The UN has adopted a very large number of resolutions on these issues over the years, and Ireland has consistently supported those resolutions which reflected the EU's commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. I would note in particular our support for the UN General Assembly resolution adopted in July this year by an overwhelming majority in response to the International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the separation barrier.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	803	I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 144 together.The recently issued report by Amnesty International, entitled Democratic Republic of Congo: Mass Rape — time for remedies, highlights the continuing and serious problem of human rights violations in that country and the extent to which women and young girls have been particular victims of the conflict in the DRC. While there has been a considerable measure of political progress in the DRC since the signing of the Sun City peace accords in 2002, state institutions and the administration of justice still remain critically weak, contributing to the country's continuing poor human rights record.The Amnesty International report has drawn attention to the way the existence of a culture of impunity in the DRC is contributing to the crime of rape being committed on an unacceptable scale. There is no doubt that more needs to be done "by all involved" to tackle impunity and to ensure that those responsible for human rights violations are brought to account. The transitional national government has a particular responsibility in this regard. Greater progress needs to be made in accelerating the transition process and particularly in establishing an effective national justice system and an integrated national police force, both of which are essential in bringing to justice human rights violators.The European Union is making a major contribution in support of security sector reform in the DRC. The EU, in particular, has helped to establish an integrated police unit in Kinshasa which is currently undergoing training. Ireland has contributed €75,000 towards the costs of establishment of this unit. Further assistance with police training and assistance to the Congolese ministries in charge of security is also under consideration. It is also important to acknowledge the valuable role being performed by the UN peacekeeping operation, MONUC, in monitoring and reporting on those human rights violations which are occurring.The European Union has remained active in ensuring that international attention continues to be focused on the need for improvement in the human rights situation in the DRC. The Irish EU Presidency successfully pursued an initiative at this year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, which resulted in adoption of a consensus resolution on the human rights situation in the DRC and provided for appointment of an independent UN expert to continue monitoring and reporting on the situation. The European Union has also tabled a resolution on the human rights situation in the DRC at the current session of the UN General Assembly in New York. This resolution, inter alia, specifically calls on the transitional national government to do more to tackle impunity and to carry out an urgent and comprehensive reform of the judicial system in the DRC. The draft resolution also condemns the widespread use of sexual violence and urges all parties in the DRC to take special measures to protect women and children from such violence.The efforts to end the culture of impunity in the DRC have also been greatly assisted by the decision of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court last June to launch an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the DRC. This is a development I very much welcome. It is also encouraging to note that the ICC investigation is being undertaken at the specific request of the transitional national government and is both a welcome demonstration of renewed commitment on the DRC's part to improving their human rights situation as well as a warning to all those who may have been involved in serious human rights violations in the DRC that they cannot expect impunity for their crimes. An investigating team from the Office of the ICC Prosecutor visited the DRC at the end of July and further visits will take place in the coming months as the investigation process develops.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	804	I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 43 and 46 together.The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 decided that Turkey is a candidate country "destined" to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria applied to other candidate states. The Copenhagen European Council in December 2002 made the clear commitment that if the European Council meeting in December 2004 decides that Turkey has fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria, the EU will open accession negotiations without delay. This commitment was reaffirmed most recently by the European Council on 18 June 2004, under Ireland's Presidency. The political criteria require a candidate country to achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.The June European Council welcomed the significant progress made to date by Turkey in the reform process, including the important and wide-ranging constitutional amendments adopted in May. It also welcomed the continued and sustained efforts of the Turkish Government to meet the Copenhagen political criteria and emphasised the importance of concluding the remaining legislative work and accelerating efforts to ensure decisive progress in the implementation of reforms at all levels of administration and throughout the country. Legislative work has continued in Turkey in recent months. I welcome in particular the adoption by the Turkish Parliament in September of a comprehensive new penal code.On 6 October, the European Commission presented its regular report for 2004 on Turkey's progress towards accession, together with its recommendation, for consideration by the December European Council. The Commission noted that Turkey has made substantial progress in its political reform process, particularly in the past two years. It drew attention to a number of reforms which have been legislated for, but which have not yet entered into force. The Commission concluded that in view of the overall progress of reforms, and provided Turkey brings into force the key outstanding legislation, it considers that Turkey sufficiently fulfils the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened. The issue of the timing of any negotiations would be a matter for decision by the European Council.In its recommendation, the Commission noted that the irreversibility of the reform process in Turkey, and, in particular, its implementation with regard to fundamental freedoms will need to be confirmed over a longer period of time. It suggested a detailed strategy for the pursuit of negotiations, which would reinforce and support the reform process, and noted that accession negotiations with Turkey would be, by their very nature, part of an open-ended process whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand.The Government has welcomed the very comprehensive report and recommendation from the Commission. Turkey has made remarkable progress in recent years in the adoption of essential constitutional and administrative reforms. I expect the Turkish Government will maintain its efforts over the coming weeks to ensure that the conditions are in place for a positive decision by the December European Council, leading to the opening of accession negotiations.The question of Turkey's accession has been the subject of political debate in all member states. Obviously, Cyprus has particular concerns which have been explained by Foreign Minister Iacovou at meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which we have both attended since the presentation of the Commission report and recommendation. The EU has welcomed the positive contribution of the Turkish Government to the efforts of the UN Secretary General earlier this year to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. However, Turkey still does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member state since 1 May. It is important to note that any accession negotiations will be held in the framework of an Intergovernmental Conference consisting of all 25 member states of the EU. I hope the Turkish Government will respond without further delay to the invitation from the June European Council to conclude negotiations with the Commission, on behalf of the Community and its 25 member states, on the adaptation of the Ankara agreement on the establishment of the customs union to take account of the accession of the new member states.

These figures do not include trade with Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan. The growth in trade between us is a clear indication of the success of the Government's Asia strategy.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	806	The Embassy of Ireland, London, submitted a report on 27 October 2004 to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on my behalf which was entitled Shot at Dawn; A report into the courts-martial and execution of twenty-six Irish soldiers by the British Army during World War I. This report was the culmination of extensive research into the subject, including in regard to the courts-martial files of the Irish men in question which were provided following a meeting with the British Ministry of Defence in February 2004. Mr. Peter Mulvany, the Shot at Dawn Ireland co-ordinator, has been kept fully informed throughout this period, and remains in regular contact with my officials as matters progress.The report submitted to the British side discusses in depth the current and contemporaneous grounds in support of our view that these men did not deserve their fate: The public and parliamentary unease on the subject of military executions at the time of the First World War is well documented. As recognised by the Deputy, this unease led to the death penalty being repealed for the particular offences under which each man was shot a mere ten years after the war had ended; there is evidence to suggest a disparity in the treatment of the lower ranks in comparison to officers, and statistics that highlight a harsher disciplinary regime faced by men from Ireland in comparison to men from other countries; and there are also concerns that both medical and mental symptoms apparent in those facing courts-martial were not adequately addressed prior to sentencing, and that convincing mitigating factors in a number of cases were ignored.When these factors are combined with the obvious practice of the British Army at the time to control discipline through exemplary justice, then our case for retrospective pardons seems very strong. We have therefore asked that the British Government consider our report with a view to restoring the good names of these men. The British response in this regard is awaited.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	807	It has been more than two years since Iran's undeclared nuclear programme was first brought to the attention of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and the director general of the agency has presented six written reports since June 2003. The latest report is to be discussed at the next meeting of the IAEA board of governors which begins in Vienna on 25 November.The issue has been followed closely at European level throughout this time. At its most recent meeting on 4-5 November 2004, the European Council underlined the importance it attached to building confidence in the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme and the need for transparency and compliance with IAEA board of governors' resolutions. The Council stressed that a full and sustained suspension of all enrichment and reprocessing activities, on a voluntary basis, would open the door for talks on long-term co-operation offering mutual benefits. The Council also confirmed that the European Union and its member states would remain actively engaged "notably through the efforts of France, Germany and the United Kingdom and the High Representative for the CFSP" with the objective of achieving progress on the Iranian nuclear issue before the IAEA board of governors' meeting later this month.These efforts have since resulted in an agreement with Iran on nuclear issues and future co-operation. Under this agreement, Iran, inter alia, reaffirmed that it does not and will not seek to acquire nuclear weapons and committed itself to full transparency and co-operation with the IAEA. Iran, moreover, decided to voluntarily suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities and to invite the IAEA to verify and to monitor the suspension. The agreement further provides for negotiations to begin in the first half of next month on a long-term agreement which will cover political and security issues, technology and co-operation, and nuclear issues. Iran’s commitment to sustaining the suspension, while these negotiations are under way, is stated in the agreement to be essential for the continuation of the overall process.The General Affairs and External Relations Council, earlier this week, welcomed Iran's decision to suspend fully all enrichment and reprocessing activities and to sustain this suspension while negotiations on long-term arrangements are under way. The Council underlined the importance of these arrangements which will have to provide for objective guarantees that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes and affirmed its willingness to work towards a positive outcome.

The Estimates for Public Services include an overall allocation of €8.267 million to support our emigrants in 2005. This is a doubling of the 2004 Estimates figure. Even allowing for the additional funding which was made available to emigrant services in late 2004, this figure of €8.267 million represents an overall increase of 63%.We have, therefore, increased very substantially funding to the voluntary organisations that assist our emigrants. The funding will in large part go to groups providing front line services to our emigrant communities in Britain, and especially the most vulnerable Irish people there. There will also be significant increases for emigrant groups providing similar services in the United States and Australia.This very significant increase reflects in the clearest possible way the strength of the Government's firm and sustained commitment to our emigrant communities. Our commitment is both immediate and long-term, and the very substantial allocation for 2005 will be built on progressively over the coming years. Our commitment is also reflected in the establishment of a new dedicated unit — the Irish abroad unit — which has been warmly welcomed at home and abroad.

Such operations are therefore financed by contributions from member states. This is currently the case under the provisions of the Nice treaty and will remain so after the entry into force of the European constitution.The procedures for establishing, financing and administering the start-up fund are not elaborated in the constitution. It remains for the Council, once the constitution has entered into force, to adopt decisions establishing such procedures, on foot of a proposal by the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Happily, they were released yesterday and I conveyed the sense of relief and delight of the Irish people to Annetta's family. The positive outcome to this difficult case is itself a tribute to the Afghan Government and to the United Nations, with whom my Department was in regular contact during these recent weeks. We also discussed the situation on a number of occasions with Archbishop Eames, who has been a great source of support to her family.The presidential election in Afghanistan — the first election to be held since the 1960s — took place on 9 October 2004. On 3 November 2004, Mr. Hamid Karzai, leader of the Afghan Transitional Authority, was declared elected. His inauguration will take place on 7 December 2004. The presidential election constitutes the penultimate step in the implementation of the Bonn Agreement of December 2001 on arrangements for the re-establishment of permanent government institutions in Afghanistan. The holding of parliamentary elections, scheduled for April 2005, will complete this process.The fact that millions of Afghan nationals turned out to vote was most encouraging, and bodes well for the future stability of Afghanistan. President Karzai won 55.4% of the vote and secured support across all ethnic groups and in all areas of the country. The election day also passed without a major security incident, which is a tribute to both the Afghan police and armed forces, as well as to the international security forces in Afghanistan.In the aftermath of the presidential election, the UN, the EU, the OSCE and other relevant bodies are continuing to work with the Afghan authorities to facilitate the peaceful and successful holding of parliamentary elections next year. The parliamentary elections present a considerable political and logistical challenge. The possibility that there will be thousands of candidates cannot be ruled out.Much attention will also be focused on the formation of President Karzai's cabinet, which will be appointed after Mr. Karzai's inauguration on 7 December 2004. It will be important that President Karzai forms a strong and broad-based cabinet which will foster the social and economic development of the country and tackle the many challenges ahead.Looking ahead, it is important that the international community remains focused on how best to support Afghanistan. The decision of the UN Security Council on 17 September 2004 to extend the mandate of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan for a further 12-month period beyond 13 October 2004 is an important development in this regard. The agreement by NATO, at its summit in Istanbul in June 2004, to provide an additional 3,500 NATO troops to supplement ISAF for the election period together with the deployment of a number of new provincial reconstruction teams in recent months were also positive developments.To ensure a secure environment in Afghanistan, it is important that all irregular forces are disarmed and demobilised, or integrated into the national army. I welcome the steps already taken towards this end, but much more needs to be done so that the future Afghan Government has unified armed forces at its disposal. To this end, I strongly urge all concerned to make a full commitment to the vigorous implementation and intensification of the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process.The House will be aware of the grave problems that flow from the resurgence of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. On 18 November 2004, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime released a survey on opium production in Afghanistan in 2004. The survey found that opium cultivation has increased by 64% compared to 2003. Afghanistan is now the largest drug cultivating country in the world. Counter-narcotics will be a priority for the new Afghan Government. Ireland, together with our EU partners, fully supports the Afghan authorities' uncompromising stance on the illicit cultivation of and trafficking in drugs. Over the past three years, Ireland has contributed €500,000 per annum to the UNODC, €300,000 of which per annum has been channelled into counter-narcotics projects in the region.Afghanistan will continue to face many serious challenges in the period ahead and will therefore continue to need extensive support from the international community. Ireland and our partners in the European Union are determined to continue to play our part in this process.

I conveyed the enormous sense of relief felt by all the people of Ireland to Annetta's family yesterday.I wish to take this opportunity to record my appreciation for the work of the Secretary General of the United Nations and his staff, as well as that of the Afghan Government. Their great efforts have been rewarded with the return of Annetta to her husband José and to her family in Armagh, with whom my Department has been in contact during these difficult weeks.The Government followed this case very closely since learning of the abduction on 28 October last. My Department was in ongoing communication with the United Nations, both in New York and Kabul. We also liaised with Archbishop Robin Eames, who has been a great source of support to the family.This happy event brings to mind the tragic outcomes of other recent hostage cases. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of Ken Bigley and Margaret Hassan at this time.

Ireland is today tabling a formal proposal in Brussels requesting that official and working status in the EU be accorded to the Irish language and I am arranging for a copy of the proposal to be forwarded to the Deputies.Amendment of Regulation 1 of 1958, which governs the Union's language regime, requires the unanimous approval of partners.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	814	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 97 together.The Government's concern regarding the situation of the undocumented Irish people in the United States is raised on an ongoing basis in our bilateral contacts with the US authorities, including when the Taoiseach and my predecessor met with President Bush at the EU-US Summit in Dromoland Castle in June 2004.The number of Irish people who may be resident in the United States without the appropriate authorisation is difficult to estimate. While the US authorities have estimated that the number may have declined to 3,000 in the year 2000, I know that many of the organisations working on the ground with our emigrants would regard this figure as a very low estimate.I welcome comments made in recent weeks by senior members of the US Administration that immigration reform will be a high priority during President Bush's second term in office. As the Deputy may be aware, various proposals on immigration reform have been made by President Bush and by members of the outgoing Congress. These initiatives reflect an awareness of the importance of addressing the situation of the undocumented in the US in a constructive and sympathetic way. Proposals for reform will have to be considered in detail by the incoming US Congress. Realistically, there is unlikely to be any movement until after the presidential inauguration in the New Year. I will be monitoring closely developments and will raise this issue in my contacts with figures in the US Administration and Legislature.The Deputy can be assured that through the ongoing efforts of our embassy and my own contacts and those of my cabinet colleagues with political leaders in the US, we will continue to encourage and support all measures that benefit Irish citizens in the US.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	815	The recent Amnesty International report, Human dignity denied: Torture and Accountability in the War on Terror, details reported abuse of detainees held by US forces, particularly at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. It calls for a full commission of inquiry into US detention and interrogation practices and policies during the war on terror. The report also includes a series of recommendations to the US Government under Amnesty International's 12 point programme for the prevention of torture by agents of the State. This extensive Amnesty report builds on earlier reports from the same organisation in relation to its concerns about the treatment of those detained by US forces.The US authorities are well aware of the Government's concern regarding the treatment of detainees in both Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib. These concerns had been made known to the US Administration well before the publication of Human dignity denied on 27 October 2004. Such concerns have been raised on a number of occasions both by the Taoiseach and my predecessor and also through the Embassy of Ireland in Washington and with the US Embassy in Dublin.During the recent Irish Presidency of the European Union, the Government also ensured that the wider European concern on these issues was expressed. For example, on 17 May 2004 the EU Council of Ministers, acting on the initiative of the Irish Presidency, expressed its abhorrence at recent evidence of the mistreatment of prisoners in Iraqi prisons and condemned any instances of abuse and degradation of these prisoners. I might add that in the Declaration on Combating Terrorism issued at the EU-US Summit in Dromoland Castle on 26 June 2004, both sides reiterated their determination to work together to combat terrorism while sharing a commitment to protect and respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law on which our societies are founded and which terrorism seeks to destroy.I can assure the Deputy that in my own future contacts with the US Administration I will raise human rights issues when appropriate. While I have not had the opportunity to visit Washington yet in my role as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I look forward to meeting with Secretary of State-designate Dr. Condoleezza Rice in the period ahead and I have already conveyed my warm congratulations to her on her nomination.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	816	I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 78 together.My Department prepares official visits in close co-operation with representatives of the incoming delegations. Each element of the visit must be acceptable to the parties. As the House will appreciate, it is not possible to oblige anybody to give a press conference if he or she decides not to do so.I delivered one formal speech on Ireland's bilateral economic relations with China in the course of the visit. The speech followed a lunch meeting with the Vice-Premier on 17 November. This has been made available publicly on my Department's website.The official talks with the Chinese delegation covered two main areas: bilateral relations and EU-China relations. On our bilateral relations, we discussed the number of high-level visits between our two countries in recent years, human rights issues, the question of Tibet, the rapid expansion in trade since the launch of the Government's Asia strategy, the growth in the number of Chinese students in Ireland and the recent exchange of cultural festivals. The areas of investment, education, culture, health, technology, telecommunications and agriculture were also raised, as were the situations in Burma and North Korea.In the context of EU-China relations, we reviewed current political relations between the EU and China, including the human rights issue. Vice-Premier Huang Ju paid tribute to Ireland's recent EU Presidency and the progress which had been made in EU-China relations during our Presidency. At his request, I updated the Vice-Premier on the current state-of-play regarding discussions on whether to lift the EU arms embargo on China.

I understand that he has since been released from police custody and was placed under house arrest for one week. These steps appear to have been taken because the Israeli authorities believed that he had contravened restrictions imposed on him concerning contacts with the media and with foreign citizens. These conditions formed part of the terms for his release from prison at the end of the prison sentence which he had served.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	818	The development of the battlegroups-rapid response elements concept has been an important part of the EU's work in developing capabilities for military peacekeeping operations over the past year.Essentially, the idea is that the Union will have at its disposal a rapidly deployable, robust force that can be deployed in crisis areas for a short period. These units could be deployed at the request of the UN to act as a bridging force, stabilising a crisis situation while the UN establishes a larger, longer-term mission to take over from the EU. They could, for instance, be used to respond to situations similar to the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year when EU troops helped to stabilise the situation there following a request by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.The rapid deployment of an EU mission in that country, to which Ireland contributed headquarters personnel, helped save lives and provided space for a UN force to be prepared. Kofi Annan, in his appearance before the National Forum on Europe during his recent visit to Ireland, welcomed the development of EU rapid response capabilities. He noted in particular the important role that regional organisations such as the EU can play in supporting the UN in crisis management and peacekeeping operations.From an operational perspective, the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday adopted a declaration which foresees that the EU will have battlegroups-rapid response elements at its disposal from 2005. Initially, there will be one battlegroup on stand-by from that date, ready to deploy within ten days of a Council decision to launch an operation. From 2007, it is envisaged that two battlegroups will be on stand-by at any one time. This will contribute significantly to the EU's ability to respond speedily to rapid-onset crises, particularly in Africa.As the Minister for Defence has already outlined to the House, the Government has examined the issue of participation in battlegroups-rapid response elements. We have agreed to consult further with partners on the possibility of Ireland's participation in rapid response elements. The Government will make a final decision based on these consultations and on a detailed analysis of the implications involved.

The opening of diplomatic relations with new states is kept under constant review.As indicated in the context of the Estimate announcements on 18 November, I hope to be in a position to go to the Government in the near future with proposals for extending our range of diplomatic missions, especially into new member states of the EU where we have not yet established an embassy and also to Bulgaria and Romania. Opening missions in these countries will allow us to take advantage of the very positive profile built up during our Presidency. The aim will be to deliver real added value for the country across all areas, including the further growth of our trade and economic links.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	820	Article III-296 of the European Constitution provides that the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be assisted by a European external action service. This service shall work in co-operation with the diplomatic services of the member states and shall comprise officials from relevant departments of the General Secretariat of the Council and the Commission as well as staff seconded from national diplomatic services of the member states.The organisation and functioning of the service are to be established by the Council, acting by QMV, on a proposal by the Union Foreign Minister and with the consent of the Commission.While the service cannot be established until after entry into force of the European Constitution, for which the target date of 1 November 2006 has been set, a declaration of the Intergovernmental Conference states that, following signature of the European Constitution, which took place on 29 October, the Secretary-General-High Representative, Javier Solana, the Commission and the member states are to begin preparatory work on the service. There have already been some informal discussions and contacts and we look forward to proposals on how preparatory work is to be structured.Inevitably, the establishment and development of the new service will involve complex organisational issues. Ireland will wish to ensure that it is properly equipped and organised to fulfil its mandate of assisting the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs and that it properly reflects the dual role of the Minister vis-à-vis both the Commission and the Council. We will also want to ensure that the member states collectively, and individual member states, are fully involved in preparatory work and that there is transparency and equity as regards the staffing of the service and access to the information generated by it.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	821	Ireland and the European Union are very concerned at the conduct of the parliamentary elections held on 17 October in Belarus. We believe that the elections were not conducted in a free and fair manner and we cannot, therefore, have confidence that the results truly reflect the will of the people of Belarus. We regret that an opportunity for Belarus to move closer to European values was missed.The referendum outcome changed the state constitution to allow the President, at the next presidential elections in 2006, to seek to remain in power for a third term of office. There will be no representatives of opposition political parties in the new Parliament in Belarus. It now seems likely that President Lukashenko will remain in power for the foreseeable future. This does not bode well for any possible future democratic reform.In its declaration of 20 October, the European Union expressed deep disappointment at the conduct of the elections and said that it fully agreed with the conclusions of the OSCE monitoring mission. The OSCE mission found that the elections fell significantly short of OSCE commitments for democratic elections and that democratic principles were largely disregarded by the authorities. In its declaration the EU underlined its regret that the Belorussian authorities did not seize the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to standards to which Belarus freely subscribed when it became an OSCE participating state. Importantly, the European Union confirmed that support will continue to be extended to all remaining democratic forces in Belarus.Ireland favours a strengthening of contacts with civil society in Belarus with a view to encouraging and supporting democratic reform at the grass-roots level. However, great care must be taken to ensure that EU support does not inadvertently contribute to further repression of civil society and opposition forces.Dáil Éireann is well aware that Ireland is among the states which have taken a lead in rendering humanitarian aid to Belorussian children in order to relieve the after-effects of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and it is familiar with the exceptional work of the Chernobyl Children's Project. In this context, the Government is concerned about the implications of an announcement by President Lukashenko on 17 November that regulations relating to children travelling abroad for medical treatment and recuperation are to be tightened up considerably, so that each permission to travel will require the approval of the Belarus minister for education. It appears a similar tightening up will apply in respect of adoptions.In the discussion of Belarus at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 22 November, I raised the new regulations. I pointed out in particular that, if implemented, they would add a new and worrying dimension to the isolation of Belarus from the rest of Europe. I also asked Secretary General-High Representative Solana and his ministerial colleagues to share any information that might come to light in order to assist Ireland's efforts to clarify what exactly the new regulations will involve in practice. I emphasised that this is an issue which Ireland would wish to see pursued by the EU with the Belorussian authorities on humanitarian grounds with a view to encouraging them to modify their position. I also recommended that the Chernobyl Children's Project, whose experience and expertise equip it to make a very valuable contribution, should be invited to participate in the workshop which the European Commission is to organise in Lithuania to co-ordinate assistance to Belarus.I and my Department will continue to monitor developments closely, and we are also pursuing it bilaterally with the Belorussian authorities. Ireland believes that Belarus must remain high on the agenda of the European Union and that every opportunity must be taken to raise the issue with Russia, which could play an important role. The European Union remains open to a dialogue with Belarus as soon as the authorities there demonstrate a willingness to respect democratic values and the rule of law.Ireland sent three observers to the elections on 17 October as part of the OSCE election observation mission.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	822	I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 71 together.Wide-ranging sanctions against Libya were imposed by the EU in 1986 and the UN in 1992 in response to evidence of Libyan support for international terrorism. In recent years, Libya has moved to break its links with terrorism and repair its relations with the EU and other countries. In recognition of this, both EU and UN sanctions were suspended in 1999, except for the EU arms embargo, which remained in force. The UN sanctions were finally abolished in September 1999.This positive development of Libyan policy has continued. In December 2003, Libya renounced and began to dismantle its programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction and has agreed to pay significant financial compensation to relatives of those killed in terrorist attacks which it had supported. Against this background, the EU decided at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in October to lift the last element of the former sanctions regime, the EU arms embargo. The EU's code of conduct on arms sales will continue to apply to the supply of military equipment to Libya.Ireland is in favour of engaging with Libya and encouraging it to continue on the more positive path it has adopted. The EU still has concerns in relation to Libya, especially in the field of human rights. A key issue is the case of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical workers convicted and sentenced to death in relation to the infection of children in Benghazi with HIV. The October GAERC conclusions made it clear that the EU looked to the Libyan authorities for early action in this case.

My officials have arranged to meet with the British authorities in London on 1 December to discuss this case and the broader issues of concern to which it gives rise.With regard to the more general question as to the operation and future of the Terrorism Act 2000, the Deputy is aware that the Act allows for all travellers from any country entering the UK to be stopped, searched and examined. The Government understands the necessity for governments, including the British Government, to deal effectively with the threat of terrorism. At the same time, we are concerned that the application of provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000, such as the powers relating to airport and border controls, should be applied sensitively and in such a way that they do not cause undue inconvenience or embarrassment to travellers or discriminate against persons travelling between the two islands. The matter is the subject of regular discussions with the British side.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	824	The task force on policy regarding emigrants contained many detailed recommendations whose implementation can best be brought about on a phased basis. Considerable progress has already been made with action under way on over two thirds of its recommendations. Overall policy is now, as recommended by the task force, the responsibility of my Department and a dedicated unit has been established to drive forward progress in this important area.I am delighted that the funds available to emigrant services will once again rise substantially next year. The Estimates for Public Services include an overall allocation of €8.267 million to support our emigrants in 2005. This is a doubling of the 2004 Estimates figure. Even allowing for the additional funding which was made available to emigrant services in late 2004, this figure of €8.267 million represents an overall increase of 63%.This very substantial increase in funding reflects the strength of the Government's commitment to our emigrant communities. Funding is directed to the voluntary organisations that provide critical services to our vulnerable emigrants. These organisations are active in the areas identified by the task force including pre-departure services and front-line advice and counselling to our community living abroad. A particular priority continues to be to reach the most vulnerable Irish abroad such as our older community, Irish travellers and the undocumented Irish people in the United States.An important policy initiative to facilitate the Government's efforts and relationship with Irish communities abroad has been the creation of the Irish abroad unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am delighted to note that its establishment has been warmly welcomed by our partners in the voluntary sector.As the task force makes clear, the needs of our emigrant community can best be met by a collective effort that involves statutory and non-statutory agencies. Officials of the dedicated unit are active on the ground in developing contacts with the full range of partners involved in this collective effort. They have to date had meetings with Departments and agencies involved in the provision of services to emigrants in Ireland. Members of the unit have also had meetings with organisations which provide front line services to Irish people in the USA, London, Birmingham and Coventry. Further meetings are being planned in London and Lancashire before Christmas. The development and maintenance of such contacts by the dedicated unit provide the voluntary organisations engaged in the provision of emigrant services with an effective channel of communication to the Government.The activity of the dedicated unit is already injecting a fresh momentum to drive forward progress on all of the critically important areas identified by the task force. In this way we can ensure that the needs of our emigrants continue to be accorded the highest priority and that our response to their needs is effective and is developed further in the period ahead.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	825	The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for two Votes, Vote 28 — Foreign Affairs and Vote 29 — International Co-operation. The Estimates for Public Services in 2005 which were published last week include a total provision of €166 million for Vote 28 and €460 million for Vote 29. I am extremely pleased at the increased funding made available for both these Votes.Included in the allocation for Vote 28 is a very substantial increase in the funding for emigrant services, bringing the total amount allocated for emigrants in 2005 to €8.2 million, more than a doubling of the allocation for last year. This very substantial increase reflects the strength of the Government's commitment to our emigrant communities. This commitment is both immediate and long-term and will be built on progressively over the coming years: funding of €19 million to complete work on and to sustain one of the most advanced passport services in the world. Before the end of this year we will produce a new machine- readable passport, capable of incorporating biometric information. The new passport will be produced using the latest technologies and will enable us to meet the highest international standard for travel documentation: an additional €4 million earmarked for the development of our visa system to the highest international standards. Underpinning the development of the new passport and visa services will be the continued upgrading of our telecommunications links: a contribution of €250,000 in 2005 —€1 million over four years — to the European Investment Bank Facility for the Euro- Mediterranean Investment and Partnership, FEMIP, trust fund. This fund has been established by EU member states and the Mediterranean partner countries as part of the process to help meet the challenges of economic and social modernisation and enhanced regional integration in the partner countries: a provision of €150,000 for information material on the European Constitution.While no decision has been made on when a referendum will be held, we expect to publish a White Paper and possibly other information materials in 2005.The allocation to Vote 29 next year is €460 million. This represents a large increase of €60 million, or 15% over 2004. Our total ODA commitment in 2005 will reach €535 million when the contributions of other Departments are factored in. This is the highest amount ever allocated in the history of the aid programme, and well above the EU average. A commitment has also been given, as part of a three year programme, that the development aid budget will be increased by an additional €65 million in 2006 and by another €65 million in 2007.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	826	The Government's programme of assistance to developing countries is broad-based. It has the capacity to deepen and broaden its bilateral engagement, its co-operative arrangements with the United Nations and EU and its partnership with international and Irish non-governmental organisations, NGOs.The recently announced increases of €190 million to the overseas aid budget over the next three years will push total spending on aid close to €1.8 billion between 2005 and 2007. The Irish NGOs are key partners in our programme. This has been recognised since the inception of the Government's aid programme by the volume of assistance that has been channelled through these organisations. In general, non-governmental organisations will have the capacity to absorb increases in funding from the programme as it expands over the coming three years and I am confident they will put such funding to effective use.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	827	The Government attaches priority to implementing the range of sectoral actions and targets which make up the Lisbon Agenda. The Lisbon Agenda covers a wide range of matters which fall within the responsibility of individual Departments. The Department of the Taoiseach has overall responsibility for co-ordinating Ireland's approach. The Government ensures ongoing consultation with the social partners to build consensus on the approach required for effective implementation of the Lisbon Agenda. This is in line with the commitment secured from all member states at the spring European Council during our Presidency to build partnerships for reform involving the social partners.At European level, the focus is on preparing for the mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda at the European Council in March next year. During our Presidency, the European Council asked the European Commission to establish a high-level group, chaired by Mr. Wim Kok, the former Netherlands Prime Minister, to prepare an independent assessment of progress to date on the Lisbon Agenda and to make recommendations for future action. The group presented its report on 3 November and its recommendations were discussed by the European Council on 4 and 5 November. It was agreed that the Commission should have regard to the report and to the views of member states when preparing proposals for the mid-term review. The General Affairs and External Relations Council, drawing on the work of a number of other Council formations, will have responsibility for preparing discussions on the mid-term review at the European Council next March.In the context of the mid-term review, Ireland has already made a national submission setting out our experience in this area as well as a number of recommendations for future action. The March European Council will be critical in giving renewed impetus to the Lisbon Agenda.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	828	I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 146 together.The Book of Estimates provides for an increase of €60 million in Government spending on official development assistance in 2005. This will bring total Government aid to the developing world next year to €535 million, which is an all-time record. In addition, the Government has agreed to make increases of €65 million in each of the years 2006 and 2007. This means a total €1.8 billion will be spent by Ireland on development assistance over the coming three years. This is a remarkable package of increases by any standards. It places Ireland among the world's leading aid donors.To put the package in context, the following are the overseas development aid outturn figures for the period since 1998: 1998, €177 million; 1999, €231 million; 2000, €254 million; 2001, €320 million; 2002, €422 million; and 2003, €446 million. These figures compare very favourably with the outturn in the years up to that period: 1995, €123 million; 1996, €142 million; and 1997 €158 million.Ireland's contribution will be welcomed by all who are concerned about the developing world. I welcome especially the return to a multi-annual commitment. This aspect of the package ensures predictability for my Department and for our non-governmental organisation partners. It provides a sound basis on which to carry out the long-term planning which is so important for development work. The increases come at a time when there are many competing demands on the Exchequer and are an indication of the commitment of the Government to help the poorest people in the world. Overseas development aid has increased steadily over the past seven years and the latest increases ensure continued strong growth towards the UN target.The additional funding will facilitate the expansion of the development co-operation programme and consideration of new innovative measures. The Government intends to conduct a broad consultative process over the next year, which will lead to the preparation of a White Paper for Government on development co-operation policy by the end of 2005 or early 2006. Other areas where the increased funding will help to make a greater contribution include the fight against the HIV-AIDS pandemic which will continue to be a major item in our programme. Over 40 million people are living with HIV-AIDS worldwide, more than two thirds of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. Current spending in this area amounts to approximately €50 million but will increase in 2005. Vietnam will become Ireland's eighth programme country with the opening of a mission and the establishment of a full development programme. The neighbouring countries of Laos and Cambodia will also receive assistance from this programme. A new development office will open shortly in Sierra Leone which will also provide some assistance to Liberia.Ireland will continue to give priority to our existing programme countries of Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Timor Leste. We provide a significant amount of dedicated funding for non-governmental organisations working in the development field. Support is provided on a multi-annual basis to five such organisations. These are Concern, Trócaire, GOAL, Self Help and Christian Aid. In addition, we provide funding to non-governmental organisations in a number of other areas of the programme including emergency, recovery, HIV-AIDS and human rights activities. Total funding to non-governmental organisations is likely to exceed €100 million in 2005.Irish people have been extraordinarily generous to people in developing countries over the years. Over the next few years, the Government will seek by way of different grant schemes to support this crucially important grassroots activity and encourage further a spirit of volunteerism. We will continue to provide funding in response to emergency humanitarian crises internationally, whether natural disasters or man-made emergencies. With the large increases announced in funding for development co-operation, the Government has demonstrated the profound importance it attaches to this area. We are achieving real impacts with our aid programme and helping to save many lives in Africa and elsewhere. The Government will continue to give the utmost priority to this crucial aspect of our foreign policy.

This embargo forbids trade in arms and related material of all types, such as weapons, ammunition, military vehicles and equipment. Deputies will recall that the European Council on 12 December 2003 invited the General Affairs and External Relations Council, or GAERC, to re-examine the question of the EU arms embargo on China. Initial discussion at the GAERC took place on 26 January 2004, when it was agreed to invite the permanent representatives' committee, COREPER, and the political and security committee, PSC, to look into the matter. The issue was further reviewed at the GAERC in April and again in October, where it was decided that the preparatory work should continue to allow all technical issues surrounding it to be fully examined.The issue was again discussed by the GAERC on Monday last in the context of preparation of the EU-China summit, which will take place on 8 December 2004. Ministers agreed that the EU was ready to give a positive signal to China on lifting the embargo. However, work must be completed on strengthening the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which sets out criteria governing all arms exports from the EU. In addition, the Union hopes for a further demonstration by the Chinese authorities of their good intentions on human rights. The Government will continue to examine this question with its EU partners in view of our overall relationship with China, our ongoing commitment to human rights and the broader regional and international context. The intention to adopt this approach has been conveyed to the Chinese authorities, most recently during talks with Vice-Premier Huang Ju on 16 November 2004, and by the Taoiseach during his discussions with Premier Wen when they met on the margins of the ASEM summit in Hanoi on 9 October 2004.

The Government avails of every opportunity to encourage the Government of Indonesia to strengthen its efforts to address the legitimate concerns of the people of Papua. In this regard, I welcome the commitment expressed by President Yudhoyono of Indonesia, prior to his election in September, to implement the special autonomy law for Papua. The law dates from November 2001 but has not yet been implemented. It provides for a greater degree of autonomy for Papua than for Indonesia's other provinces.My predecessor met with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Noor Hassan Wirajuda, on the margins of the UN General Assembly, on 23 September 2004. Deputy Cowen used the occasion to express Ireland's continuing concerns on the situation in Papua. These concerns had previously been raised with Minister Wirajuda in April 2004 during an EU Troika meeting and again in January 2003 on the occasion of the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers' meeting. Minister Wirajuda took note of our concerns, and expressed his belief that the special autonomy law will satisfy the aspirations of the overwhelming majority of the people in Papua. He said autonomy remains the settled policy of the Government of Indonesia. My predecessor made it clear that we would carefully monitor the situation in this regard.The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council of 11 October 2004 adopted conclusions on Indonesia which reiterated the EU's respect for the territorial integrity of the Republic of Indonesia and welcomed President-elect Yudhoyono's intention to implement the special autonomy law for Papua. Officials of my Department regularly discuss the situation in Papua with their counterparts from Indonesia and representatives of various Papuan non-governmental organisations and third countries such as Australia and the United States of America. Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to support the development of a strengthened partnership and effective dialogue between the EU and Indonesia. As I have said, the Government sees this as the most effective framework at this time to address our concerns about the situation in Papua.

The European Council adopted a declaration on Iraq which underlined EU support for the Iraqi Government and Iraqi reconstruction.The declaration included a package of EU assistance measures for Iraq. These include, inter alia, political support for the interim Iraqi Government, financial and practical assistance for the preparation of the Iraqi elections in January, substantial assistance for reconstruction work in Iraq focusing on basic services and humanitarian work and the preparation of a policing and rule-of-law assistance action to help rebuild and reform the Iraqi criminal justice system. The full text of the declaration is attached as an annexe to the Council conclusions.

It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the matter until the investigation has been completed and the complainant notified of the outcome.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 92 together.As the Deputy will be aware, the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel 1994 applies to UN personnel on defined UN operations and "associated personnel" who are personnel provided with the agreement of the UN by Governments, intergovernmental organisations or humanitarian non-governmental organisations to assist in the fulfilment of the mandate of such UN operations. The convention obliges states parties to take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety and security of UN and associated personnel and to protect them from murder, kidnapping or other attack. It also requires states parties to punish the perpetrators of such attacks and to co-operate with one another in any criminal proceedings.There are two important points which arise in relation to the convention. First, to date only 77 states have become party to it while several states in which aid workers are present, including Afghanistan and Iraq, have not done so. Ireland and its EU partners have consistently called upon all states to become party to the convention. Second, a number of weaknesses have been identified in the legal regime created by the convention. In this regard, I refer the Deputy to my reply to a parliamentary question, reference 26752/04, of 28 October 2004 in which I informed him of the negotiations which have been ongoing in the sixth legal affairs committee of the United Nations General Assembly since 2001. The negotiations involve the strengthening of the legal protections offered under the convention. I am pleased to report that in a number of meetings of the sixth committee held last month significant progress was made. The basic text of a draft optional protocol to strengthen the convention was agreed. A further meeting will be held in April 2005 in which UN member states will discuss whether the term "United Nations operation" in Article 1 of the convention should be widened by the optional protocol to cover all UN operations established "for the purposes of delivering humanitarian, political or development assistance". It should be noted that while Ireland and its EU partners favour this proposal, several other delegations have proposed more restrictive wording.On 17 November, the sixth committee recommended that the UN General Assembly adopt a draft resolution on the safety of UN and associated personnel. The resolution will urge states to take all necessary measures, in accordance with their international obligations, to prevent crimes against such persons and ensure that the offences do not go unpunished and that the perpetrators are brought to justice.

Such cases have also been raised in the context of the ongoing implementation of the EU-Lebanon Association Agreement and its relevant provisions in this area. I have asked the Irish Embassy in Cairo, which is accredited to Lebanon, to inquire as to the background to the particular cases raised, and I will communicate further with the Deputy when information is received.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	835	I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 148 together.The Democratic Republic of the Congo peace process remains largely on track, although recent events, such as the assault and capture of the town of Bukavu in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo by rebel forces last June, underlined the fragility of the transition process established under the Sun City peace accords of 2002. There is a need for accelerated progress in implementing the transition if the target of national elections in 2005 is to be met and lasting peace and security are to be achieved in the country and in the wider Great Lakes region.Recent positive developments at regional level included the initial Summit of the International Conference on the Great Lakes, held in Dar-Es-Salaam on 19 and 20 November, attended by the leaders of 11 countries in the region, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Agreement was reached at the summit on a declaration of principles which will be elaborated into a series of protocols constituting an overall regional peace and stability pact. It is hoped these will be adopted at a second summit, to be held in Nairobi in 2005. The Great Lakes conference process will build on and provide a framework for a number of earlier regional peace initiatives, including the tripartite commission which the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda agreed to establish in Kampala on 26 October 2004. This includes the joint border verification mechanism which the Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda agreed to establish last June.The Great Lakes conference was organised under the auspices of the UN and the African Union and fully supported by the EU. The EU's special representative for the Great Lakes has been actively engaged throughout the preparatory process. Ireland and other EU member states have also participated in the conference process through involvement with the Group of Friends of the Great Lakes support group. Ireland has contributed €200,000 towards the costs of holding the conference.Under the provisions of the Sun City accords signed in 2003, national elections are scheduled to take place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in June 2005, at the end of the two year transition period. There is, however, provision under the accords for these elections to be deferred, if necessary, for a maximum period of up to one year. In line with the overall need for greater progress in implementing the transition process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a number of necessary legislative changes still remain outstanding. These must be finalised soon if the desired goal of national elections in June 2005 is to be achieved. In particular, nationality and electoral laws still wait to be finalised by the transitional national assembly. Consideration has also begun of a draft constitution, due to be submitted to a referendum in early 2005. Decisions are also necessary regarding compilation of an electoral register and whether it is feasible for a national census to be carried out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in advance of any election.Greater progress will also need to be achieved as regards security sector reform, if the appropriate secure environment is to be created in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the holding of national elections in 2005. In particular, the process of creating integrated national army and police forces needs to be accelerated and a viable start made to disarming, demobilising and rehabilitating the estimated 300,000 combatants who still carry arms. The EU is actively supporting the process of security sector reform in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including the establishment of an integrated police unit in Kinshasa. Further support in training integrated army brigades and police is also being considered. Ireland has contributed €75,000 towards the costs of establishment of the integrated police unit. The EU also provides substantial financial support for the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.MONUC, the UN peacekeeping mission, plays a critical role in all aspects of the transition process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including security sector reform and creating a secure environment for the holding of elections. In response to proposals from the UN Secretary General, both the strength and mandate of MONUC have recently been extended. This will enable it to focus more on essential tasks such as supporting the transition process and improving the security situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Resolution 1565, adopted by the UN Security Council on 1 October 2004, provides for an increase of 5,900 in MONUC's strength. These additional measures are being used to provide an extra battalion in the troubled Kivus region and also a rapid reaction capability. MONUC will also chair a newly established joint commission to oversee the electoral process. The EU has made clear its willingness to assist the UN in the reinforcement of MONUC's capabilities to enable it to carry out its essential tasks.The overall costs of holding elections as scheduled in 2005 will be substantial, with some estimates ranging as high as $300 million. Donor support for and confidence in the electoral process will therefore be crucial. The EU is committed to supporting the 2005 electoral process and the European Commission has already pledged to provide some €85 million in assistance. Consideration will be given to a possible contribution by Ireland in support of the electoral process. A decision will also be taken closer to the elections as to whether the EU will participate in an electoral observer mission there, which Ireland would strongly support.

Officials of my Department regularly discuss the situation there with their colleagues, and representatives of concerned non-governmental organisations.Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, and has, from that time, recognised Tibet as an integral part of China. Tibet regularly features in our discussions within the EU, at EU-China meetings, and in our bilateral meetings. I raised the issue of Tibet and recent developments during the official talks with the Chinese Vice-Premier, Mr. Huang Ju, in Dublin on 16 November. In response, the Chinese Vice-Premier said that the channels of communications between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama were open. Tibetan delegations had visited China since 2002 and met with their relatives. China continues to work to ensure peace and development in Tibet.At EU level, Ireland, together with our EU partners, encourages the continuation of the dialogue between the Chinese authorities and representatives of the Dalai Lama. In this regard, I welcome the statement issued on 10 March 2004 by the Dalai Lama, in which he expressed the hope that there might soon be a significant breakthrough in relations with the Chinese Government. He also said he has instructed his envoys to continue the process of dialogue with Beijing at an early date. I am pleased that representatives of the Dalai Lama met with the Chinese authorities in Beijing from 12 to 29 September 2004. Previous meetings between China and Tibetan envoys took place in September 2002 and May and June 2003. This third meeting was generally characterised as positive by Mr. Lodi Gyari, the special envoy of the Dalai Lama. For the first time there was a substantive discussion between Chinese and Tibetan representatives on major, sometimes fundamental differences, including the issue of the delimitation of Tibet and the scope of autonomy. It is understood that there may be a further round of talks in February 2005.Following this meeting, the EU Presidency issued a declaration. The General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 October 2004 emphasised, in its conclusions on the EU-China dialogue on human rights, the importance of the protection of minority rights in Tibet. Ireland, and its EU partners, hope that this latest round of talks will encourage further meaningful and direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama's representatives, leading to a peaceful and sustainable solution for Tibet.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	837	There are few sources of reliable and independent information concerning the nature of the nuclear programme in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The most reliable source of information about a country's nuclear activities is the International Atomic Energy Agency which has the responsibility for carrying out inspections under the safeguards agreements, mandatory for states party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Such an agreement entered into force for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in April 1992 but the International Atomic Energy Agency was never permitted to verify that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's initial declaration of nuclear material subject to safeguards was correct and complete.From November 1994 to December 2002, however, the agency was able to monitor the freeze of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's graphite moderated reactor and related facilities as requested by the UN Security Council and as foreseen in the US-the Democratic People's Republic of Korea agreed framework of 1994. On 31 December 2002, agency inspectors had to leave at the request of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea following its decision to terminate this freeze on its nuclear facilities. Since then, the agency has been unable to draw any conclusions regarding the nuclear activities in that country.In January 2003 the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced its withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors in a resolution of February 2003 confirmed that the agency's safeguards agreement with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea remained binding and in force. The board called upon the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to remedy its non-compliance urgently by taking all steps deemed necessary by the agency to this end.At the International Atomic Energy Agency general conference in September 2004, a further resolution noted with concern the statements of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea declaring its intention to build up a nuclear deterrent force and its announcement in October 2003 that it had completed the reprocessing of over 8,000 spent fuel rods. The resolution urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to reconsider those actions and announcements that ran counter to its international non-proliferation obligations and to completely dismantle any nuclear weapons programme in a prompt, transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner.At this general conference meeting, the EU expressed concerns that the International Atomic Energy Agency had not been able to carry out its verification activities and was not in a position to confirm that nuclear material had not been diverted to non-peaceful uses. The EU commended the efforts of the agency to seek dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to find a solution for the implementation of safeguards. The EU urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to come unconditionally into full compliance with all its relevant international commitments. The EU also called for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's compliance with its safeguards agreement by allowing the re-establishment of the required containment and surveillance measures at its nuclear facilities and the full implementation of all the required safeguard measures, including the return of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.The issue of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclear programme is also being addressed within the framework of the six-party talks process involving China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States. While not directly involved in these talks, the EU has welcomed this ongoing multilateral process and made clear its firm support for the resolution of the situation by peaceful means. We have availed of every opportunity to confirm the EU's willingness to contribute to these international efforts and have indicated our readiness to consider enhanced co-operation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea if the present difficult situation can be resolved in a satisfactory manner.An EU Troika, at official level, visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from 13 to 16 November 2004, and held talks with senior Korean officials. The question of the six party talks was among issues discussed, and the EU side urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to re-engage as soon as possible in the six-party talks. However, the Korean side replied that it was not willing to return to the talks so long as the United States maintains its "hostile" attitude to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The EU side persisted in encouraging the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to re-engage. The talks also covered human rights, the question of EU-Democratic People's Republic of Korea relations, humanitarian assistance, economic reforms and inter-Korean relations.

In the past, the accession of new members has been based on pragmatic procedures adapted to the particular case under consideration. Unanimity is the general rule. The OECD is engaged in a fundamental review of the organisation. One issue being considered in this context is the future process of enlargement.As a member of the OECD since its foundation in 1961, Ireland supported the accession of the ten members which have joined subsequently, including four of the ten new EU member states. Pending the completion of the reflection on future enlargement in the context of the review referred to, the question of formally considering applications for membership does not arise.However, almost all of the new EU member states that are not already member countries of the OECD participate as observers in many of its subsidiary bodies and committees. Such observer status allows them, as well as other prospective members, to familiarise themselves with the OECD's working methods and to prepare for membership.Ireland has consistently supported the participation of new EU member states as observers in the activities of the OECD. Equally, we have made clear that we strongly support membership of the organisation for those of our new EU partners that wish to join. The OECD's preparatory work would, of course, need to be completed and applicants would be expected to be able to meet the accession requirements in place at the time of accession. For our part, we are working towards an early resolution of all the issues arising in the context of the preparatory work.There has been no formal accession procedure under way since the Slovak Republic acceded in 2000. Pending the completion of the review referred to, the question of a vote or a veto on an application for future membership has not arisen.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	839	Croatia has made substantial progress in the adoption and implementation of reforms in recent years. It concluded a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in 2001 and applied for membership in February 2003. At the request of the Council, the Commission presented its opinion on the application in April 2004. It assessed Croatia's performance against the criteria for EU membership which were set out for candidate countries by the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993, and the reforms required under the EU's stabilisation and association process for the countries of the western Balkans. The Copenhagen criteria require a candidate country to achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy, and the ability to take on the obligations of membership. On the basis of a positive assessment of Croatia's progress, the Commission recommended the opening of accession negotiations.On 18 June the European Council in Brussels agreed that Croatia meets the Copenhagen political criteria. It decided that Croatia is a candidate country for membership and that the accession process should be launched. The European Council decided to convene a bilateral intergovernmental conference with Croatia early in 2005 in order to begin negotiations. The negotiations will be based on Croatia's own merits and the pace of progress will depend solely on the fulfilment of the requirements for membership. The European Council also emphasised that Croatia needs to maintain full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and to make additional efforts on minority rights, refugee returns, reform of the judiciary, regional co-operation and the fight against corruption.The Commission presented its annual strategy paper on the enlargement process on 6 October. It sets out suggested principles for a framework for negotiations with Croatia, for consideration by the Council. I hope that the December European Council meeting will be in a position to agree a precise date for the opening of accession negotiations, followed by a decision by the Council on the negotiating framework.

The report contains an overview of the human rights situation of individuals and communities in a region, heavily dependent on its natural resource of oil and where there is a heavy presence of multinational corporations. Amnesty International also examines the role of the Nigerian Federal Government in the region. Amnesty International points to grievances against the federal government and multinational corporations as one of the reasons for continued violence in the region. In the report, Amnesty International urges the Nigerian Government to ensure that all law enforcement agencies respect human rights; that environmental protection legislation is put in place and enforced; and that mechanisms of redress of violations of both civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are in place.Recently, developments in the Niger Delta, which produces most of the approximately 2.5 million barrels of crude oil exported from Nigeria on a daily basis, led to warnings in the international media that long-standing tensions in the region could escalate into widespread violent unrest and disrupt the Nigerian oil and gas production. The revenues generated by the activities of multinational oil and gas companies, operating in the Niger Delta in joint ventures with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, account for roughly 85% of the Federal Government revenues. Unfortunately, the enormous generation of wealth in the region is accompanied by structural socio-economic underdevelopment, few educational and employment opportunities, and violence and insecurity.The situation in the Niger Delta region is a complex one as it is an area with much inter-tribal violence, criminality and siphoning of oil. Local governance issues also need to be resolved. The Nigerian Federal Government has taken a positive approach in its attempts to resolve the issues in the region, by increasing funding to local governmental institutions and promoting transparency and increased environmental protection. Unfortunately, problems with local governance persist.The regional security situation again deteriorated on 28 September last, when the Niger Delta Peoples' Volunteer Force warned all foreign oil workers to leave their production facilities by 1 October or risk attack. Following talks, an understanding was reached between the militias and the Nigerian Federal Government on 4 October, with the government promising further talks as well as structural development. The unrest subsided but rivalry between groups continues.The Government remains concerned by the situation in Nigeria. EU embassies in Nigeria visited the region last month to speak to the government, politicians and other local actors there, including the oil industry. They expressed our deep concern regarding the situation and the urgent need to promote human rights and sustainable development in the area. Together with our EU partners we have agreed to continue to monitor the situation in the Niger Delta and to discuss further with the Nigerian Federal and State Governments, ways in which the local communities can be assured that their rights will be safeguarded and that they will benefit from the great resources of the region.Nigeria is the most populous democracy in Africa but 70% of the population live below the poverty line. The high turnout and largely peaceful conduct of the elections held in 2003 marked a further important step towards the consolidation of that democracy. However, there is still some way to go. An EU election observation mission, including two Irish observers, monitored the presidential, parliamentary and other elections and regrettably noted some grave irregularities in the voting processes in some states. On 14 May 2003, the EU issued a declaration on the elections which expressed concern at the findings of the observation mission and which urged President Obasanjo to use his mandate to improve the quality of democracy and accountability in Nigeria.In 2002, the EU adopted a Common Position on Nigeria, which was updated by Council Conclusions approved last November. A key element of the EU's position is to maintain a constructive and regular political dialogue with Nigeria. The Irish Presidency of the EU was the first to initiate EU-Nigeria political dialogue at ministerial level. The former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, led an EU Troika which addressed a range of issues including peace and security, governance and development matters. Ireland acknowledges and appreciates the strong leadership role President Obasanjo has played, not only in defusing recent tensions in his own country, but in facilitating the peace process in Liberia and the ongoing peace talks in Abuja on Darfur under Nigeria's current chairmanship of the African Union. Ireland and the EU continue to support and encourage Nigeria's transition to democracy and look forward to maintaining our strong relationship with a most important partner in Africa.

The principal exports were cork and wood manufactures, beverages, cereal and cereal preparations. The principal imports were vegetables, fruit, tobacco and tobacco manufactures.The EU is Cuba's largest trading partner, accounting for approximately 35% of the country's exports and approximately 40% of its imports in 2002. In the following year, 2003, EU exports to Cuba were valued at €1,069 million, while imports from Cuba were valued at €546 million. The main products imported into the EU from Cuba were tobacco and tobacco products, fish products, fruit and sugar. EU exports to Cuba included machinery, motor vehicles and parts, wheat and flour, plastics and various industrial products.The Government, in common with our partners in the EU, believes that the US economic embargo on Cuba seriously hampers the economic development of Cuba and negatively affects all of its people. We reject unilateral measures against Cuba which are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade. On 28 October 2004 in the United Nations General Assembly, Ireland and our EU partners again voted in favour of the annual Cuban-tabled resolution, the Necessity of Ending the Economic, Commercial and Financial Embargo Imposed by the United States of America against Cuba.

Negotiations will be concluded on the same basis and principles which applied to the ten new member states which acceded on 1 May 2004.On 6 October 2004, the European Commission published its annual report on progress towards the EU accession of Bulgaria, as well as an overall strategy paper on progress in the enlargement process. The Commission makes clear in its report that Bulgaria has made good progress this year in its preparations for EU accession. Bulgaria informally concluded its accession negotiations during the Irish EU Presidency in June 2004. The formal conclusion of negotiations with both Bulgaria and Romania is on the agenda of the European Council in December and the Council should be in a position to take a positive decision.

Dr. Reiss and I have spoken on a number of occasions when I have briefed him on developments in the process on an ongoing basis, including the current intensive round of talks between the two Governments and the parties focusing on the outstanding issues. I have updated Dr. Reiss on the Government's position, in particular our commitment to working closely with all those involved with a view to securing the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement at an early date. I look forward to further discussions with Dr. Reiss in the near future.The US has always been a firm and loyal friend of the peace process, which is deeply appreciated by the Government. As the Taoiseach reiterated in his recent message of congratulations toPresident Bush on his re-election, this support is a source of great encouragement as we continue to work together to ensure that the Agreement is implemented in full. This engagement will continue on an ongoing basis with the US State Department and the White House.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	844	The solidarity clause and so-called mutual defence clause are separate issues in the European constitution. The Solidarity Clause, Article I - 43, is for each member state to determine how to respond to a request from another member state in case of terrorist attack or natural or man-made disaster. No member state is bound to take any particular course of action. The European constitution also contains a declaration on the solidarity clause, which clearly states that none of the provisions of the solidarity clause are intended to affect the right of another member state to choose the most appropriate means to comply with its own solidarity obligation towards another member state. Any decisions having military implications under the solidarity clause would be taken by unanimity. The Government has welcomed and supported this provision which is fully consistent with our traditional policy of military neutrality.Under the mutual defence clause, Article I - 41.7 of the treaty, the European constitution states that if a member state is a victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other member states will have a obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. Importantly for Ireland, the article makes clear that this obligation shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states.As the Taoiseach and my predecessor have made clear, in the event of another member state coming under attack, we would continue, as we do now, to determine our own response, consistent with our own constitutional and legal arrangements. Ireland is not bound by any mutual defence commitment and the entry into force of the European constitution will not change this. Our traditional policy of military neutrality is not altered or compromised by this article in the constitutional treaty.

Structured co-operation is open to all member states, on the condition that they undertake to enhance their defence capacities through the development of national contributions and subject to participation in a number of areas specified in the European constitution. Member states can indicate their decision to take part in structured co-operation once the European constitution comes into force. Alternatively, member states who decide not to participate immediately can decide to do so at a later date, providing they meet the criteria outlined.Decision-making procedures for structured co-operation are set out in the European constitution. These provide that decisions will be taken by unanimity among the states participating in permanent structured co-operation. The detailed arrangements for the implementation of structured co-operation have yet to be elaborated. Structured co-operation will be possible only upon entry into force of the European constitution, which, subject to national ratification procedures, is envisaged in 2007. The Government will take a decision on whether or not Ireland should participate in structured co-operation in due course, once it becomes clear as to precisely what commitments are involved.

I was honoured to be received by His Holiness Pope John Paul II. I also met with the Secretary of State, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. In both meetings, a number of issues of mutual interest were raised, including the situation in the Middle East following the death of Yasser Arafat, whose funeral I attended in Cairo before travelling to Rome. The question of a possible second papal visit to Ireland was also raised. I assured the Pope that the Government and people of Ireland would warmly welcome such a visit, although I recognise that a decision will not be taken for some time.In my meeting with Cardinal Sodano, we also discussed the agreement reached during Ireland's EU Presidency on the European constitution. A widely welcomed provision of the constitution is the commitment that the Union shall maintain open, transparent and regular dialogue with churches and philosophical and non-confessional organisations. Cardinal Sodano welcomed the intention of the Government to invite all churches and faith communities to join with us in exploring similar arrangements for dialogue in Ireland.As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I look forward to continuing the close diplomatic co-operation between Ireland and the Holy See, based on our shared commitment to the central role of the United Nations in conflict prevention and conflict resolution.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	848	The current crisis in Cote d'Ivoire arose following a decision by the Ivorian Government, led by President Gbagbo, to launch a military offensive at the start of November to retake the rebel-held northern part of the country. This decision came after an announcement by the rebel Forces Nouvelles, FN, on 28 October that they were recalling their members of the coalition government to the territory under their control and also ceasing their participation in the disarmament process, in protest at what they perceived as failure by the Gbagbo Government to honour earlier political reform commitments. The military offensive launched by the Ivorian Government in early November represented a clear and unjustified breach of the ceasefire in effect since May 2003. The actions of the Ivorian government resulted in widespread civilian casualties in the rebel-held areas as well as the deaths of nine French peace-keepers and one US civilian. In retaliation for what France regarded as a premeditated attack against its troops, the French airforce launched strikes which destroyed virtually the entireIvorian airforce.This response provoked widespread rioting and attacks against French citizens and property as well as other non-nationals in Abidjan and other Ivorian cities on 7 and 8 November. It is estimated that approximately 30 people were killed and 900 injured in the violence which ensued. In response to the situation, a number of EU member states, for example UK, Netherlands, Spain and Italy sent either military aircraft or small military contingents to Côte d'Ivoire to assist with the evacuation of their citizens as well as other non-Ivorian nationals wishing to evacuate. Some 5,000 non-Ivorian nationals, including one Irish national, are judged to have been evacuated from Côte d'Ivoire since the present crisis began.The situation in Abidjan and throughout Côte d'Ivoire has stabilised in recent days, though the situation remains extremely tense. Life is described as returning to normal in Abidjan and other major cities while the humanitarian situation in the rebel-held northern part of the country is also slowly improving. However, there is concern over an influx of Ivorian refugees intoLiberia, with the UNHCR estimating that between 5,000 to 10,000 have fled from Côte d'Ivoire into Liberia in recent days.The UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1572 on 15 November which imposes an immediate 13-month arms embargo against Côte d'Ivoire and also provides for the imposition of further sanctions, an assets freeze and travel ban by 15 December, in the event that either the Ivorian Government or the rebel Forces Nouvelles fail to honour in full their various commitments under the Linas-Marcoussis and Accra III peace accords. The council resolution also condemns the government air strikes of 4 and 6 November and demands that all Ivorian parties to the conflict fully comply with the May 2003 ceasefire. The resolution also reiterates the council's full support for the action undertaken by UNOCI, the UN peace-keeping mission in Côte d'Ivoire, and the French forces.The General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed the events in Côte d'Ivoire on Monday and adopted conclusions which, inter alia, called on the relevant Ivorian parties to fulfil without delay all their commitments made in the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and reaffirmed in Accra and making clear that, if they fail to do so, the European Union will apply from 15 December onwards the further sanctions provided for in Resolution 1572. It is clear that there can be no military solution to the problems which face Côte d’Ivoire and that the Ivorian Government and political parties must spare no effort to re-establish political order and security and resume political dialogue. The European Union has also made clear that it fully supports the ongoing mediation efforts being undertaken by the African Union and the sub-regional organisation, ECOWAS, and which offer the best prospect of achieving progress if the 15 December deadline for full implementation of existing political commitments is to be achieved. The clear support offered by the regional AU Summit held in Abuja on 14 November for the imposition of UN sanctions against Côte d’Ivoire in line with those subsequently enacted in Resolution 1572 is particularly to be welcomed.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	849	There are some 15 million people of Kurdishethnic origin living in Turkey. The Government's concerns about the human rights situation in Turkey, including the situation of the Kurdish population, have been raised regularly in official contacts with the Turkish Government and its representatives, and in co-operation with our partners in the European Union.I have been encouraged by the significant progress which Turkey has made in legislating for human rights reform over the past three years. Legislation has been enacted which is aimed at strengthening the enforcement of human rights and enhancing the cultural rights of all citizens, including those of Kurdish origin. The revised accession partnership with Turkey, which was adopted by the Council in May 2003, provides the framework for an intensive dialogue between the European Union and Turkey on Turkey's preparations for accession, including the implementation of its reform programme. Progress on the introduction and implementation of political and human rights reforms is monitored closely in regular political monitoring meetings between the EU and Turkey.The Commission's regular report on Turkey for 2004 includes a comprehensive review of developments in the reform process. The Commission notes Turkey has made substantial progress in its political reform process, including in the areas of minority rights, cultural rights and the protection of minorities. It notes a number of important decisions on cultural rights, which had been raised directly with the Turkish Government earlier in the year by Ireland, as EU Presidency. I welcome the implementation in June of a decision to allow radio and television broadcasts by the state broadcasting corporation in languages and dialects other than Turkish, notably in a number of Kurdish dialects. I also welcome the implementation over recent months of a regulation allowing teaching in languages other than Turkish, which has enabled the organisation of the first private courses in Kurdish. The Commission report comments that there has been a greater tolerance over the past year towards the use of the Kurdish language and the expression of Kurdish culture in different forms.The Commission reports that, overall, the situation in the east and south east of Turkey, where the majority of the Kurdish population live, has continued to improve gradually, both in terms of security and the enjoyment of fundamental freedoms. The state of emergency has been lifted and the return of internally displaced persons has continued, although their situation remains very difficult. The Turkish Government has assured the EU that it is working on plans to promote the economic development of the south east region.I understand that the Turkish Government is committed to ensuring the full implementation of reforms, including those directly relating to the rights of people of Kurdish ethnic origin. Progress on implementation will be a significant element of the decision to be taken by the European Council in December on Turkey's fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria for EU membership. If that decision is positive, the European Council will agree a date for the opening of accession negotiations. In its report and recommendation presented in October, the Commission concluded that, provided certain important legislative changes enter into force, Turkey sufficiently fulfils the political criteria and it recommended that accession negotiations be opened. It noted the irreversibility of the reform process, and its implementation, in particular with regard to fundamental freedoms, will need to be confirmed over a longer period of time. It proposed that the pace of reforms would determine the progress of any accession negotiations, and that the negotiating process would be essential in guiding further reforms in Turkey.The Government has welcomed the Commission's very comprehensive report and recommendation. I hope that the Turkish Government will maintain its efforts in the coming weeks to ensure that the conditions are in place for a positive decision by the European Council, leading to the opening of accession negotiations. I believe this would contribute to the further strengthening of the reform process in Turkey, and to the continued improvement of the situation of theKurdish population.

The study indicates that this would involve significant capital investment and annual operating costs. The report identified this cost at €12 million capital and €4 million revenue for a single helicopter. Additional helicopters could be added with an additional annual cost for each aircraft of over €3 million.Inter-hospital air ambulance services are currently provided to the health boards by the Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard on a request and availability basis. The service is provided subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments. Most patient transfers are airport to airport with onward transfer by land ambulance.My Department and the Department of Defence are currently finalising a service level agreement to formalise arrangements for the future provision of an air ambulance service by the Aer Corps. A significant helicopter fleet replacement programme is being put in place for the Aer Corps. My Department is advised that tenders for six new helicopters have been received and are currently being considered. Each of the new helicopters will have a specific air ambulance capability and will be made available under the terms of the service level agreement.In addition, my Department has met with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources who have confirmed that the Irish Coast Guard will continue to provide services on the same basis as heretofore.My Department is advised that plans are being actively developed within the voluntary sector for the introduction of a dedicated HEMS, primarily in an inter-hospital transfer role and with a view to the service becoming operational in 2005. My Department will closely monitor developments in this regard over the coming months.

This will ensure that all women in the 50 to 64 year old age group in every county have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where required. A capital investment of approximately €20 million has been approved to construct and equip two static clinical units, one in Cork and the other in Galway. This investment will also ensure that mobile units are available to screen women in the relevant age group throughout the country.Detailed planning for the units is progressing as a matter of priority. A design brief will be completed shortly and it is expected that a design team will be in place early next year. The design, construction and commissioning of the units will take approximately two and a half years.Any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her region.

Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter raised and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.The Deputy may wish to note the 200 increase in whole time equivalent terms, 70%, in the number of speech and language therapists employed in the health services between 1997 and 2003.The continued implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body as well as the report of the expert group on various health professions which included new pay scales and career structures, the availability of the fast track working visa scheme and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications are designed to help sustain the improvements in staffing levels achieved for speech and language therapy services, both at local and national level.In addition, as the Deputy may be aware, three new speech and language therapy courses commenced in the 2003-2004 academic year in UCC, NUIG and UL. In total, these courses will provide an additional 75 training places in speech and language therapy. This expansion in training numbers was identified in the Bacon report as necessary to meet the long-term demand-supply balance for speech and language therapists in Ireland.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	864	The cost of extending the medical card scheme would depend on the groups to which eligibility were to be extended and the category of card to be issued. On the basis of a standard medical card, the approximate cost of extending the scheme to 70,000 persons in a full year would be in the region of €70 million. This figure includes the costs of payments to GMS general practitioners, drugs and medicines and fees to pharmacists. There would also be other associated costs with a standard medical card, such as the dental and ophthalmic schemes. On the basis of a doctor visit card, as announced by me in the context of the 2005 Estimates, the approximate cost of an additional 70,000 cards would be in the region of €17.5 million in a full year. These are prospective costings based on the implementation of such changes with effect from 2005 onwards. The estimates above assume no change in existing fee arrangements.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	867	It is necessary to clarify the distinction between e-Government and open source technology. e-Government is about improving efficiencies in service delivery processes, typically involving the innovative use of information and communications technologies, ICTs, and the transformation of operational processes. The action plan for e-Government and progress reports on its implementation are available in the information society policy section of the Department of the Taoiseach website at www.gov.ie/taoiseach.Open source software, OSS, is where the source code of software is made available for use or modification under licence. In many instances, this code is available for free or relatively small fees. There is no necessary interdependence between the two. The Irish public service has recognised the value and importance of OSS and the potential it offers for some considerable time. Consequently, OSS is used quite widely and wherever it makes operational and economic sense in Departments and offices, in areas such as operating systems, desktop productivity tools, etc.In making software choices, the Irish public service operates a procurement policy that facilitates open competition, best value for money and best technological fit to requirements in keeping with public procurement law. Within that approach, different products are evaluated on their merits, including openness in terms of future procurement and, where possible, avoidance of lock-in to a particular supplier. Accordingly, an open view is taken which in practice tends to follow standards emerging from the market. These open standards are critically important to facilitate interconnection of computer systems and exchange of data and information across these systems.Consequently, with respect to the costs of software, consideration is given to the total cost of ownership which, in addition to the licensing element, also includes the issues and costs associated with development, maintenance, customisation, adherence to open standards, etc. In keeping with this, my Department is engaged in ongoing OSS research to enable it to judge the value of new opportunities as they arise in this area. This research indicates that OSS can form part of viable solutions and my Department has so advised public bodies.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	868	Under the decentralisation programme, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is decentralising 384 staff to Cavan town. Today I published two reports submitted to me by the decentralisation implementation group. One of these reports contains details of the organisations-locations which, in the group's view, should be the first to relocate. The contents of this report have now been accepted by Government. Both of these reports are available from the Departments website at  www.finance.gov.ie.The relocation of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to Cavan is not among the first moves. The decentralisation implementation group states in its report that it will submit a further report in spring 2005 containing its recommendations on the remaining moves.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	869	Under the decentralisation programme, 26 jobs are moving to Monaghan town with the Combat Poverty Agency and 85 to Carrickmacross with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. In the case of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in Carrickmacross, there was a total of 74 Civil Service applicants and a further three public servants up to 7 September 2004. There is a total of 34 applications for transfer to Monaghan made up of six public service and 28 Civil Service applications.The figures from the Civil Service are much better than those for the State agencies. Unlike the State agencies, the Civil Service has considerable previous experience of decentralisation and a long tradition of inter-departmental transfers. I see no reason in principle State agencies should have to remain in Dublin. Clearly, there are particular issues that arise in dealing with the State agencies. This was always going to be the case. The correct approach is to tease out the issues and develop good long-term solutions in consultation with all of the parties involved. This approach is being adopted by the Flynn group.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	870	I have no plans to provide for special treatment of crèches under the Valuation Act 2001. This Act maintained the long-standing position that commercial facilities, including child care facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, crèches and Montessori schools, are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other useful services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist. The process could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value, NAV, that is, the rental value of the property. Any ratepayer dissatisfied with the rateability of a property, the valuation assessed on a property or the method of calculation can appeal to the commissioner of valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent valuation tribunal. There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.The core objective of Government policy in the area of child support is to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and benefit all children. In that context, our policy has been to increase child benefit by substantial amounts as the main fiscal instrument through which support will be provided to parents with dependent children. Child benefit provides assistance to all parents in whatever caring choices are most appropriate for them and their children. In addition, unlike tax relief, it provides support to parents irrespective of their income status. We have also undertaken measures to favour the supply of child care by tax incentives to set up facilities, relief from VAT and relief from benefit in kind, BIK, for free or subsidised child care provided by employers.Taken together, these represent substantial measures to assist with the cost of child care. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has overall responsibility for the formulation of national policy on child care. In that context, the establishment of the €449 million equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, for 2000 to 2006, with funding provided by the European Union and the Exchequer under the national development plan, aims to increase the supply of centre-based child care places by 50%, or some 28,400, by the time the programme ends.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	872	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are making arrangements to issue in excess of 2 million tax credit certificates to PAYE taxpayers in the period 10 to 31 January 2005 which will incorporate any changes made in the budget. Similarly, in early January, they will be issuing certificates to employers, by post or electronically, via the revenue on-line service so that the correct tax credits can be applied in the calculation of employee wages or salaries.The PAYE system is a cumulative system and all tax credit certificates automatically apply from 1 January of the year of issue. In these circumstances, no specific provisions are required by the Revenue Commissioners to deal with any refunds which might arise. Any adjustments, including refunds, will be made by employers.

The Government set aside an indicative €200 million under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for broadband infrastructure investment that will, in turn, enable the provision of broadband services regionally by the private sector.Under my Department's regional broadband programme, metropolitan area fibre trunk networks, MANs, are being built in 26 towns and cities, in association with the local authorities. Cavan, Kingscourt, Monaghan and Carrickmacross are included in the current phase of the rollout. In the second phase, MANs will be built in a further 92 towns, including Clones, Castleblaney, Cootehill and Bailieborough. For smaller towns and rural communities, I have introduced the group broadband scheme, under which Government funding of up to 55% is available to assist the community to come together and, with the service providers, to obtain broadband for their area using the technology that best suits the location, such as wireless, satellite or fibre. The timescale for the adapting of telephone exchanges is a matter for Eircom.My Department's website, www.broadband.gov.ie, gives full details of the companies offering broadband in all parts of the country. Full details of the regional broadband programme and the group broadband scheme can be found on my Department’s websites, www.dcmnr.gov.ie and www.gbs.ie.

Arising from this commitment, a number of reports, including the Flynn report, have examined modernisation of the network in order to provide a range of products and introduce service delivery channels which meet consumer needs. In order to show its commitment to post office network, the Government approved an equity injection of €12.7 million for An Post to facilitate the modernisation of the network. The equity injection was paid to the company in 2003.A number of initiatives are underway to implement necessary restructuring of the post office network. Non-automated sub-post offices are being converted to postal agencies offering a limited range of services, namely social welfare payments and purchase of stamps. An Post continues to pursue new business opportunities for the network. Additional business won includes bill paying facilities for the ESB, telephone top-ups through its postpoint service and a contract with the AIB under which the bank's customers can access their accounts through the network. Further opportunities from both the public and private sectors are being actively explored by the company with a view to bringing on stream additional services at the post office counter, wherever possible.I have no plans to introduce a subsidy payment to An Post. The long-term future of the post office network can only be secured by meeting the needs of customers. In this regard, I have asked the Postmasters Union and An Post to work in partnership with a view to securing existing business and to pursuing new business opportunities as they arise. As outlined above, that strategy is being followed with some success by the company.

I observed that when she met my predecessor at the United Nations in New York last September, she indicated that she shared our wish for an early decision and, while emphasising the independence of the courts in Colombia, was hopeful that the appeal would be concluded some time in the autumn.I assure the Deputy that I will continue to monitor this case closely and provide all possible consular assistance to the three men as well as to their families and representatives.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	877	Africa is a continent beset by often seemingly insurmountable problems including conflict, debt, poverty, HIV-AIDS and the abuse of human rights. The European Commission and member states collectively are the largest global donors of development assistance to Africa and the EU is thus in a position to play an important role in helping Africans address the problems of the continent especially in multilateral fora.The EU conducts a process of political dialogue with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries that are party to the Cotonou Agreement. Human rights are a central theme of political dialogue.Ireland sought to strengthen political dialogue with African countries and organisations during our recent EU Presidency. To this end, two important meetings took place with the African Union and ECOWAS under Irish chairmanship. The discussions with the African Union troika took place in a very positive and constructive atmosphere and covered peace and security and good governance issues, as well as regional integration and trade and development issues, such as external debt and food security. The discussions with ECOWAS took place in a very positive and open atmosphere, with good discussions on peace and security, conflict prevention, economic integration and trade, institutional matters and political dialogue follow-up as well as the issue of human trafficking.During the most recent session of the UN Commission on Human Rights the EU was active under the co-ordination of the Irish Presidency in securing a number of initiatives in relation to Africa. These included the establishment of a special EU mechanism on the Sudan, the agreement with the African Union of a resolution on the DRC and the adoption of a resolution regarding assistance on human rights in Somalia. The EU also supported resolutions tabled by the African Union on Chad, Sierra Leone and Burundi. In addition, at the initiative of the Irish Presidency, the EU, for the first time, delivered a strong statement to the Commission, in which the EU reaffirmed its strong commitment to work for the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery.Although the EU was not successful in pursuing a resolution on Zimbabwe, the commitment of the Irish Presidency and its promotion of active engagement with the African Union bore fruit in that there is now a clear African concern about the situation in that country which was expressed in Nigeria's explanation of its vote for the no-action motion which caused the EU resolution to fail.With regard to the situations in countries such as Sudan, Liberia and DRC, Ireland has been actively involved in their discussion at bilateral, EU and UN levels and continues to attach utmost importance to the issue of human rights in Africa. The European Union is tabling draft resolutions in the current session of the UN General Assembly regarding the human rights situations in Sudan, Zimbabwe and DRC, and Ireland will continue to play an active role in the discussion of these resolutions.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	878	To ensure that overseas development aid is directed to those for whom it is intended, it is important that there is a clear policy framework with a well articulated strategy for aid delivery and robust systems of oversight and accountability.As the Deputy will be aware, the central objectives of the Irish programme of development co-operation continue to be the reduction of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development. Through the bilateral development programme and through our interaction with multilateral institutions and our engagement with non-governmental organisations, we seek to address the basic human needs of some of the poorest people in the world by improving their access to food, water, health services and education.The main geographical focus of the bilateral programme is sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region in the world. Development Co-operation Ireland provides long-term development assistance to seven programme countries as well as South Africa. In line with other donors, we operate in partnership with the Governments of these countries supporting the national poverty reduction strategies.An agreed strategy also directs our engagement with the United Nations agencies and their work is increasingly focused on the millennium development goals which are directly related to poverty reduction. Our relationship with the larger Irish non-governmental organisations is underpinned by a multi-annual commitment and we support them in their work of addressing the needs of the poor. Our relationship with the United Nations agencies and with the non-governmental organisations is also key to the delivery of humanitarian assistance to some of the most vulnerable communities in the world.Robust systems for oversight and accountability are extremely important especially when working in such a difficult environment. This is provided through a rigorous system of monitoring, audit and evaluation. Monitoring takes place at all levels in the programme. All accounts are subjected to external audit in addition to a well-developed process of internal audit. A series of key evaluations are conducted annually and these examine the relevance and effectiveness of the interventions and identify lessons to improve the programmes. We also work with our partners to strengthen their own audit and evaluation processes.The Department of Foreign Affairs has an independent audit committee — all members are external to the Department — and this plays an important role in overseeing the audit, evaluation and risk management processes in the Department and in making recommendations to strengthen and improve these processes where necessary.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	879	I refer the Deputy to the reply to his QuestionNo. 135 on 12 February 2004 and Question No. 42 on 24 June 2004.The basic principles underlying the Partnership for Peace, PfP, as set out in the PfP Framework Document of January 1994, remain unchanged. This document sets out the political purposes of PfP which include: the protection of human rights; the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace; the promotion of democracy; the maintenance of the principles of international law; and the fulfilment of the obligations of the UNCharter, and of OSCE commitments.A key aspect of PfP membership, from Ireland's perspective, lies in the core principle of self differentiation, whereby each country participates according to its own interests and priorities. This principle remains at the core of PfP activity.PfP has proved itself an important framework for co-operation in areas appropriate to the so-called Petersberg Tasks which include humanitarian, peacekeeping, crisis management andrescue activities.Ireland's ability to make a meaningful contribution to UN authorised missions is undoubtedly enhanced by its participation in Partnership for Peace activities. Ireland's participation in PfP is aimed at improving the interoperability of the Defence Forces so as to continue to play a meaningful and effective role in appropriately sanctioned multinational peacekeeping operations. Through PfP, the Defence Forces acquire necessary training, familiarity with operational procedures and techniques, as well as peacekeeping methodology. These are essential prerequisites in the new style of peacekeeping and crisis management missions mandated by the UN in recent years. This can also be seen by the participation in PfP of all our EU partners, including the other neutral and non-aligned states.

Some 85% of our bilateral programme country assistance is spent there. It is our intention to maintain this focus and indeed to expand our assistance to the region as the aid programme grows.The EU is a major donor to Africa. EU aid to Africa is provided from the Community budget and the European Development Fund, EDF. The majority of this aid comes from the EDF which is the main instrument of Community aid for development co-operation in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States. The current 9th EDF was concluded at the same time as the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP-EU Cotonou Partnership Agreement in June 2000. Aid amounting to €13.5 billion was allocated by EU member states over a period of five years. Ireland contributes its proportionate share to the 9th EDF. In 2004, an overall sum of €2.34 billion was contributed to the Ninth EDF. The Commission has indicated that it wishes to raise the level of overall contributions to €2.855 billion in 2005.Ireland also works closely with the United Nations to assist Africa. The UN Secretary General has highlighted the need for special support from the international community for sub-Saharan African countries if they are to achieve the millennium development goals within the target dates. I share the Secretary General's concerns about the achievement of the millennium development goals in sub-Saharan Africa.Ireland has substantially increased its voluntary contributions to the UN development agencies in recent years. Slightly more than one third of Ireland's overseas development assistance is disbursed through support to key UN agencies such as the UN Development Programme, the UN Children's Fund, the UN Population Fund and UNAIDS.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	881	Ireland's programme of development co-operation has sub-Saharan Africa as its core focus. The programme concentrates on addressing the key causes of problems relating to poverty, food insecurity and strife in Africa. We use a variety of channels to deliver our development support, including directly through our embassies in a number of African countries and indirectly using experienced and effective NGOs, UN agencies and other international organisations.There is a strong interrelationship between conflict, food insecurity and poverty. Conflict is exacerbated by poverty, inequality and exclusion. It is undeniably the case that most wars occur in poor countries. Conflicts impact on the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly women and children. Furthermore, food security is undermined by the effects of conflict.Ireland responds in two ways to the humanitarian and development needs of Africa. In the short term, we focus on saving lives in the most effective way possible. A recent example of Ireland's humanitarian efforts is our response to the crisis in Darfur, Sudan. We have combined immediate life-saving assistance through a number of key humanitarian NGOs and UN agencies, with pressure at the international political level to bring about an end to the conflict.In the longer term, Ireland's development programme tackles the structural reasons underlying endemic poverty. One of the main ways in which this is pursued is through our strong development partnerships with six countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Through these partnerships, Ireland fully engages with Governments, local communities, donors, EU and UN agencies on the basis of poverty reduction strategy plans, PRSPs. The PRSP process brings Governments, donors and all interested stakeholders together, with the objective of prioritising a country's resources and expenditures to reduce poverty. They also aim to support democracy and build a culture of respect for human rights and the rule of law. These are enormous challenges. However, they stand the best chance of, at long last, beginning to reverse the decline of social and economic indicators in Africa. The people of Africa deserve no less.

The end of a long and brutal civil war and the establishment of a multi-party democracy have provided a strong basis for future political development. At the same time, the country's economy has experienced significant expansion. The current overall situation in the country remains stable and the general economic climate is positive, although the country continues to face many problems including war damage, underdevelopment and recurrent natural disasters.The EU is a major development partner of Mozambique and pursues an active political dialogue with the Mozambican Government which includes encouraging increased respect for human rights, rule of law and good governance, and promoting national peace and reconciliation. The EU has also expressed its willingness to contribute to the development of the judicial system, with €10 million pledged over three years.Mozambique's second municipal elections were held on 19 November 2003. The EU sent an election observation mission, EU-EOM, to oversee this election and reported many positive aspects. The atmosphere was generally calm, the legal framework adequate and there was a general equitable access to media for all sides. Improvements were suggested by the EU-EOM in a number of areas such as result tabulation and the transparency of the Comissao Nacional deEleicoes, CNEs, dealing with complaints.Both presidential and legislative elections will take place in Mozambique on 1 and 2 December next. Ireland and the EU consider the 2004 presidential and legislative elections in Mozambique as important for the democratic development of that country. The EU is due to send an election observation mission for the duration of these elections, which will include four members from Ireland.With a budget of €36 million in 2004, Mozambique is the largest of Development Co-operation Ireland's bilateral country programmes. The current country strategy paper, CSP, runs from 2004 to 2006. The programme has a broad reach and at present DCI is engaged in six areas: general budget support; education; health; HIV-AIDS; governance; and public sector reform. It also runs two area based programmes — in Niassa to the far north of the country and in Inhambane in the south. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is due to visit Mozambique next month.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	885	I assume the Deputy is referring to the position of markets under the Casual Trading Act 1995. The Casual Trading Act 1995 regulates trading in public places and is operated by local authorities who use their powers to make bye laws under the Act to regulate this activity. Under the Act a "market right" is defined as "a right conferred by franchise or statute to hold a fair or market, that is to say, a concourse of buyers and sellers to dispose of commodities". These rights usually originate in royal charters or statutes from the pre-1921 era. People who sell in a public place are subject to the Act including those who trade by virtue of a market right.Section 7(4) of the Act states that if a market right remains unexercised for a period of ten years from the commencement of this section that market right shall be extinguished. Section 7 of the Act was commenced on 1 May 1996, which means that section 7(4) will not become operative until 1 May 2006, which gives people and communities nearly a year and a half to activate or reactivate local traditional markets. Also, local authorities have the powers to regulate these markets under the Act by designating them as casual trading areas.

The framework agreement sets the parameters for the next stages of negotiation of the DDA. Essentially, the DDA negotiations are now back on track.Over coming months and next year, the WTO members will develop the agreed framework into concrete, detailed and specific commitments under each of the key areas of interest, including in agriculture, non-agricultural products and services. In the case of agriculture, the framework will include negotiations aimed at a substantial cut in trade-distorting supports, the elimination of trade distorting export competition practices and a significant opening of agricultural markets. In the case of industry, a set of precise guidelines to cut tariffs has been adopted. The framework, in addition, pays close attention to the needs and concerns of developing country members of the WTO.These negotiations will take place with a view to completing the round as soon as possible. When the Doha round was launched in November 2001, negotiations were scheduled to conclude by 1 January 2005. This will now not happen.Alongside the adoption of the framework agreement, the WTO general council, at end July, agreed that the next WTO ministerial meeting will take place in Hong Kong in December 2005.

However, it is devised on a regional basis and does not provide a breakdown for specific areas such as Tallaght. While the live register provides monthly data for specific areas, including Tallaght, it is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers.It should be noted that the exact area covered by each local office is not limited to the immediate locality of the particular office, for example in the Tallaght local office persons from the Blessington area may be registered.The live register figures for October 2004 in relation to the Tallaght local office were 3,077 whereas the comparable figures for the area for October 1994 were 6,900.The current overall unemployment rate, QNHS, for the country for the second quarter of 2004 is 4.4% — 84,200 persons. This compares very favorable to the unemployment rate in 1994 of 15% — 209,600 persons. The pattern in the Tallaght area reflects national trends over this period. The prediction for the medium term is that the numbers in employment will continue to grow.

The objectives of the scheme are: to provide an income for qualifying farmers who decide to stop farming; to encourage the improvement, where necessary, of the economic viability of the remaining agricultural holdings; and to reassign agricultural land to non-agricultural uses where it cannot be farmed economically.Farmers who retire early under the scheme can draw a pension of up to €13,515 a year for up to ten years. The scheme receives 50% co-funding from the European Union. Persons intending to retire under the scheme must cease commercial farming permanently and the land must be transferred, leased or gifted to an eligible younger farmer. Having entered the scheme, the retiring farmer must not return to farming at any stage in the future unless all monies already received by way of pension are refunded.Social welfare legislation provides that any payments received by way of pensions are excluded from the definition of reckonable emoluments for the purposes of calculating PRSI contributions. Accordingly, recipients of a farm retirement pension are not liable for PRSI contributions in respect of that payment. In such cases, depending on the circumstances, it may be possible for the farmer to pay voluntary PRSI contribution to maintain or build entitlement to old age contributory pension.Where a recipient of a farm retirement pension has another source of income, for example from an insurable employment, the earnings are reckonable for PRSI purposes and liable to PRSI at the appropriate class — generally PRSI classes A or J. Contributions paid at PRSI class A can contribute towards the accrual of old age contributory pension.Recipients of farm retirement pensions with reckonable income, including rental income from land or other property, are liable to PRSI class S on that income, providing the income is above the insurable limit which is currently, €3,174 per annum. Contributions paid at PRSI class S can help to maintain or improve entitlement to old age contributory pensions.Farmers should also be aware that the amount of the farm retirement scheme pension is reduced if the retired farmer becomes entitled to one of the following social welfare pensions: old age contributory pension; old age non-contributory pension; widow-widowers contributory pension at age 66; widow-widowers non-contributory pension at age 66; retirement pension; invalidity pension; and blind person's pension.

The central issue in regard to time restrictions is that of capacity constraints and the pressure on the transport system from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening.Time restrictions do not apply on any transport services in the case of people with learning disabilities, people attending long term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other people with disabilities or visual impairment. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times. Also, there are no peak time travel restrictions on Luas, DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.I understand that any general lifting of the existing time restrictions at this time could cause capacity problems for transport operators. However, I have requested my officials to keep the matter under regular review. In exceptional circumstances, where hospital appointments cannot be arranged out of peak travel time, my Department can issue a temporary unrestricted free travel pass. Requests for such passes are considered on a case by case basis.

The person concerned had not produced evidence from employers where employment is most likely to be available. It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision to the social welfare appeals office and a form for this purpose was issued to her on 22 November 2004.Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.

An allocation of €654.83 million was provided in the Vote for my Department in 2004 to meet the estimated overall cost of the scheme and its administration this year. The allocation is not apportioned initially to each health board each year, but is drawn down by health boards to meet individual scheme payments and administrative costs as they arise.Scheme and administrative expenditure is monitored closely by my Department throughout the year, through data from the computerised claim payment system and regular returns from health boards. Details of total expenditure, comprising both programme and administration expenditure, by health board up to 31 October 2004 are set out in the following tabular statement:Health BoardExpenditure €000Eastern Regional Health Authority289,185Midland Health Board21,594Mid-Western Health Board37,131North Eastern Health Board31,699North Western Health Board20,267South Eastern Health Board52,514Southern Health Board73,572Western Health Board50,452Total576,414This is the gross expenditure on supplementary welfare allowance before inter-scheme adjustments and refunds are taken into account.

Social welfare legislation provides for the return, subject to certain conditions, of PRSI contributions paid in respect of payments made to such pensions by employees and proprietary directors outside the payroll system. The refund process is technically complex involving a number of steps and calculations, requiring both Revenue and social welfare legislation to be taken into account.My Department and the Revenue Commissioners have been in consultations to devise a mechanism for dealing with these cases. These consultations have now been completed and the Revenue Commissioners have agreed that these refunds will be processed in the Office of the Collector General. The practical arrangements for claiming refunds will be published shortly by the Revenue Commissioners.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	895	I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 169 together.I am meeting representatives of the Mid Western Regional Authority later this week, when I will discuss any issues of concern to the authority. As I mentioned in my reply to the Deputy's previous question, on 17 November 2004, it has been Ireland's position at a number of recent Transport Councils, that while we are in favour of an open skies agreement between the EU and the US, Ireland's support would be contingent on an acceptable arrangement on Shannon being agreed between Ireland and the US, and that arrangement being reflected in the EU-US agreement.I am conscious of the fact that the new board of Shannon Airport is now required to produce a business plan for the airport and that clarity on the open skies issue would be very helpful to that business planning process. I am also conscious that Irish airlines are currently restricted in the routes they can serve under the existing bilateral arrangement, and that expanding scheduled services across the Atlantic is of great importance to the growth of Irish airlines and Irish tourism, as well as for inward investment and trade generally.Negotiations between the EU and US on an agreement to introduce open skies across the Atlantic are set to recommence early in the new year. Our priority is to keep Irish aviation strong by encouraging the State airports to compete and grow. This is good for Irish jobs and tourism.

To date, I have had no discussions with the RPA about extending Luas from Tallaght, through Oldbawn and Tallaght west, to Citywest and such a proposal does not form part of the DTO strategy for the greater Dublin area, Platform for Change.I understand the RPA has received preliminary proposals from the private sector for the extension of the Luas red line from the existing Belgard stop, through Fettercairn and Fortunestown Lane, to Citywest. However, those discussions are at a very early stage. The RPA awaits firm proposals from the parties, which have expressed an interest in supporting this extension.

These regulations also provide that the driver of such vehicles must hold a current small public service vehicle drivers licence. Responsibility for the grant of a licence to drive small public service vehicles rests with the Garda Commissioner.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	902	The Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, provides air traffic control and communications services to aircraft that pass through both sovereign and international airspace which it administers on the north Atlantic. Only a small proportion of military flights through Irish administered airspace actually pass through Irish sovereign airspace. Irish administered airspace covers 135,000 square miles of which 32,000 square miles is sovereign airspace.Under a Eurocontrol, European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, multilateral agreement to which Ireland is a party, various categories of flights — flights under visual flight rules, flights performed by small aircraft, flights performed for the transport of Heads of State and search and rescue flights — are exempt from paying en-route charges. In the case of other categories — military flights, training flights, flights performed to test air navigation equipment and circular flights — states have the option to exempt such flights from payment of the en-route charge. In common with most Eurocontrol member states, Ireland exempts all such flights, including military flights of member states of Eurocontrol, the United States and Canada, from payment of the en-route charge and this arrangement has applied since Ireland joined the Eurocontrol en-route charging scheme in the early 1970s. Because of this arrangement the IAA costs in relation to military flights are met from my Department's Vote.Ireland also exempts military aircraft flights from payment of the communications charge and the IAA costs for those charges are also met from my Department's Vote. Efforts to collect this charge in the early 1990s were unsuccessful and, following advice from the Attorney General, debts then outstanding were written off with the agreement of the Department of Finance and a decision taken to cease charging the communications fee to military aircraft.A total of €2.13 million, excluding VAT, has been paid to the IAA between January and September 2004. US military flights account for approximately 90% of the total amounting to €1.92 million. It is estimated that a further €700,000, excluding VAT, will be paid to the IAA by the end of 2004 with US military flights accounting for €630,000 of that amount. The published Estimate for 2005 for all exempt services is €4 million, including VAT. While it is difficult to predict the expected number of exempt US military flights in 2005, an amount of €2.98 million, excluding VAT, has been estimated based on the outturn in recent years.Foreign military aircraft using the State airports pay the appropriate airport charge to each airport authority.

Over 8,000 individuals benefited from the scheme last year alone. It is a measure of the success of the scheme that a gradual fall-off in demand has been experienced as more people have their security needs met by the scheme and the funding made available for the scheme in recent years is a reflection of that demand. I will continue to monitor the funding available to the scheme in the light of demand.

Three systems were approved following authorisation tests conducted under the terms of EU Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1215/2003 and the system selected by the industry is now installed in 24 meat plants that account for almost 95% of our beef exports. The move to mechanical grading, which was provided for under Sustaining Progress, was achieved with the co-operation of the sector as a whole and it is generally accepted that the move will help the industry become more market orientated and better positioned to exploit the opportunities for Irish beef within the expanded EU.As the competent authority my Department is required to carry out fortnightly inspections of the machines in the first year of operation and is exceeding that requirement. These inspections involve the selection of carcasses and the recording and analysing of these findings against the classification results determined by the machines. The results are forwarded to the system manufacturer for the purposes of identifying any difficulties being experienced and with a view to bringing about further refinements.My Department will implement any such refinement if it can be definitely shown that the adjustments would result in a higher level of accuracy.

In addition, such imports are subject to checks laid down in the harmonised rules prescribed at European level, and must be accompanied by the prescribed veterinary health certification from the competent authorities in the country of export.The Community beef labelling requirements, which are compulsory in all member states, apply to beef sold at retail level within the Community, regardless of whether that beef was produced within the Community or in a third country. Where beef is imported into the Community from a third country that beef must, at a minimum, be labelled as "origin: non-EC" along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place. There is a gap in these requirements in so far as they do not apply at restaurant and catering sector level. It is my intention to proceed with a legal requirement that country of origin must be displayed in respect of beef served on such premises. The legal options allowing for this development are being examined at present.

The Deputy may be aware that the group in question has already received a total of over €986,700 in capital and staffing grant assistance from the programme.The EOCP is a seven year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training. The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-06 and, following the mid-term review, additional funding of approximately €12 million was made available for the child care measures. This brings the total funding available for the programme to €449.3 million. This now includes an increased provision for capital developments for which €157 million has been set aside.Since 2000, my Department, with the technical assistance of ADM Limited, has processed and I have approved 1,271 applications for capital grant assistance of over €118 million and 1,015 applications for staffing grant assistance totalling €104 million. Almost €44 million has been allocated for projects under the quality measure. Much of the remaining current funding is required for ongoing supports to groups providing child care services to disadvantaged families to enable them to participate in employment, education and training opportunities.A list of outstanding capital applications is now being finalised and my Department will be writing to the applicants in early December. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this capital grant application.

The commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. Additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of Garda allocated to traffic duties.

Installation of Garda CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process. The Garda authorities are giving careful consideration to a restructuring of the manner in which these Garda CCTV systems go to tender with a view to delivering the implementation of these CCTV systems in a faster, more efficient and cost effective manner.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda CCTV advisory committee which was established by the Garda Commissioner to advise on all matters relating to CCTV systems, has not received an application for the installation of a Garda CCTV system in Tipperary town.

The establishment of the traffic corps follows the completion of a strategic review of traffic policing carried out by the Garda Síochána and published on 23 November by the commissioner.A key recommendation of the strategic review is that a new position of assistant commissioner in charge of all aspects of road traffic law should be created. On 23 November, the Government, at my request, made a new Garda Síochána ranks order providing for this, and the post will be filled shortly. The holder of the new post will be a member of the top management team in the force and will bring visible leadership to the traffic corps. In addition, following the recent Government approval of the increase of the strength of the force to 14,000, the number of members dedicated to enforcement of road traffic law will progressively increase from approximately 530 now to 1,200 in 2008. The traffic corps will also have a dedicated and identifiable budget, as recommended by the strategic review, and the formal arrangements for this within the Garda budget will now be put in place.The most appropriate place for a traffic corps to be located is within the Garda Síochána structure. Road traffic offences are serious offences, which too often lead to fatalities and serious injuries. The Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006, recently published by the Minister for Transport, sets out demanding enforcement targets and will set a significant benchmark for the traffic corps.Members of the Garda Síochána assigned to the traffic corps will remain full police officers and as such continue to be responsible for preventing and detecting crime generally. Similarly, members of the Garda Síochána who are not members of the traffic corps will continue to have general responsibility for enforcing road traffic law.

All projects are being assessed against the published prioritisation criteria, agreed earlier this year with the education partners. Each project will be assigned a band rating and the progress of all projects will be considered in the context of the programme from 2005 onwards.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	930	On foot of a Government decision, the then Minister for Education and Science formally established the State Examinations Commission on 6 March 2003. The commission now has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. Accordingly, the Deputy's query of 29 September was passed to the chief executive officer of the commission for direct reply.I have been advised that a reply was issued to the Deputy at Leinster House on 13 October 2004. The commission is issuing a copy, as the original has not been received.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	931	I propose to take Questions Nos. 206, 216, 219 to 221, inclusive, together.Funding arrangements for voluntary secondary schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system and is structured mainly on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants for secretarial and caretaking services. There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. The standard per capita grant now amounts to €274 as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. I wish to draw the attention of Deputies to my recent announcement, in the context of the 2005 Estimates, to the further increase in this grant to €286 per pupil, with effect from January next. This increase will bring the per capita grant in the case of disadvantaged schools to €324 per pupil.In addition, under the school services support fund initiative, secondary schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant. This grant that was introduced in September 2000 has been increased from €25 per pupil to the current rate of €99 per pupil, and will be further increased to €103 from January next. Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support grant has in the case of voluntary secondary schools been significantly enhanced to €131 per pupil, and from January next will be further increased by €10 per pupil bringing the overall grant for such schools to €145 per pupil. These increases are in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools.For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to additional funding of up to €119,000 per annum and annual grants of €255,761, €275,000 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items, including those referred to by the Deputies.I was particularly pleased to announce an aggregate increase of €26 per pupil from January next for voluntary secondary schools. Schools have welcomed this increase. These significant increases in the funding of secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.

Applications are considered under the terms and conditions of the scheme.The management authority of the school to which the Deputy refers has recently made an application for provision of a play area under the summer works scheme 2005.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	933	The main conditions of my Department's free fees initiative are that students must (a) be first-time undergraduates; and (b) hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. If students do not meet these requirements they are liable to pay tuition fees.I would emphasise the distinction between the criteria that determine eligibility under the free fees initiative and the criteria by which individual third level institutions establish what rates of tuition fees should be charged in cases where a student does not qualify for free fees. Universities are autonomous bodies and, as such, may determine the level of fees to be charged in cases where the free fees initiative does not apply. The classification of a student as an EU or a non-EU applicant is a matter for each institution to determine in this regard.

The National Educational Psychological Service has recommended 3.5 hours part-time resource teaching support per week for one pupil. The applications for the other two pupils have been examined by NEPS and, based on the documentation provided, it was considered that these pupils needs did not warrant resource teaching support.My Department notified the school authorities of the outcome of their applications on 23 September 2004 and 8 November 2004, respectively.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	939	The staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The guidelines can be deviated from only where a school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment. In such cases, an additional post, referred to as a developing school post, may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.The enrolment in the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 2003 was 59 pupils, which warrants a staffing of principal plus two mainstream posts for the 2004-05 school year. On the basis of projected enrolments, a developing school post was approved provisionally. However, the required enrolment figure at 30 September 2004 was not achieved and accordingly sanction for the post was withdrawn.To ensure openness in the teacher allocation system at primary level, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The staffing of this school for the 2004-05 school year was considered by the appeals board on 21 October 2004. The board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in departmental circular 19/02, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case. The board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board on 21 October 2004.I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	942	The vocational training opportunities scheme is funded by my Department and delivered through the vocational education committees. It is a second chance education and training programme which provides courses of up to two years' duration for unemployed people. To be eligible for the scheme, one must be more than 21 years of age, unemployed for at least six months, and in receipt of specific social welfare payments. A participant on a VTOS programme receives free tuition and is paid a training allowance in lieu of an unemployment payment.I do not envisage any changes to the VTOS scheme for 2005.The VTOS has a current annual cost of approximately €53 million, which covers teachers' and co-ordinators' pay, training allowances to eligible participants, and overhead costs incurred by VECs.The provision for 2005 will allow for the continuation of 5,000 places.

As the first step in the process, my officials are consulting with serving visiting teachers to determine if any of them is interested in transferring to an area in which a vacancy exists, including the area referred to by the Deputy. This procedure will be completed shortly and steps will then be taken to fill thevacant posts.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	944	The communications mast in question was erected in 1988. All the antennae mounted on the mast, with the exception of a Vodafone GSM system, are State-owned and authorised installations. It is not proposed to specify details of these systems for security reasons.I am advised by the military authorities that the telecommunications equipment installed on the mast in question complies with the standards set down by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, and that, in addition, this equipment complies with the highest international technical standards for safe operation as set out by CENELEC, the European communications electrical standards body, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, the International Telecommunications Union, and the Federal Communications Commission. These systems and associated antennae are regularly checked and maintained to ensure that they are working within specification and pose no health and safety risk to anyone in the vicinity of the mast. The Vodafone GSM system was installed in June 1998 and comprises a single beam antenna to provide coverage in the Phoenix Park area with an associated microwave link.I am advised that while there is no statutory requirement for owners or users of communications masts to have electromagnetic field strength tests carried out, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which is the licensing authority for the use of the radio frequency spectrum in Ireland, has recently completed a large survey of communications facilities on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The location in question was not selected as one of the sites for survey on this occasion. However, I understand that ComReg may be requested to undertake further measurements next year although a decision in that regard has yet to be made.

The individual accepts that he was never so informed. The individual enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 1994. The conditions under which members of the Permanent Defence Force who enlisted after 1 January 1994 can be extended in service are prescribed by Defence Force Regulations A10. An individual enlists initially for five years. This period of enlistment can be extended to nine years and then to 12 years' service. These regulations also provide for the re-engagement of members of the Permanent Defence Force after 12 years' service to complete 21 years' service subject to fulfilling certain specific criteria.

My Department's offer in the case of this blanket bog was based on expert valuation advice from the OPW, and, following a request on behalf of the person concerned for OPW to review their figures, the valuation was reconfirmed by OPW. In the absence of evidence of a higher valuation, which it remains open to the landowner to submit to my Department if available, it is not possible for my Department to increase its offer.

These plans contained, or were accompanied by, recommendations for such designations by the relevant county council. An independent expert advisory panel assessed each such plan, and in turn made recommendations to the Minister in this regard. The panel's recommendations were accepted in full, and are the basis on which the town renewal scheme is now being implemented in all areas.

The registration process is under way, but still incomplete. My Department understands that there has been a positive response to registration from landlords generally and that the board is actively assisting landlords to meet their registration responsibilities. Landlords failing to register will be rigorously pursued by the board.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	949	The current local authority mortgage interest rates are 2.95% variable and 4.45% for fixed, which represent competitive rates of lending. The cost of the mortgage protection plan is met by way of an additional charge, currently 0.598%, to the rate of interest charged on individual loans. This mortgage protection charge would be about €50 in the first month on a loan of €100,000, reducing over the term of the loan, with the average charge being around €30.The position regarding monthly payments on a €100,000 loan is set out in the table below:RateOver term of:15 years20 years25 years30 years2.95% variable€688€552€472€419Variable mortgage lending rates shown above may change over the term of the loan.
