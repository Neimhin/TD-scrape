#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The practice of motions of this type being referred to committee and back to the House without debate is unsatisfactory. Although No. 14 is a technical motion, it received 15 minutes consideration in committee. No. 14a requires the approval of Dáil Éireann on an important matter related to waste management, an area on which the Government is proving to be deficient. A previous motion on trade in hazardous waste was given five minutes consideration at the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food and was not voted upon or discussed subsequently in the House. On these grounds, the practice of referring motions and regulations of this nature without debate is not working in the interests of Members as they are not given proper consideration and the Green Party opposes the proposal.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I am glad to note in respect of No. 22 that the Government does not propose to guillotine the Disability Bill as envisaged earlier in the week. I note also in respect of No. a8 that the Government wishes to postpone statements on suicide. This is acceptable provided the House is given a guarantee that the debate will take place at an appropriate time, possibly next week.The proposal for dealing with No. a8 is not the way to do business. This is the second time in three weeks that emergency legislation has been brought to the notice of the House. Last week, legislation was introduced to deal with Waterways Ireland and the issue of ground rents, while this week it relates to an element of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill. The Fine Gael Party spokesman in this area, Deputy Hogan, contacted me at 7 a.m. The committee is in Wexford dealing with small business issues but this Bill is expected to be rushed through the House today. This is not the way to do business and I object to it for that reason. The content of the Bill is necessary but I cannot understand how the Government expects to come in here, get approval for this, hold a briefing session for spokespersons at 11 a.m. and rush the legislation through all Stages at 1.30 p.m. I object to the manner in which we have been presented with this and the way the Government proposes to deal with it. Putting emergency legislation through the House for the second time in three weeks is no way to do business.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	12	This is the second time in three weeks that emergency legislation has been brought before the House to protect the property interests of the State in different respects. On the previous occasion, the legislation related to the British-Irish Agreement and the protection of properties under the aegis of Waterways Ireland. On this occasion it applies to development land or properties — we have not been told which — under the aegis of IDA Ireland, Údarás na Gaeltachta or Shannon Development. Why we are in this position for a second time in three weeks?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	14	There has been no briefing on this and the Government Whip did not feel obliged to tell the Whips at the meeting last night what the emergency measure contains or its purpose. There was no briefing of the spokespersons for either party and there has been no advice to the leaders of the parties why this is the case. If I am right in divining that it is about protection of State property, can the Minister name a precedent where, twice in three weeks, the Government has been required to come before the House with emergency legislation to deal with essentially the same matter?The arguments we made three weeks ago have been borne out. Legislation was rushed through the House without notice or scrutiny and now we find it was inadequate to deal with the situation that had arisen.In terms of the technical defect in the British-Irish Agreement and our reluctant agreement to go along with the Government on the day to correct it, because we believed it was a drafting error and we were only restoring the status quo, it now seems, from the little I have been told, IDA Ireland, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Shannon Development or SFADCo could not be put in the same circumstance. This is not about restoring the status quo, rather it is a substantive amendment or, given the manner in which it has been brought before the House, a surreptitious amendment to amend the substantive law. It is different.It is absurd that we have been put in a position of making a judgment about such a serious matter when we have been given no information and our spokesperson has not been briefed. The Government knows the spokespersons and the relevant committee are meeting in Wexford this morning, leaving us ill equipped to deal with the situation. If the Government had notice to draft and publish legislation, it must have had sufficient notice to brief spokespersons in detail of what is involved. It is typical of the contempt this Government has shown for the passage of legislation through the House on many occasions. It is not good enough, it is not acceptable and on the basis of the procedure alone, without committing myself on the substantive matter of the Bill, which I do not yet know, we must oppose this.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Arrogance. The Government thinks it can do what it likes.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The Opposition will not see this legislation until after the Order of Business, only two hours before the debate will begin. For the second time in three weeks, the same substantive issue is being tackled by way of emergency legislation. It is curious that the amending legislation is so haphazard that two weeks ago the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs introduced legislation that should have come from the Department of the Taoiseach and today the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is amending legislation that falls within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. If this headless chicken approach to legislation is how the Government sees the legislative programme progressing for the rest of this Dáil, it cannot be guaranteed co-operation from this side of the House. Given that these two emergency measures relate to the same issue, what is to stop another Minister coming into the House in the coming weeks to say the same problem exists in all public buildings, such as schools, hospitals and Government offices?We have not seen any real Government attempt to deal with ground rent itself, a problem that affects hundreds of thousands of residents. The Government has chosen to tinker at the edges of the legislation, only ensuring that the ongoing difficulties with ground rent do not affect public buildings. That is not an honest way to deal with the problem and for that reason the Government does not have the co-operation of the Green Party on the issue.

We have the Bill this morning and we must be realistic while pointing out what is necessary.Unless this issue is addressed as a matter of urgency, further problems will arise. I am prepared to acknowledge that and accept it on the basis of the briefing that my colleague, Deputy Morgan, received from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last evening, with the promise of further elaboration this morning. That is part of the reality and we must deal with that.The important message that must be delivered from this, however, is that there is a fundamental issue that must be grappled with and not in the piecemeal, reactive manner of the Government's approach to specific aspects that may present because of litigation. We need preparedness on the part of the Government to address the ground rent issue holistically and in the round, and for it to have the courage to do so. Only in that way will every element be addressed rather than chipping around it and being afraid to get into the kernel of the issue.We do not intend to oppose the Government proposition on the basis of the information that was shared with Deputy Hogan and Deputy Morgan last evening and the opportunity that was provided to other Opposition spokespersons had they been available. Understanding the reality, I am using this opportunity to appeal to Government to grasp the nettle on the issue of ground rent. This has been part of the promised programme of legislation since the Government entered office in 1997. It should learn the lesson of the embarrassment of these reactive, emergency legislative approaches in recent weeks and commit itself to fulfil its electoral promises to the electorate eight years ago. The Government will find a universal welcome for this. While some may be disappointed, the majority will welcome that courage being translated into real action on the Government's part. The Government must deal with the ground rents issue.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I acknowledge the difficulties the Opposition has indicated on this matter. However, I must emphasise that this is urgent legislation to address a problem that has arisen for the industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta. This is a result of a settlement negotiated on legal advice by IDA Ireland which was notified to the relevant county registrar at a hearing on 17 May.On foot of this being brought to our attention, the Attorney General has advised that an amendment be enacted to section 4 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978. It states "this Act shall not bind a Minister of the Government, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland or the Irish Land Commission.". The purpose of the amendment is to include IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta among the State authorities not bound by the legislation. The proposed legislative amendment will not apply retrospectively where a notice of intention to acquire the fee simple and land lease from one of the agencies has been served. Accordingly, considerable urgency attaches to securing early passage of the amending provision.It is a legal lacuna which has been identified and it is important that the legislation is passed. It came about as a result of a settlement, notified to the relevant county registrar at a hearing on 17 May. This matter was brought to Government at yesterday afternoon's Cabinet meeting. It was determined that we needed to move immediately on this matter. I understand the Minister made genuine attempts to give a quick indication of the reasoning behind this matter to Opposition spokespersons. The Labour Party spokesperson was unavoidably absent on other business. Further attempts were made to contact him this morning. The briefing that the Minister wishes to make at 11 o'clock will flesh out in detail the circumstance in which the Bill must be brought forward. Members who have been in Government will recognise that on occasion, a matter such as this requires urgent rectification.That a separate issue arose several weeks ago is by the way as it could have happened three months or three years ago. It just so happens that these issues emerged so near to each other. They are separate matters which have been brought to the Government's attention and must be addressed immediately, based on legal advice.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Last week the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, said an independent terminal at Dublin Airport in competition with other terminals was not feasible or practical. Yesterday's decision in respect of terminal two, and the future prospect of an independent terminal three, is a contradiction of the Minister's views. Following the Government's decision, will legislation be introduced for this? Does the brief given to the current aviation regulator allow for competition between terminals, as now seems to be the case?In view of the commitment given by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for a super consumer agency with real powers, is the Government willing to use the template brought forward in the Fine Gael Party's Private Members' Bill that proposed such an agency? It was voted down last November.

The Government's objective is to underpin the most cost effective, efficient and timely delivery of such a terminal, in line with emerging aviation trends through an open, transparent and competitive process. No decision has been taken on how this will be established until such time as those issues have been addressed.In the past when I was Minister for Transport, we found ourselves in crisis management situations. Now, as a result of these decisions, we are dealing with expansion plans that will put the aviation sector in a proper framework and enable us to deal with the increased capacity and develop the airport's potential.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	34	If I understood the Taoiseach properly yesterday, he said it would be necessary to bring legislation before the House if the national stake in Aer Lingus was to be sold. Is the Minister for Finance saying this is not now necessary, although control has been ceded, and the lifeblood of this economy in terms of trade, with all its implications, will not be discussed because legislation will not now come before the House? If that is so, can we have the earliest possible debate in this House on the implications of this Government deciding to surrender control of Aer Lingus and that we would be enabled to discuss the matter from the point of view of trade, tourism and the strategic interests of this country?The consumer strategy group, comprised of various experts and resourced, produced a report after a long wait. This morning I opened my newspapers find an advertisement advising that a further report on the groceries order has been commissioned. The consumer strategy group made clear recommendations and now another group is to be set up. This is in keeping with the actions of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, who commissioned 116 reports when he was Minister for Health and Children.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The decision on Aer Lingus yesterday clearly makes a difference as to how we will proceed with the matter. Last March, the Minister for Transport outlined in the House the course he would take if the Government decides to embark on a sale of all or part of Aer Lingus:I will set out for the House, in accordance with the provisions of the Aer Lingus Act 2004, the general principles of the proposed sale as well as the basis for the Government's decision and the arguments for and against such a sale. I will also set out how the Government proposes to deal with the important strategic issues such as slots at Heathrow.The point is that a legal framework already exists to enable outside equity or an external investment in the airline in the event of the Government embarking on a sale based on advice from advisers to be appointed.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	39	With respect, the Minister spoke of clarity, but this matter is not clear to me. Will it be necessary to bring legislation before the House to sell a stake in Aer Lingus or is that provided for in existing legislation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Legislation already exists, the provisions of which can be utilised to enable the sale to take place. I assure the Deputy that as we embark on the process, appoint our advisers, take advice from them and do our analysis, we will give ample opportunity for this House to discuss the options and how we should proceed. There may well be different views in the House on that matter, but the Government is of the view that a process of external investment in the airline is required to enable it to grow, particularly on the long-haul routes, and thereby increase its profitability and business and broaden the prospect of further job creation in Aer Lingus in future.Regarding the consumer strategy report, it is normal when a report is published to engage in a consultation process regarding how or if certain recommendations should be implemented. Such issues involve varying arguments. A consultation process for a limited period with interested stakeholders would be advocated by Deputy Rabbitte in regard to aviation matters, and I agree with that. Issues raised about the groceries order should also involve consultation and discussion with interested stakeholders before final decisions are taken.

I want to check that the Ceann Comhairle is practising what he preaches. I refer to Standing Orders Nos. 42 and 43. The latter states:The Ceann Comhairle shall have the discretion to permit any Member to make a personal explanation in the Dáil, following notice given in writing by the Member concerned, to the Ceann Comhairle of his or her desire to make such an explanation and of the content of such proposed explanation.Will the Ceann Comhairle advise the House that this Standing Order was complied with yesterday when a personal statement was made in the House?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I cannot rise from this seat without the Ceann Comhairle lecturing me on Standing Orders. It now turns out that the Ceann Comhairle allowed a member of the party to which the Ceann Comhairle formerly belonged to sneak into the House yesterday without approval. The Whips were not advised. There is precedent in that regard too, which was not adhered to. The Ceann Comhairle ought to be consistent.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	49	As the Deputy is well aware, the matter has nothing to with the Chair. The Minister of State involved entered the House yesterday and made a statement. That has nothing to do with the Chair.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Standing Orders Nos. 42 and 43 are very clear. The Minister of State was not entitled to do what he did.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	51	The matter had nothing to do with the Chair.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	53	The only breach of Standing Orders allowed by the Chair was the breach this morning of Standing Order No. 26.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	54	In light of the increased concern arising from energy price hikes, will the Minister indicate when the national oil reserves agency, NORA, Bill will be brought before the House? It has nothing to do with the song line, "The violets were scenting the woods, Nora." That Bill and a related Bill, the electricity Bill, should be brought before the House as a matter of urgency. They are particularly relevant at this time because of the increased cost of energy.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The Deputy should allow the Minister to answer his question.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I understand that the electricity Bill will come before the House next year. The heads of the national oil reserves agency Bill have been approved so the legislation should come before the House later this year.

I have still not received an answer to the question I put quite validly in the sequence of those who questioned the Minister on the Government's intent to accommodate a proper debate on the issue of the Aer Lingus sale.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	62	That question has already been answered by the Minister.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	68	No, the Deputy is not.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The Minister has already replied on the matter.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Minister has made a statement. We cannot have repetition.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	81	What has happened to the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill? It was passed expeditiously in the House but I do not know if it is before the Seanad or what has happened to it. Students and staff are working in difficult conditions throughout Dublin at present.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	82	It is awaiting an order for Report Stage.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	84	According to the information available to me there is an order for Report Stage for the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill 2004. It was published in June last year.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	85	It is very slow.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	86	If the Whips agreed to view it as a priority, it could be arranged. I assure Deputies, including Deputy Ó Caoláin, that there will be many opportunities to discuss the issues relating to aviation. I base that on my prior experience of having responsibility for that Department.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	89	The Bill is due to be discussed by the Government and is due to be published next year.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Government is currently undertaking a countrywide consultation about Irish overseas development aid. How appropriate is it to have the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid lecturing the country on the need for good government in Third World countries——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	91	That does not arise on the Order of Business. I call Deputy Bruton.

If the Deputy has a question on the consultation process, she should submit a question to the appropriate Minister.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	96	——dealing with Ireland's commitment on overseas development aid, which has already been reneged on by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The Minister put a disclaimer on the record yesterday and that must be accepted.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	98	This is a question about legislation. There is a consultation process about a White Paper. Will that result in legislation?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I ask the Deputy to resume her seat.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Will it result in legislation?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19058	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	102	My question is about No. 27 on the legislative programme, legislation to end imprisonment for inability to pay fines and to provide for new ways of enforcing fines. The Government has said it is not possible to indicate when this Bill will be produced. If this legislation saved even 5% of prison places, it would mean a saving of €25 million per year. Why is it not possible to produce this legislation? There is emergency legislation before the House today and this is clearly——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Allow the Minister to answer the question.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19058	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I do not want to hear about hold-ups in the parliamentary draftsman's office. This will save €25 million a year. Surely draftsmen can be employed for that type of saving.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	105	On the Order of Business I must communicate to the House about the schedule for dealing with each Stage of legislation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform answered questions in the House two days ago and a specific parliamentary question to him would elicit more information than I am in a position to give. The Deputy should accept that point rather than criticise me for the information I can give. It is not possible to say at this stage when that legislation might be brought forward. A question to the Minister concerned would elicit more information than simply raising it on the Order of Business.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19058	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Surely——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Deputy, we cannot have a debate on the matter.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19058	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	108	——we are entitled to ask why it is not being delivered. This was regarded as a Government priority but it now seems to have been put on the long finger. The Minister has some accountability to the House for that.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Following last night's announcement, where stands the promise to Cork Airport about leaving it debt free with a new terminal and does the Minister wish to comment on that?

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	111	It is reported that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has presented the heads of the defamation Bill to Cabinet. When is that Bill likely to be introduced and will it cover racial slurs made by members of the Government?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	112	These matters are before the Government at present.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	118	That does not arise on the Order of Business. The Deputy should put the question to the appropriate Minister.

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	123	On many occasions I have asked the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach about the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill. It was removed from the Order Paper and I received a letter from the Minister for Finance explaining that this was because the issue was before the Supreme Court. What is the current position with that legislation and when will it be brought before the House?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I understand the Supreme Court decision might have implications for how we try to address the matter. That is the reason we have not been able to progress the Bill as quickly as the Deputy would wish. I am aware that he has had a long standing interest in the Bill.

What is the position of the water safety Bill? Will Second Stage be taken before the end of this session? Second, with regard to CCTV cameras and anti-social behaviour, the OPW is preventing the Garda Síochána from monitoring CCTV systems in Garda stations.

Under the proposals, we will decide on a set of advisers to advise us on what the proper investment mechanism might be for an equity share in Aer Lingus by the private sector. We will await that analysis.With regard to the terminal issue, the Dublin Airport Authority is mandated to proceed and commission a design proposal which will be independently verified. The Commissioner for Aviation Regulation will also use his statutory powers to ensure the proposal is commensurate and consistent with the requirements of the airport going forward, as per his remit. The operational integrity of the airport, for which the DAA has statutory authority, will be married with necessary cost effectiveness and efficiency to ensure the maximum business can be done through the airport.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	170	The legislation is a positive action measure and the Long Title reflects that accurately. I do not intend, therefore, to accept the amendments. I will retain the present Long Title which adequately describes the intent and purpose of the legislation.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	171	The Long Title states this is, "An Act to enable provision to be made [by Ministers] . . . consistent with the resources available to them and their obligations in relation to their allocation . . .". Yesterday the Minister of State said this was a standard statement in all Bills. I beg to differ because I conducted a trawl of every Bill that has been passed since 1999 and this statement is not to be found in any Long Title. The statement in this Long Title, therefore, is unique.It is a ground-breaking statement, which provides belts and braces and bells and whistles to constrain resources. Why is it necessary in this Bill when it was not necessary in every other Bill I examined, including the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004? I would be interested if the Minister of State could refer to a Long Title in which that statement is included. For example, it is not contained in the Long Titles of the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 2002 or Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. These Acts provide for significant expenditure of Exchequer funding but it was not deemed necessary include such a statement. Why has it been inserted in this legislation?I acknowledge that most Bills contain a provision similar to section 3 of the Civil Defence Act 2002, which states: "The expenses incurred by the Minister in administering this Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas." This is a standard provision which is also contained in this legislation. However, the belts and braces and bells and whistles the Minister of State is attaching to resources demonstrates how mean-spirited the legislation is, having been introduced by a mean-spirited Government. Why is the Government so afraid of people with disabilities that it has inserted provisions throughout the legislation to prevent them from accessing services?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I support Deputy Stanton's contention regarding the restrictive nature of the legislation. We discussed this issue on Committee Stage and we will discuss it again. One cannot nod one's head and say it is fine and we will live with it. Unfortunately, the people who need this legislation to live a full life depend on us to highlight issues such as this. The restrictiveness is evident in the Long Title which outlines the Bill's intention. We cannot continue to put legislation of this nature in place. The Bill will end up in the very place the Minister of State keeps telling us he does not want it to end up. On the Order of Business earlier, the issue flawed legislation that needs to be amended was again raised. We have been telling the Minister of State for the past six months that this legislation is wrong and that it needs to be scrapped and rewritten but he still will not listen to us.The Long Title is important because it indicates what the Bill is meant to do. However, it contains a restriction. The Long Title is the essence of the legislation and points out at first glance what it is about. In this instance, it highlights that this is restrictive legislation, which will not do what people the Minister of State consulted for two solid years felt it would do. Their frustration and dismay is now palpable when one talks to them. They throw their hands up and ask what more they can do. However, I am sure they will find the energy again, they will come back and we will, at some stage in the future, have legislation that gives people with disabilities the right to services and not just the right to assessment.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I wish to raise a number of points concerning the Minister's response to the amendments and specifically to amendment No. 2. He pointed out that such funding provisions are not in place in any other country and that if the Opposition was in power, it would not put such funding and resource provisions in place either. He referred specifically to the sections in the legislation which demand the right to services and funding.However, we have an opportunity to do something different, to have a Disability Bill that is historic and held in high regard internationally. Given that this country claims to be interested in equality and social inclusion, this is an historic moment when we have the opportunity to translate this interest into action.I become very annoyed when I hear statements asserting that the Department of Finance cannot write blank cheques to provide services for people with disabilities. Services, in this context, refer to respite, residential and day care for people with intellectual disabilities and broader services for those with other disabilities. However, there never seems to be a problem in providing public money for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That Department paid €30 million for a site in north County Dublin that was worth €4 million. It also revamped a courthouse in Cork, the cost of which was estimated at €6.5 million, but the final bill was €26.5 million. One does not have to be a rocket scientist or an accountant to work out that €46 million was inappropriately used. Imagine the amount of disability services that could be provided with that amount of money. Imagine all of the respite, residential, day care services that could be provided. That money could have been used to fund the respite homes in north Dublin that are closing.These are the real issues in the debate. When we use the term "rights" for people with disabilities, we do not do so lightly. We are talking about the rights of our citizens, both adults and children. This country has constantly been in conflict over the rights of its people, both historically and internationally. Amendment No. 1, in the name of Deputy Ó Snodaigh and amendment No. 2, tabled by Deputy Lynch and myself, are progressive attempts to improve the legislation. I urge the Minister to re-examine them and to be radical and creative.There is an historic opportunity to do something really positive for people with intellectual and other disabilities. I pay deliberate attention to people with intellectual disabilities because they are priority cases. There are people with intellectual disabilities in their 40s and 50s, whose parents and extended families are dead, who are in very negative, if not sad, situations. We must, as proposed by amendment No. 2, guarantee and protect the rights of people with disabilities.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	174	During the course of the debate yesterday, the Minister stated that he is happy with the Bill and I would not have expected him to say anything else. The Long Title as it stands confirms what I said yesterday, that this Bill is not about the provision of rights. The Minister said as much in his opening comments today, when he used the phrase "positive action measures".The hope of everyone, except perhaps the Minister, the Government and departmental officials, was that we would have a Disability Bill that conferred rights on people. That is not what we have before us. The conferral and guarantee of rights is at the heart of amendment No. 1. I have also tabled, thereafter, a series of amendments that follow on from the conferral of rights and explain what they are.The Minister said there is no justiciable rights legislation for those with disabilities in any other country. In France, disability legislation has been in place since 1973. The French have not gone forward in terms of positive action measures or rights since then because they were not included in the original legislation. We have an opportunity, particularly given our wealth, to draw up legislation that ensures we are ahead of the rest of the world and are setting the standard for others to follow. We should take the lead and set out rights explicitly.My intention in tabling amendment No. 1 was to change the Long Title to reflect the type of rights-based legislation demanded and deserved by people. This type of legislation was recommended by the disability legislation consultative group, the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority and is required by law under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. I urge the Minister to take the time to examine the wording of amendment No. 1, to accept it and to accept the subsequent amendments that flow from it.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	175	No legislation has been passed in this House that did not have conditions attached in respect of resources. All legislation is predicated on the availability of resources and this Bill is no exception. The Long Title reflects what is contained in the Bill. If the members of the Opposition who have spoken on this section of the Bill were in Government, the situation would not be any different.I do not agree with Deputy Finian McGrath's assertion that there is an opportunity to change the legislation. There is no such opportunity. I have had robust discussions with the Minister for Finance and his officials about this issue. The fundamental elements of good governance and responsible public expenditure are laid down in the procedures pertaining to the budgetary and Estimates requirements of the Department of Finance and all other Departments. It is not possible to diverge from that.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	176	Why does the Department of Finance not restrict the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform when it spends money inappropriately?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	177	Deputy McGrath is making a fundamental mistake in giving examples such as the ones he mentioned earlier, because all spending is subject to the Estimates and budgetary processes of the Department of Finance and other Departments. This legislation underpins a multi-annual expenditure programme, as outlined by the Minister for Finance, which is designed to bridge the gaps in funding and services for people with disabilities. It underpins a public expenditure programme over the next five years, in order to address those identified gaps and I am satisfied the Bill will achieve its aim in that regard. There are rights in the Bill ——
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	178	Such as what?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The rights range across the spectrum, but there is not a justiciable right of redress to the courts. Deputy Lynch has been eloquent on this issue but even if justiciable rights were included in the Bill, that would not guarantee a right to services, as she has claimed. The experience of the Department of Education and Science in the courts is ample evidence of that. Every €1 paid out to people who have gone to the courts has cost €4 paid to lawyers. I do not accept that is in the best interest of people with disabilities and neither do I accept that justiciable rights will give people with disabilities their proper services. I am quite satisfied that the balance in this Bill, as outlined in the Long Title, is the best way to give people with disabilities their rights.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Again, the Minister of State has confirmed that he will not accept my amendment nor any of the other amendments which try to set out rights. The intention of my amendment and the ones that flow from it is to confer rights and ensure that if those rights are denied, people will have recourse to a remedy for redress. The Minister of State has not adopted that track in the legislation.I am not alone on this. It is not something I dreamt up last night or the night before. This is something for which a number of organisations have called. It is what we lived and hoped for after the debacle over the previous disability Bill.The Long Title sets out the context and intention of the Bill. The intention of my amendment is to change it. The amendment contains five different points the purpose of which is to ensure equal rights for people with disabilities. Equal rights for people with disabilities are to be affirmed and protected. Positive action must be taken to enable people with disabilities to live with maximum independence and autonomy. They must have equal rights to participate and contribute to society. The Bill must guarantee a minimum standard for the provision of disability-specific services and, finally, it must guarantee the progressive realisation of the right of equal access to all public buildings and services.This Bill, as currently formatted and presented, does not include any of those five rights. That is the reason I want to amend the Long Title. I want to ensure this appears in the Title, at least, and that the rest of the legislation is amended to take heed of that change. I made my points yesterday and will not repeat them now. I will make another attempt at convincing the Minister of State when we get to amendment No. 5 where we will try to amend the Title of the Bill. However, at this stage we are dealing with the Long Title. Even at this late stage the Minister of State should adopt my amendment, which I will press.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 5, line 30, to delete "Disability" and substitute the following:"Assessment and Services For People with Disabilities and Miscellaneous Provisions".The amendment arises from Committee Stage proceedings. It tries to describe the Bill in a more accurate way and to focus on what the Bill should be about, namely, the needs of people with disabilities. However, people are not referred to in the Title of the Bill, although they are referred to in similar legislation throughout the world. The Short Title, "Disability Bill 2004", does not really mean anything. I propose to change the Title to the "Assessment and Services For People with Disabilities and Miscellaneous Provisions" Bill, because the Bill is an assessment Bill which also purports to provide services.Some parts of the Bill should be dealt with in separate legislation, for example, the areas dealing with genetics and the centre of excellence, and Part 7, the miscellaneous part, which deals with broadcasting, covenants in leases and so on. The Title should be more accurate so those referring to the Bill know what it is about. The Title "Disability Bill" does not clearly convey what the Bill should contain, purports to contain or does contain. We have a disagreement with the Minister as to how the Bill will operate when it is finally enacted.The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill was the last Bill to deal with the needs of people with disabilities. In that case, the relevant Minister agreed to change the title of the Bill because he took on board the argument that the new Title better and more humanely reflected what all Members of the House were endeavouring to achieve. The phrase "Disability Bill" is too bland and does not convey clearly enough what the Bill should do. The Title should be changed to open it up and to emphasise that the Bill deals with assessment and services for people with disabilities.When we talk about disability, we must move away from the old medical model of disability. It was pointed out earlier in the debate that the Long Title includes that old model; it serves to blame people with disabilities for having disabilities. We must move through a social model to a human rights model, which is what the Bill should try to achieve. People with disabilities are citizens of the State, the same as everybody else. They should have a right to services and supports to enable them to live the best quality of life possible with the impairments they have.However, while that should be the underlying philosophy of the Bill, unfortunately, it is not. The Bill reminds me of the film title "The Empire Strikes Back". The previous Bill, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill, was struck down on the eve of an election because it was flawed, following a campaign against it. The Government of the time got windy and pulled the Bill. Now, the empire strikes back, and those who will suffer are people with disabilities.The end-users have already walked away in disgust, despair and disappointment. The Minister failed to keep them together and the disability legislation consultation group, which was established by the Government, has fallen apart because the Bill focuses on resources not people. The Long Title is all about resources and protecting the State. It is the only Bill that so blatantly focuses on this area, while the other Bills I referred to have a different focus.I accept that every Bill will contain sections stating that expenses will be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance and approved by the Oireachtas. However, while there is no need for it, the Bill goes out of its way, time and again, to refer to the protection of resources. The Bill is not about people; it is about protecting the State and the Government, as the Minister said, from the Four Courts. It is not about providing services or supporting people but the opposite. The Bill will make things worse for people with disabilities when it is enacted.The Minister and Fianna Fáil should be ashamed to stand over a Bill such as this. They have not listened to people with disabilities, the end-users. Progressive Democrats Members did not even think it worth their while to speak on the Bill on Second Stage, apart from the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who came to the House to heckle.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	194	By changing the Title of the Bill, we might help to change its focus onto people with disabilities and not focus on protecting resources, which is what the Minister is interested in, no more or less. I acknowledge that resources are limited and must be protected, and that we must plan ahead and make resources available. However, we must do much more than that.The be-all and end-all of the Bill seems to be to make sure that people with disabilities have no services and no recourse to rights or the legal mechanisms that are currently available. The Bill restricts them and boxes them in, which is why many people are angry and disillusioned. My amendment tries to bring people back into the equation. It will make no difference to the Bill itself, but it might refocus our thinking on people. There has been too much talk about resources and not enough talk about people. The Bill is concerned with protecting resources in every way.The sky will not fall in if the Minister of State accepts this amendment and the Four Courts will not take over. However, he will say that it has always been known as the Disability Bill and he will not change it. There are shades of the song that said that flowers are red and green and leaves are green, and that is the way they always have been seen. The Minister of State is showing no imagination or courage. He is being told what to do in every respect and has no authority to make any changes. We are wasting our time debating the issue.People with disabilities, the end users, who have spent years in so-called consultation with the Government have walked away at the eleventh hour in disgust, despair and disappointment. If the Minister of State had been successful those people would still be involved, debating, discussing and negotiating how a Bill such as this can be put into practice. However, they have been forced to walk away because they were badly let down. None of us in Opposition asked or forced them to walk away; they did so out of pure frustration. Some of the groups still involved are just hanging on, and there are various reasons for that also. The Minister of State has failed in this regard because he has forgotten that the Bill is about people with disabilities who are vulnerable.This Bill is like The Empire Strikes Back and it is an absolute disgrace. There are belts and braces and bells and whistles to limit services and resources that could be made available to people with disabilities. It is over the top. Admittedly, there is always a need for a section that enables moneys to be spent, and that is included in every other legislation. However, this Bill does not have such a section. It is unique and ground-breaking in that regard. The public is very angry about this, and in every constituency people with disabilities, their families and neighbours know what is happening. They are waiting for this Government to come before them, and this Bill will be top of their agenda because of the way in which they have been treated. I am surprised the lambs at the back of the Government side have not been more vocal. They have all been silent on the matter. It is amazing in this so-called democracy of ours that this is allowed to happen.I propose to change the Title of the Bill to reflect what it should contain. It should be about people and assessment of services for people with disabilities. There are also miscellaneous provisions.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I support amendment No. 5, which proposes to deleted the word "Disability" on page 5, line 30, and substitute it with the words "Rights of Persons with Disabilities". We are referring to the core issues in the legislation when we speak of the rights of people with disabilities. It is important to reflect that the disability movement and in particular people with disabilities have been talking with and lobbying us over recent months as well as sending us messages. They have encouraged us to stand with them in respect of this Bill. One of the largest organisations is namhi which represents some 28,000 intellectually disabled people, those who provide services and parents of people with intellectual disabilities. It has strong views on this legislation, and it is important that all Deputies, and especially those in power, listen to their voices and not simply look the other way and hope the other groups will stay silent.It is also important to listen to parents of people with disabilities, in particular those with younger children, such as Pat O'Hanlon, mother of Ryan O'Hanlon, and Marie O'Donoghue, mother of Paul O'Donoghue from Cork. When these people contact us and ask us to raise specific issues with regard to the promotion of the rights of people with disabilities we have a duty as legislators to listen to them. Over recent months they have been saying that justice delayed is justice denied.The Minister of State is constantly referring to budget resources and extra allocation, and we accept that has been announced. During the debate on the budget I welcomed the extra resources that would be provided in 2005. There was another roll-out of an extra €900 million between 2002 and 2009, which I also welcomed. However, those involved in services and people with disabilities are also saying these moneys must be targeted so that they can make a real impact on the daily lives of the 400,000 with disabilities awaiting and demanding services.We have a duty to listen to people with disabilities. Nigel Brander, who has a disability, is national chairman of PwDI, an organisation is involved in the disability sector. On his discussions with politicians, he says:To them I say we are looking for equality, to be treated on an equal basis as other citizens in this country. You cannot say: "Sorry, you cannot have the health care you need", or "Sorry, there are too many children this year so you will not get an education" or "We do not have any housing to give you". So, why do you say it to people with disabilities? Give us the stepping stones so that we can stand alongside everyone else as equal citizens.Mr. Brander has a very valid point. There is no problem about wasting money and resources in other Departments, but there is always a problem in respect of people with disabilities.I strongly urge people to support my amendment because it adds to the legislation. It is progressive and adds depth and teeth to the Bill. Deputy Stanton said that it was amazing that in such a short debate the party that calls itself the Progressive Democrats is not involved on any level. That is a disgrace. It talks about issues of equality and justice and regularly lectures the nation. However, it makes no contribution to defend the rights of people with disabilities. We know what that party's agenda is in respect of the rights of all citizens. One is not top of their political agenda if one is unemployed, an Aer Lingus worker or a person with disability. We should not be afraid to state that in this debate. It is important that we do so. Amendment No. 5 relates to the rights of people with disabilities.I get extremely annoyed and let-down when I hear people taking about services coming on stream. That is pie in the sky and we need to ensure that services are there and that people with disabilities have these services as a right. I do not accept that people must ring our offices because they cannot get respite in 2005 after the massive allocation in the budget. Something is going wrong within the management and structure of the services and it must be challenged. It is not just a question of legislation, but also a question of the management of services. Elderly parents of people with intellectual disabilities are unable to get day care or respite services. A few hundred people on the north side of Dublin are on the waiting list for some services. That is amazing and it is not acceptable. People talk about respecting people's rights but that is a complete disregard for their human and civic rights. It is also very much part of this debate. I urge Deputies to support amendment No. 5.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I support Deputy Stanton's amendment. We will all make statements about particular amendments but from our experience on Committee Stage we know none of them will be accepted. It is important that the arguments are made, however, and the reasons the amendments are being tabled outlined. The Minister of State will say in his reply that resources are the problem. Anyone put in charge of this legislation, regardless of who they are, would say the same as the Minister, that it is about finite resources and we cannot write a blank cheque, despite all the money that goes to solicitors.That would be an appropriate response from a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who might be concerned about the way the legal system operates, even though the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not concerned about the way the legal system operates. He is the Minister who organised the payments to barristers in the tribunals which he now cribs about because they are costing millions but he set the rate. He said they were to be paid by the day. Someone building an extension on their house would never agree to paying the builders by the day because they know they will probably be lifelong lodgers. It is hypocritical to talk about resources not being available for people who desperately need them when there is such waste in the country.A recent report indicated that in regard to four projects, and the country is like a building site at the moment, the total cost was to be €60 million. I am being extremely conservative in regard to that figure. I am overestimating the cost of the projects and underestimating the cost of the overrun. The eventual cost was €120 million yet this Minister is telling us we do not have enough money to provide services to people with disabilities.It frightens me to think of the amount of money that has been wasted in various areas. It equally frightens me to think that we are prepared to allow that type of waste continue while at the same time telling people with disabilities that they cannot have the services they need to allow them make a contribution to society and the economy, and people with disabilities will make a contribution to the economy.I remember the same argument being made about equal pay for women but no one makes that argument now because they realise the contribution women make to the economy. The same argument was made more recently about the minimum wage, and it is still being made. Every time there is a minuscule increase in the minimum wage, the same argument is made, namely that we cannot afford it and that it will bankrupt us and destroy business. We are hearing the same argument now.The hypocrisy of that argument is very hard to take. This country is awash with money. Every year the returns to the Exchequer surprise the Minister for Finance. He has underestimated the returns to the Exchequer every year. The figure is always more than he expected. He is finding it difficult to find ways of getting rid of it and that is the reason there is no restraint on overruns or the waste of money.One can only imagine what people with disabilities could do if they had access to that type of funding. There would be no question about participation. We would not be having this debate. People with disabilities would not be as frustrated as they are now yet the argument will continue to be made that resources are limited and we cannot provide everything. If they are limited, they are limited by imagination and capacity because the problem is definitely not a shortage of money. We have so much money we do not know what to do with it but there is an absolute block when it comes to giving people equality. It existed when the argument was for equal pay for women, it is still there in relation to children and it certainly exists for people with disabilities.I do not know whether the Minister has the power to change this Bill and make it radical and worthwhile but very few of us in our lifetime get an opportunity to be remembered for doing something in the common good that will affect everyone for good, not ill. This is an opportunity for this Minister, and he should consider doing it.

This is not a disability Bill. It should be a rights for people with disabilities Bill because those groups who were drawn into the consultation process and involved in the discussions for the past two years believe they were cynically used over two years on a promise which has not been delivered. They see it as a betrayal. They engaged in the process in good faith but they have been let down because the rights they hoped for and were led to believe would be included in a Bill to address disability issues and the equal rights of people with disabilities have not been addressed.While I recognise that a Title change does not reflect the actual contents of the Bill, that does not prevent us from changing it and adopting the amendments put by the Opposition who hope to change the intent of the Bill to one that will deliver rights. I urge the Minister to do the right thing and accept the recommendations of his Government's disability legislation consultation group and change the focus of the Bill, in keeping with the Government's promises to the DLCG and to the people with disabilities that rights based legislation would be the product of the long, drawn out consultation process, which only ended last week when the Minister met with different groups.In proposing this amendment I urge the Minister to reflect on the responses of the DLCG member groups and the Government's treatment of them in the process. In their formal statement on 4 May of this year, in advance of a meeting with the Minister of State, the DLCG described the Minister's response to their position on the Bill's ten fundamental flaws as totally inadequate and fatally flawed. They stated: "As matters now stand, the sector will be compelled to condemn the Bill as a betrayal of the hopes of people with disabilities in Ireland". It is a pity it reached that stage because everybody hoped the rights would be provided.Even with that warning, the consultation process was in danger of breaking down owing to Government intransigence. Within recent weeks the DLCG in good faith narrowed down the list of issues it wished to see addressed to a group of five key issues in the vain hope the Minister would move on some of them. These issues are pertinent to the change in the Title because they concern rights. The DLCG called for a clear and unequivocal right to an assessment of need, a right to the provision of services identified within a reasonable and agreed timeframe, clear protection of disabilities specific resources so these rights can be realised and a clear duty on all Departments and public bodies to include people with disabilities meaning every Department must provide a sectoral plan as a minimum.The Forum of People with Disabilities, the only organisation in the State exclusively led by people with disabilities stated five days later on 9 May following a meeting with the Minister of State that its investment in the three-year process, "had yielded minimal results for the disability community". In the context of announcing its formal withdrawal from that process the forum said disabled people are left with political promises rather than justiciable rights. It stated it would ask all political parties to give a commitment to complete an immediate review of the legislation in their election manifestos. I give that commitment today on behalf of Sinn Féin.Other members of the DLCG were just as scathing about the resource basis of this Bill. The Disability Federation of Ireland said:As a nation we have put off inclusion by saying that we cannot afford it. We were told over and over again that "when things get better you will be looked after".It also said:Good intentions and honest attempts are not in themselves enough. We have to get it right.The DFI called on us to live up to our responsibilities, stating the Oireachtas now has a clear choice between using this legislation to oblige the Government to fully include people with disabilities or to confirm that people with disabilities in Ireland remain as second class people. It reminded us that people with disabilities have been wrongly treated by our State. The key challenge for this legislation is to right a continuing wrong.The DFI went on to say, "We should not have to continue to be inferior in status," but that the Government's approach means, "disabled people will remain petitioners on the edge of society". It warned us: "We will know whether we have become equal citizens by virtue of how the Oireachtas deals with the amendments to this Bill." They lived in hope and that is the basis on which this amendment and others have been tabled.People with Disabilities Ireland expressed concern that the Bill is not rights-based and will reduce access to rights as it potentially excludes vast numbers of people with disabilities from the services they badly need because they may not need such service on a continual basis.It is a disgrace that Members of the Opposition have been prevented from even proposing amendments to redress the definition issue owing to the decision of the Ceann Comhairle to rule out of order many amendments that would put this legislation right. Of my 59 original amendments, 38 were ruled out of order because they involved a potential charge on the Revenue. The Minister of State did not even get to debate them with us. Every single amendment is a charge on the Revenue by virtue of the fact that it is written down on paper that costs money to produce. Ruling amendments out of order because they involve a charge on the Revenue is a sham.The Opposition has tried on Second Stage, on Committee Stage and now on Report Stage to be constructive in this debate. We wanted to debate the amendments and while I would not be in favour of the Minister of State rejecting them, that would be his say. We will not have the opportunity to discuss many of the issues that were part of the preparatory consultation process over the past two years. We wanted a debate of substance but we will not get it because the amendments that have been allowed only skirt around the edges of the issues. We will not have rights-based legislation even if the Minister of State accepts all the Opposition amendments that have not been ruled out of order.The groups that took part in the consultative process had set their hopes high but have been let down. The National Association for Mentally Handicapped in Ireland, the co-ordinating body for more than 160 organisations providing services to approximately 26,000 people with intellectual disabilities stated this Bill, if enacted, would dilute the rights of people with disabilities and push them further into the margins of society.The National Parents' and Siblings' Alliance offered the view that the effect of the Bill was to give legislative support to existing inequalities and that it could not take the Bill seriously unless it were drastically redrawn because, as it stood, it was aimed at excluding a large number of people from receiving assessments and the resulting services. The organisation reminded legislators that history has shown that where there is no pressure on Government to provide services for people with disabilities, they are left at the bottom of the heap. This means that when they reach adulthood, not only have people with disabilities been damaged by State neglect, the intervention required is even more costly. I agree and urge the Government to change the Bill, not to insult people with disabilities and accept this amendment and the amendments flowing from it.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	198	Amendment No. 4 would relegate the remaining provisions of the Bill dealt with in Parts 3 to 7 to the status of miscellaneous provisions. I believe the Bill represents a more comprehensive response to the concerns of disability than the Title proposed seeks to convey. On amendment No. 5, putting exclusive emphasis on rights will not give us the most effective results.I want to refer again to the issue of resources, mentioned by three of the speakers. I pay particular attention to what Deputy Finian McGrath stated on this issue. He has personal experience as his daughter is a young person with disability. I must re-emphasise where we are coming from in respect of the problems outlined by various Deputies, most effectively by Deputy McGrath.The reality is that in the mid-1990s, just ten years ago when Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour all spent time in Government, the increase in funding for disabilities in any one year was approximately €1 million. That is where the difficulties lie. This year the extra amount provided in the Estimates is €290 million with an additional €150 million provided in the budget, which amounts to €440 million extra this year for services for people with disabilities. It means a total of €2.9 billion will be spent this year which is three times more than in 1997 and represents 7.5% of gross public expenditure.I am first to accept the point made eloquently by Deputy McGrath that there are serious gaps in the service and people are waiting for services. This Bill, however, is designed to underpin people's rights to obtain those services through an assessment, a service statement and the right of redress. The Bill is part of a multifaceted strategy that was outlined by the Taoiseach. In particular, the legislation will underpin a multi-annual expenditure programme, as outlined by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech. For the first time in the history of the State, half the budget speech was devoted to the provision of proper services for people with disabilities. Also of significance in that speech was the Minister's statement that the €900 million multi-annual expenditure over the next five years is only the start. It will be possible for him to provide extra resources over and above that in any one year during that period. There is no question, therefore, but that the Government is committed to providing resources in line with the points, correctly raised by the Opposition, about gaps in services. In those circumstances it is not necessary for people to go to court in order to have their rights determined by the Judiciary. There may have been a case for doing so ten or 15 years ago when all political parties neglected people with disabilities, but that is not the case today.The top three people in Government — the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance — are committed to implementing this Bill in the spirit in which it was framed. They are also committed to providing the necessary resources in order to implement the legislation and, therefore, I reject these amendments.

That takes in most matters, as almost everything in the Bill is about assessment and services, whether it concerns employment services, access services or genetic testing services. The wording "miscellaneous provisions" concerns the Minister's own Part 7. The Bill is about assessment and services for people with disabilities. Everything else is about assessment and services of some sort, or so it should be.The Minister referred to courts and he seems to have a fixation in this regard. He must have nightmares about being in court. However, court is the last place that people with disabilities want to be. If this Bill works as it should, they should never have to set foot in a court to get what they need.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	201	Exactly. The Minister should try to broaden his vision and take off the blinkers where courts are concerned. He is fixated by and scared stiff of courts. Every time he stands up he talks about courts and the Judiciary, but if the Bill works there will be no need for courts. Likewise, there will be no need to bar people from courts because they will not seek recourse to them. The Minister is preventing people from using the courts as a last resort but if the Bill does what is should, the courts would never be used in this respect. However, the Minister knows this Bill is flawed and he is bolting the door, and nailing it shut, so that people will not be able to use the judicial system.Courts are the last place that anyone wants to go, but people with disabilities are being forced there. We all know of numerous cases involving children with special needs whose parents go to court because the Government and the Department have dug in their heels and will not provide such services and supports until the courts instruct them that under the Constitution these children are entitled to them. That is the current position.If the Minister thinks the Bill is the cat's miaow, as he keeps telling us, then he should not be afraid of the courts as there will be no need for them. People would not bother going to court if the Bill worked. In barring access to the courts, however, the Minister is saying the Bill is fatally flawed. He has inserted that provision because he is fixated about courts and scared witless of them. Up to now, court is the only place in which people could obtain their entitlements.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Although I covered this point earlier, it would be remiss of me not to re-iterate my belief that it is unconstitutional to prevent anyone from vindicating their rights in court. I am not the only one who believes that. I know of no other legislation in which people are deliberately prevented from vindicating their rights in court. I could cite how many cases have come before the High Court and were eventually dealt with in the Supreme Court. Apart from one case of which I am aware, Supreme Court appeals in such cases have always been at the instigation of the Government which refused to accept the determination of the High Court. There have been five such cases. The Minister appears terrified by the notion of people vindicating their rights in court, but how would he like it if someone told him he was legally prohibited from going to court? The provision is unconstitutional and, therefore, the Minister should re-examine it. Given the way the legislation has been framed, it will have the opposite effect to that which is intended. Once again, the judges will become legislators, which none of us wants. I did not spend my political life trying to get into the Dáil and enact legislation only to hand that function over to the courts. God knows, there are bodies outside this House that do virtually everything legislators should be doing. The Judiciary should not be acting as legislators and I do not think they want to do so anyway. I intend to press amendment No. 5.

No Opposition Members or those in the disability sector — either providing services or those who are disabled — is denying that the Government has put additional resources into this area. The Government has the additional resources to put in, and it would have been an even worse scandal if it had not done so. The point is, however, to provide such resources as of right so that they will be there for the future. The Minister may cite the example of multi-annual funding and say that the Minister for Finance was very good to spend half his budget speech speaking about services for people with disabilities, but the Minister will not be there for ever. He will not be there in five years. He might not be there next year if the Taoiseach decides to change him, so we do not have guarantees in that respect. Ultimately, the disabled, those who work with them, their organisations and the Opposition are seeking guarantees of rights to ensure they will receive their just delivery of services. They must be treated as equal citizens in this State. We have already extensively covered the issue in our discussion of the first five amendments. In the opinion of the Equality Authority not only does the Bill not amount to additionality but its provisions could diminish and reduce existing equality provisions and protections with regard to direct and indirect discrimination, positive action, including a reasonable accommodation requirement, and employment and could reduce the provision of services as a result of a disproportionate burden test and the enforceability of these rights.The authority is particularly concerned that the Bill creates tensions with existing equality laws in that it marks a move away from the inclusive non-hierarchical rights based model contained in equality legislation. It is specifically concerned that the decision to avoid a more inclusive definition of "disability" will result in the Bill's provisions not being applicable to everyone with a disability. It is a pity my attempt to include, though amendment No. 12, the definition of disability used in other legislation has been ruled out of order because it would address the concerns of the Equality Authority.The Equality Authority is correct that the legislation creates a hierarchy of disabilities because its effect will be to reduce and diminish existing provisions. It will also be a source of confusion in the public sector. The authority maintains the provisions on access to buildings and services fall short of those already contained in equality legislation. This is the final opportunity for the Minister of State to change his mind and take steps to adopt a rights based Bill.

This leads me to conclude that he has no case to make. I suggest, therefore, that he accept the amendment, although I doubt, given the Government's track record to date, that any amendments tabled by the Opposition will be accepted. Nevertheless, we live in hope.The amendment reflects the Short Title the Bill should be given. The purpose of the legislation should be the provision of assessment and services for people with disabilities, which is what most of it, with the exception of Part 7 entitled "Miscellaneous", purports to do. If the Minister of State wishes to retain the Short Title, "Disability Bill", it is his call to do so given his majority in the House. However, it would not cause the sky to fall in to change the Short Title to reflect the fact that the Bill is for people with disabilities as opposed to being concerned solely with disability. I doubt, however, that the Minister of State has the authority to make such a change.

In page 5, to delete lines 31 to 36 and in page 6, to delete lines 1 to 8.I was not satisfied with the answers given by the Minister of State during a lengthy Committee Stage debate on a similar amendment. Usually a Bill automatically enters into force when it is signed by the President. Under the current provisions, the Minister may delay the Bill or introduce it in a piecemeal fashion if the Government so decides. While I accept a combination of factors must come together to form what the Minister of State describes as the disability strategy, it is unacceptable to give the Minister control over the timing and manner in which these elements are to be introduced. It would be wrong, for example, not to introduce the sectoral plans as quickly as possible because the Minister has the power to delay them as this would also delay the allocation of the limited resources available under the Bill. It is inappropriate to include such a provision. The legislation should take effect as soon as the President signs it, as is the case with all other Bills. A piecemeal approach towards implementing it will damage whatever benefits are available.I hope Deputies will not need to ask the Taoiseach month after month when the Disability Act will be implemented and when the Minister will sign the order. The Bill should be rolled out as soon as it is signed into law and then we can see what are its implications.While the mechanism for delay is unnecessary, I understand the reason it has been included. If, for instance, the Minister is not certain that everything he has indicated will become available, it is understandable that he will need to protect himself from an early onslaught as people discover the Bill does not do that which he claimed. The purpose of the amendment is to address this issue.

This is the first instance of a reference to the circumscription of services. Under Part 2, only the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science can make orders allowing a person to be the subject of an assessment of need and only for health and education services. I am opposed to this patronising, medical approach. It does not acknowledge or reflect the reality that people with a disability are routinely excluded by design from much more than health care and education services. They are excluded from the work place, independent living, transport, communications and participation in many aspects of life that non-disabled people take for granted. These structural impediments are obstacles to their full inclusion on an equal basis. Therefore, disability specific services, which should be provided on the basis of need and as of right, constitute much more than could be appropriately provided by the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science.I propose the deletion of section 1(3) and the reference to it in section 1(2). The formulation reflects the Government's view that the only services people with disabilities truly need and, therefore, should be assessed for can be provided by two Departments. I disagree with this. As the disability legislation consultation group has pointed out, disability-specific services that people with disabilities should have a right to are those which enable them to participate fully, as equals, in society and that maximise their ability to live their lives as independently as possible to their full potential as equal citizens: housing, training, employment support, transportation, access to communications and a range of other things that have nothing to do with health or education.The whole tone of the Bill is that people with disabilities are dependent on who needs to be cared for. We all must recognise people with disabilities as people with equal rights who are being prevented from exercising them by a society that is exclusive by design. This Bill does not recognise that and continues to patronise them. That is why my amendments seek to strike out the words "Subject to subsection (3)” and section 1(3) itself.The whole point of the recommendation that the legislation should assert the right of people with disabilities to an independent assessment of need is that such an assessment must be made independently of service providers, the Health Service Executive or the Department of Education and Science with their inevitable organisational and financial constraints. Otherwise the assessment will not reflect the individual's true needs and, therefore, will only become a statement of what is currently available to the person. That is not good enough.We oppose the Government's entire model for the assessment and appeals process and that opposition starts with section 1, which is why I have tabled amendments and support the other amendments we are discussing. We must address this now rather than making minor changes further on in the Bill. The Ceann Comhairle has ruled out many of my other amendments on this principle and I am forced to press this amendment because it is important that we ensure that the responsibilities of other Departments and the Government appear at an early stage in the legislation.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Section 1 provides for commencement orders by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of the Bill except for Part 2. This is a matter for the Minister Health and Children, after consultation with the Minister for Education and Science, as these Ministers have primary responsibility for the matters covered in that part of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 10 seek to remove from the Bill provisions relating to commencement, the intention being to allow immediate commencement on enactment. Such an approach would be unusual for a Bill of such size, diversity and complexity.With regard to Part 3, these provisions will become operative on 31 December 2005. When the Bill was published, the Taoiseach remarked that putting in place the full set of measures set out in the Bill will take time. The scope of the Bill is ambitious and people will understand that these services and supports will take time to put in place.The priority, however, for the Government is to enact the Bill, as promised in the programme for Government. The Government intends to implement the provisions of the Bill as quickly as possible. The HSE is working on the detail of the practical implementation of the new arrangements, regulations and standards that will come into being and the Government will implement this Bill as soon as physically possible.

We all want to see it start as soon as possible but there must be a mechanism to enable it to begin. That is standard in most Bills.The Minister of State did not react to amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 11, which are technical in nature. Does he agree with them or is he going to ignore them altogether? They propose the use of the active voice, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission. During the debate on the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, accepted amendments that were almost identical to these. Will the Government take the advice of the Law Reform Commission in its report on legislative drafting?Can the amendments be moved if amendment No. 6 falls? Why were they taken together? The three I have tabled have a totally different intention from amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 10.

The text as drafted is in accordance with these recommendations and uses the active voice and future tense, rather than the present tense as proposed by the amendment. This is the style used in the Bill so I will not accept the amendments.

I am grateful to Deputy Lynch for bringing this matter to my attention on Committee Stage.Deputy Lynch's amendment No. 14 proposes to alter the citation of the Local Government Acts in a different way. The Local Government Act 2001 contains the most up-to-date definition of a local authority. This Act replaced the definition in the 1941 Local Government Act which was used in the interpretation of relevant legislation prior to 2001. I am advised that a reference to the 2001 Local Government Act will be sufficient and is the preferred option from a legal perspective. Government amendment No. 62a deletes a reference to the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill which is unlikely to be enacted before the Disability Bill.

I amended the definition of passenger transport services on Committee Stage to reflect concerns expressed by Members and others that the definition was unduly wide and will encompass access to some mainstream train services. In doing so, I drew on the language and definition in the Transport Acts and in particular the 2001 Railway Safety Bill which is before the Oireachtas. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 15.

In page 7, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:"(i) any private body which provides services and products to the public;”.Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 deal with public moneys made available to private bodies. The concern is that if a private body provides services and products to the public using public money, it should be accountable. If public money is used, required services should be provided to people with disabilities.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	224	The Bill is a positive action measure geared to support participation by people with disabilities in society. It places a significant positive obligation on public service providers in this respect. The extension of such obligations to voluntary and private bodies could be viewed as an unreasonable encroachment into service organisations, particularly those run on a commercial basis. These organisations are already obliged to comply with employment equality and equal status legislation which is of relatively recent origin.These amendments would place certain obligations on voluntary and private bodies. Part 3 requires that services provided by public bodies are made accessible and would be subject to complaint ultimately to the Ombudsman. These amendments, if accepted, would, for example, require cinemas and shops to retrofit their premises over the next ten years. Sports centres would have to present all literature in accessible forms, irrespective of cost. Organisations, such as the National Women's Council, in receipt of State support would have to ensure any service they purchased is disability accessible.Part 5 established a statutory basis for the 3% employment target. This would be broadened to include the whole economy. If these amendments were accepted, those carrying out car tests for the national car test would be obliged to observe an employment target for people with disabilities. Similar provisions would extend to contractors in publicly funded road and building projects. I am not convinced that the proposed amendments would help in practical terms in attaining the goals of the Bill. It is better to maintain an approach based on the mainstream public bodies which we all use and which have a public duty to accommodate all citizens.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill 2005 is a short but vital Bill which proposes to protect the State's interests in property that has been acquired for industrial development purposes by IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Udarás na Gaeltachta by including these bodies among the State authorities that are not bound by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978.Section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1986 empowers IDA Ireland to purchase, lease and dispose of property for the establishment, development or maintenance of an industrial undertaking but for no other purpose. This was amended by the Industrial Development Act 1995 to permit IDA Ireland to dispose of properties for other purposes but only with the express consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. To comply with the requirement of the 1986 Act and for good estate management reasons, IDA Ireland adopted the practice of selling property by way of long lease, usually for a term of 999 years, with a covenant restricting the use of the land to manufacturing or the supply of internationally traded services. The leases also contain provision for rent review which removes them from the scope of the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts that entitle a leaseholder to acquire the fee simple. Acquisition of the fee simple under the Acts would result in the covenant restricting the use of the land being extinguished. IDA Ireland estimates that it has entered into over 700 such leases.In December 1981, IDA Ireland granted a lease of a unit in one of its industrial estates to a client company which subsequently erected industrial premises on the land. The original client assigned its interest to a second company in 2000 which, in turn, granted a sub-lease to a third company in November 2004. The following day a notice of intention to acquire the fee simple interest was served on IDA Ireland by the third company. It transpired that the sub-lease had been structured in such a manner — entailing a term of 50 years plus one day, the payment of a fee and no provision for rent review — as to comply with the conditions in the Landlord and Tenant Acts entitling a lessee to acquire the fee simple. The second and third companies are connected companies.IDA Ireland contested the application when it was heard before the county registrar on 7 April 2005 and the hearing was first adjourned to 18 April and subsequently to 17 May. However, senior counsel advised IDA Ireland that the sub-lease conferred a statutory entitlement to acquire the freehold interest. This was confirmed by advice provided to the Attorney General. On the basis of this advice, the IDA decided to negotiate a settlement and agreed a price for the conveyance of the fee simple. Having been advised by the Attorney General, I decided to grant my consent to this settlement to secure the best return to the Exchequer in the circumstances. The county registrar was informed of the proposed settlement at the resumed hearing on Tuesday, 17 May.This case, which was first brought to my Department's attention on 2 March 2005, highlights that a legitimate scheme can be devised whereby sub-leases created by lessees can establish an entitlement for the sub-lessee to acquire the fee simple, thus extinguishing restrictive covenants in the head lease. This anomalous situation, whereby a sub-lessee can extinguish an agreement between the lessee and a third party, was noted by the Law Reform Commission in 1989 and again in 1992. This has serious implications for IDA Ireland both in the execution of its statutory functions and also in the possible loss of value to the State in any sale of its land assets. In addition, inquiries by my Department have shown that there are also similar implications for Shannon Free Airport Development Company and Údarás na Gaeltachta in the operation of their property functions related to their industrial development roles.On learning of this issue, my Department immediately examined the matter, including initial examination of the legal and practical implications both in the specific case cited above and the general implications in respect of the impact on the role and effectiveness of the State's industrial development agencies and the assets they hold on behalf of the State. When these became clearer, the matter was brought to my attention on 13 April and a process was put in place to remedy the situation. This has led to the Bill which I am presenting to the Houses of the Oireachtas today.High standard property solutions, both business parks and buildings, for both inward investment and indigenous enterprises are crucial for regional industrial development in Ireland. To provide attractive locations for such inward investment and indigenous enterprise, elaborate master plans have been drawn up for such estates. If individual tenants are entitled to purchase the fee simple, thereby circumventing the covenants in the original head leases, then the agencies concerned will not be able to ensure that such property continues to be used for the legislative purposes for which it was provided. In effect, the agencies' ability to control activities on their industrial estates will be undermined.As well as giving rise to a situation whereby State assets are not being used for the purposes of each of the agencies' industrial development mandate, the agencies will also be faced with estate management issues in that they will not be able to enforce covenants such as "quiet enjoyment" on their estates. It is also unlikely that a tenant will continue to pay service charges if another occupier is not paying similar charges. There will also be a loss in the value of State assets. Using the sublease mechanism, the private sector may be put in a position to make substantial gains from property, which was originally provided by Exchequer funding. There is a substantial difference in value between a freehold title and a leasehold title subject to covenants and it is clear that the valuation mechanism set out in the landlord and tenant legislation, which is based on a multiple of the ground rent, will not yield that value to the head lessor, in this case, the three named agencies.The selling price sought by the agencies is determined by valuation, which is based on the existence of the restrictive user covenants. If the covenants cannot be enforced, the selling price of the land should be higher to reflect the freedom of the purchaser to use the land as he or she pleases. This may make the selling price unattractive to potential purchasers, including inward investment concerns, who intend to use the property for qualifying activities, and will consequently adversely affect the agencies' ability to carry out their industrial development functions.The advice of the Attorney General was sought regarding the legislative action necessary to prevent the widespread use of the device employed in the case mentioned. The Attorney General has advised that an amendment be made to section 4 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, which states, "This Act shall not bind a Minister of the Government, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland or the Irish Land Commission". The purpose of the amendment would be to include IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta among the "State authorities" that are not bound by the legislation.IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta enter into leasehold arrangements in respect of their properties in the context of their industrial development functions. IDA Ireland has estimated its ownership of State property is at risk in regard to more than 700 leases. While the current application has been settled out of court, there is no guarantee that it will not act as a catalyst for similar cases. The Attorney General has advised that the proposed legislative amendment could not apply retrospectively where a notice of intention to acquire the fee simple in land leased from one of the agencies has been served.Accordingly, considerable urgency attaches to securing early passage of the amending provision. I, therefore, urge all Members to support the Bill, the objective of which is to protect the interests of taxpayers and the State. I thank the Opposition Members I briefed last night and this morning for their co-operation and understanding. The Bill was introduced with a view to its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas in one day, and Presidential signature without delay. In view of the circumstances outlined, this is considered to be of the utmost urgency and necessity.The Bill is short, containing only four sections. Section 1 defines the relevant Acts. Section 2 provides for the amendment of section 4 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 by adding the Industrial Development Agency (Ireland), the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and Údarás na Gaeltachta to the list cited. The opportunity has also been taken to remove the reference to the Irish Land Commission, as it no longer exists. Section 3 provides the appropriate savers in respect of notice of intention or an application made regarding the acquisition of the fee simple before the passing of the Bill or any arbitration or appeal to the Circuit Court in respect of such a notice or application. Section 4 sets out the short title of the Bill and the collective citation. I commend the Bill to this House.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this rushed legislation. Fine Gael is fed up with the Government's attitude to doing business. On the one hand, its attitude to the nation's infrastructure reflects paralysis and tardiness, as a result of which airports take decades to build, motorways take years and stadiums do not get built at all. On the other hand, a flurry of emergency legislation continually passes through the Chamber and barely a week goes by without an amendment to the Dáil schedule. There is always a crisis. We recently dealt with the aftermath of the Minister's incompetence and neglect of his duties on nursing home charges, about which the Supreme Court sent the Government packing. It does nobody a service to govern or legislate this way. The House is an instrument of scrutiny and its function is to hold the Executive to account and not to rubber-stamp the Executive's demands, pat it on the head and say, "There, there".The Bill will be passed but it will not be taken in the manner it should following appropriate scrutiny, reflection and debate. However, I thank the Minister and his officials for their briefing earlier and I fully accept the legislation is urgently needed. The Bill covers IDA Ireland, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Shannon Development. The latter is a powerhouse of job creation in my constituency and in the mid-west generally. Shannon Development is a fine agency. It created more than 1,521 jobs in 2004 bringing total employment in the firms with which it deals to 20,000. The companies had a collective turnover of €4.4 billion last year, of which €3 billion comprised exports. It is a good agency and I will support legislation that protects it. The agency does excellent work on research and development projects, the Atlantic technology corridor, the digital media cluster, the western regional tourism initiative and so on, which I welcome.I am at a loss to know what has happened in recent days to necessitate the Bill's immediate passage. The Minister stated why the legislation must be passed today but we would have liked more time. In December 1981 the IDA granted a lease of a unit to a client company, which built an industrial premises, as was its right. The company subsequently passed on its interest to another company, which, in turn, passed it on to another in 2004. The three companies were linked. However, subsequently, a notice of intention to acquire a fee simple or freehold was served on the IDA. It beggars belief that the law permitted this to happen. It is amazing that a company can pay €7 million for a property, subject to restricted use, a rent review and long lease, and can then set up a puppet company to circumvent the law. The company attempted to rob the State, even though it did so in a legitimate fashion, and its owners should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves. I can imagine their lawyers were rubbing their hands with glee when they noticed the flaw in the legislation, which allowed them to seize land designated for the promotion of enterprise and industry and do as they wished with it. The company is based in Clonshaugh industrial park and it has taken all of us for a ride. In addition, the legislation cannot be made retrospective because an out of court settlement was made and, therefore, the company has got away with it.The legislation is designed to prevent this and similar companies from legally but immorally stripping the State of its assets. I challenge the company owners, which, despite Dáil privilege, I will not name, though it does not deserve an ounce of kindness from the institutions of the State, to publicly state how it can justify their actions. How can they honestly say they did a good day's work? How do they sleep at night? It is fair enough that the law was on their side. What moral compass do they use in their everyday lives that allows them to exploit this legislative flaw?The company acquired the land from IDA Ireland in 1981. At that time, the country was on its knees. Inflation was averaging 20%, unemployment was creeping up to 20%, tax rates were high, emigration was part of everyday life and our debt to gross domestic product ratio was 100%. The economic situation was so bleak that it seemed that the future of the State itself was in doubt. The prospects for our economic improvement were not helped by the bombing campaigns of the IRA and the UVF in Northern Ireland. Against this background, the company in question sought assistance from the IDA. The IDA went to a very bare cupboard and gave the company assistance to make investment attractive.Now, when the Celtic Tiger is roaring and we have low tax rates, low inflation, higher employment and net inward migration, this company sees an opportunity to make a quick buck and attempts to take it. The motivation is unclear. Perhaps it hopes the land will be zoned as residential land and believes that a few more apartment blocks would not hurt anybody. It may hurt our industrial infrastructure to have apartments located in an industrial park, but the company does not care about this. Maybe the value of the site, zoned industrial, was a major attraction or perhaps this is a test case, with IDA Ireland the potential loser of millions of euro.In this context, Fine Gael will act appropriately in a patriotic manner and support the Bill. The way business is conducted can be nasty, without a doubt. Despite my criticisms of the rushing of this legislation, I accept that it is a response to the instincts of some in business. I will not table any amendments to the Bill on Committee or Report Stage as I am aware that the Minister is anxious that the Bill be signed by the President before she leaves on a State visit.My party is willing to trust the Minister and the Government on this legislation and I hope that trust is well placed. I also hope that this Bill covers other areas of concern, for example, industrial land owned by local authorities and semi-State bodies. Can the Minister clarify if such lands are also protected under this legislation? I will not delay any further because I know that the Minister wants this Bill to be given a speedy passage through the House. Fine Gael will support his efforts in this instance, but I hope that we will not be presented with rushed legislation on a weekly basis.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	231	This Government acts very strangely at times. There are a number of items which have been on the legislative programme for a long time, some of which are concerned with property rights, which the Government, perhaps because of an ongoing dispute between the two parties, is unable to address. For example, the Labour Party has been calling for the abolition of ground rents for some time. This Bill deals with property rights but it does not deal with the ground rents issue.Another more important issue that has not been dealt with is the price of land for schools. When a local authority rezones land for housing purposes, developers benefit by tens of millions of euro through the automatic, follow-on rezoning of sites for schools. The Minister, as a former Minister for Education and Science, knows the extraordinary failure of the Government to take on land speculators regarding the enormous increase in the cost of sites for both houses and schools. School sites in Dublin now cost at least €1 million per acre and this is probably also true of the Cork area.However, while the Government is aware of this crisis and school groups and communities have often protested outside Leinster House on the issue, this Administration cannot exercise any urgency in dealing with it. We have instead been presented so quickly with a Bill that when I sought advice on it, the only similar emergency legislation some of those to whom I spoke could recall was the Offences Against the State Act which was passed overnight in very different circumstances in 1985. It granted the power to seize identified funds held by the IRA in bank accounts to prevent that organisation from withdrawing moneys at a moment's notice.IDA Ireland owns approximately 700 commercial properties and the deal to which the Minister referred concerns one property in Clonshaugh in north Dublin. He informed the House that the purpose of the Bill is to protect the interest that the State holds in property acquired for industrial development purposes by IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta. This is another emergency Bill but it is very different from the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Act, which was introduced in a similar cloak and dagger fashion two weeks ago. There is no reference in the explanatory memorandum to a possible technical defect giving rise to this Bill. There was a technical defect in the original British-Irish Agreement legislation concerning Waterways Ireland, which is why the Labour Party supported the emergency amending legislation. It was clear that the Government had intended that the original Act would treat North-South bodies as State authorities for the purposes of landlord and tenant law. It had not achieved its intention because of a drafting error. We supported that Bill because it was intended to restore what everyone understood to be the status quo ante.Members of the Houses have not been given any explanation about a mistake in the original drafting of the 1978 ground rents legislation. No one could ever reasonably have assumed that IDA Ireland, Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company had, or were ever intended to have, the benefits of State authority status under that Act. No one could have believed that IDA Ireland was a Minister or an authority in the now defunct Land Commission or the Office of Public Works. What is being attempted is a surreptitious amendment to substantive law to correct the case to which the Minister referred. Added to this, the Bill confers substantial new and additional benefits and perhaps it is correct to do so. However, the manner of the Bill's introduction has not afforded Deputies the opportunity to consult or discuss the merits of conferring these additional benefits. As Deputy Pat Breen said, all Members support IDA Ireland and want to see its status and position protected but we have not been given the opportunity to tease out the substantial additional rights conferred by this Bill.Policy issues are involved that deserve greater consideration. The Labour Party opposes ground rents and would support any mechanism for their abolition. They are an unnecessary and anachronistic relic of bygone times and serve only to act as an irritating obstruction to the otherwise complete capacity to sell, bequeath and dispose of domestic property. It is only ground rents we are talking about, not normal arms' length commercial leases. The 1978 Act creates a right to buy out the landlord's freehold interest where one of a small number of alternative conditions set out in the Act is satisfied. The most generally relevant condition is that the lease is for not less than 50 years and the annual rent is for less than the annual rateable valuation of the property. At a briefing this morning, I understood it is IDA policy to grant 99-year or 999-year leases. How many multinationals could conceivably enjoy the benefits of that sort of tenancy agreement? The agreements covered in the 1978 Act apply to domestic dwellings.There are a number of constitutional questions. The sole purpose served in introducing this Bill without notice and seeking to have it enacted in one day is to prevent any person paying ground rent to an industrial development body from escaping the application of this measure by serving a notice of intention to acquire the fee simple of his or her property. Has the Attorney General advised whether the statutory entitlement created by the 1978 Act, the right of a property owner, including a domestic property owner, to enlarge his or her interest in that property, is not to be characterised for constitutional purposes as being a property right and so protected from arbitrary interference? Has the Supreme Court judgment on the Health (Amendment) Bill been taken into account?I call attention to what the current authors of the late Professor Kelly's textbook, The Irish Constitution, say:If a statute without little self-evident justification were to exempt the State from legislation regulating ordinary private rights and duties — such as, for example, the landlord and tenant Acts — then its constitutionality would surely be open to question in the light of the specific reservation to this effect contained in Mrs Justice Denham's judgment.I am not a lawyer but this is precisely the sort of legislation we are being asked to pass today as speedily as possible and without any opportunity to consider the justification of extending the exemptions from ground rent legislation to include bodies such as IDA Ireland. To be honest, the Minister is leaning on the good will of the different parties in the House who, without exception, are in favour of protecting the interests of the agency. However, we are not lawyers, were not elected as such and have had no time to consult on the matter. This is a bad principle. This is the second time in three weeks that the Government has introduced legislation in a rushed manner to the House.The Bill will also create another distinction, possibly arbitrary and unjustified, between those tenants who may have commenced the procedure to enlarge their interest before the enactment of this legislation and those who discover today that such an avenue is being shut off. Is that discrimination constitutional? The impression is being given, with which I agree, that we are trying to block a loophole which was found by some clever lawyers who are either property owners or advisers to property owners.Another question arises. IDA Ireland receives significant amounts of State money, the State spends fortunes on lawyers' fees and the Attorney General has a very well staffed office. If this was a problem, why was it not noticed? Has the Attorney General conducted a review of similar owners of property who are State-subsidised or State-sponsored bodies in some way, for example, vocational education committees, county councils and so on? Is this provision simply a result of diligence on the part of civil servants in the Department, which would be to their credit, or is it a general point on which the Attorney General has advised? We need information in that regard.Will section 70 of the 1980 Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, a subsequent provision which modifies the general exemption of State authorities and creates a right to buy out the fee simple in the case of dwelling houses, subject to the right of a State authority to prevent alienation of property where it considers that the public interest so requires, also apply to these three bodies? Deputies on all sides of the House would be familiar with cases where people acquired property from the State as a result, for example, of being in the employment of the State as soldiers and so on. Have the ramifications of this legislation been checked out and has the Attorney General done a thorough review? If the answer is "No", one of the three listed bodies will be able to block a tenant from acquiring the fee simple in a dwelling house if it certifies that it is satisfied that such acquisition would not be in the public interest. What precisely does this mean? Is the public interest equivalent to that of the body? Is the maintenance of a body's property portfolio in the public interest? If so, does it outweigh the importance of the public interest in the effective operation of socially progressive legislation designed to relieve the population from the remnants of an outmoded property interest?I point this out as a member of the Labour Party because in 1973 when I was a student, Dublin was still reeling from the housing crisis as a consequence of houses falling down in the 1960s. The then Labour Minister for Local Government, Jimmy Tully, gave local authority tenants the right to buy out their houses. This was fundamental reform for the country which has benefited local authority tenants everywhere. We have a progressive attitude here that where people have a long-standing tenancy, particularly in a private dwelling house, they build up and acquire rights to acquire the property. I am not challenging the Minister's concern with regard to the bodies, such as the IDA, which fall within his remit and his desire to protect their interests, but what ramifications does this have with regard to rights to acquire property in a socially progressive manner from the State in certain circumstances? Have the ramifications been examined?Although this Bill is very short, introducing such legislation at the last minute means it could go wrong. I am sure the Minister has not forgotten the Department of Health and Children to the extent that he cannot remember the recent legislation which was introduced, the Health (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2004, which was intended to plug the ongoing exposure of up to €2 billion as a result of the nursing home situation. That was bells-ringing emergency legislation, but despite that, it was still presented to the House on a Monday and debated on the following Thursday and Friday. If the Minister has been aware of this problem and his Department clearly has been for some time, it is not good enough to give the House just a few hours in which to consider it.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	234	Once again we are here on a Thursday afternoon at the end of a Dáil week discussing emergency legislation. Not only is this is a repetition of a process we went through two weeks ago, it is something that has happened regularly in the life of this Government. I suspect that any analysis would show that this Government has processed more emergency legislation than any previous Government. It is unsatisfactory that we have had many debates on emergency legislation, at short notice, at the end of the Dáil week.The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill 2005 has been introduced in a similar fashion to a Bill that was debated in the House two weeks ago. We need to ask whether the Government has got its act together in this regard. I refer to the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill 2005, introduced by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs two weeks ago. It was clear that certain cross-Border bodies were facing difficulties in acquiring the fee simple of properties because the UK legislation in this area was far more progressive than that in this jurisdiction. We needed to amend our legislation to ensure that people could not compromise properties belonging to cross-Border bodies, particular Waterways Ireland, by taking commercial advantage of them.The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, two weeks later, is trying to plug a similar loophole that affects IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta. I wonder whether we will find at a later stage that other loopholes need to be plugged. Do we need to legislate to give similar protection to assets owned by other State agencies and Departments? I refer to the VECs and the Health Service Executive, for example.Given that the Government has panicked by producing two Bills to plug two loopholes, it is clear that it does not know what part of the dyke it will have to stick its thumb in next. The Minister needs to respond proactively on this issue. It is not as if the Government has not been forewarned about the issue of property rights. Although 13 months have passed since the All-Party Committee on the Constitution produced its report on property rights with great fanfare, no legislative action has been taken to try to improve this country's property law.The Oireachtas is about to pass the second of two emergency Bills, but the many people who continue to live under the "anachronism" of ground rents, as Deputy Burton called it, will not benefit. Such people will continue to suffer as a consequence of the Government's failure to issue an appropriate legislative response. My house has a ground rent, which is payable to a local authority. Perhaps I should learn a lesson from the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill 2005 and today's Bill by turning my household into a limited company and challenging Cork City Council. That might provoke the Government into taking the necessary action. I will discuss such an approach with my wife when I get home later today.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Other aspects of the State's ownership of buildings and properties may be open to challenge. What about the new forms of ownership the Government proposes to foist upon us? The Minister, Deputy Martin, is familiar with the use of public private partnerships from his time as Minister for Education and Science. The Government has considered the possibility of using such partnerships in areas like the development of roads and the health service. Do questions of property and ownership arise in that regard? I suggest that Deputies might have to return to this Chamber to plug further loopholes of that nature.It is unfortunate that we are not considering the wider value for money aspects of IDA Ireland's management of its property portfolio in the context of this debate. IDA Ireland has taken out long-term leases on advance factories that have never been used or have been vacated not long after being occupied. It is costing the State millions of euro. Although we might save money by plugging this loophole, such ongoing problems will continue to exist. I hope the House will have an opportunity to discuss such matters properly as part of a wider debate.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Deputy Ó Caoláin outlined Sinn Féin's position on this legislation on the Order of Business this morning. Sinn Féin will not oppose the Bill because it understands that it is urgently needed. I acknowledge that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment contacted Opposition spokespersons yesterday evening to brief those of us who were able to attend the meeting. The Minister and some of his officials met those who were available again this morning to provide a fuller briefing about this emergency legislation.I was pleased when I discovered this morning that the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill 2005 was to be discussed in the House, because I thought the Government had finally introduced legislation to deal with all aspects of the ground rent issue. There was not much chance of that, however. I quickly realised that I was engaged in wishful thinking.I have reiterated Sinn Féin's demand for the abolition of ground rents on many occasions. My party set out its stall on this issue in the submission on property rights it made to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. It seems I need to make that case again because legislation on this matter has failed to materialise, despite a commitment from the Government. I will take this opportunity to do so. Ground rents, which are a form of feudal tax, represent an ongoing injustice against the people of this State. They are a hangover from the days of British colonial rule in Ireland and their abolition must be facilitated. Ground rent landlords should not receive compensation if ground rents are abolished. As a legacy of colonialism, ground rents have been unjust from the start. Therefore, to compensate would legitimise what is manifestly unfair.It is to the shame of consecutive Governments that this issue has not been dealt with in more than 80 years, since the establishment of the Twenty-six Counties State. Various Ministers have given the excuse of possible constitutional difficulties as a reason for putting this overdue legislation on the long finger. I ask the Government to introduce legislation now and to allow it to be tested in the Supreme Court, as was done with Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2002. If such legislation is unconstitutional, we can have a constitutional referendum to allow for improved legislation.Householders whose leases are about to expire are placed in an unacceptable position when they are forced to choose between buying a freehold on their house for one eighth of its value or signing a new lease for a drastically increased rent. As the value of houses is increasing, people whose leases are due to expire are justifiably angry and concerned. The alternative for those who cannot afford to buy out the expired lease is to sign a renewal of the lease for 35 years.In 1997, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, who was then in Opposition, commended a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill on ground rents to the House. He said "all Members accept that its preparation involved an enormous amount of teasing out and discussion to ensure its provisions were justified on constitutional grounds." If the Bill was constitutional when Fianna Fáil was in opposition, why is it unconstitutional when Fianna Fáil is in government?The ninth progress report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to which Deputy Boyle referred, recommended that legislation be introduced to abolish ground rents. Why has the Government failed to act on that recommendation, especially as we have been told that it is a Government priority? When can we expect to see legislation on the abolition of ground rents before the House? Sinn Féin will continue to hound the Government until ground rents have been abolished and the subjection of citizens of the State to unjust tyranny from ground rent landlords has been brought to an end.As I appreciate the urgency of the Bill before the House, I will not oppose it. This matter should have been dealt with in the context of a single ground rents Bill that deals with all the outstanding issues I have mentioned.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I understand and accept that there is sometimes a need for emergency legislation to be brought before the House at short notice. In this instance, I received much less notice than Deputy Morgan. The debate on this Bill has replaced the discussion on suicide that was to take place this afternoon. I wonder whether the decision to cancel the debate on suicide betrays the attitude to the problem of suicide that is found at a high level. Ten young people lose their lives to suicide each week. There are more than 220 instances of self-harm each week. While I accept that there is an urgent need for the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill 2005, I suggest that the House should have considered extending its sitting hours today or meeting tomorrow to accommodate this emergency legislation. I have mentioned the existing attitude to suicide. I regret that the debate on the issue of suicide has been put on the back burner.With regard to the Bill, the availability of industrial land is the most important factor in attracting new business ventures to rural or regional areas. In recent years, the private sector has taken up the slack and has been willing to buy property where a profit is likely. It is that prospect of economic gain that drives the private sector. However, areas must also attract public sector agencies.Three major public sector agencies are involved in the provision of industrial property for the purpose of achieving economic growth, either nationally or in regional and peripheral areas. IDA Ireland provides industrial land and property in the pursuit of national and industrial development objectives, Shannon Development uses industrial land to achieve its primary target of economic growth in the Shannon region and Údarás na Gaeltachta provides industrial property to increase employment in Gaeltacht areas as a means of preserving and extending the use of the Irish language.These three agencies not only need to maintain their current land supply but also to acquire and develop additional land to be able to meet future demand for industrial sites. This is a vital activity, particularly for IDA Ireland, which concentrates on selling serviced land for development by private sector contractors. However, it can happen that these agencies may have more land on hand than may be required to meet demand in certain areas. In the past IDA Ireland and Shannon Development held lands that were in the wrong places or unlikely to be used in the foreseeable future.Prices paid for lands by the agencies are generally, although not always, felt to be reasonable, but the indicative costs of development land are generally higher for the agencies than the private sector would normally be willing to pay. In the past 50 years, IDA Ireland, in particular, has a history of assisting the private sector to invest in the provision of industrial buildings. The peripheral nature of the areas served by the other agencies makes it more difficult for them to encourage private sector involvement.Due to the growth of the greater Dublin area, attention should be given to providing the physical infrastructure to accommodate development corridors in a sustainable manner and in appropriate locations, including along national primary routes. In that regard, I would like to see development take place along the routes to counties Cavan and Monaghan, which now have much improved access to Dublin. Developing individual centres should not be considered in isolation, but should be linked to coordinated policies by the three agencies throughout the country.In my constituency, a case has arisen involving a landlord, JES Holdings, on behalf of the Shirley estate, which has taken High Court action against the State and a leading businessman who is a leaseholder in Carrickmacross. Leaseholders number almost half of the town's businesspeople and this appears to be a test case against them. The Shirley estate has had a long-running gripe against the State, which it claims denies it the constitutional right to own and keep its own property.This follows a successful test case taken against the landlord by the business people in an attempt to purchase the respective freeholds on their Main Street properties at market value. The Shirley estate leases affect a total of 50 businesses in the town, and the issue is a major bone of contention in Carrickmacross. If the High Court decision in favour of the business people is again upheld, the floodgates may then be open for all qualifying 99 year leaseholders to purchase their respective leaseholds.This is a situation where the landlord abused leaseholds in 1991, when leases came up for renewal. In one case, that of the former post office, the rent soared from £35 a year to £10,500 a year, despite the tenants having carried out renovations to the property. These enormous and exorbitant hikes have been instrumental in stagnating business development on much of the west side of Carrickmacross. Many Shirley leaseholders in Carrickmacross are now afraid to spend money on their premises because they are unsure whether any improvements would be for their own benefit or for that of the Shirley estate.Stagnation has been caused in Carrickmacross, which is a good market town. The tenants live and work in the town but are unsure whether to develop their businesses. If they do so, they must keep pace with rent increases. They are caught in a catch-22 situation.

I refer to two aspects of the Bill: the necessity for the rush to bring it before the House and its content in regard to provision for our industrial development agencies.Like other speakers, I regret that Bills come before the House at short notice because hasty legislation does not always make for the best legislation. However, I accept that the Government does not have much option when issues are highlighted at short notice. In protecting the State's assets and interests, the Government must act with haste in this instance. It is commendable that we have moved so quickly and found time in the schedule of the House to deal with the Bill.This haste begs the question as to how the House orders its business. Ground rent is an issue that everybody talks about, like draining the River Shannon. However, many other Bills have been waiting for time in the House, which operates for just three days at a time. I accept that there was an urgency to introduce particular provisions to tighten up in this area so nefarious practices would not be accommodated. However, one would wish for a system whereby all legislation is constantly monitored, and Members had time to check for loopholes in legislation, rather than having loopholes found on behalf of property developers. Members, who are on the inside, so to speak, should consider legislation as it is being drafted or debated. They would spot any loopholes fairly quickly.We should have a programme for reform of legislation. In my short time in the House, there has been quite a good deal of emergency legislation. All Members, including those on the Government side, regret that we have to bring in such rushed and hasty legislation. Nonetheless, when the purpose of legislation is to protect State interests and assets, we cannot but act in that way. Therefore, I welcome the harmony in the House in dealing with the Bill. It is magnanimous of the House that there does not appear to be opposition to it. We are doing our duty in protecting the possessions and assets of the State.The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, this morning described the situation as a "legal lacuna". Given that this legal void exists and has been identified, it is of the utmost importance that the Bill is passed quickly. It is our duty in the House to protect the State's assets from any potential nefarious practices. We do not know whether such practices would ensue but it is likely they would. However, we need to close loopholes when they are found.The matter only came to Cabinet yesterday, where it was agreed time was of the essence. I commend the Minister for making a genuine effort in this regard. He is no doubt grateful that Members have acknowledged that he facilitated them with relevant briefings. As stated on the Order of Business this morning, those Members of the House who have been in Government in the past will recognise that a matter such as this requires an urgent response from all sides of the House, in particular when it serves to protect the interests of the House. Unfortunately, the House must act in haste at times.On the specific content of the Bill, the industrial development agencies listed — IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta — play a necessary and valuable role in promotion and development in their respective areas of concern. I am sure all Members will join me in commending the work they have done over the years. They deserve and are entitled to expect the protection of the State.The settlement to which the Minister referred earlier has serious implications for the IDA in terms of the execution of its statutory functions and the possible loss of value to the State in any sale of its land assets. There are implications for Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta in the operation of their property functions related to their industrial development. We have a duty to safeguard the ability of these valuable agencies to control the activities on their industrial estates and we must also ensure that the State's assets will be used for the purposes for which the agencies have been mandated. We must allow the agencies the ability to enforce other covenants and requirements while not being hampered in any way.I welcome the Bill, but rather than have bits and pieces of amended legislation we must try to take a holistic approach to Bills and legislative reform.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I do not like rushed legislation, of which we have had much recently. Rushed legislation is bad legislation and usually results from such. This Bill is some 30 years too late. I call on RTE's "Prime Time" to do a programme on IDA land bought since the foundation of the State. I could provide it with information about my town and surrounding areas where the State bought IDA land for development purposes and there are now hotels, private houses and apartments there. Údarás na Gaeltachta had land in north Mayo and now there are mushroom factories and all sorts of development on land paid for by the taxpayer.A new scandal is brewing because the developers got all the land they could from Údarás and the IDA and are now looking to the county councils. The Minister should amend the Bill to tie in local authorities using taxpayers' money to buy land for the State. A number of local businesses set up an industrial estate in my town and did a great job. However, there are always wise guys, builders and investors and they bought the estate on the condition that if they did not have planning permission within six months they would return the property to the local authority. People are now letting, reselling and letting again and this should be stopped. Now that the Minister has initiated the legislation, he should include an amendment to curtail local authorities so that they cannot give land to somebody unless they immediately set up their industry and adhere to every clause. What is currently happening is wrong and should be dealt with.There is already a national scandal, which the Minister and his predecessors continue to stand over. There is a factory in Ballinrobe that has been empty for 19 of the past 20 years and the IDA renegotiates a deal every five years. The people who own the factory are getting €160,000 per year for an empty factory. This is a great country if we can afford to pay people such amounts for nothing.My town is about to lose approximately 300 jobs and the Minister gave a commitment that he would come and visit. I hope he keeps his promise. We have a problem in the west of Ireland in terms of unemployment and the IDA has failed in that regard. The Government has directed that there must be a bias towards the west with regard to Objective One status. The IDA is not filling its quota in terms of supplying jobs to the BMW region. The Minister should immediately put pressure on the IDA to ensure that it honours the Government's commitment and the provisions of this legislation to ensure that a certain quota of jobs go to the west of Ireland. There is an overflow in Dublin city and people cannot live there any longer.Many industries have worked well in the west, such as Allergan, even though there has been a bit of a setback. Some 300 people will leave that company over the next two weekends. I ask the Minister to visit Mayo to ascertain what can be done. He should bring the State agencies with him because we do not see much of them. We want a commitment from the Government that every effort will be made to honour it's promise that a percentage of jobs will be created in the west of Ireland.With regard to this Bill, I hope the Minister will include an amendment covering the local authorities. Land the State bought is not used for the purposes for which it was bought. Nobody should be allowed to build shops, apartments, houses or factories on industrial land bought with taxpayers' money. That land should be used for industrial purposes and employment. There is no excuse for somebody else getting the land. There must be 16 or 17 legal advisers in the Attorney General's office. We should be able to include amendments so that when companies coming to Ireland receive IDA land paid for by the taxpayer they are not allowed to build houses, apartments hotels or factories on it. That should be corrected in this legislation.I do not like rushed legislation and hope our senior spokesman is up early this week to put down the necessary amendments to ensure that this provision is included. The days are over where industrial sites were given to big builders and industrialists to use for a year or two, close down the factories and start building what they like after that. This legislation is rushed but necessary. As we are passing it through the Houses, let us do so correctly. Let us cover the local authorities, Údarás na Gaeltachta and the IDA to make sure that what has happened will not happen again.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate and for facilitating this urgent and immediate emergency legislation. Nobody likes to bring in legislation at such short notice. However, it is designed to protect State assets and the policy context within which the IDA, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta operate in terms of the utilisation of these assets and industrial parks and the application of those assets for the benefit of creating jobs.Deputy Pat Breen raised issues about the case that acted as a catalyst for the publication and formulation of this legislation. I appreciate his assertion that Fine Gael will support the Bill because of its desire to safeguard State assets.There has been a correct policy of endeavouring to manage estates properly and control the type of developments and investments that take place. This sometimes requires patience because estates are not always developed as quickly as some would like. We have all seen examples of how badly managed industrial parks and estates can turn away investment and make a location unattractive. The IDA has been largely successful in applying this policy in respect of lands within its ownership by placing covenants to secure manufacturing, restricting the land from manufacturing or international traded services. People have, from time to time, questioned and called for a review of the policies, and Deputy Burton alluded to this in her contribution. Notwithstanding the passage of this legislation, those policy issues can still be considered and debated again. This legislation does not preclude such a discussion of the idea of policy in terms of the most effective utilisation of land within IDA ownership.The IDA has a very active property portfolio. It has been in the business of selling some of its property and creating new, more modern industrial, business and technology parks, which are more fitting and appropriate for the attraction of inward investment. It has always had to do that with the consent of the Minister of the day in accordance with statute and legislation. There is nothing underhand in that kind of exercise or transaction.In the context of Deputy Burton's contribution, the Attorney General has advised that the section 4 amendment is the most appropriate mechanism to deal with this situation as it has arisen, and that is in the constitutional and legislative context. The Attorney General has advised on this issue and the Office of the Attorney General has been closely involved with both the individual case and with the more general issue that has arisen from that case.In essence, the purpose of the Bill is to exclude the IDA, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Shannon Development from the operation of the Ground Rents Acts save in the special case of dwelling houses which, in the case of these bodies, is not relevant in any event. This legislative amendment to the Ground Rents Acts would solve for these three bodies the difficulties highlighted in the individual case that has given rise to this legislation. The legislation does not apply to any notice of proceedings under the Ground Rents Acts in existence prior to the enactment of the Bill. I understand that has been an ongoing issue in terms of the abolition of ground rents. It was the previous occupant of the Chair who brought in the far-seeing and progressive Bill in Opposition in 1996 or 1997 to abolish ground rents but my understanding, and it is not within the remit of my Department, is that constitutional issues have been put forward as a barrier to the introduction of legislation that would, in effect, abolish domestic ground rents although I realise there are arguments on both sides of that debate. For the purposes of today's legislation, however, while the opportunity was correctly taken by Deputies to raise that issue we do not propose to deal with it in the context of this legislation.On the question of local authorities buying land, local authorities are at one remove from the centre. This issue has arisen at Government level and it falls to other Departments to examine their positions in terms of making a risk assessment of their individual property portfolios. In regard to Deputy Ring's suggestion that I would attempt to bring the local authorities within the ambit of this legislation, that would not be appropriate and in any event local authorities have their own legislative template for the disposal of properties. I understand it is the reserved function of elected members to dispose of properties, not just the executive of the county council. On another day that would be construed as an outrageous interference in the democratic rights of elected representatives on councils throughout the country. It is open to councils to put qualifications and restrictions on the use of any land. It is within reasonable parameters and I do not propose to do that.On the Deputy's wider issue about IDA land in the past being used for different reasons, there was a strong policy in the 1980s of developing advanced factories throughout the country. That policy ceased in more recent times but it has led to the moving on of that property and its utilisation for different purposes. That is the backdrop.Thirty-five year leases were entered into in the 1980s, some of which were for advance factories. That was a policy decision taken at the time. There is difficulty renting out those factories now as modern industrialists want more flexible, custom built facilities and they do not necessarily believe those advance factories suit their needs and concerns.In terms of the BMW region generally, the IDA's target is to have 50% of all new greenfield jobs in Objective One regions by 2006. To date it has achieved a 42% target, which is a significant achievement. Addressing a recent conference on the BMW region I received information to the effect that, for the first time in a long time, jobs were created at a faster rate in the BMW region than in the south and the east. It might be argued that people are commuting and so forth. We will also take up the wider issues raised by Deputy Boyle.I thank Deputies for their contributions. Ministers do not like to bring in urgent legislation such as this but we had to act when the situation was presented to me. Clear decisions had to be taken to protect the State asset and that is what we are doing.
#JohnCartyFF	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-party	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I welcome in particular that the Bill makes it an offence for a person other than a veterinary practitioner to practise veterinary medicine. Stringent penalties, which can range up to €130,000 and-or five years imprisonment, are provided in the case of a first offence or €320,000 and-or ten years imprisonment in the case of a second or subsequent offence.I welcome also that the Minister recognises the reality of situations that can sometimes occur on a farm when a veterinary practitioner might not be available to attend to an animal. Provision will be made for treatment of animals in an emergency by non-qualified persons and farmers will be enabled to continue to carry out treatments or procedures that were possible under the existing legislation.There are a number of outstanding issues that need to be dealt with if this Bill is to be best formulated for the future of veterinary practice in the years ahead. The Bill recognises the need for the public interest to be represented on the council. An effect of that, however, is that the proposed composition of the new council might not include a sufficient number of veterinary surgeons to carry out effectively their designated roles in various committees. Veterinary surgeons have specialised knowledge and can provide important insights into the operation of the profession and care should be taken not to lose sight of that. This Bill is about the veterinary profession and their expertise is needed if the council is to function properly.The section providing for a ministerial appointment to the council specifically excludes that person from being a veterinary surgeon but at the same time he or she should be involved with animal welfare related activities. Given that the veterinary profession is all about animal welfare, this exclusion is very strange. Removing the exclusion would not only deal with the obvious anomaly but could also be used to ensure that more veterinary expertise would be available to the new council.With regard to limited registration as proposed in the Bill, it is important that professional standards would always be maintained. Concerns have been expressed that this provision could be used as a back door to register unqualified persons and that this in turn would undermine the veterinary profession. The real concerns arising from this provision should and could be addressed by specifying that the provision for limited registration be designed to deal with the outbreak of a class A disease or such similar disease which poses a significant threat to the national herd. The importance of maintaining professional standards and the consequences of any deviation from this could have a catastrophic effect on our food exports.On the section dealing with authorised officers appointed by the veterinary council entering veterinary premises, all requests to enter or search premises should be accompanied by a warrant from a judge of the District Court. To do otherwise would be to go a step too far in the interests of equity and fairness. I know the Minister is seeking clarification on this from the Attorney General. The Veterinary Practice Bill is comprehensive and well balanced legislation and takes account of the needs of the profession as well as the public interest. It will also underpin confidence in the Irish agriculture and food industry both here and with our international customers in the years ahead.I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House and thank her and the Ministers of State for the many amendments and changes they have implemented to make the Bill workable. I fully support this legislation.

The record of veterinary surgeons in caring for animals is second to none and this is evidenced by the fact that they operate a 24-hour seven-day service, 365 days a years, akin to the medical and surgical on-call service we would like to have in Monaghan General Hospital.

Considerable time has elapsed since then which accentuates the need for reform and change and makes this legislation all the more welcome.EU membership has been largely responsible for the dramatic change in the environment in which veterinary surgeons and personnel operate in this country. Advances in technology together with increased attention to food safety and animal welfare have transformed the situation for the veterinary profession. As food consumers we have a vested interest in the work of the veterinary profession and have become more discerning and questioning than ever before. Veterinary surgeons do a commendable job in all types of weathers while ensuring the integrity of the food chain. This integrity even extends to tourists' natural concerns about the dangers of BSE and its human form, vCJD, and we are all aware of the presence held at Dublin Airport and Border areas.A television commercial features a female vet and two well known actors from my own county and constituency, Tommy and John McArdle, better known as the twin McArdles. It vividly illustrates the privations of veterinary surgeons called out in the middle of the night. It also illustrates the difficulty people have with remembering names when one of them takes off his hat and confuses the vet.

Veterinary practice will be the winner for being better regulated, especially through the veterinary council's structure and role in setting standards and imposing sanctions on its members. The veterinary profession is self-regulating as are many other profession and it is important that those being regulated are well represented. I will refer to concerns I have on that later.The Bill significantly broadens the make up of the veterinary council but I am mystified as to why a Member of the Oireachtas is precluded under section 29 from membership of the Veterinary Council of Ireland. It also precludes members of local authorities and the European Parliament from membership. Members of these bodies who are employed by the veterinary council are required to resign that employment. No reason is given for this prohibition and I fail to see the rationale for it. I find this section offensive to Members of the Oireachtas and to members of the other bodies mentioned and believe the section should be removed from the legislation. It is not as if there will be a stampede for membership of the veterinary council. Perhaps it was felt a conflict of interest might arise from one's membership of these other bodies. However there appears to be no rational explanation and I submit that the section could be removed without having any adverse effect on the legislation.The current council has 17 members, including 14 vets and of these 12 are elected by the wider body of vets, one by the National University of Ireland and the Minister appoints the chief veterinary officer from her Department. Only eight of the proposed new council would be vets, of which seven would be elected and the remaining one a ministerial appointee. A registered vet, veterinary nurse or a person entitled to be so registered would be appointed by one of the country's education bodies. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland and Director of Consumer Affairs would each nominate one member. The balance would be made up of users of veterinary services involved in animal welfare and nominated by higher education bodies. The final seat on the veterinary council would be occupied by a registered veterinary nurse.The veterinary profession, with which consultation appears to have been minimal, is of the opinion the new council does not include a sufficient quota of vets to carry out the designated committee roles effectively. The previous committee had approximately 14 vets and that number has been reduced significantly to eight. I can see why vets are concerned. It is obvious there has been minimal contact with vets, but as the composition of councils is being changed, consultation on the Bill's provisions should have been continually conducted with the existing Veterinary Council of Ireland, the Irish Veterinary Union and Veterinary Ireland. We are at risk of losing the vital insight of vets into the operation of the profession and accordingly the number of vets on the council should be increased to provide for a majority.The Bill also allows for temporary registration of veterinary surgeons from outside the country for disease outbreaks such as the foot and mouth outbreak some years ago. The Bill also enhances the role of the veterinary nurse. We have seen examples of our vets going abroad and performing useful tasks in England in times of need and it is useful when it happens. The category of limited registration proposed to facilitate this measure would have the support of the veterinary profession, which feels it is a vital measure to protect the heath of the national herd and the economy as a whole. However, it feels the role of such visitor vets should be confined to tackling class A diseases only and would require stricter conditions under training. This would preclude the measures from covering such diseases as TB and brucellosis.Another provision in the Bill would allow the Minister to make regulations for limited practice of certain defined veterinary procedures by non-registered persons or non-vets. The veterinary profession strongly opposes this. Such procedures include the treatment of an animal in an emergency and administering an anaesthetic. This section would also permit drawing up a regulation to maintain and improve standards of animal health and welfare and to ensure adequate provision of vet services in the state. The Minister's expressed view is that the maintenance of the highest standards within the veterinary profession is a matter of great social and economic importance to this country. The inclusion of this section appears to go beyond what is needed and it should be scrapped.The Bill's statutory recognition of veterinary nurses is welcome but their deployment should be in conjunction with vets. Veterinary nurses are an extremely important resource and much progress has been made in the development of formalised education and training programmes for them. The development of deployment structures for nurses to work in conjunction with veterinary surgeons appears to be a matter of urgency. The overriding concern must at all times be the health and welfare of animals in the care of the veterinary profession. Matters such as the choice of appropriate medications, possible adverse reactions post-injection and immediate access to a directing veterinary surgeon are all important.I hope there is no possibility that the draft legislation will cause division between veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses. There is a role for both the vet and the vet practice nurse and legislation should reflect how they complement each other. It would be a pity if any such legislation were to be the cause of division. It would only take a relatively minor adjustment to overcome this potential difficulty and to ensure the present excellent co-operation can be maintained and developed.Another welcome measure in the Bill is a proposal to introduce the certification of veterinary premises. However, the proposed certification should only be granted to premises that would be operated by registered vets. As currently drafted, the proposed wording might even allow veterinary nurses to operate certified premises, but there should be no ambiguity in this respect. While people might deal with a nurse in a veterinary practice, they may be under the misapprehension that they are receiving advice from a qualified vet, whereas they are not.Section 55 makes it illegal for anyone to misrepresent themselves as being qualified in veterinary medicine. In view of the close association of the veterinary profession with the farming community, it would be only appropriate that farmers should be represented on the new veterinary council. There is a possibility that farmers could be elected under the Bill's existing provisions. Nevertheless, those elected places should be reserved for farming organisations such as the IFA and the ICMSA. Specific representation should be provided for farmers through these organisations in view of the farmers' position as major consumers of veterinary services. It is essential for farmers to be represented on the veterinary council and their representative bodies should have first call on who represents them on it.Section 54 sets out for the first time the definition of veterinary medicine. The legal definition is so comprehensive that it would render illegal common practices that have been carried out for generations by farmers and other animal owners. The section should specifically provide that all existing common practices for the care and husbandry of farm livestock by a farmer or his employee, be excluded from the definition of veterinary medicine.With the exception of the reservations I have expressed, I give a general welcome to the Bill.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I thank Deputies who have contributed on Second Stage. The discussion has been informative, comprehensive and generally positive. The Veterinary Practice Bill 2004 is important legislation. We have endeavoured to ensure it is well balanced and will provide a legislative basis on which to regulate the veterinary profession as a whole to the highest standards. It meets current and prospective requirements for openness and fairness, as well as the further development of the profession.I thank Deputies Naughten, Upton, Sargent, Connolly and Carty for their input into the Bill during the debate. I am sure that on Committee Stage the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, will heed some of their views and suggestions. In the Seanad, where 78 amendments were tabled, she was amenable to a number of Opposition amendments. We will be able to tease out the legislation more on Committee Stage in line with the suggestions that have been made by Deputies on Second Stage.I have listened carefully to the views of Deputies on specific provisions of the Bill and will reflect further on these before we deal with the subsequent Stages. We must be careful, however, not to disturb the balance included in the Bill. In addition, we must retain essential elements, such as transparency in the regulation of the profession and fairness as regards individual veterinary practitioners. We must also ensure that we legislate for current realities as well as those that will evolve over the coming decades.Deputy Connolly mentioned that Members of the Oireachtas and MEPs are not allowed to participate as members of the Veterinary Council of Ireland, but that was the case with the old legislation, so there is nothing new in that area.There has been a general welcome for the overall thrust of the Bill as it has been amended in its passage through the Seanad. Most Deputies accept the need to modernise the legislation and to broaden the membership of the veterinary council. Deputies also accept the widening of registration possibilities, the reformulation of the disciplinary procedure and the roles being given to the council concerning the standards of premises, ongoing education, training and investigations.There has also been a welcome for the inclusion of a definition of veterinary medicine and for the recognition of veterinary nurses. Deputies on both sides of the House welcomed the latter provision in particular.I wish to comment on some specific issues that were raised by Deputies Naughten, Upton and others. With regard to the composition of the veterinary council, we have achieved a reasonable balance in its membership. We have also met the concerns expressed when we increased by two the number of vets to be elected to the council. This should enable the veterinary council to carry out its statutory functions effectively in a way that will continue to enjoy public confidence.The rationale underpinning the provision for limited registration is to provide for disease emergencies and for certain gaps in the educational institutions. The provision may be activated by the council only where it is satisfied that it is necessary. I would emphasise the restrictions that the council is enabled to place on practitioners with limited registration. It would not be appropriate to restrict it to class A diseases and I consider the provisions covering educational aspects appropriate.We have struck the correct balance with regard to veterinary nurses, as that profession is being recognised for the first time in law. The Bill does not prescribe the particular qualifications or courses that will be recognised. Graduates from institutes such as Athlone can be accepted for registration if the courses are deemed to be up to the required standard. Deputy Naughten raised this issue earlier in the debate.

The Department did meet a veterinary nurse as part of a delegation for discussions on the Bill, although neither she nor the Department would claim that she was representing the profession as a whole. There was a discussion with a veterinary nurse, however, and many of the ideas and suggestions came from that quarter.Section 55 allows non-vets to treat animals in emergency situations from time to time. This section also allows farmers and others to carry out various treatments to their animals, which are incidental to their usual care and management. Treatments such as hoof paring and assisting with lambing are not classified in the Bill as being reserved functions of vets or veterinary nurses.Part 9 deals with veterinary premises and their approval. Deputy Naughten raised the issue of grant aid but we contend that it will be a matter for the owners of the premises to bear the costs of meeting standards set by the veterinary council.The exclusion of State premises from the provisions of this Part of this Bill is appropriate. This provision has nothing to do with TB tests or other animal health legislation.The question of powers of entry by officers of the veterinary council into veterinary and non-veterinary premises was also raised by Deputies Upton and Naughten. As I said previously, the Minister is still awaiting definitive advice on this issue from the Office of the Attorney General. However, the Minister hopes to be in a position to address the matter on Committee Stage.This Bill has nothing to do with the prescription of veterinary medicines. That aspect is regulated under the Animal Remedies Act and regulations made thereunder. It is intended that regulations will be introduced later this year, both to amend prescribing rules and to implement the recent EU directive.I again wish to thank Deputies for having raised various issues in the course of this debate. Their positive contributions have been helpful and I look forward to a lively debate on Committee Stage. Hopefully the Bill will be passed as quickly as possible thereafter.I thank my senior official, Mr. Séamus Healy, an Assistant Secretary General in the Department, for keeping us all on the straight and narrow. I also thank the main Opposition spokespersons, Deputy Naughten and Deputy Upton, for their contributions on Second Stage, and my colleague from Mayo, Deputy Carty.

This work is ongoing with the assistance of an advisory group of experts, An Coiste Téarmaíochta.Regarding the grammar of the language, the Deputy will be aware that the caighdeán oifigiúil was last reviewed in 1958. While I have no formulated proposals in this regard, the question of whether there is a need at this point to review the official standard again was raised briefly at the most recent meeting of Fóram na Gaeilge, and Foras na Gaeilge agreed to prepare a paper in that regard. I anticipate that the paper will be discussed at the next meeting of the fóram.

Does the Minister agree it is vital that children learn to speak Irish as early as possible and use it as widely as possible? Does he agree that a major difficulty for children can be the first letter of various words, because of aspirations, eclipses and prefixes? For example, Éire become tír na hÉireann. Does the Minister agree that any obstacles confronting children using the language must be addressed and that appropriate changes, where deemed necessary in the sense of assisting children in learning the language at that early stage, should be quickly introduced?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I agree this issue must be looked at. It is very tricky. I come from a long tradition of modernists in this regard and I am often criticised for example for spelling my name "Cuív" because people say there is no "v" in Irish. My view is that modern Irish has a "v". For example, in this House we regularly used the word "Vótáil". One could spell it "Bhótáil" but the sensible and modern thing to do is use the "v" instead.Someone recently wrote to a newspaper criticising the use of "v" in Irish. I asked an Irish scholar who turned up an interesting piece. Apparently, my father was criticised many years ago for using "v" in his name. In his reply, he explained how the litriú simplí came about, because the "cónaighe" and all such forms which would be familiar to people at the beginning of the 20th century were causing chaos to learners. It was difficult to know how to pronounce a word such as "cónaighe" if one did not know the language. In his defence, my father pointed out how this came about, but also pointed out something more interesting. He noted that in the Annals of Inishfallen in 1259 there was a reference to "Corc mac Fínguni í Kymh  d'éc Bennact era anmin", but the spelling for "Caoimh" was "Kymh". Some people who want me to go back to the older version think it is "Caoimh", but I am thinking of reverting to "Kymh".

Accordingly, there is nothing new in modernisation. There should be simplifications. I do not think one can get rid of the séimhiú totally, nor of the urú. I would prefer not to make judgments which would be better made by experts. One cannot suddenly make non-native speakers out of native speakers because they do not understand the new "speak".However, there are great inconsistencies in the caighdeán oifigiúil. For example, we all know that in Munster Irish, one says "bhíos" agus "bhí sibh" agus "bhíomar" agus na rudaí sin ar fad, whereas in Connacht we have the simple version, with which Deputy McGinley is probably familiar, namely "bhí mé", "bhí tú", "bhí sé", "bhí muid", "bhí sibh" agus "bhí siad". I could never understand why the caighdeán oifigiúil has "bhí mé", "bhí tú", "bhí sé", "bhíomar", "bhí sibh" agus "bhí siad". I do not know why it did not use the foirm scartha gan bhriathar i gcónaí. That is by far the simplest, perfectly grammatical and correct in two of the major dialects, in my understanding. Accordingly it would be a much simpler form to teach a child, so that every verb would be the préamh of the verb, "bhí" nó "tá" nó "bheadh" and so on, with simply "mé", "tú", "sé", "muid", "sibh" and "siad".There is work to be done in this area. I intend to pursue it. As I said, we have raised the issue with Foras na Gaeilge. The board is central to the issue because under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 it is responsible for An Coiste Téarmaíochta. Clearly it is sensible for the body which now has the official, legal responsibility for téarmaíocht to look also at what I see as the associated issue of grammar and the caighdeán oifigiúil. We must move forward and we cannot freeze the language. I am not a linguist or a great expert in the area but I understand that in many languages, the genitive is not used in the same form in which it was used 100 years ago. That is not unique to Irish, although in certain cases in Irish the change has accelerated.Certain changes are quite incorrect. A common one which has entered the Irish language is "an asal" and "ar an t-asal". That is just nonsense. I will not support the bastardisation of the language by the introduction of — I will try not to use unparliamentary language although one can get away with that in Irish easier than in English — non-native forms of speech which are quite inappropriate to the language as spoken. Tá bealach nóáit idir eatarthu agus ba mhaith liom é a fheiceáil ag dul ar aghaidh.

When announcing the decision to establish the Department, the Taoiseach stressed the need for Government to address issues of regional and social balance in a more effective way, as well as securing economic development. He explained that my Department was being set up to produce a more co-ordinated engagement by the State with communities throughout the country as they pursue their own development.As Minister I have responsibility for a wide range of programmes covering community and local development, drugs, volunteering, Gaeltacht, Irish language and rural development. Most of these measures, individually and collectively, focus on communities, particularly those that are vulnerable or under threat. Those communities may be in rural or inner city settings, grappling with difficulties caused by a range of factors, including declining populations, unemployment, language issues, social disadvantage or drug misuse. As well as communities which can be defined in terms of geographic location, we also support communities that are defined on the basis of a common focus on a particular issue.The key principle underlying my Department's activities is the provision of support that enables communities to identify and address problems in their areas. Our purpose is to provide support to communities in the most appropriate way as they work to shape their futures, address their common goals and achieve their full potential.It is this bottom up approach, where communities are empowered to develop solutions to their difficulties, that is the best source of fresh thinking to tackle such problems. As indicated in my reply of 22 February 2005, in addition to schemes specifically directed at rural and Gaeltacht areas, the programmes operated by my Department include community development programme, grants for community and voluntary sector, local development social inclusion programme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund and the RAPID programme. More than €129 million has been provided in my Department's Estimate in 2005 for these programmes. In addition, grants under the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board are available to communities experiencing disadvantage.I accept that there is no room for complacency. We are always attempting to improve services to communities. However, the foregoing is concrete and comprehensive evidence that the Government is committed to supporting communities as they tackle the difficulties caused by disadvantage, exclusion and isolation.

Does the Minister recognise the level of deprivation and poverty that is the daily reality for many urban communities? Does he recognise the need for radical new thinking to help city and suburban communities and the need for community based finance schemes above and beyond the good work done by MABS? Does he see a role for his Department in intervening to save communities from extortionate moneylenders? Does he see a role for the State in providing banking and financial services to those communities, either in conjunction with An Post or the local credit unions? Could the Minister, in conjunction with the Ministers for Finance and Social and Family Affairs, use their good offices to lobby the banking sector to accept its responsibility to provide a community banking service, which it refuses to offer at present?The Minister sees himself as having a co-ordinating role in the community sector. This problem is one of the things that came out of the reports on the How are our Kids and Do the Poor Pay More surveys. Does the Minister agree that in common with many rural working class communities, people in city and suburban areas are facing huge challenges in dealing with the transition from the old economy activities to new ones? I can cite examples from my constituency where there has been a haemorrhage of jobs. There have been jobs losses in Gallahers, Coke, APW, Packard and so forth. The unemployment rate is higher than the national average. Many locally based manufacturing and electronics jobs are becoming part of history rather than providing secure employment.Does the Minister accept that there is a need for new thinking? Is there a role for his Department and other Departments to come together to examine the banking issue? Moneylenders are putting people to the wall. Everybody accepts there is a problem in this regard but no solutions are being put forward. There is a role for the State in providing small loans these people cannot get otherwise. Will the Department examine this in conjunction with other Departments?

It is amazing how people can be given a certain colouring by popular perception. Many people perceive me as being essentially rural and rurally biased. However, all my formative years were spent in Dublin. When asked where the greatest crisis is, in terms of community, lifestyle and planning, I have said time and again that it is in the cities. Last night, when I met the Council for the West, I agreed that there are unquestionably problems in the west but I also asked if the council knew many people from the rural west who, of their free volition, would move tomorrow to live in one of the RAPID areas. I mean no disrespect to the people in those areas but disadvantages would accrue. When I challenge people on that point, and I have said this in meetings throughout the country, they will immediately accept it. One of the reasons that rural Ireland is worth fighting for is that it is a great place to live if one is lucky enough to have a job.

What is the nature of the problem? It is curious that the RAPID areas in this city are largely located cheek by jowl with the areas of the greatest opportunities in both education and employment anywhere in the country. The problem is not jobs per se as we would have understood it 30 years ago. People are coming from all over the country to take up jobs in Dublin. The big challenge is education and the educational attainments of people in RAPID areas, which are a good definition of the most deprived communities. These can range as low as 2% to 3% of the population getting a third level education. Creating all these fantastic jobs is no good because these people cannot get them. They cannot get through that gate, the gate being education, skills and training.Life is full of dilemmas. How is it that in these areas of huge population near the universities and jobs only 2% to 3% of the population, and in some cases it is as low as 1%, get a third level education? Then there are places in other parts of the country, far from third level facilities, where 60% to 70% of the population get a third level education. The situation is full of ironies. That is the challenge. I have always believed that educational attainment is one of the keys to solving the problems discussed by the Deputy.One must then ask why these people do not get the education. Is it due to bad schools? That is when one realises that there are family, lifestyle and social segregation issues, partly and largely due to bad planning whereby society was socially segregated, which has a huge effect on educational attainments.

There are a number of issues for people who have problems with money. Shortage of money is one. Lack of knowledge of how to deal with debt is another, in addition to a lack of knowledge of the law if one is in debt. People succumb to pressure because they do not know how to handle debt or do not know their rights. Advice and services such as MABS are incredibly important. Some people run out of money to maintain their gas and electricity supplies and we must deal with that problem.It is a cross-departmental issue. That is the reason we have made all this investment in community development projects, partnerships and so forth. They can get through to the people in the communities. There is a huge role for the credit unions here. It is the people's bank. It is in the community and owned by the community. They cannot simply give the money away but they have a role in social banking. They have already played a huge role but we must examine new ways of dealing with that problem. It is a frightening problem for people who are in debt to moneylenders and others.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	272	CLÁR funds or co-funds, together with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, invest in selected priority developments. These investments support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a wide range of measures and reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas, whom I consulted at the start of the programme.Expenditure under the CLÁR programme amounted to €14.14 million in 2002, €8.613 million in 2003 and €12.116 million in 2004 which, it is estimated, leveraged out a further €36.5 million in related public and private expenditure in those three years. The estimate for 2005 is €13.7 million, an increase of more than 13% on the 2004 outturn. As a result, I expect that, once again, a comprehensive work programme will be completed in 2005 and I am satisfied that CLÁR is making a sustained and strong positive contribution to rural communities.In general, no specific allocations are made to the CLÁR areas of counties from each year's Estimates provision for the programme. Some measures are demand led while in other cases the projects are, by and large, selected or recommended by the relevant Departments, State agencies, Leader groups and local authorities in consultation with my Department. However, under the non-national roads measure, allocations are made to each local authority based on the county's percentage of the total CLÁR population.This approach ensures both efficiency and effectiveness in delivering the programme and meets the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas. I intend to continue these procedures for any new measures I may introduce, depending on the needs identified. Equally, I will keep under review the operation of existing measures. The CLÁR programme vividly demonstrates that relatively small amounts of public funding, specifically targeted, can have a profound and positive impact in disadvantaged rural areas.

Does the Minister agree many other rural areas that may not have experienced sustained population decline since 1926 are equally disadvantaged? As a result of job losses and other economic difficulties, a number of areas in my constituency should be as entitled to CLÁR funding as areas included in the programme. Will the Minister consider extending the qualifying criteria for the programme to include such areas? What is the future of the programme? Can the Minister guarantee this worthwhile scheme will continue? I have only one criticism: ‘Sé an locht an laghad'.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	274	The figures were adjusted on the basis of the 2002 census and significant additions were made to the programme. I am happy that, within the criteria laid down, no other areas are eligible and I have examined this issue thoroughly.The Deputy has touched on the nub of the matter. I am delighted there is demand to expand the CLÁR areas because that signifies the programme has delivered. It has dealt with the micro-infrastructure, which is very important but which is often overlooked. There is no point providing a main water pipe if it is not connected to a house down a little boreen; there is no point building a motorway if the boreen to the house is not connected to it and there is no point in providing major sewerage systems in large cities and towns if little villages are not provided with similar schemes. Similarly, there is no point providing massive community facilities in large towns if small communities with which the Deputy and myself are familiar do not have them.CLÁR was intended to deal with minor issues in small towns and villages while taking into account the lack of critical mass that often bedevils the provision of facilities in small rural areas. I would love to expand CLÁR but there would be no point in doing so unless I had the funds to sustain the programme. Governments were enthusiastic about successful programmes in the past and expanded them but the butter got so thin on the bread that it could not be seen anymore. An appreciable difference can be made through the funding of €13 million which assists approximately 350,000 people in the CLÁR areas. However, if the programme was expanded to cover 500,000 people, a pro rata increase in the budget would have to be provided. We must be realistic in this regard.It would be ideal if we could cover all of rural Ireland outside the periurban areas. Such areas are more urban than rural even though grass still grows in them. However, the issue boils down to resources. My primary obligation is to make the programme work and I am doing so. I am examining new measures because the goalposts keep moving. I am happy that many houses have become part of group water schemes. These schemes in rural areas were expensive but the people involved would never have had access to water if we had not introduced the schemes.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 123 of 9 November 2004, in which I stated I had undertaken a wide range of initiatives in support of rural economies, including the establishment and expansion of the CLÁR programme; establishment of the rural social scheme; small food producers forum and co-ordinator; Comhairle na Tuaithe; and a review of enterprise supporting rural areas. The establishment of the CLÁR programme has enabled me to support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a wide range of measures and has the potential to create additional jobs through improved productivity and delivery of services.The rural social scheme established in 2004 provides for improved rural services directly while ensuring an income and employment support for farmers who can no longer make a viable living on the land, within a working arrangement compatible with farming. This scheme was designed specifically for farm families and its operations and structures are operated in a farmer-friendly manner. It recognises that farmers have a wealth of experience and talents, which need to be preserved for future generations, and these talents are being harnessed for the good of the community. The scheme focuses on the provision of direct services in the community.My Department has also funded the appointment of a small food producers co-ordinator to work, under the aegis of Comhar Leader na hÉireann, with artisan and traditional food producers. This initiative is aimed at identifying barriers inhibiting small food producers, ranging from the scale of the enterprise, access to funding and distribution, marketing and promotion as well as the provision of skills and training and the regulatory environment.I established Comhairle na Tuaithe in February 2004. It includes representatives of farmer, recreational users, tourism marketing bodies and other interested groups. Comhairle na Tuaithe works on conflict resolution in regard access to the countryside, the development of a countryside code and a countryside recreation strategy.In conjunction with the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Arts, Sport and Tourism, I initiated a review of enterprise support in rural areas. My Department, in conjunction with the two other Departments, is examining the recommendations of the consultant's report. In further support of rural areas, my Department continues to oversee the delivery of a number of programmes. These comprise the Leader programme; rural development fund; PEACE II programme; rural initiative measure of INTERREG; and farm relief services.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseUnder the Leader+ and area-based rural development initiatives, my Department provides almost €150 million in funding for the implementation of agreed business plans for the development of all rural areas between 2000 and 2006. These initiatives include the provision of important support to indigenous rural enterprises and small food producers in strengthening and developing their capacity.I also support a number of pilot projects from my Department's rural development fund to regenerate particularly disadvantaged rural areas through a variety of community initiatives. The cross-Border rural development measures of the PEACE II programme aim to promote agriculture and rural development co-operation in the Border area. The rural initiative measure of the INTERREG Ireland-Northern Ireland programme is aimed at encouraging rural businesses and communities to engage in the development of their area.My Department also provides funding to the farm relief services measure of the national development plan. The funding is primarily aimed at training of farm relief operatives and staff with smaller elements for infrastructure and research and development. In addition, the Government programme of decentralisation will promote regional balance and will result in the relocation of a wide range of Departments in whole or in part and a significant number of high quality jobs to areas outside Dublin. My Department will relocate to Knock Airport and na Forbacha.EU proposals on the future of rural development should provide further opportunities, post-2006, to strengthen and develop the capacity of rural areas.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I tabled the question because I read recently about a survey conducted in the Minister's county regarding how it had reacted to changes in the economy and agriculture in particular. It was alarming that the majority of farms generated less than €10,000 per annum except in the Clarinbridge area where the figure was higher. The majority of men in the county are unskilled whereas women are more involved in professions such as nursing and teaching. Is it not important that there is an upskilling of the male population in these areas because, according to the survey, approximately half the farms are passing on to an heir? There are fundamental structural problems. While the working population in these areas has increased, which is to be welcomed, the imbalance in the range of skills vis-à-vis gender is an important issue that must be addressed.

That was great news and it mirrored the impression I got when I toured those areas and spoke to people.The surveyors were clever in that they selected an area in the Connemara Gaeltacht, Clarinbridge, which is partly urban. They then selected Glinsk, which is a very strong farming area. The final area surveyed was in the south of the county, around Laurencetown, if my memory serves me correctly. The aim was to survey a mix of areas — strong farming areas, poor farm and fishing areas in the Gaeltacht and partly urban areas.The survey produced some very interesting information. There were no complaints, for example, in Gorumna about the roads and while I do not think the situation is perfect, the Gaeltacht road strategy has paid dividends. However, there were many complaints about health services in that area. It is also the area with the highest number of people who want their own children to settle there, which is a great indicator of how happy people are. It was a very interesting study.Deputy O'Shea is correct in his comments about the imbalance in educational skills. In rural Ireland in the past, those who received an education moved on and moved out of an area, while those who were not educated stayed on to farm the family land, which poses challenges for us today. We must recognise that people aged 50 or 55 are not likely to train or enter the conventional education system to get a fancy job in an electronics or software company. However, many of them have a wealth of skills and under the rural social scheme we have been working to develop those indigenous skills. We should never dismiss skills. The revival of interest in the skill of dry stone walling, as well as the amount of money that people are willing to pay for it, is incredible. Such a skill cannot be acquired at university, it exists among the rural community who have practised it and handed it on from generation to generation. There are different types of skills and we should not dismiss those of older farmers, acquired through traditional activities.

One of the conclusions of the survey puzzled me, namely, the suggestion that commuting has both positive and negative effects on areas.

This is because many new people arrive who have no connection with the area. They leave at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. to go to work, put their children in a crèche and do not arrive home until late in the evening, by which time they are tired, hungry and stressed. They feed their families, do their household chores, fall into bed and then get up the following day to repeat the cycle.One of the challenges for our society is that, while we are better off economically, there has been a social capital cost attached to the increase in wealth. Our final measure of should be quality of life. Sometimes we talk too much about the economy and too little about creating for our people the best——

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 8 together.The community support for older people scheme provides grants to assist communities in improving the security of their older members. The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department. It provides for maximum individual grants as follows: €300 for the once-off installation of socially monitored alarms, €150 for locks for doors and windows, €150 for security lighting, and €50 for smoke alarms. People with disabilities who are over 65 are included in the scheme, but there are no plans at present to extend it further. A sum of €2.8 million has been allocated to the scheme for 2005, an increase of 17% on the 2004 allocation of €2.4 million.Funding was provided at 90% of the cost of equipment between 1997 to 2003. In 2004, following a review of the scheme, this 90% limit on funding was abolished and replaced with individual maximum grants, as outlined earlier. Grant levels were fixed by the Department on the basis of the grants sought and paid out in the previous year. Smoke alarms were added to the list of qualifying equipment in 2004.Deputies will appreciate that the scheme has been running for the greater part of a decade and has supplied security equipment to many older people. Since 1997, in excess of €30 million has been provided to assist older people under this scheme. Personal security depends on a range of factors and this scheme makes a valuable contribution to the security requirements of eligible older people.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	286	Will the Minister of State consider extending the scheme to people with disabilities who are under 65, who would benefit greatly? I urge him to examine this possibility and report to the House on the outcome of such an examination.Will the Minister of State clarify who owns the alarms once they have been installed? Does ownership pass to the older person. Is there a scheme in place for the recycling or reuse of the alarms?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The scheme is community based, administered by the community section of my Department and focused on those over 65. People with disabilities under this age limit may require security equipment grants as well as other aids, but this scheme is not appropriate to meet their needs as it specifically targets older people. People with disabilities receive most supports through the health services and are in a different category from the people that this scheme is designed to assist.My Department issues the grants to local community groups, some of which recycle the security equipment when possible. However, I would like to see more recycling taking place. I get the impression some groups never recycle. The equipment is never removed forcibly from the individual who receives it, but I encourage and support groups who try to recycle it.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	289	We will provide new systems where it is established that the old ones cannot be repaired. However, people in the business tell me most of them can be repaired. I am nervous about the issue of obsolescence. If the alarm or pendant is working well a person will not qualify for a new one. I have heard reports, true or untrue, of some suppliers telling people they or their group need a new system and that the ones they got five years previously from some other group are obsolete. If the alarm and pendant work, the person will not qualify for a new system. However, in a case where it is established that it is broken and cannot be repaired, we will replace it.

Does the Minister of State agree that restrictions exist that sometimes make matters difficult? For example, this grant can only be applied for at certain times of the year, probably before the end of May. If an elderly person was discharged from hospital in June or July and needed more security, he or she would probably have to wait till next year to apply for it.Will the Minister of State confirm whether there is an annual monitoring fee of between €60 and €100 attached to this equipment? This sum would be a considerable drain on the resources of elderly people who receive a non-contributory pension. Should the system not be free, like fuel, electricity or telephone rental?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	291	From the beginning the scheme has been administered once a year. We get queries and complaints from some groups from time to time who feel they should be able to get the pendants on an ongoing basis. However, most groups seem to get by. We advertised for applications some weeks ago. Quite often a number of months pass between the time when a group applies and approval, but most groups get by, perhaps because an applicant may have died or because they usually have a spare or two.I accept that people are released from hospital at various times and the health service provides them with substantial supports, aids, equipment and home care packages etc. It should not be beyond the remit or responsibility of the health service to provide these items where necessary in severe cases as they can be bought commercially.We provide grants towards the initial cost of the pendants. Depending on who the person is signed up with, there is an annual monitoring fee such as that mentioned by the Deputy, or perhaps more in some cases. That fee is the responsibility of the individual and is not covered by our scheme.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	292	Unfortunately, whether in urban or rural areas, older people are not as secure as they used to be, so obviously the scheme is very welcome. Has any study being done on the effectiveness of the scheme? Have the various alarms been useful in situations where, for example, a home was under attack and the alarm was used? It may be difficult to give a response to that question, but I am interested in whether there is real improvement in terms of the security of older people in their homes.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	293	We have not done any study since our Department took responsibility for the scheme. The scheme has been consistently popular so, obviously, the community groups that apply to the scheme feel it is of benefit. The biggest fear is not so much that houses may be under attack, but that a person alone might be unwell or fall and may need to summon help. I am not aware of any study that has been carried out, but people on the ground and community groups dealing with the elderly feel the scheme is of benefit. It may not provide the elderly with total protection against all concerns, but it provides reassurance that they will be able to contact the outside world in the event of any unforeseen circumstance.

It is too early to meaningfully seek to quantify the full costs at this stage. My Department will make every effort to keep such costs to a minimum.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I thank the Minister for his response, but I am not sure it clarifies anything. Will the Minister at least indicate the numbers of people who have indicated a willingness to move to the new location of the Department's headquarters? Will he use the opportunity of this question to put on record concerns that have been expressed about the general decentralisation process and the concerns of people who choose not to move to new relocated headquarters of Departments but to remain with secretariats in the Dublin area? Will such a decision affect promotion prospects or how they are considered within the general hierarchy of the Department?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	296	We have 158 applicants for 159 places in Knock. However, the applications do not all match the available positions. We have oversubscription in the lower ranks and under subscription in the higher ranks. The case is similar in the case of Na Forbacha where we have nine applicants for seven and a half places. One of the great mysteries of the public service is how we can have half a place, but Deputies understand how this works.I agree decentralisation is a difficult change and that we must be sensitive to those who want to stay in Dublin. However, the point has been made to me time and again that nobody asked young people over the past 60 or 70 years whether they thought Dublin was the optimum choice. If they wanted a public service career they had no choice but to come to the big smoke. Nobody asked them whether they wanted to come to Dublin for a job or whether they would like a job at home.It has come out clearly from the applications and the decentralisation process that there is a problem for those settled in Dublin. We recognise that and it will be dealt with sensitively. It is also clearer that young people would have preferred jobs down the country if they were there. There is no question that transition means difficulties. However, the place to which we seek to go will be much better than the place we are now which discriminates against those who feel they should have a right to a public service career without having to come to the capital city.Another major problem in the public service, of which we are all aware, is that there is only a certain career path for those outside the capital city. For example, in my Department the highest officer outside of Dublin is a principal officer. This means we get a logjam behind some principal officers who obviously do not want promotion to Dublin. Most principal officers and assistant principal officers in rural local locations will not find many applications to come to Dublin. On the other hand, neither they nor the people behind them have any promotion prospects.There is constant negative kicking at the decentralisation issue from certain Oppositions parties. They will not come out clearly and say they do not believe in decentralisation but want to put a dris chosáin in its way all the time. I am disappointed by that. They give no consideration to the denial of rights over so many years to people from rural areas to a public service career in their community.

The Minister said that many people have applied to be decentralised to Cnoc Mhuire and Na Forbacha, which is in his constituency. Can he elaborate further on the figures available to him? How many people have applied to be decentralised to Gaoth Dobhair, which is in my constituency? It was announced that Foras na Gaeilge would be relocated to Gaoth Dobhair.

Such people are older, by definition, and are more likely to have families. They need to consider of all sorts of factors, such as the availability of third level education facilities. Has the Government examined why senior civil servants do not want to decentralise? I presume they are concerned about the career implications of decentralisation.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	301	Some people believe that decentralisation will be good for one's career. The tenor of the question asked by Deputy Boyle was that staying in Dublin might not be so good for one's career because when promotion opportunities arise there, few people will apply for many places. I think the tenor of the Deputy's question was that one's chances of promotion will be much better if one decentralises.I sometimes think we can over-analyse the obvious. It is obvious that it is much easier for young people from the country, who may have been working in the public service in Dublin for three or four years and may not have a partner or a family, to participate in the decentralisation programme. All they have to do is ask themselves whether they want to move. People who have been settled here for 25 years need to consider other implications, however. They might have a house, a partner with a job in Dublin and a teenage family attending various schools. The answer to Deputy O'Shea's question is self-evident.It is obvious that we must take every individual case as it comes. The global reasons for the higher take-up in the lower ranks are obvious. There are other factors which will facilitate the decentralisation programme when we begin to implement it. Such factors will make the implementation of the programme much easier than most people expect it to be. I am confident that progress can be made if we pursue the programme judiciously and sensitively. We are examining the options. A committee has been established in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to try to facilitate as smooth a transition as possible. I do not doubt that all the positions will be filled when the time comes.Questions No. 8 answered with Question No. 6.

Tá an staidéar teangeolaíoch seo, a thosaigh i mí Aibreáin 2004, dírithe ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht mar bhunús chun forbairt theangeolaíoch na Gaeltachta mar cheantar labhartha Gaeilge a threisiú agus athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar na limistéir oifigiúla Gaeltachta.

Tá a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil cúrsaí ag dul i léig taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí.

Go deimhin féin, le gairid bhí mé ag déanamh fiosrú chun a fhéachaint an bhfaigheadh muid an staidéar in am. An rud a tharla nuair a thosnaigh muid an staidéar ná gur déanfar cinnithe. Mar is eol don Teachta, ceann de na moltaí a bhí ag Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ná go dtabharfaí seans do na ceantair imeallacha iad féin a chruthú agus nach caithfear amach iad díreach thar oíche. Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte go bhfuil fonn orm brú ar aghaidh leis an cheist seo. Má cheapann éinne go bhfuil mé ag iarraidh é a chuir siar de bharr go bhfuil toghchán ag teacht, ní thuigeann siad an chás.An áit is mó ina ndéanann na limistéir Gaeltachta difríocht go praiticiúil ná an cheist a phléadh i gcomhthéacs vótáil i dtoghcháin an Údaráis. Go deimhin féin, bhí iontas orm nuair a bhí mé ag breathnú ar na haighneachtaí nach tógadh an cheist seo ach i gcabhair chás sna haighneachtaí a fuair muid roimh an toghchán maidir leis an Údarás, ach sin scéal eile. Bhí sé luaite, ach ní fhéadfá a rá go raibh sé téama an-mhór trasna na n-aighneachtaí ar fad.Maidir le caitheamh an airgid, is dóigh liom go gcaitheann an Roinn dhá chineál airgid — airgead a chaithfear as an Stáitchiste ar aon bhealach i chuile cheantair mar go bhfuil na saoráidí seo ag dul go dtí an phobal agus an airgead a chaithfear go speisialta mar gur Gaeltachtaí iad. Tá an chuid is mó den dara chineál sin airgid — scéim labhairt na Ghaeilge, deontais tithíochta — ceangailte le Gaeilgeoirí. Nuair a scrúdaítear na figiúirí, is beag dóibh atá á chaitheamh sna Ghaeltachtaí laga. Mar sin, éinne a cheapann go mbeadh mórchuid airgead breise le chaitheamh sna Ghaeltachtaí láidre dá ndéanfaí an Ghaeltacht a laghdú, tá míthuiscint iomlán orthu maidir le chaitheamh airgead na Roinne.

The Green Party asked this question in light of emergency legislation that was introduced by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs two weeks ago on foot of a number of court actions which were pending against his Department. We live in a society that, sadly, is becoming more litigious. Does the Department, which was established relatively recently, keep statistical information about the number of court actions which have been taken against it since 2002? Can the Minister of State comment on the Department's success rate in tackling such court cases?

The Deputy is probably making a distinction between court actions in which the Department might be directly involved or other cases before the courts in which the Department might be indirectly involved. I cannot provide figures offhand but I am sure there are very few such court actions, if any at all. However, I will try to find the relevant figures and forward them to the Deputy.There would be normal court cases involving commercial interests, in which the Department might have an interest in that the cases might refer to legislation or have an influence on some of the agencies under the remit of the Department.

The group was tasked with examining the overall progress made to date in implementing the strategy and with identifying future priorities for the remaining period up to 2008. The relevance of the strategy in tackling the current nature and extent of drug misuse in Ireland, including emerging trends, was also examined. The steering group has completed its deliberations and the Cabinet committee on social inclusion approved its report at its recent meeting.In keeping with the terms of reference of the review, the report looks broadly at progress made to date under the strategy's 100 actions and identifies a number of areas, across each of the pillars of the strategy that need to be prioritised in the remaining period up to 2008. Amendments to existing actions and new actions in some cases are recommended to give renewed focus and priority to the issues for the remainder of the strategy. The report will be launched on Thursday 2 June in the Government press centre.

On the question, the House knows that the drugs strategy is not working, as is clear from results on the ground. I hope the review is honest, practical and highlights the problems. I accept that the strategy has worked to an extent in some areas and may have led to slight improvements. However, the majority view is that the strategy is not working.What actions will be permitted under the review? Will there be a supplementary budget or Supplementary Estimate for this year to put increased funding into problem areas? The cocaine problem is growing. I presume the review refers to this and recommends urgent action. Will the House discuss finance for these actions in the coming weeks, given that there are only perhaps five sitting weeks before the summer recess?

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	311	In reply to Deputy English, the report states that the strategy is working well and that its objectives and aims are well focused. While it suggests some new priorities, and while a few of the strategy's 100 actions are being amended, fundamentally, the strategy gets a clean bill of health.There will not be a supplementary budget for this year. The budget for this year under the drugs subhead has already been increased by 18%. That has allowed me to do many things, including providing funding for the regional drugs task forces, which were of interest to the Deputy. The plans of seven of the ten regional drugs task forces are now being considered. They will be rolled out as the year progresses.These plans will address the point made by Deputy Boyle. I acknowledge that the number of heroin addicts in Dublin has stabilised at approximately 12,500 but that heroin use has spread, particularly to the towns of Leinster, such as Arklow, Carlow, Portlaoise, Tullamore, Athlone and similar towns. The services in such areas need improvement.However, given the 18% increase in funding in this area, no extra funding will be made available this year. Some €5 million was allocated to the regional plans, many of which did not begin last January. While we might not have enough money to roll out those plans on a whole year basis, by the time they get up and running, the year will be at least half over.Written answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Thank you for allowing me to raise this issue. I recognise the work of the National Council on Ageing and Older People for its report on the issue of ageism. The report showed that many older people felt they were fobbed off because of their age when they sought information on the health services available to them. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Power, has read the report, Perceptions of Ageism in Health and Social Services in Ireland, which is also concerned with the tendency towards prescribing many drugs at the same time to older people without consulting them, which the report construes as ageist.I have been concerned for some time about this issue of consultation with elderly people when they are in difficulties in hospitals, when decisions must be made about their discharge or when families are consulted about nursing home or other treatment options. It must be extremely upsetting for an elderly person not to be consulted, because his or her view should be the first to be considered by the health services.The report states that direct discrimination was evidenced by upper age limits of 65 years for breast screening, a matter which has been raised recently in the House and we have called for breast screening to be made available to people over the age of 65. It also points to discrimination in certain treatments through a lack of referrals for some specialist services and prejudicial attitudes by some staff towards older people. The report claims direct discrimination was evidenced by shortages of certain services of particular importance to older people and which disproportionately affect them.With regard to referrals to specialist services, a substantial number of older people reported that they felt directly discriminated against because of their age. Health staff were consulted about this by the authors of the report and agreed that such an approach was taken. An example in the report was the case of a man of 88 years who stated:We are always told that there wouldn't be any point in doing that operation at your age. They are acting as judges regarding our health and whether we are value for money.I was surprised that some health boards would not take any person aged 65 or over for stroke rehabilitation. I would be interested to know, and intend to put down a question to the Minister to discover which health boards have a policy that denies people over 65 stroke rehabilitation. The report states that one health board had no aggressive treatment for older people with cancer. In another region staff said there was no upper age limit for cancer treatment as long as the patient could tolerate it.The report also states that the older people interviewed particularly resented the practice of staff consulting family members about their condition rather than them. I fully agree with family consultations, but it is discriminatory not to involve the patient. Many older people reported negative experiences with staff in the acute sector and felt they were often ignored or not taken seriously.The National Council for Ageing and Older People considers this research a first and necessary step in the identification and elimination of ageism from the health services. The report's findings are not that surprising but very revealing. Many of us were concerned for some time as a result of our experience with constituents, mainly families dealing with an elderly person in hospital or accessing health services rather than the person in question. Most discussion on the issue has ignored the views, concerns, feelings and wishes of the elderly person whose personal autonomy is equal to everybody else's.

I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter as it provides an opportunity to discuss ageism and its adverse impact on our older population.The report attracted much publicity in the media and this must be welcomed. It has put the issue on the agenda. While there is much discrimination against older people a certain amount is unintentional. Nonetheless we must change the situation and prevailing attitudes that cannot be tolerated in a modern Ireland.The Department of Health and Children welcomes the publication of the report, Perceptions of Ageism in Health and Social Services in Ireland, by the National Council on Ageing and Older People. It highlights the findings of research carried out in the ten former health boards during 2004 involving some 450 older people and 150 health and social services staff. The study sought to investigate whether older Irish people experience ageism within health and social services and, if so, to ascertain the impact of this experience. Ageism refers to deeply rooted negative beliefs about older people and the ageing process which may lead to age discrimination.The Department is committed to promoting healthy ageing and an age-friendly society. It is also committed to ensuring that older people who have contributed to the development of our society are treated with dignity and respect when receiving health care services.The Deputy mentioned consulting with older people. Older people are sometimes ignored and their views are not always sought. However, the situation is changing and must continue to change. We cannot allow for decisions to be taken on behalf of older people without consulting them. They are in the best position to know what they want and it is vital that they are not taken for granted. They have the same mind as the rest of us and the fact that they have a little more experience in life is no reason to ignore their views. Many older people, when they finish their normal working lives, become involved in voluntary organisations and make a huge contribution. Therefore it is important to put in place the necessary structures to allow them to make that contribution to society. The Government is fully committed to developing services for older people, including those who are sick. Home care packages will help them to live at home with dignity for as long as possible.The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the provision of health care services throughout the country and must ensure that all the services it provides are age friendly. The report will be very helpful to the HSE in this regard and I thank the National Council for Ageing and Older People for raising awareness of the issue of ageism in the health service.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The lack of public transport is one of the major issues that affects the people in my constituency and beyond. There is a need to increase the capacity on the northern line and provide a rail link or metro to Dublin Airport and Swords.Dublin is the only European capital without a direct rail network to its main airport. In view of this, and given the projected population increase to the airport and other related traffic issues, it is imperative that the metro line proposal be included in the Minister's ten year transport plans being finalised at present.I hear on the grapevine that the extension of the metro to Swords will not be included in phase one. Such a decision would be a disaster and commuters bringing their cars to Dublin Airport to access the metro to the city centre would infinitely worsen the already chaotic situation. It would be impossible to get to or from the airport and the area would become gridlocked. Neither would it make economic sense as a successful metro requires a viable adjacent catchment area. Such an area is available in Swords, which now has a population of 30,000 people. It is estimated that the cost of the extension to Swords would be approximately €300 million. Fingal Country Council could come up with €150 million through development levies and available detailed proposals outline stations at Airside, Pavillions, Seatown, Fingallions, Lissenhall and park and ride facilities. It would be a monumental disaster if the Government decides not to proceed with the metro or extend it to Swords.Significant development is taking place along the rail network from Balbriggan, Skerries, Lusk and Rush, Donabate, Malahide and Portmarnock on the clear understanding that necessary public transport infrastructures will be in place. Unfortunately that is not the case. We appreciate that Irish Rail was in a position to increase the capacity at morning and evening peak periods by almost 40% last year due to the lengthening of the Arrow trains from six to eight carriages. The situation is once again reaching crisis proportions with no real improvements pending until 2009 at the earliest depending on whether the Government gets its act together which it has not done to date.I read with interest views expressed by my constituency colleagues, Deputies Sargent and Glennon. It is imperative that elected members be up-front and honest with their electorate. Deputy Glennon calls on the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, to commit to the extension of the DART to north Fingal no later than the end of 2006. Deputy Sargent recommends that the proposed metro be extended from Swords to Donabate. Both of these objectives are laudable and can hopefully be implemented in the long term. Hard pressed and stressed rail commuters deserve better. Regardless of the long-term objectives of these promises, they would not provide one additional seat for commuters in the short term.The existing rail network has severe limitations that affect the capacity to extend the service. There is one line to the city centre. The cross line from Connolly to Pearse stations is operating at full capacity with 12 trains per hour. It is therefore not possible to provide more frequent services at peak periods. The DART upgrade project, which involves the upgrading of signalling in the city centre, will result in an increase in the number of trains from 12 to 16 per hour, whenever that comes about. However, that will only provide one additional train on the northern route, which is insufficient.All the reports available to me indicate that the only way forward is the construction of a new station at the docklands, which in any event will be part of Iarnród Éireann's exciting proposals for an interconnector. This new station would initially be linked to the Maynooth-Kildare line and thus provide additional much needed capacity through Connolly Station for the northern route and the DART to Malahide and Howth.I am not satisfied that the Minister and the Government have given this matter the priority it requires. During the debate on the Estimates, the Minister for Transport said he was providing €5 million this year for this project. That is a miserly and unacceptable response from the Minister to the needs of the commuting population of greater Dublin, many of whom have bought houses and transferred to new locations on the basis of public transport being available. We need action, not press releases. The Minister should do his job and provide the needs for the people of the greater Dublin area.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I thank Deputy Seán Ryan for raising this matter. He asked me to take action. The House will appreciate that I am a man who does not need to be asked or encouraged to take action; it comes naturally to me.I am aware of Deputy Ryan's concern about the issue he raised. Deputies Sargent, Wright and Glennon have also raised the issue of the metro for north Dublin. I am delighted to respond positively to this debate as a "Dub", a public representative for the constituency of Dublin North-Central and also as Minister of State for transport. I fully accept the need to provide a metro line and a new Dublin docklands rail station. I assure Deputy Ryan that I am fighting hard, and I believe he knows that, for both these projects and I am confident that during my watch real progress will be made on the metro and the Dublin docklands rail station. I am not stopping at that, however, if Deputies will excuse the pun. There will be other improvements in public transport services in the north Dublin region.Deputy Ryan referred to the Minister for Finance's contribution to the budget debate. In fairness, the Deputy must acknowledge and give due credit to the Minister, Deputy Cowen. For the first time a Minister for Finance gave the Department of Transport a ten-year envelope which will allow us go about the planning of what are deemed to be long-term projects, whether it is the metro we will deliver on, the Dublin Port tunnel or the tremendous carriageways and dual carriageways we are building throughout the country. There are long lead-in times for these projects and the ten-year envelope will give us great scope in that regard.The programme for Government contains a commitment to develop the metro for Dublin. The Railway Procurement Agency has submitted to my Department a detailed case for phase one of the metro, which would be procured on a public private partnership basis. The RPA has proposed that phase one would run from St. Stephen's Green to the airport in approximately 17 minutes. It would serve key areas such as Trinity College, the Mater Hospital, Ballymun and DCU and an extension to Swords is under consideration.It is estimated that phase one would carry about 24 million passengers per annum, rising to about 50 million over time. It will provide a new rail commuter corridor through north Dublin in areas not served by rail and would be a significant step in the creation of integrated public transport for Dublin, which is a reflection of Fianna Fáil policy on transport for Dublin. The cost of phase one of the metro will be met by the Exchequer through an annual availability payment over a 26-year period commencing when construction is complete. While value for money for the State will remain a central consideration, the cost of the metro ultimately will be determined by market forces through a competitive tendering process.By way of giving information to the House, I recently made an interesting visit to Munich, some of which was covered by the media, and an aspect I examined there was the metro and the costs associated with that. I was greatly impressed with what I learned and saw in Munich.A business case has been submitted to my Department by Iarnród Éireann for the development of a greater Dublin integrated rail network, which is also required, aimed at meeting the projected demand for rail services into the future. Included in the business case are proposals to construct a new rail station in the city centre area; provide an interconnector tunnel linking the existing rail network and serving the Dublin docklands; provide a spur off the Maynooth line to the N3 beyond Dunboyne; and expand the capacity of the DART.The Government is considering the metro, the Iarnród Éireann plan and all other proposals for the development of the transport system in the context of a national ten-year transport investment framework that will propose an integrated solution to the transport challenges facing greater Dublin and the country as a whole.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State for taking it. There is grave concern in the Leinster area about the beet quota and the problems growers envisage in the coming harvesting season. Sowing of the seedlings was delayed because of a lack of commitment in regard to Greencore and the process of preparing the harvest has been of concern to those farmers who have earned a living from beet harvesting over the years.There is a major problem in respect of transport in that none of the depots promised have come on stream. Last February or March, the Minister for Agriculture and Food said that one of her priorities would be to ensure that the transport issue was dealt with as a matter of urgency. That has not happened to date and no planning application has been submitted to any local authority in the general area. There were talks of one in Carlow and Portlaoise and the possible upgrading of another in Wellingtonbridge in Wexford, but none of that has happened.The start date for the campaign is 19 September, but nothing has happened to date. If we consider the delays in the planning process, nothing will happen in time for the forthcoming beet harvest. If that happens, we will face major problems in that the farmers will attempt to access the factory in Mallow by truck from the Leinster area because no other means are available to them. No capital costs will have been made available to obtain additional wagons. Those available will only be able to deal with the Wexford area campaign and all the beet from north Leinster will have to be transported by truck. It is of major concern to the farming community that 70% of the harvest will have to travel by road, and we can all imagine what will happen in that regard.The concern of the community is that Greencore is dragging its heels on this matter until after 22 June when the reforms will be announced by the European Commission. There is talk on the grapevine of proposals to buy out the quotas of the members on the periphery of the community. One could assume that is one of the reasons planning applications have not been made and no beet seedlings were released in time to plant early to ensure a good crop. The later the seedlings are put down, the worse the crop will be. The farming community has major concerns about the future of the beet harvest, especially in the Leinster area, because of the lack of commitment of Greencore. The one commitment the Minister for Agriculture and Food gave was that the transport matter would be resolved at the earliest opportunity, but no progress has been made.The overall picture is bleak and seems to involve holding back until reforms come from the Commission on 22 June. One wonders where we stand on the sugar quota. The Government always talks about the golden share but it seems to be disappearing rapidly. It is no longer a question of retaining the sugar quota or maintaining a crop and an industry that has been beneficial not only to the farming community but also to the areas where it is grown, the employees of the factories in Carlow and Mallow and subsidiary industries. I hope the Minister for State and the Minister for Agriculture can give some indication as to where we will go with this and what will happen at the European Commission on 22 June.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I thank Deputy Wall for raising this issue. I am aware of the concerns that were expressed following the closure of Carlow sugar factory in March about transport arrangements for the delivery of sugar beet to Mallow. The transport issue is one to be resolved between Irish Sugar Limited and the beet growers and I have no function that regard. I understand the two parties have been working constructively on this and other issues and I am satisfied they can devise satisfactory arrangements to deal with the new situation. The company has already announced plans for a new rail depot to assist beet growers to make their deliveries.The European Commission recently signalled its intention to publish the formal legislative proposals for reform of the European Union sugar regime on 22 June. The Commission's initial ideas for reform as outlined in its communication of last July would, if adopted, have serious consequences for sugar beet growing and processing in this country and the Minister has made it abundantly clear in discussions in the Council of Ministers that proposals on those lines are unacceptable. Ireland is not alone in this regard. We are in a group of ten member states with shared concerns about the Commission's initial proposals and we made a joint ministerial submission to the Commission in this regard.In our view, the aim should be to maintain the existing distribution of sugar beet and sugar production in the entire EU territory. We believe that reform should be based on the following principles: an import system from third countries which will ensure predictable and regular import quantities and it is important to remember that the poorest sugar-producing countries want an arrangement like this rather than the race to the bottom in price terms that totally free access would bring; the price reduction should be significantly less than that proposed and should be implemented more gradually; the impact of the quota reductions should fall mainly on "C" production; and transfers of quotas among member states should not be allowed.It is generally acknowledged that reform of the sugar regime is now unavoidable for a number of reasons, in particular the developments at World Trade Organisation level and other international pressures. The recent ruling by the WTO appellate body will certainly add to the pressure for reform and there have been suggestions that when the reform proposals emerge, they may be even more severe than originally anticipated. Therefore, we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge facing us when the reform proposals come before the Council of Ministers in the autumn. Ireland's primary objective in the forthcoming negotiations will be to ensure that the future shape of the European Union sugar regime is consistent with the continuation of an efficient sugar beet growing and processing industry in this country.

I am satisfied that it accords with specific policy directions that I have given to Údarás in this regard in recent years, namely, to target at least 20% of capital expenditure towards Irish language-based investments and to allocate a specific amount of current resources towards Irish language promotional activities.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 52 together.As the Deputies are aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.In relation to the prevalence of cocaine use in Ireland, the NACD-DAIRU drug prevalence survey is generally regarded as the most reliable baseline data on drug prevalence in Ireland. That study, which surveyed 8,442 people aged 15 to 64 in Ireland and in Northern Ireland between October 2002 and April 2003, reported that 3.1% of the population had ever used cocaine, 1.1% had used it in the last 12 months and 0.3% had used it in the last month. Compared with similar comprehensive population surveys undertaken in other European countries, these figures suggest that Ireland is roughly average in terms of use.There are no specific studies on the use of crack cocaine in Ireland and the only available figures come from the NACD-DAIRU drug prevalence survey. However, caution must be exercised in this regard as general surveys such as this are not good measures of "hidden" populations such as heroin and crack users. For information, in that survey, reported crack cocaine was very low — 0.4% reported lifetime use, 0.1% reported use in the last 12 months and there were no respondents in relation to last month use.In relation to the media reports, I would be most concerned about such activity and I have asked my officials to discuss these claims with the Garda Síochána.As I have outlined to this House on a number of occasions, I am confident that through the implementation of the actions in the national drugs strategy and the projects and initiatives operated through the local drugs task forces, LDTFs, the problem of cocaine use can be addressed. Each of the LDTFs has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in their area based on their own identified priorities and they continue to have regular contact with the local communities in which they are based.These projects deal with supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation for a range of drugs, including cocaine. We must be aware that most drug users engage in poly-drug use and, therefore, projects should be able to address this pattern of usage rather than concentrating on one drug to the exclusion of others.I would add that, where cocaine usage is seen as an emerging problem in LDTF areas, it is open to the task forces to develop proposals and apply under the new emerging needs fund which I announced in January last. The LDTFs were invited to submit applications to the national drugs strategy team, NDST, for consideration by 31 March. In addition, late last year, I approved funding of almost €400,000 for a number of pilot cocaine projects which are currently being rolled out in selected task force areas. I will be examining the outcomes of these projects closely over the coming months.With regard to treatment, the Deputies will be aware that there is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine, in crack or powder form, and existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available. In this context, it should be noted that the health services have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in the last number of years.On the prevention side, the ongoing national awareness campaign on drugs has addressed the issue of cocaine through a well-received campaign. The campaign aims to tackle the perception held by some that cocaine use is safe. In regard to supply, the gardaí and Customs and Excise continue to target cocaine dealers and have very significantly increased seizures of cocaine in recent years.In addition, the mid-term review of the strategy, which will be published in early June, will identify priorities for action in the remaining period up to 2008. The need to amend the strategy to reflect changing patterns of drug use will be considered in this context.I can assure the Deputies that the Government will continue to monitor the situation regarding cocaine very closely.

Work on these matters is continuing in my Department.In relation to the national development programme, I draw the Deputy's particular attention to the provision of funding for the islands and Gaeltacht under the local infrastructure — non-national roads measure, the local infrastructure sub-programme — urban and village renewal measure and the Gaeltacht — islands harbour sub-measure.The national spatial strategy has specific references to linguistic heritage, the Gaeltacht and islands, and cultural identities, and outlines policy responses to relevant areas.

This guide provides detailed information to communities who wish to become involved in wind energy development.Funding is available under the Leader+ and area based rural development initiatives for environmentally friendly initiatives, including the provision of a range of assistance types for developing alternative-renewable energy and waste management initiatives using new technologies and know-how.Funding can also be provided by Údarás na Gaeltachta to community based groups in Gaeltacht areas, including Gaeltacht islands, to investigate the possibility of establishing renewable energy projects.The Deputy may also be interested in the alternative energy requirement, AER, programme, which seeks applications from groups to build, own and operate renewable energy generating plants, and to supply electricity from these to the Electricity Supply Board. This programme is administered by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.

Both single-phase and three-phase installations are eligible for assistance under the scheme.Financial assistance for the conversion to three-phase electricity is provided also under the CLÁR programme which is operated by my Department. The objective of the programme is to address depopulation as well as decline and lack of services in rural areas. CLÁR funds the cost of the customer contribution to the ESB for conversion from single-phase to three-phase electricity for small business and enterprises in CLÁR areas with no more than ten employees.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	337	In February 2004, I established a countryside council called Comhairle na Tuaithe to address issues relating to waymarked ways and access. This decision followed consideration by the Rural-Agri-Tourism Advisory Group of a report presented by the Consultation Group on Access to Waymarked Ways. The establishment of a countryside council was the key recommendation of the report.Comhairle na Tuaithe has the following aims: to ensure that all appropriate means are used to resolve conflicts that arise in relation to access issues and responsible enjoyment of the countryside; to ensure that all those with an interest and concern in the sustainable development and proper management of the recreational amenities of the countryside are fully consulted on their future management; to develop and update, as necessary, a national countryside recreation strategy; to raise awareness of the benefits to and responsibilities of recreational use of the countryside and to carry out research and training on related issues; to ensure that adequate funding is made available to allow the organisation to achieve these aims; and to examine the benefits and management of increased leisure use.Comhairle na Tuaithe consists of representatives from the farming organisations, recreational users of the countryside and State bodies with an interest in the countryside. It has approached its work in the spirit of co-operation and through working groups which progress components of these aims.In order to achieve its work programme, Comhairle na Tuaithe has established working groups to address specific required outputs. These groups are addressing: the examination of the issues surrounding access to the countryside; the development of a national countryside recreation strategy; and the development of a countryside code.Comhairle na Tuaithe held a successful national conference to promote and develop its work, including the areas specifically outlined above. This event also served as an opportunity to progress the development of a countryside recreation strategy. There were approximately 200 attendees at the conference and the report of the conference has been published on the Department's website.Comhairle na Tuaithe is continuing to meet regularly, facilitated by my Department, and hopes to have agreed a countryside code in the near future. Work is also ongoing in relation to the development of a national countryside recreation strategy. I look forward to receiving a report from Comhairle na Tuaithe which will report on matters in the near future. I will carefully consider any proposals which it may make to me.As I have made clear on a number of occasions, I believe it is only through working together as a community on this issue and reaching an amicable agreement which accommodates all sides that these issues can best be addressed. We can then strengthen the positive image of rural Ireland, and crucially, further develop rural tourism.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 118 together.I refer the Deputy to my previous answer to Question No. 212 of 1 February 2005 in relation to funding and supports for community schemes throughout the country in 2005.Regarding the scope and scale of grant aid through my Department for community, rural and Gaeltacht ventures in the future, the provision in the Estimates for 2005 for the CLÁR programme is €13.7 million, a 13% increase on the 2004 outturn, and this will facilitate the continuation of investment under existing measures of the programme as well as providing scope for the introduction of new measures depending on the needs identified. As in the last three years, CLÁR will continue in 2005 to build on the successes achieved to date in regenerating rural areas. Expenditure of some €35 million over 2002-04 levered out a further estimated €36.5 million in related public and private expenditure into areas which otherwise would have been bottom of the list for infrastructure investment.Under the community development programme, CDP, 185 community development projects will be funded in 2005. A further five CDPs are in pre-development at present. Funding to these five is likely to be announced later this year, subject to satisfactory workplans being furnished by these projects.Under the local development social inclusion programme, 38 area partnerships, 31 community partnerships and two territorial employment pacts will be funded in 2005. There are no plans to expand the number of groups funded in 2005.Under the funding scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies, 32 groups are currently being funded totalling €5.48 million over three years. Under the funding scheme for training and supports, 20 projects are currently being funded totalling €1.83 million over three years. The national anti-poverty networks are being funded to a total of €4.1million over three years.The Department is funding volunteering through its existing grants to three volunteer groups totalling €829,595 over a three year period. In the new volunteering package, announced in March 2005, core funding will be provided to six further volunteer bureaux totalling €900,000 over the next three years. Funding totalling €150,000 over three years is being provided to Volunteer Centres Ireland for the recruitment of a development officer. A further €500,000 of local area partnership funding is being ring-fenced for measures that encourage volunteers and volunteering. A further €500,000 of the Department's Cohesion Fund will be spent on measures that will promote volunteers and volunteering locally.Funding totalling €600,000 is being provided to support the young social innovators programme including the Annual Showcase awards, over three years.Funding, totalling €330,000 over three years, is also being provided to the DIT community learning programme, CLP, which is an example of a new teaching method called service-learning, and it works by integrating classroom learning in any subject with suitable volunteering activity.The programme of grants for locally based community and voluntary organisations comprises two schemes of once-off grants to local voluntary and community groups: the scheme of equipment and refurbishment grants provides essential physical supports for the local community and voluntary sector; and the scheme of education, training and research grants aimed at enhancing the capacity of local communities. I have increased the funding available for this programme to €2.9 million in 2005 from €2.7 million in 2004.The scheme of community support for older people encourages and assists local support for older people by means of a community based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. The scheme is operated on an annual basis. Funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations on behalf of older people in their community.Funding can be provided for the following security equipment: window locks, door chains, door locks and security lighting, socially monitored alarm systems and smoke alarms. I have increased the funding available for this programme to €2.8 million in 2005 from €2.4 million in 2004.My Department's expenditure on the islands has risen from just €2.314 million in 1997 to €13.228 million in 2004 with a further increased allocation of €15.862 million provided for in the 2005 Revised Estimates. This funding facilitates the provision of transport services to the mainland for island communities and assists in improving both public and social infrastructure on the islands. My Department is constantly seeking new ways of ensuring the future of sustainable communities on the islands and, in this context, I have recently announced the establishment of a new scheme, the enterprise scheme for non-Gaeltacht islands, to encourage enterprise development on those islands which do not come under the remit of Údarás na Gaeltachta.Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are currently a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 provides for significant changes to the disbursement process and for the establishment of a reconstituted board. The Bill completed its passage through both houses of the Oireachtas last Tuesday, 17 May.

The regional breakdown of this expenditure is €9.5 billion for the BMW tegion and €26.5 billion for the southern and eastern region representing 74% and 104% of profiled expenditure, respectively.Table 1 sets out the regional breakdown of forecast expenditure in percentage terms for the operational programmes under the NDP for both regions for the period January 2000 to December 2004. These forecasts of expenditure were set in 2000 when the NDP was prepared.Operational ProgrammeNationalBMW RegionS&E Region(€m)%%Economic & Social Infrastructure17,9772773Employment & Human Resource Development10,4323070Productive Sector4,9683664BMW Regional2,880100—S&E Regional3,937—100Peace II141100—Technical Assistance83862Total40,3433268The breakdown of actual expenditure incurred in percentage terms to December 2004 for each operational programme is set out in Table 2. These figures are provisional until approved by the NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee at its meeting in June 2005.Operational ProgrammeNationalBMW RegionS&E Region(€m)%%Economic & Social Infrastructure19,1752278Employment & Human Resource Development10,0182971Productive Sector2,4842476BMW Regional1,761100—S&E Regional2,658—100Peace II116100—Technical Assistance9.64060Total36,2212773The economic and social infrastructure operational programme in the BMW region, the productive sector operational programme and the BMW regional programme have failed to date to achieve the forecast levels of expenditure.Due to changes in the nature of the interventions supported by the productive sector operational programme, performance over the period of the NDP appears disappointing for this operational programme. However, the level of expenditure and its regional breakdown at the beginning of the NDP proved to be unrealistically high given the nature of industrial development in recent years.Expenditure outturns show that infrastructural investment to date in the BMW region is behind the indicative target set out in the NDP. There has, however, been a rapid increase in spend-allocation on national roads in the BMW region between 2003 and 2005 with the allocation-spend increasing from €143 million in 2003 to €236 million in 2004 and €382 million in 2005.The underspend in the BMW regional programme reflects the disappointing level of take up of some measures, and consequent lack of private funding, under that programme.The rural development goal of my Department is to promote and maintain living and working populations in rural areas by helping to foster sustainable and culturally vibrant communities there. In that context, particular initiatives I have taken include: extension of CLÁR programme and development of the range of measures within its scope; establishment of the new rural social scheme; initiatives on small food producers and on rural enterprise support; implementation of the farm electrification grant scheme, for which I recently assumed responsibility from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; and establishment of Comhairle Na Tuaithe.In addition, my Department also supports rural development through: the Leader programme; working in close co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food and the EU Commission in the negotiations on the adoption of the draft EU regulation on rural development for the period 2007-13; consideration, in co-operation with relevant Departments, of action on the review of rural enterprise supports; support of projects under the rural development fund; promoting debate and progressing rural development issues through the National Rural Development Forum; and continuation of cross-Border co-operation in rural development; leading the Rural Development Co-ordinating Committee under the NDP; participation as appropriate in interdepartmental committees on issues appropriate to rural development such as the national spatial strategy; continuation of support to the Western Development Commission and Údarás na Gaeltachta in the discharge of its functions and spend on the islands and the Gaeltacht.

I provided a copy of the joint statement to the Oireachtas Library on 4 May last.In line with the normal confidentiality that applies to personnel matters, the Departments stated that they do not propose to publish the report of the investigators. This remains the position. However, their joint statement included a summary of the findings of the investigators' report, as well as the actions to be taken following the findings, as agreed by the Departments with the chief executive of Waterways Ireland.Waterways Ireland is, at present, progressing these actions and, as confirmed in the joint statement, the Departments will be monitoring progress during 2005 in this regard.

The objective is to produce a practical guide based on these principles. A consultant was engaged to prepare this manual. The draft manual is under consideration in my Department.The White Paper provides for a review of the Implementation Advisory Group and as part of that process my Department is currently examining practical measures to further advance key principles as set out in the White Paper.As I previously stated, in my reply to Question No. 63 of 14 December 2004 the White Paper remains Government policy. However, the context in which White Paper policy is to be implemented has clearly changed with time. Hence, while the broad principles of the White Paper remain, it is appropriate that the mechanisms for addressing these be adjusted to appropriately reflect wider developments including contextual, programme and structural changes.

It should be noted that it is not possible to give a breakdown by Dáil constituency as figures are compiled by county in all cases except for the local drug task force, LDTF, where the figures are given by area.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I am pleased to tell the Deputy that a sum of €5 million per annum is available to the regional drugs task forces to assist them in implementing their action plans.To date, seven of the ten regional drugs task forces have submitted their plans to the National Drugs Strategy Team, NDST, for assessment and I understand that the remaining three are expected shortly. On receipt of these proposals, I will be making recommendations to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion for approval as early as possible.I am anxious that a number of new programmes and initiatives will be put in place in the regions in the coming months.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	345	As the Deputy is aware, as part of my brief, I have responsibility for the national drugs strategy in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, D-CRGA, and for the homeless strategy in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, D-EHLG. In addition, the D-EHLG is represented on the National Drugs Strategy Team and the Inter-Departmental Group on Drugs, which I chair, and the D-CRGA is represented on the Cross-Departmental Team on Homelessness. In this respect, I am happy that there is ongoing co-ordination at both ministerial and official levels between the two areas.In relation to services for homeless persons, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, recently published a report on drug use among the homeless population. Arising from the report, the NACD has made a number of recommendations to me in relation to responsibilities in both Departments, which I am currently examining. I will also be discussing these recommendations with the other relevant Ministers and their Departments.The NACD report has also had an input in terms of the discussions on the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy which will be published in early June and into the review of the homeless strategy which is currently ongoing.The Deputy should note that a number of homeless services have already been developed and expanded to cater for the needs of people with drug or alcohol problems, including services provided by Merchant's Quay, Dublin Simon and the DePaul Trust. Among these services is a low threshold, harm reduction hostel in Dublin, Clancy Night Shelter, which caters for people with a history of drug use or who are currently involved in drug use. This is an important development as it was the first service in the country to actively cater for this group.

To date, just over €85 million has been allocated or spent to support in the region of 450 projects, primarily in local drugs task force, LDTF, areas.Proposals submitted as part of a third round of capital allocations in LDTF areas are currently being examined by the National Assessment Committee for the fund, which is chaired by my Department. I hope to make announcements in this regard in the near future.As part of the overall fund, a number of services projects are also being supported in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow.

I refer the Deputies, in particular, to my replies to Questions Nos. 4 and 5 of 22 February 2005, 360 and 367 of 22 March 2005 and 24, 27 and 37 of 14 April 2005. As I indicated in these replies, since the decision to discontinue funding under the national anti-poverty networks programme was communicated to the Community Workers Co-operative on 17 December 2004, my Department has facilitated the organisation by holding a series of separate meetings with its representatives.As I have previously stated, I am fully satisfied that the Community Workers Co-operative has been afforded exhaustive access to appeal the decision. The group has not demonstrated a basis for reversing my decision at any of these meetings. Since the previous occasion on which I answered questions in the house on this matter correspondence has taken place at official level between my Department and the Community Workers Co-operative.

In 2002 and 2003 CLÁR funding of nearly €500,000 was provided for more than 30 health projects in the selected areas. In October 2004 I announced a second round of minor health projects in the CLÁR areas covered by the north-eastern, north-western, western, mid-western, south-eastern and southern health boards. Each health board covering CLÁR areas was invited, in the first instance, to submit proposals for CLÁR funding to the Department of Health and Children. The total cost of the 95 projects subsequently approved by the Department of Health and Children and recommended to my Department for funding is nearly €7.5 million. Of this, the CLÁR programme has approved some €2.5 million in line with the funding ratio of €2 of health board or other funding for every €1 in CLÁR funding. The work will be carried out fully in the period October 2004 to December 2006.Health projects to be funded include development, refurbishment and improvement of health centres and facilities, including ambulance services, the provision of people carriers and upgrades to social centres, day care centres, etc.

Fifteen centres were identified for a pilot trial of broadband technology in selected industrial estates, business and educational-training centres in the CLÁR regions. Following technical and financial evaluations, 12 locations were identified to receive broadband and grant aid under the CLÁR programme of almost €400,000 supported this rollout in 2004. Boyle, Carlingford, Cootehill, Mohill, Tubbercurry, Lismore, Tulla, Ballycastle, Clifden, Corraun, Carna and Kilcar are benefiting from high speed broadband connections at speeds equal to or better than most current market offerings, using the latest high speed wireless and satellite technologies.In 2003, following discussions with the BMW regional assembly, my Department agreed to fund, under the CLÁR programme, a wireless based Internet service for three projects covering five locations in CLÁR areas in the BMW region at the rate of 80% —€254,709 — of the total cost. The projects are Dungloe, County Donegal, Killala, County Mayo, Enniscrone, County Sligo, Lanesborough, County Longford and Ballyleague, County Roscommon. At the end of 2004 the three projects were up and running.In addition, CLÁR and Údarás na Gaeltachta are developing proposals to supply town fibre optic networks to the industrial parks in Belmullet, County Mayo and Dungloe, County Donegal. The projects, expected to cost in the region of €260,000 in total, would be funded on a 50-50 basis. I do not propose to place any further calls for broadband proposal in CLÁR areas as, having consulted with Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, it advised that the county and group broadband schemes run by that Department amply accommodate broadband supply to rural areas.The objective of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources schemes is to promote the roll-out of broadband access through the establishment of sustainable broadband services in towns, villages, rural hinterlands and under-served areas of larger towns on the basis of local or regional authority co-ordination and community driven initiatives. They are open to all smaller and rural communities of less than 1,500 people. This enables local communities to work with a broadband service provider of their own choice or draw up and implement their own broadband plan, with the aim of launching a broadband service for residents and small and medium sized businesses in their respective areas.

This was intended to allow for a pilot programme under which an annual grant of up to a maximum of €130,000 would be available to four suitably qualified community based Gaeltacht organisations over a three year period to assist in the preparation and implementation of Irish language plans within their areas of operation.Following a public call for applications, a process of assessment according to set criteria was carried out in co-operation with Údarás na Gaeltachta. Five groups were selected following this process and annual funding ranging from €70,000 to €110,000 has been allocated to the respective groups depending on their own anticipated expenditure. The €1.56 million budget is sufficient to allow for the full implementation of the pilot phase of the initiative. The provision of further funding will depend on the success of the initiative in meeting the goals set out in the various plans.

This is an independent statutory body, under the aegis of my Department, established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The board engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf, which involves the disbursement of up to €60 million from the fund.Disbursements from the dormant accounts fund are for the purpose of assisting three broad categories of persons — those who are economically or socially disadvantaged, those who are educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability. To date the board has approved 481 projects for funding totalling approximately €55 million, from the initial allocation of €60 million. In accordance with the board's disbursement plan, the bulk of this funding is initially being targeted at those areas designated as most disadvantaged.To date, the only resources from the dormant accounts fund, which have accrued directly to my Department were in respect of funding for the rural social scheme. In July 2004, following consultation with the board and in accordance with the terms of the Dormant Accounts Act 2001, as amended, €10 million from the fund was transferred to my Department to partly finance the rural social scheme. The rural social scheme provides ongoing income and employment support to small farmers who can no longer make a viable living on the land and is one that fully meets the objectives of the dormant accounts scheme. In the context of the continued rollout of the rural social scheme, I will monitor the direct support provided by the dormant accounts fund and, if necessary, consult with the board about any further allocations from the fund.The current value of the dormant accounts fund is in the region of €229 million. This figure includes amounts transferred to the fund in 2003 —€196 million, 2004 —€56 million and 2005 —€40.5 million. The €40.5 million transferred in 2005 includes a figure of €7.6 million from dormant insurance accounts.The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 completed its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas last Tuesday, 17 May. The Bill provides for significant changes to the disbursement process and for the establishment of a reconstituted board.

The process used in determining a person's eligibility for subvention is set out in the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993.The placing of a person in a private nursing home is a private matter between the person or his or her representatives and the nursing home proprietor, as are the fees charged in these facilities. The subvention scheme was introduced to assist with the cost of private nursing home care. It was never intended that a subvention payment would meet the full costs of private nursing home care. It should be noted that the regulations governing means assessment were devised to try to provide an equitable system of payment and to direct available resources to those most in need. The Government is aware of the difficulties some people are having with respect to the cost of long-term care and are actively addressing the issues which have arisen.Professor Eamon O'Shea of NUI Galway was commissioned to study the nursing home subvention scheme and recommendations arising from this study are being considered. These will be considered in the overall context of the future provision and funding of long-term care, both community based and residential. The Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care, commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, examined issues surrounding the financing of long-term care. A working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs has been established following on from the publication of the report.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I have clarified with the Deputy's office that the issue he refers to involves self-employed individuals who have reckonable income of less than €3,174 in a particular year and consequently are not liable to pay PRSI. Such individuals may be entitled to make voluntary contributions to the Department of Social and Family Affairs under the PRSI system, provided certain conditions are met, but they may not always be aware of this. The Deputy is seeking that a mechanism be put in place whereby these individuals are notified of their possible entitlement to make voluntary contributions, thus protecting their pension entitlements.The Revenue Commissioners already notify those who are considered to have no net tax liability to contact the Department of Social and Family Affairs about their PRSI contributions. I have asked them to examine the feasibility of the Deputy's request with regard to those individuals who are not liable for PRSI because they are under the €3,174 PRSI threshold but who do submit a return of income to the Revenue Commissioners. I will write further to the Deputy when I receive a response from the Revenue Commissioners.

The remainder of the property was settled on two trustees with the provision that on the Senator's death it would pass to the use of the State forever "to the intent that the same may constitute a memorial to Patrick Henry Pearse and William James Pearse and to their deeds and efforts for the freedom of Ireland and the preservation and promotion of the Irish Language". Senator Pearse died in November 1968. The property is managed as part of the State property portfolio by the Commissioners of Public Works. The commissioners have granted a licence to a mobile phone operator to erect telecommunications equipment within the park. The installation requires planning permission and a planning application has been lodged with the local authority.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I am advised by the Marine Institute that no direct scientific information is available to assess the catch distribution of wild salmon returning to the south east coast. However, research has consistently shown that, while tagged, ranched fish have been found in a wide range of fisheries remote from their home waters, in general, the bulk of salmon taken from a given geographical area are taken in adjacent fisheries. This would indicate that the majority of the commercial harvest of salmon from the south east is most likely taken in adjacent fisheries in the south eastern area itself and in fisheries along the south coast. I am informed by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board that a large proportion of the commercial fishing quota in the southern region is caught inside the estuaries and up river by snap net and estuary fishermen in the Waterford district and the private licensees in the Lismore district, which signifies exploitation of a single stock. To gain more detailed information on the spread of catches along the south and east coasts, efforts are being made by the Marine Institute and the regional fisheries boards to capture and tag wild salmon smolts on the Rivers Laune and Suir. In addition, 11,000 tagged smolts were released in the River Suir. On their return in 2006 it may be possible to assess the pattern of exploitation by the various commercial fishing engines on these tagged groups.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I have previously advised the House that works carried out on the weir on the River Nore in Kilkenny City were undertaken on behalf of and are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works. Because of the impact that the new installation was having on the passage of migrating salmon up river, the regional fisheries board and the engineering division of this Department offered technical expertise to address the problem. I understand, from the chief executive of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board, that his staff, in co-operation with the engineers in this Department and the Office of Public Works, have installed a temporary extension to the fish pass in order to ameliorate the situation and allow for the passage of fish up river. I am also advised that a long-term solution is planned and it is expected will be completed during low water in the summer months. I am further advised by the board that some salmon encountered difficulties migrating to the spawning grounds during an eight day period at the beginning of January 2005. Low water levels throughout the catchment but specifically at Lacken Weir, Kilkenny, resulted in the hold up. While fresh redds were observed in the tributaries above Lacken Weir after the period, water conditions in the following few weeks prevented accurate counts being taken. Salmon migration in the Nore catchment occurs from May through to March, the main run being in August, September and October.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I am advised by the Central Fisheries Board that the data collected and published in the Wild Salmon And Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Fisheries Statistics Report is constructed primarily with a view to measuring exploitation rather than tags issued to anglers. Consequently, the information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. However, since 2002, only one tag is issued with a one day angling licence up to the 31 May. Three tags per day are issued thereafter during the season. Only one tag per one day licence was issued during September 2004. Five tags are issued with all other salmon and sea trout angling licences. When confirmation is provided that those initial five tags have been used, a further allocation of five tags to a maximum of 20 per season is made. Confirmation of use is verified through the log book. Prior to 2003 there was no limit to the number of tags that could be issued in a season. Anglers are obliged under the terms of the licence to return log books and any unused tags to the regional fisheries boards at the end of the season. However, there are variations in the level of compliance. The national average percentages of log book return in 2001, 2002 and 2003 were 43%, 52% and 57%, respectively. In addition, not all anglers who have returned logbooks will return their unused tags. A comment is entered into the database in relation to those licence holders who have returned unused tags. These entries are not in a format suitable for numerical analysis and cannot therefore be quantified. The Central Fisheries Board needs to examine the development of the database since 2001 to establish if it could provide this information for 2001 to 2003. The 2004 statistics are have not been finalised.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	406	Following my recent announcement on 12 April, the number of labour inspector posts has increased to 31. The additional inspectors will strengthen the labour inspectorate's capacity to ensure workers receive their entitlements under employment rights legislation. Arising from paragraph 12.4 of the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress, and to assist in the preparation of proposals for consideration by Government, a discussion document was prepared by the labour inspectorate regarding its mandate and resourcing. This comprehensive discussion document was prepared and circulated to the social partners in January of this year so that their views could be obtained. All the issues raised by the Deputy are considered in the document. The discussion document covered the full dimension of issues that impact on the operation of the labour inspectorate ranging from the legislative framework right through to the operational aspects and staff development. The document also examined a range of possibilities regarding the operation of the labour inspectorate and offered a spectrum of possibilities ranging from a compliance regime where the initiative would move more toward the complainant, with the inspectorate offering support; for a model where the right of initiative would be with it to conduct a hands-on approach. The discussion document, which identifies 39 key proposals, is not prescriptive; rather it seeks to present the arguments for and against an extensive range of issues impacting on the mandate and associated resourcing of the labour inspectorate and its linked business units. In the absence of appropriate analysis, no particular model can be endorsed. However, the purpose of their inclusion is primarily to stimulate debate and signal that fundamental changes in approach should be considered. The discussion document has been well received among the social partners with some comments received while others are awaited, although initial favourable views have been made known. An interactive phase on the discussion document will get under way shortly whereby the range of choices will be narrowed down and the issues raised by the Deputy will be considered in the context of the review.

The error was rectified by issuing a double payment to her on the next pay date. The executive has further advised that, in the course of a review of her rent supplement entitlement, the person concerned confirmed that there has been an increase in her household income. In addition to her one-parent family payment from my Department, she is receiving family maintenance payments of €120 a week, the first €95.23 of which is regarded as being for housing costs under rent supplement rules. She has been notified by the executive that her revised rent supplement entitlement is €62.20 per week, effective from 23 May 2005.

It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity on these transport services.I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme. However, while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide transport services where none exist.The issue of access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed through the rural transport initiative, managed by Area Development Management, ADM, on behalf of the Minister for Transport. My Department contributed €500,000 to the initiative in 2004 and I have secured €575,000 for 2005. This will ensure that free travel pass holders continue to have full access to community based transport services.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	411	The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment that provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.From August 1999, the full-time care and attention requirements were relaxed to introduce an element of flexibility for carers, while still safeguarding the needs and interests of care recipients. Under these arrangements, which were introduced in recognition of the economic and therapeutic value of work, carers may work for up to ten hours per week. However, the carer's allowance scheme is designed for full time carers and, accordingly, in allowing for flexibility to work, a balance needs to be struck between the needs of the care recipient and needs of the carer to maintain contact with the labour market.Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. The types of services that recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to the people involved will continue to be developed. All allowances and systems of support and the qualifying conditions will be kept under review.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	412	The concerns to which the Deputy refers relate to the treatment of maintenance payments. Half of any maintenance a lone parent receives can be disregarded as means for the purposes of assessing his or her entitlement to one-parent family payment. The means test for this and certain other social assistance schemes also provides for a disregard of up to € 95.23 per week of maintenance payments in instances where applicants have rent or mortgage interest obligations on their family homes.The means test for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, through which rent supplements are provided, requires that all types of household income, including maintenance payments for the lone parent and his or her children, must be taken into account in determining a person's entitlements under the scheme.Given that up to €95.23 per week of maintenance payments has already been disregarded in the means test for primary scheme payment purposes to allow for housing costs, maintenance income up to this weekly amount is assessable in determining the appropriate level of additional rent supplement payable. However, depending on the particular family housing cost, up to €60 per week of maintenance in excess of this €95.23 amount can be disregarded for rent supplement means assessment purposes, to ensure that the family has the benefit of the extra maintenance income up to that level before it affects their rent supplement entitlements.Overall, the means test rules and disregards are designed to give an incentive to lone parents to obtain maintenance to improve their household income position, while ensuring that families in that situation have access to appropriate levels of rent or mortgage interest supplement to be able to continue to meet their accommodation needs.

The parameters established in section 21 for the use of apparatus generally are stated in the broadest possible manner in order to facilitate the deployment of any technology currently in use.Decisions relating to both the type of equipment and the technology to be deployed to support enforcement are matters for the determination of the Garda Commissioner. The equipment deployed by the gardaí presents evidence relating to the offence and records details of the registration plate of the vehicle concerned. In the case of speeding offences, the fixed charge notice issued following detection is served on the registered owner of the vehicle whose identity is established through inquiries made of the national vehicle file by the gardaí based on the registration plate details recorded by the apparatus used for detection purposes.

Some of these contacts would be through formal meetings, while others would be quite informal, through phone and casual contacts. Many meetings involve a wide range of officials from across Departments and public bodies and therefore, it is not possible to provide fully reliable information in relation to the departmental identity of each official.Furthermore, to identify, list and describe all the written communications between my Department and the Departments mentioned by the Deputy would be an onerous task that would significantly disrupt the work of my Department. I ask the Deputy to advise if he is concerned with a specific issue, or issues, involving my Department. If so, I will be happy to have the matter examined and a response supplied to him.

It was also raised by a number of organisations in their submissions to the review, including some of the local drugs task forces, the Probation and Welfare Service, the Health Research Board and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform commissioned a study on the utilisation of provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1999 for mandatory sentencing for certain drug offences. The Deputy should note that the study has since been published and is now available on that Department's website under the title "Research for the Department of Justice on the criteria applied by the Courts in sentencing under s. 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 (as amended)."

These groups, subject to satisfactory financial and progress reports, will receive €66,000 and €47,000 respectively in 2005.For the sake of completeness I also draw the Deputy's attention to the decisions of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board which operates under the aegis of my Department. Up to the end of April 2005, the board had approved funding in respect of 11 projects based in County Kildare totalling approximately €2.7 million. A breakdown of these approved projects is provided in the following table.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	420	The Deputy will be aware that decisions on the disbursement of unclaimed moneys from the dormant accounts fund are currently a matter for the dormant accounts fund disbursements board. This is an independent statutory body, under the aegis of my Department, established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The board engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf, which involves the disbursement of up to €60 million from the fund.The board has to date approved 481 projects for funding totalling approximately €55.2 million, from the initial allocation of €60 million. In accordance with the board's disbursement plan, the bulk of this funding is initially being targeted at those areas designated as most disadvantaged.The drawdown of funding is subject to the satisfactory completion of legal contracts between the individual groups and the board. As part of this process, groups are required to submit necessary documentation, such as agreed budgets, tax clearance certificates, evidence of insurance etc., to ADM before payments are actually made. I understand that the board and ADM anticipate that a figure in the region of €20 million will be drawn down during 2005 in respect of approved projects.The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 completed its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas last Tuesday, 17 May. The Bill provides for significant changes to the disbursement process and for the establishment of a reconstituted board. Arrangements regarding further allocations from the fund are subject to the provisions set out in the Bill.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	421	As the Deputy is aware, my Department has overall responsibility for coordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. It also has responsibility for the work of the local and regional drugs task forces as well as the young peoples facilities and services fund.In this context, it should be noted that to date approximately €95 million has been allocated or spent to implement in the region of 440 projects contained in the two rounds of plans of the LDTFs. A further €12.8 million has been allocated to over 50 projects under the premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects and approximately €85 million has been allocated or spent under the YPFSF to support in the region of 450 facility and services, primarily in LDTF areas.My Department has funding of €31.5 million available to it in 2005 to fund various drug programmes, which represents an increase of 18% on last year's budget. Through this funding, the ongoing work being done through the LDTFs and the YPFSF will be further developed and consolidated. In addition, a number of new initiatives are being supported. A new fund to tackle emerging needs in the LDTF areas is being put in place, a number of pilot projects to specifically tackle cocaine use are being rolled out in LDTF areas and funding to implement the action plans from the regional drugs task forces will be made available.In addition, I will announce a third round of capital funding under the YPFSF in the coming weeks and a further round of funding through the premises initiative will be announced during the summer. The Deputy should note that additional administrative supports for the LDTFs have also been approved and will be put in place over the coming months.

All of these areas are eligible for funding under the various measures in the programme.Some measures are demand led while, in other cases, the projects, by and large, are selected or recommended by the relevant Departments, State agencies, local authorities and Leader groups in consultation with my Department. In the case of the non-national roads measure, allocations are made to each local authority based on the county's percentage of the total CLÁR population. Also, some of the measures may have more relevance to particular CLÁR areas, for example, small sewerage schemes in the tax incentive areas of the upper Shannon, forestry access roads co-funded with Coillte and the local authority housing estate enhancement scheme.I am satisfied with the eligibility criteria that currently apply for assistance under the measures. However, I keep the operations of the measures under review to ensure their continued efficient and effective operation.The following table details the applications received to date in 2005 and their status. To date in 2005, 32 applications at a cost of nearly €2.8 million to CLÁR have been approved under the various measures. Of the further 506 applications on hand some 340 are projects submitted for funding by the local authorities from the €6 million non-national roads measure co-funded with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the €1 million similar measure co-funded with Coillte; 94 are proposals received from the local authorities for projects to be funded under the second CLÁR local authority housing estate enhancement scheme; and 23 are proposals received from primary schools under the third phase of the CLÁR primary schools outdoor play facilities enhancement scheme. These remaining applications are being examined as regards their eligibility for funding under the criteria applying to the measures concerned.I expect, very shortly, to announce the roads projects, the allocations under the second CLÁR local authority housing estate enhancement scheme and the third phase of the CLÁR primary schools outdoor play facilities enhancement scheme.CountyApplications ApprovedApplications on HandNo.€No.€Cavan0033396,707Clare1242,54547906,885Cork8342,45739598,450Donegal123,75076726,090Galway211,69137320,971Kerry377,13131491,643Leitrim180,00051357,813Limerick00115,000Longford17,7179119,034Louth001087,764Mayo81,891,117661,597,389Meath00115,000Monaghan00775,058Roscommon494,65840449,186Sligo213,44541232,911Tipperary North14,006650,408Tipperary South00115,000Waterford007150,833Westmeath00332,052Total322,788,5165066,638,192

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations made by the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal. The tribunal was established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. An application to the tribunal was first received from the person in question in 1996. The tribunal examined his application but did not recommend an allocation of quota on that occasion. The person's application was reviewed again in 1997 but no allocation was recommended. He applied to the tribunal in the 2004-05 quota year and his case was examined in March 2005. The tribunal recommended an allocation of quota effective from the 2004-05 milk quota year. Notification of this allocation has issued to the person and his co-operative. It is not the case that an allocation was incorrectly granted to another person.

The extension of funding to such farmers by means of a nationally funded scheme would require the approval of the European Commission by virtue of the EU provisions on state aids. I have previously stated that I intend to raise the cases of such farmers with the Commission in the light of the new circumstances arising from implementation of the nitrates directive.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	426	The person in question applied for consideration of force majeure exceptional circumstances on 6 February 2004. After a full examination by the single payment unit and the independent single payment appeals committee of the circumstances put forward, it was agreed that force majeure should be applied in this case. As a consequence, 2000 and 2001 will be excluded and only 2002 will be used to establish single payment entitlements for the person. This represents the best possible position available to the person named under the force majeure measures of the single farm payment scheme. A letter notifying the person named of this decision issued on 1 November 2004.

The applications were refused because the visa officer was not happy to approve the visa in light of the insufficiency of documentation relating to her husband in Ireland. The documents provided with the application did not indicate that the applicant's husband was a refugee. I have decided to forward the visa application to the refugee applications commissioner for examination under section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. When the investigation has been completed, which I understand should be in approximately two months, the commissioner will prepare and forward a report to the Department. On receipt of the report the application will be considered and a decision reached.

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the declaration in question has been located in the Department's citizenship section. The average processing time for such declarations is ten months. I have been informed by the staff of the citizenship division that they will ensure that the declaration is processed by reference to its date of original receipt and that the declarant has been issued with an acknowledgement letter containing a reference number. I will advise the Deputy and the person in question when the matter has been concluded.

A person employed under the work permit scheme can apply for their spouse and minor children to join them in the State after they have been in the State for a year and have been offered a contract for a further year. An initial assessment has been undertaken on the application and further information has been sought to progress the application. The husband in Ireland has been asked to submit birth certificates for the two children included in the visa application. The applicants can expect a decision within a short period of time when the information sought by the visa officer has been received.

Due to the complicated nature of this type of case, which requires examination of an applicant's entitlement to the property concerned, it is not possible to estimate a date of completion at this time.

I have been further informed that the member of the force in question is still available to participate in operations targeting drug-related crimes, as members from the detective branch crime unit and divisional drugs unit come under the direct control of the detective inspector for the division. The strength of the drug units is regularly reviewed and adjusted as required.

The programme continues to operate under the direct control and administration of the Garda Commissioner. It is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest to comment on specific details of the operation of the programme, including the numbers admitted to it. The cost of the programme was £41,608, or €52,831, in 1998; £86,373, or €109,671, in 1999; £149,704, or €190,085, in 2000; £361,955, or €459,588 in 2001; €829,898 in 2002; €1,183,482 in 2003; and €1,097,000 in 2004. The figure for 2004 relates to the allocated amount, as the actual expenditure figure is not yet available.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I understand that an application for capital grant assistance under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, EOCP, was submitted by the group in question to my Department in September 2004. The EOCP is a seven year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training.This application has been forwarded to Area Development Management limited, ADM, which is engaged by my Department to carry out detailed assessments on all EOCP grant applications on my behalf. As the Deputy may be aware, each application for funding undergoes a thorough assessment by ADM to ensure it meets the criteria for funding under the EOCP. I understand from inquiries I have made that ADM has been in dialogue with the group in question and is awaiting additional information from the group in order to advance the assessment process.When the assessment on the project in question is completed, the application will then be considered by the EOCP appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, before I make a final decision. The group will be informed of the outcome in due course.

I wish to confirm that funding is available from my Department for the purchase of the site and for the building of a premises to meet the needs of the project in question. Planning permission has been obtained in accordance with the plans and specifications.However, difficulties subsequently arose regarding the site boundaries which caused some considerable delay. I am now advised, by our legal representatives, that negotiations are nearing completion and the purchase of the site will be finalised shortly.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	437	The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, EOCP, is a seven year development programme and provides grant assistance towards the staffing costs of community based not for profit child care services which have a clear focus on disadvantage and which can demonstrate that they are supporting disadvantaged parents to access employment, education or training. The Deputy may be aware that the group in question has been approved staffing grant assistance to date totalling €490,000 and this covers the period to the end of August 2005.The Deputy may also be aware that I am now extending to the end of December 2007 the terms of the existing staffing grants to groups which continue to deliver a child care service in accordance with their pre-agreed targets. To benefit from such funding the groups must continue to pay particular attention to the support of disadvantaged families and the implementation of a fee structure tailored to the differing economic circumstances of the client group and which ensures that child care places subsidised by the EOCP are targeted towards those most in need.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 258 on 18 May 2005 regarding the permanent placement of staff temporarily assigned to other institutions as a result of the closure of Fort Mitchel place of detention.The position regarding permanent placement for the staff temporarily assigned to other institutions as a result of the closure of Fort Mitchel place of detention is currently being considered and it is expected that staff will shortly be notified of the prisons to which they are being permanently redeployed. I am not in a position at this point to indicate where the staff involved will be redeployed permanently as I must have regard to the wider staffing needs of the service. I have arranged, however, to elicit the preferred prison locations to which staff would wish to be assigned so that some consideration might be given to staff preferences. However, it has been made clear to all concerned that the needs of the service remain the primary issue of concern.With regard to the number of personnel involved, the position is that 93 staff were employed in Fort Mitchel institution. Of these, 58 were transferred temporarily to Cork, 30 were transferred temporarily to Limerick, two were transferred temporarily to Portlaoise, one was transferred to Arbour Hill and two retired.We are anxious to progress this matter as soon as possible in the interests of the individuals concerned and the overall needs of the Prison Service.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	439	As I have already stated, as a result of the rejection by the members of the Prisoner Officers Association of the proposal for organisational change in the Prison Service, I have instructed the director general of the Prison Service to immediately close the current facilities on Spike Island and at the Curragh.The Deputy will be aware that, following on the Government decision of November 2003, these facilities were mothballed. The majority of the staff from both institutions were transferred to other prisons on a temporary basis while a small number of staff remained to provide security and essential maintenance. These staff have now left the facilities in question and arrangements are now in train to effect the transfer of all of the staff in question to other prisons on a permanent basis to further reduce overtime expenditure.Officials from the Prison Service, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works and professional advisers, are developing proposals for the construction of a new prison complex on Spike Island to replace the existing Cork Prison. The new facility will address the overcrowding and inadequate facilities associated with Cork Prison and will, in addition, offer significant improvements in the areas of work training, education and medical services as well as providing predominantly single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation facilities.

Athy Garda station is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily and there is a mobile patrol which patrols the Athy sub-district, dealing with and responding to calls on a 24-hour basis seven days a week.Local Garda management is satisfied that the current opening hours of Athy Garda station are adequate to meet the current policing needs of the area and considers that an extension of the opening hours at Athy Garda station would only serve to confine to indoor administrative duties additional personnel who could be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.

I am also informed that further queries issued to the lodging solicitors on 17 May 2005 and that the application cannot proceed until these queries have been satisfactorily resolved. However, I can assure the Deputy that on receipt of a satisfactory reply, the matter will receive further attention in the Land Registry.

My predecessor as Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, considered their applications under the terms of Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 and 1986 and decided not to grant certificates of naturalisation in these instances. These decisions were communicated to the applicants in January, 2000.To date, I am informed by my officials that no subsequent applications have been made in respect of the named persons.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to Questions Nos. 726 and 781 on Wednesday, 26 January 2005 and Question No. 129 on Thursday, 14 April 2005. The person concerned is awaiting deportation following a comprehensive examination of her asylum claim and of her application to remain temporarily in the State. Representations made regarding her medical condition, while not deemed to constitute grounds for revoking the deportation order and granting leave to remain in the State, are nonetheless being taken into consideration by the Garda National Immigration Bureau in arranging the timing of her removal. I understand that the person concerned is due to give birth shortly and the bureau intends delaying her removal until a date after the birth, when both mother and child are fit to travel.I wish to address again the refoulement issues raised by the Deputy which I referred to in my replies to Questions Nos. 726 and 781 on 26 January 2005. I must consider 11 factors under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, together with section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement, when considering whether to deport a person.The safety of returning a person, or  refoulement as it is referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether to make a deportation order. This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The legislation requires that this consideration is given before the deportation decision is made. As I mentioned previously, my Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries. I am satisfied that the procedures followed in this case have fully taken the refoulement question into account.

I am informed that there are currently four gardaí employed full time on community policing duties in the Carlow-Kildare division.Garda resources assigned to the Carlow-Kildare division are continually monitored and reviewed, as part of overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.In relation to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in this regard in An Agreed Programme for Government. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Carlow-Kildare division will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. Clearly the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda Traffic Corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.

It is open to the school to contact the SENO directly regarding any special education needs that the pupil may have.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	453	In the light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, has developed a model of general teacher allocation for these disability categories. The general allocation, which also includes an allocation for pupils requiring learning support, is designed to put in place in primary schools a permanent resource to cater for the pupils in these categories.The advantages of the new system are that: it puts resources permanently in place in schools and thereby facilitates flexible and early intervention; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments for pupils in the categories involved; it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; greater flexibility is given to school management in the deployment of resources; and it makes the posts more attractive to fully qualified teachers.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department has now completed its review of the general allocation system of resource teaching support. The new model replaces that which was notified to schools in June 2004, which has been reviewed to take account of difficulties that it may have caused for smaller schools.Under the new model, which I published recently, a new ratio has been introduced for small schools, with a lower appointment ratio for the first full post for each type of small school.As differing pupil teacher ratios apply to boys' schools, mixed schools and girls' schools, for the purposes of the general allocation system, a small school, in the case of boys' schools, is a school with fewer than 135 pupils; in the case of a mixed schools it is a school with fewer than 145 pupils; and in the case of a girls' school it is a school with fewer than 195 pupils.Small boys' schools will now qualify for their first post at 100 pupils. Small mixed schools will qualify for their first post at 105 pupils. Small girls' schools will qualify for their first post at 150 pupils.All allocations up to the point for the first full post will be made on a pro rata basis. If a small boys’ school has just 50 pupils for example, it will get 0.5 of a post. The allocations between the point of the first full post and the cut-off enrolment point for small schools will stay at one post, that is, a small boys’ school with between 100 and 135 pupils will get one full post.These changes represent a substantial improvement for small schools on the original model.The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system.My Department is now devising school clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the general allocation system. These will be notified to schools shortly along with the details of each school's individual allocation. My Department is also finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. It is intended that this circular will issue before the end of the current school year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	454	As part of the primary school curriculum Irish is a compulsory subject. Exemption from the study of Irish may, however, be granted to primary pupils under certain circumstances outlined in Department circular 12/96. Under the terms of the circular delegated authority to grant exemptions from Irish, within the conditions laid down, has been vested in the individual school authority.There is no provision in the Department's circular for the automatic granting of exemptions to pupils in special classes. In addition, one of the conditions for the granting of an exemption to a pupil with a specific or general learning disability is that evidence of such a disability must be furnished by a qualified psychologist and the psychological report must be carried out not more than two years prior to the application for exemption.Irish is being omitted from the curriculum in the majority of special classes. Pupils attend special classes for a period of two years generally after which they return to mainstream where they should have access to Irish at their level.The criteria applied for the inclusion of a pupil in a special class and the criteria used for granting an exemption from Irish are not one and the same. It does not follow that a pupil who has been in a special class becomes automatically entitled to an exemption from Irish. An exemption from Irish will be determined in accordance with the relevant circular and in particular will be underpinned by the recommendation from an up-to-date psychological report.In the case of the two special classes in the school referred to by the Deputy it was noted that the psychological reports in respect of the pupils involved were well outside the two-year requirement. The school was accordingly requested to supply up-to-date psychological reports on the pupils involved. While the pupils in question were assessed as suitable for inclusion in special classes, a determination on a request for exemption from Irish cannot be processed in the absence of such reports.

This project has been sanctioned to commence architectural planning as part of the 2005 school building programme.With regard to the provision of extra pupil places for September 2005, my Department has not received any application for additional accommodation from the school authorities. This school has consistently enrolled two junior infant classes each year and my Department has not received any request or proposal from the school to review this matter.

The question of granting pupils in private schools exemptions from the study of Irish on the same basis as applies to pupils in recognised schools is being considered as part of this review.It is hoped that this review will be completed shortly. Any new arrangements arising from the review will be notified to schools by way of circular letter.

This schedule is outlined in primary circular 15/05 which issued to all primary schools recently. This is in line with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.According to my Department's records, the school referred to by the Deputy had an enrolment of 191 pupils on 30 September 2004. On the basis of this enrolment, the appointment of two additional mainstream class teachers is warranted for the 2005-06 school year. Therefore, the mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will be a principal plus seven mainstream class teachers.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	459	The home tuition scheme is primarily intended to provide compensatory instruction for pupils who have a medical ailment that is likely to cause major disruption of their attendance at school. In this context, my Department provides home tuition grants to pupils who cannot attend school at all or are absent for a significant proportion of the school year. Furthermore, while children are awaiting a suitable educational placement, my Department sanctions home tuition as an interim measure, if appropriate.In addition, my Department also sanctions home tuition grants for children with autism for whom a home-based applied behavioural analysis programme is considered appropriate or in cases where such children are awaiting an appropriate school placement.Home tuition is only intended as an interim measure and my Department considers that school-based education provision is the most appropriate intervention for pupils with special educational needs. Therefore, my Department has no plans to extend the scheme to cater for children with learning difficulties.The issue raised by the Deputy in relation to additional speech therapy facilities is a matter for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-19 00:00:00	Prelude	460	The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a principal and eight mainstream class teachers, based on the enrolment of 236 pupils on 30 September 2003.The enrolment in the school on 30 September 2004 was 235 pupils. Based on this enrolment, the mainstream staffing for the school year 2005-06 will remain at a principal and eight mainstream class teachers.To ensure openness and transparency in the system, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any staffing appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02 which is available on my Department's website. The appeals board will meet in June to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year.The closing date for appeals is 3 June 2005. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The application form is available from primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone or on my Department's website.I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.

Data for the 2003-04 school year is provided in the following table.However, the data may be out of date and may not reflect the current position in these schools.Significant progress has been made in the area of school staffing in recent years. Over 4,500 additional teachers, including more than 3,000 resource teachers, have been employed. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, tackle educational disadvantage and provide additional resources for children with special needs. The pupil-teacher ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. Average class size has been reduced from 26.6 in 1996-97 to 23.9 in 2003-04.Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break or Breaking the Cycle programmes, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class.School NameNumber of children aged nine or under in class size of more than 20Sacred Heart School, Huntstown630Scoil Ciarán, Hartstown509St Brigids, Beechpark478

The SENO examined the application and expressed the opinion that as the pupil's special educational needs appear to be within the high incidence disability category, his needs will be catered for under the general allocation model that I recently announced.The new model replaces that which was notified to schools in June 2004, which has been reviewed to take account of difficulties that it may have caused for smaller schools. I can confirm that 660 additional special needs teaching posts will be put in place in primary schools from next September to facilitate the implementation of the new general allocation system. The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system.My Department is now devising school clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the general allocation system. These will be notified to schools shortly along with the details of each school's individual allocation. This communication will clarify the position regarding the resource and learning support allocation available to the school which this child will be attending. It will be a matter for the school to make arrangements to provide teaching support to all pupils who qualify for such support from its general allocation, including the child referred to by the Deputy.My Department is also finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. It is intended that this circular will issue before the end of the current school year. My Department has been advised by the SENO that the pupil has been granted the services of a full-time special needs assistant. The school authorities have been notified accordingly and it is a matter for the school to make the necessary arrangements to fill this post.

The commission now has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. This includes the issue of marking schemes.I can, however, advise the Deputy that the creative writing question in the leaving certificate higher level Irish written examination may take a number of forms, including reporting, a literature type creative story, a debate or address, an article for a newspaper arguing a number of points, and the more traditional essay type.From a total of 600 marks available for the subject, 100 marks may be awarded for the creative writing question. The published marking scheme provides for 80 marks for the "quality of Irish displayed" not just grammar and the remaining 20 marks for the treatment of the subject matter.The marking of the leaving certificate Irish examination is undertaken by experienced examiners appointed by the State Examinations Commission, who recognise the difference between major mistakes in syntax and minor grammatical errors. In marking this question the examiners consider the depth and breadth of the Irish displayed, as well as mastery of idiom, structure and grammar. I am confident that this is the correct approach.

This was made possible by the Government's decision that pay savings arising from the reorganisation of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper of 2000, along with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment.Over €192 million was spent between 1997 and the end of 2004 on the capital investment programme for the upgrade of operational, training, accommodation and recreational — including sports — facilities for the Defence Forces. This year's Estimate for the Department of Defence includes a further €19.4 million for capital works.The upgrade of training facilities for the Defence Forces, including sports facilities, has been a priority in my Department for a number of years and significant progress has been made to date. Works completed include: the construction of a new swimming pool, gymnasium complex, and the provision of all-weather pitches in the Defence Forces training centre, Curragh Camp; the provision of a new all-weather pitch in Monaghan military barracks; and the provision of a new gymnasium in Collins Barracks, Cork.The construction of a new sports centre — including changing rooms, warm-up areas and showers — in the Defence Forces training centre, Curragh Camp, will go to tender soon and will be completed in early 2006. The provisional capital works programme for 2006 provides for the construction of a new gymnasium in McKee Barracks. It is expected that this project will commence in September 2006.

There is no general income threshold set by my Department for local authority housing. In making the assessment of housing need, local authorities have regard, inter alia, to the income and family circumstances of the applicant. Persons who are, in the opinion of the local authority, unable to provide housing from their own resources, are eligible for local authority housing.Housing loans are provided by local authorities for those who wish to build or purchase their own home but cannot access finance from private institutions. To ensure effective targeting of resources to support households most in need, income limits are applied. The income limits distinguish between single earning households and those with two incomes, but do not take account of family size. Importantly, in assessing applicants for loans, local authorities take account of the household's ability to finance the loan based on their net household income.Approved applicants for local authority housing, and tenants and tenant purchasers of local authority dwellings, and tenants, for more than one year, of capital loan and subsidy scheme housing surrendering their dwellings are exempt from the above income eligibility limit requirements for house purchase loans.

I understand that expenditure, to date, by Kildare County Council on this project has been mainly on a significant level of archaeological investigations. These have not been completed, to date.
