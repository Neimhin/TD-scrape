#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the up to date position on the provision of a sports hall for Palmerstown community school and the community of Palmerstown, which was to be provided in 2001 under the drugs task force initiative and, second, under the refurbishment and roof repairs required by the school.I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive. No. 1 is a motion that was referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights which has completed its deliberations thereon. It concerns the application of certain provisions of the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and its 2001 protocol to include Iceland and Norway. It is proposed to take this item without debate. No. 2 is a motion that was referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which has completed its deliberations on it. The motion concerns the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties imposed by member states. It is proposed to take this item without debate. No. 3 is a motion that was referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which has completed its deliberations on it. It concerns the confiscation of crime related proceeds, instrumentalities and property imposed by member states. It is proposed to take this matter without debate, notwithstanding the word "instrumentalities". No. 4 is the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill 2003 – all Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 2 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and Members may share time. No. 5 is the Independent Monitoring Commission Bill 2003 – all Stages, to be taken at 3 p.m. and to conclude not later than 8 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and Members may share time. There will be a sos from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	2	On the Order of Business proposed by the Deputy Leader of the House, we are in agreement that all Stages of Nos. 4 and 5 will be taken today. However, this should not be considered a precedent. We appreciate that these are important pieces of legislation that need to go through the House by the conclusion of business. However, the Fine Gael Party will move some amendments to both Bills and we will ask the Minister to look sympathetically at them.Will the Deputy Leader find out from the Government when it proposes to make a clear statement on its plans for decentralisation? We had the razzmatazz of the budget last week and the bleatings of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, as well as the outrageous suggestion that there is some kind of Dublin mindset in place. A clear statement is needed on when decentralisation will take place, who will be involved and what it will cost. It is clear from developments over the weekend that there is much muddled thinking by the Government on the matter. It would be useful if the House could obtain a full statement from the Government.The Deputy Leader might also ask the Government to make a statement concerning last night's "Prime Time" programme which made it clear that a small but unknown number of people in this country are trading across the Internet in some of the most depraved pictures of children. This is a very serious matter. There was a call this morning for a full inquiry throughout the country. Will the Deputy Leader speak to the relevant Minister and ask that a statement be made as soon as possible? It is important that all measures necessary to protect children are put in place and where it is clear that people in this country are abusing children and trading in their images in the most deprived form of Internet use, that must be stopped. An early statement by the Government would be useful.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I support what Senator Brian Hayes said and I compliment RTE on the responsible manner in which it addressed the issue. I found the programme ending so distasteful that I was unable to watch and turned away. Many parents in Ireland would be greatly reassured if the evidence uncovered by that excellent investigative documentary was given to the Garda for investigation. All Members of the House will probably agree with that because it is the way forward not in terms of sensationalism, but of using the information gathered.We have had a number of discussions in the House recently on European affairs and we have had visits by Members of the European Parliament. It would be worthwhile to have discussed and explained in the House a very crucial point now being addressed in Europe by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. The Government has found the precise balance between our responsibilities to other members of the European Union and the guarantees of our own sovereignty in deciding not to rule out supporting a fellow member state of the EU, but to make the decision in the Houses at our discretion afterwards and not as part of any requirement or condition. This is an important issue and the Government is to be complimented on finding the perfect balance in this matter. It is also one which meets the views of all sides, including those of Fine Gael, which went further in its recent Private Members' debate.Towards the end of a session it is appropriate to mention the importance of drawing good people into politics. We have discussed this matter many times. Maurice Manning, Fintan Coogan, Mick Lanigan, Liam Cosgrave, Tom Fitzgerald, Máirín Quill, Dick Spring, Austin Currie, Nora Owen and many others have given their lives to politics. We must commend Nora Owen, for example, who served in the Oireachtas from 1981 until 2002, whatever our view of her politics. It is disgraceful that not one of the people I have named would be entitled to draw a pension if the Government's budget proposals were currently in effect. We will not attract people into politics if we do this. If it is wrong for the people I mentioned, it will be wrong for future Members. This matter should be discussed in this House. Whatever our criticism of the Minister for Finance he has always supported attracting the best people into politics. This is a real problem which is being spun by the Department of Finance. I ask for a discussion on that aspect of the budget. It is in the interest of politics and in all our interests that Oireachtas pension arrangements are family friendly and appropriate.

To say that it represents a Dublin mindset is simply not fair.I have raised the issue of our Kyoto Protocol responsibilities on previous occasions. It is unclear whether the Russian Federation intends to ratify the protocol. Indications are that it does not. However, it is clear that the Government is not serious about the Irish obligations under the protocol. The Minister for Finance announced in his 2003 budget that a carbon energy tax would be introduced the following year. Remarkably, he made no mention of it in last week's Budget Statement. We must look again at our responsibilities under the protocol. They are serious responsibilities which could, if they are not met, bring serious fines to bear on Ireland and these could have consequences in themselves. I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate in the new year on that issue.Will the Deputy Leader intervene with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism on an issue which we have discussed a number of times in recent weeks and which I know is close to the Deputy Leader's heart? There have been developments in the last week which make the issue even more urgent. The chief executive of the Football Association of Ireland has indicated that we may have to play soccer internationals abroad, interesting developments have been initiated in the Gaelic Athletic Association in Wicklow relating to Croke Park and a meeting will take place tomorrow between the Irish Rugby Football Union and the Minister. All of these developments come together nicely and bring to bear on us the urgency for the Government to give a clear line on an issue which is of great concern.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	12	What is the issue, Senator? Are you speaking about the need for a national stadium?
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has been telling us for some months that a decision is imminent. The developments to which I have alluded bring an urgency to the issue. We need a statement from the Minister and he should take the opportunity to make one in this House in the near future. We have discussed this issue on several occasions in recent weeks and the time is now opportune to bring the matter further.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I warmly welcome the decision of the Government to decentralise Departments. It is important that it be known that there are other counties besides Dublin. Some Opposition politicians, including a former Leader, are not making much sense on this issue. There are daily complaints about the gridlock in this city but when something is done about it, the Government is accused of being wrong.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Please put a question to the Deputy Leader.

I always have a question. I am tired listening to the politics of the pavement. I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on mobile phone licensing. It has been brought to my attention that a mobile phone was bought from a certain company and the customer was informed when buying it that it could be upgraded after one year. However, a year and eight months after it was purchased, the customer was informed that the rule had been changed to two years. That is sharp practice by any standards and the phone company in question is O2.

There can be no hiding place for people who are engaged in such activities. I advise anybody with the slightest suspicion about persons who may be indulging in this type of heinous practice not to be behind the door in picking up the telephone and informing those responsible for enforcement. We must ensure those people are put in prison where they belong and that they are left there.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House following the allocation in the budget and the Estimates of capital funding for the building and repair of both primary and secondary schools. The Minister should come to the House as soon as possible to allay the fears and the disappointment of many boards of management, parents, teachers and students and to indicate once and for all, as a matter of urgency, which schools will be allocated funding in the coming year. The mystery has been going on for too long and the lobbying of Members continues with regard to the promises made. It is essential that the Minister comes to the House and clearly indicates what schools will be grant aided for urgent and necessary repairs. I suggest that he make the information available on the Department's website.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I join with my colleagues in welcoming the programme researched and broadcast by RTE last night. Its revelations were shocking to most Members of this House and indeed to any right-minded person. I ask the Deputy Leader to consider a debate on the subject. There are implications for Departments other than the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in particular for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The Garda Síochána is doing an excellent job in trying to track down people in what is a very difficult environment. The service provision companies that operate and host these Internet sites should be examined. They are providing a service to these people and continue to abuse their dominant position. I would welcome a debate involving the participation of both Departments.I ask for a debate on decentralisation. It is important to move away from some of the rhetoric heard in the past week and start to listen to the views of people on the other side who have condemned the Government proposals. A debate would allow the House to hear the views of the Opposition parties at both national and local level.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	21	That is a good one coming from the Government side—

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I support my colleagues in their request for a debate on the issue of child pornography on the Internet. It is a natural human instinct to protect children but there has been a significant change. Children used as child soldiers are being killed on a wide scale throughout the world and children are also being exploited for the purposes of pornography. There has been a sexualisation of children by the pop and fashion industries and there is much confusion in this area. Before we try to organise a witch hunt against people, we should examine the causes of such activity which seems to be very widespread. People who are otherwise very respectable seem to be caught up in an Internet generation. I do not know what is going on and the House should examine the matter not by calling for the brutalisation of these people, but by trying to understand a phenomenon that is taking place all over the world.I also seek a debate on the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes company, which was the subject of an interesting television programme recently. It was the source of much of the corruption that has been going on in this country. A well known commentator dismissed it all on RTE's "The Sunday Show" programme saying, "Ah well, sure it's all over now and they got the hospitals, didn't they?" Some 90% of the money raised by the sweepstakes went into the pockets of profiteers who did not pay tax on it, while the hospitals got 10% and had to pay tax. It is disgraceful that the women who were exploited in the sweepstakes head office were turfed out onto the side of the road without a pension. If we do not remember these matters and examine them, we will never reach the conclusion of this type of corruption in public life.We should recognise the wonderful work that is being done in South Africa by an Irish businessman, Mr. Niall Mellon. He has put €1 million from his own pocket into building houses in townships. He had a luxurious house there and was confronted by the spectacle of poverty and squalor so he did something about it. Many decent Irish workmen assisted him in the project. We are often critical of the building trade but I salute them for going out there to work for nothing, sweating in the hot sun to build houses for poor people. It was heartening to hear what the people who received those houses had to say. When the project was first launched there were begrudgers here who asked why Mr. Mellon did not do it for his own people because charity begins at home. However, what he did was wonderful for the image of Ireland abroad. The Department of Foreign Affairs should provide some degree of funding to assist such projects.

It is important that we have a debate on that issue.On another issue, I would like the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the bonuses chiefs of health boards are giving themselves. I heard amounts of up to €1,300 have been given to some chiefs recently at a time when hospital beds and wards are being closed, when the Government has failed to roll out many services in the area of health, and when carer's allowance is being cut back—

One aspect that struck me was the sentencing. One individual who had downloaded thousands of images got a prison sentence of two and a half years.

That is an aspect on we should have a debate.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I hope I am not having a strange effect on the House. Perhaps the absence of the Leader has caused this mayhem. I thank the leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, for agreeing to take all stages of the two Bills before the House today. It is necessary to dispose of legislation before Christmas and I thank the Senator for facilitating this.Senators Brian Hayes, McDowell, Glynn, Dooley, Norris, Leyden, Bannon and Wilson raised decentralisation and several of them, including Senator Leyden, called for a debate on the issue. There will be an opportunity to debate this and other issues when the Finance Bill comes before the House.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	119	There will be no money for decentralisation.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	120	It surprises me that a former finance spokesperson of the Labour Party did not read the relevant document, which states that €20 million will be allocated in January for this purpose.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	121	The decentralisation proposals are indicative of muddled thinking.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Allow the Deputy Leader to reply without interruption, please.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	123	There is no muddled thinking on this matter by any member of the Government. Attending the opening of a section of motorway in County Kildare which cost €160 million, the Minister for Finance made the point that this is a small country. Irrespective of whether one has a Dublin mindset, this city is grinding to a halt. It will be beneficial to the country and the capital that 10,300 jobs have been allocated to various parts of the country. I particularly welcome the decision, for which I have argued for many years, to move the Defence Forces to their natural home, namely, the Curragh, and to locate the Department of Defence in Newbridge.With regard to last night's "Prime Time" and the availability of certain images on the Internet, a matter raised by Senators O'Toole, Glynn, Dooley, Scanlon and Brian Hayes, while I did not see the programme, I agree this is a serious issue. I heard the comments of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children on the issue this morning. It is reprehensible that these images should be downloaded but even worse that there should be a trade in them through the Internet. This demonstrates that the issue must be dealt with severely and that any deficiencies in legislation governing the Internet will need to be examined, which I am sure will occur.Senator O'Toole raised the issues of the constitutional treaty and mutual defence. The Minister for Foreign Affairs gave a good exposition on this matter to the Committee on European Affairs last week and subsequently to a conference on the Presidency held in Dublin Castle. I fully agree with his position that there should be no question of obligation on these matters and that while it is acceptable for countries to seek mutual defence in the European Union, decisions on our participation should be voluntary. It would, however, be wrong if we did not come to the assistance of another member state if it was attacked or required assistance. This is a personal view, which does not necessarily reflect that of the Government.On the contribution of people in politics and the pension age, I heard Senator O'Toole forcefully express his views on this matter during last week's debate on the budget and I note his comments. The matter could be debated and could come within the ambit of the Finance Bill.Senator McDowell mentioned the Dublin mindset, with which I have dealt. Perhaps there is a culchie mindset, which I may have. However, there are major benefits to be gained.I hope I did not misunderstand the comments on the Kyoto Protocol. There is no doubt that we have obligations under it. I noted the Senator's comments on the carbon tax. It is obvious that neither the Russian Federation nor the United States is prepared to take their responsibilities seriously. The Leader of the House indicated last week that this was something we could debate in the new year, which is something I support.Regarding the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism attending the House to discuss improvements to the Lansdowne Road stadium, I understand the Irish Rugby Football Union is to make a proposal within the next few days or week, if it has not done so already, on an upgrade of the stadium which would cost in excess of €100 million. There are obviously planning issues in connection with that. I welcome the motion that is going before the GAA congress, though I do not want to interfere in the affairs of the association.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Or the IRFU.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I said I did not want to interfere in the affairs of the Gaelic Athletic Association. However, I attended the international rules match in Melbourne and wondered why it took place in the Melbourne Cricket Club.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Hear, hear.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Senator Glynn mentioned mobile phones and the possibility of having a debate on that issue, which is something we should try to do. He also mentioned the matter of images on the Internet.Senator Burke raised the matter of education. An extra €30 million was allocated in the budget for the purposes of capital funding. I heard the Minister for Education and Science explicitly state on a trip to County Kildare during the week that there should be no question of the politicisation of decisions, that the decisions should be made on their merits alone. He is determined to do that, and I commend him for it.Senator Dooley raised the "Prime Time" programme and decentralisation, with which I have dealt. Senator Norris also spoke about it. I accept Senator Norris's remarks on the difficulties that some of these people have, but I still find it extremely difficult to understand how anybody could indulge in that sort of activity.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Why?
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	129	The programme on the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes was another very good example of good journalism by RTE. Obviously, what happened to the employees there at the time the business closed was not acceptable. I fully agree with what the Senator said about Niall Mellon. One of the things about it that struck me was that it was the sports reporter on "Morning Ireland"—
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Des Cahill.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Yes, it was Des Cahill who was the one who could bring good news to us, instead of the constant continuous whinge that we have on that programme every morning. It was something to celebrate and a marvellous story.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	132	It was very good.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	133	In answer to Senator Leyden, we should debate decentralisation. I was not sure what Senator Bannon was saying, not because he was not making sense, but because he was being interrupted so often. He has a point about better local government, which is something the House should examine. I noted what he said about the payments to health board executives.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	134	He is not even a member of a health board.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Senator Scanlon also raised the "Prime Time" programme.I do not have anything to say about the Adjournment debate which was raised by Senator Feighan as it is a matter for the Cathaoirleach, but it is a long-standing tradition of the House that people who are not here to defend themselves are not attacked in the way the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, was attacked.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	140	It is not common to talk about people who are not here to defend themselves.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	144	Senator Wilson made a point about the Minister for Finance coming here to talk about decentralisation. I am sure the Minister for Finance will be here to discuss the budget.Several calls have been made for a debate on Northern Ireland in recent weeks. The Taoiseach intends to come to the House early in the next session after Christmas to have a full debate on Northern Ireland.

While it is inappropriate to discuss a Member of the House who is absent and who therefore cannot defend themselves, it is completely in order and within convention to criticise a Minister. Perhaps some people are taking exception to the words used, but it would be completely wrong if Members on either side of the House could not criticise a Minister. Senator Feighan did not break the rules.

It is a short Bill of two operative sections and is concerned with mechanisms to ensure the better conduct of tribunals. While these mechanisms will be of general application, the Bill has been prompted by concerns which became apparent following the resignation in June 2003 of Mr. Justice Flood as chairperson and as a member of the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, also known as the Flood tribunal.At issue is the determination of applications by parties for costs arising out of the findings of a tribunal. More specifically, it deals with the determination of costs concerned with certain modules dealt with in the second interim report of the Flood tribunal, published in September 2002. The modules were dealt with at a time when Mr. Justice Flood was the sole member of the tribunal and that report was accordingly prepared by him. The determination of costs had not been made at the time of Mr. Justice Flood's resignation. The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide certainty to the current chairperson of the tribunal, Judge Mahon, in dealing with matters relating to the award of costs.To avoid any ambiguity, and because of an abundance of caution, it is proposed to insert a new subsection in section 6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry Act 1979, to the effect that the sole member of a tribunal, or the chairperson if there is more than one member, may make an order for any costs that were incurred before his or her appointment which have not already been determined. In exercising this power, the sole member or chairperson shall have regard to any report of the tribunal dealing with its proceedings in the period before his or her appointment. These new provisions will apply to tribunals appointed and costs incurred before or after the passing of this Bill.It is also proposed to avail of this opportunity to provide for an express power for a tribunal, of its own volition, to seek the direction of the High Court on the performance of the functions of the tribunal, including in the matter of costs. This provision mirrors similar provisions for inspectors appointed under the Companies Act 1990. A somewhat similar provision is also contained in section 25 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000. It is also proposed in the Bill to provide an express statutory power, vested in the chairperson, to direct other members of the tribunal to sit as separate divisions and to determine the conditions that will apply, including the preparation of reports.Section 1 of the Bill is a standard interpretation provision. Section 2 deals with the amendment of section 6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1979, as amended by the similarly titled 1997 Act, by the insertion of a new subsection (1A) after subsection (1), providing that the sole member, or chairperson where there is more than one member, of a tribunal may make an order under subsection (1) for any costs that were incurred before his or her appointment and have not already been determined in accordance with that subsection. The sole member or chairperson shall, for that purpose, have regard to any report of the tribunal relating to its proceedings in the period before his or her appointment.Subsection (2) provides that the amendment effected by subsection (1) of this section shall apply to tribunals appointed and costs incurred before or after the passing of the Bill.Section 3 deals with the amendment of the 1997 Act. The section is in two parts and amends section 4 of the 1997 Act by inserting two additional sections, 4A and 4B. New section 4A concerns directions and orders of the High Court. Thus, subsection 4A(1) provides for the tribunal, or the chairperson if the tribunal has more than one member, whenever they consider it appropriate to do so, to apply to the High Court for directions relating to the performance of the functions of the tribunal or the chairperson, under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2003, including their functions relating to costs.Subsection 4A(2) provides that the High Court may give such directions and make such orders as appropriate. Subsections 4A(3)(a) to (c) provide that the High Court may hear an application otherwise than in public if satisfied that it is appropriate to do so because of the subject matter in relation to which the direction is sought, the risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings or any other matter relevant to the nature of the evidence to be given at the hearing of the application. Subsection 4A(4) provides for the High Court to give such priority as it reasonably can to the disposal of the proceedings in the court under this Act. Subsection 4A(5) provides for the Superior Court Rules Committee to make rules to facilitate giving effect to subsection (4).New section 4B concerns divisions of tribunals. Thus, subsection 4B(1) provides that a tribunal consisting of more than one member may, whenever the chairperson so determines, act in divisions each of which consists of such members of the tribunal as the chairperson may determine. Subsection 4B(2) provides that the chairperson may designate one member of a division to be chairperson, determine the functions to be performed by the division, determine the matters to be dealt with by the division and require the division to prepare a report.Subsection 4B(3) provides that a division of a tribunal shall provide any report as required to the chairperson. Such report is considered to have been made by the tribunal. Subsection 4B(4) provides that a division of a tribunal and the chairperson of the division have all of the powers of the tribunal and the chairperson of the tribunal in the performance of their functions. Subsection 4B(5) provides for a situation where the chairperson of a division is for any reason unable to continue to act as such.Section 4 is a standard provision dealing with the Short Title and collective citation. The provisions of the Bill do not of themselves have financial implications for the Exchequer. However – I wish to be careful what I say here – should it be the case that ultimately the determination of costs results in the non-award to persons who have appeared at a tribunal, then, obviously, there could be a considerable saving in that regard. However, I emphasise that the issue of determination of costs is a matter for the chairperson of a tribunal. The immediate effect of the enactment of the Bill will be to dispel any possible legal uncertainty as to the authority of Judge Mahon, as the current chairperson of the Tribunal to Inquire into certain Planning Matters and Payments, to make a determination of costs. There is, it would be fair to say, fairly widespread dissatisfaction on all sides, including the Government, with regard to the costs of tribunals. These have become quite significant. I am sure many Senators wish the Government was bringing forward a more comprehensive Bill on legal costs of tribunals. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform agrees that changes are needed in the organisation and administration of tribunals in an effort to reduce the levels of legal costs associated with tribunals. To that end, I mention two initiatives currently underway.Senators will be aware that the Government published on 2 July 2003 the Commissions of Investigation Bill, which it is hoped can provide for an alternative, more timely and cost-effective mechanism for investigations into matters giving rise to significant public concern. This would not be a single or permanent body but it is planned that commissions may be established as required and that more than one might sit at any one time. Commissions of investigation will not replace or alter in any way the work of the tribunals of inquiry currently under way or any other inquiry or investigation mechanism already available. It is envisaged that they will, instead, provide a new and alternative mechanism. In certain instances, this will be a precursor to a tribunal of inquiry. Commissions will be required to establish the factual position. A commission may be followed by a tribunal where it is unable to establish clear facts. In those situations, the evidence collected by a commission will be available to the tribunal, thereby reducing the time and cost associated with tribunals. In reducing the time and cost involved, while ensuring fair procedures and respect for confidentiality, the proposed commissions of investigation will add significantly to the mechanisms and instruments available for public investigations.I also direct the attention of Senators to the work of the Law Reform Commission, which has been examining all issues concerning tribunals. The commission issued a lengthy consultation paper in March 2003, which traced the history of public inquiries in general, dealt with the legal and constitutional issues which have arisen, the type of proceedings involved and the issue of costs. The consultation report made a number of recommendations on the totality of issues involved with tribunals. It is expected that the final report of the commission should be available in mid-2004 and it will surely provide an important input into how public inquiries might be conducted in the future.However, let me reiterate that the Bill we are considering today, though critical, is one primarily concerned with the issue of determination of costs, with particular reference to an existing tribunal. In that regard, Judge Mahon has indicated to the Government that he is anxious to deal with the issue of determination of costs arising from those modules dealt with in the second interim report of the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments.The timescale for consideration of this Bill in both Houses is regrettably short as it is the intention of the Government that the Bill be enacted before the Christmas recessAccordingly, I commend the Bill to the Seanad.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This Bill, which is overdue, is welcome. When Mr. Justice Flood resigned in June 2003, my party leader asked the Taoiseach to bring forward legislation to deal with his resignation and the subsequent fallout. While six months is not too long to wait, this is an urgent matter and I am glad it is being dealt with now.I remind the House of the circumstances which give rise to the need for some aspects of the Bill. There was a considerable degree of delay in the Government's handling of Flood. In June 2001, Mr. Justice Flood requested extra judges. That request was only acceded to in March 2002. On 16 June 2003, Mr. Justice Flood announced his decision to step down as chairman but to remain on as an ordinary member, thus enabling him to determine the question of costs. After a series of meetings and correspondence between Flood and the Government, Mr. Justice Flood announced his decision to resign completely on 29 June 2003. It appears that up to a certain point in time Mr. Justice Flood was willing to remain on and determine the issue of costs but following a meeting with the Attorney General he announced his decision to resign fully.Like the subsequent resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy, the Government's handing of the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood gives rise to many questions. Both resignations were remarkable and surprising. However, the same Government's mishandling gave rise to both resignations. The Government's contempt for the inquiry headed by Ms Justice Laffoy is palpable from the correspondence from her to the Government.This Government consistently tried to discredit the tribunal mainly by disseminating the notion that its work would last a further 15 years. This assertion is without foundation and certainly does not originate from Mr. Justice Feargus Flood. As recently as last month, the Taoiseach told the Dáil the work of the Flood tribunal would run for 30 years.The amendment effected by section 2 marks a significant departure from established practice, whereby the judge who determines the substantive matter determines also the question of costs. If put into practice, section 2 will require Judge Mahon to adjudicate on the costs of the past five years' work of the tribunal. The last thing we want is a further delay in the work of the tribunal but legislation of this nature represents an opportunity to disrupt it. I will not say anything to provide encouragement to those who will challenge the legislation, but a well drafted provision would deter potential challenges.Section 2 of the Bill will be the most scrutinised legislative provision of recent times and there is a real danger of "over-drafting" a provision of such importance. Will the Minister of State confirm that the Attorney General participated in the drafting of the provision? Will he assure the House that he is certain of its strength? Section 2 will see legal bills of millions of euro being imposed on people and it is inevitable that the legislation will be challenged.Section 3 of the Bill will attract much less attention but it is of great importance to the work and efficiency of the Mahon and other tribunals. By inserting section 4A, section 3 will allow the tribunal to seek directions from the High Court and specific reference is made to assistance with the termination of costs. Despite my reservations, I welcome the legislation and hope it will be dealt with speedily.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He referred to a point with which we all agree, that we would have welcomed even more comprehensive legislation on the legal costs of tribunals.It is unfortunate that the general Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act must be amended. It should be acknowledged that while Mr. Justice Flood was chairman of the tribunal, and he should be commended for his work, the Government was most facilitating in answering the requests he made, sometimes overly so. The judge's pension was dealt with at a very early stage but Mr. Justice Flood found himself making representations on the remuneration of counsel attending the tribunal, a matter that was not appropriate for the chairman of a tribunal.Costs are another serious concern. When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in the House previously, I said that if I had known in 1998 when we established the tribunals what I know today, I would have argued that we should look at alternative mechanisms that would be as effective but more cost effective. It behoves us to look in that direction and the Minister of State referred to other legislation that will come before the Houses to address the substantive issues involved. That is overdue and I would like it implemented as a matter of urgency.The matters of public concern which are the subject of the many tribunals currently functioning have given rise to serious scandals in the operation of public office and public service. The importance of the work cannot be underestimated but, in many ways, the scandals are being underlined by the exorbitant fees that are being paid. Taking this matter up with some people in the legal profession recently, I was told that the major culprit in escalating fees is the State because it engages so many of the legal profession and makes concessions to them that are wholly unjustified. The Minister should note that it is an area of public concern that we cannot manage our affairs in a way that is much more in tune with the cost effectiveness that should be hallmark of any Administration.It is important that the provisions in the legislation before us are introduced. It is sensible to allow for the division of the tribunal so the chairman can designate specific responsibilities and tasks to other members of the tribunal. This should lead to the acceleration of the process and will inject a greater degree of pace into the operations of the tribunals. The length of sittings should also be examined.There is a need, with the multiplicity of tribunals, with some of them impacting on the body politic, for broad consensus among parties for any changes. It might be useful to refer the operation of current tribunals to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. It could look at the tribunals to see how they could be re-focused at this stage. Senator Terry mentioned the Laffoy tribunal and it would be wholly unacceptable that the victims of sexual abuse would have to wait ten or 12 years for the findings of the tribunal to be known. There is an adage in the legal profession that justice delayed is justice denied. We should ensure that deliberations are carried out in a way which gives rise to prompt findings and recommendations that can be then implemented to avoid similar situations arising. I hope that the provision that allows tribunals to divide will be embraced by them in a way that will improve their operation and effectiveness.The provision allowing the tribunal to make applications to the High Court of its own volition to determine aspects of its function and costs is also sensible. In areas where there is any doubt, the application to the High Court should bring clarity and perhaps avoid the challenges which might arise.The main purpose of the Bill is contained in section 2. As a result of the previous chairman departing the scene, there must be legislation to allow the current chairman of the tribunal to determine costs based on findings to which he was not party previously.It is interesting that at present we are holding several hearings on the criminal justice system during which we have heard presentations from many sides of the argument on balancing the scales of justice. The Human Rights Commission enshrines the right to avoid self-incrimination which although not the same as the right to silence is often interpreted as such. The legislation does not permit a judge to draw any inference from a witness's decision to remain silent in a criminal trial except in the case of a terrorist offence. A person appearing before a tribunal does not enjoy that privilege. Several of those who have appeared before tribunals of inquiry have not only been charged but found guilty as a result of interim reports. Given the powers and public nature of tribunals where witnesses do not always have the mechanisms to bring forward a defence, it seems there is a gap between many of the findings in Mr. Justice Flood's interim report and its conclusion. While the evidential part of the report was based on logic there did not seem to be a definite link between the two parts. We need to ensure when we embark on these processes that there are safeguards to protect the good name of people who may be only marginally involved in some areas of the investigation.I have consistently acknowledged the work of tribunals as essential because it is important that in all aspects of the administration of the State people adhere to the highest standards. In general, we have a good track record in this respect but I was struck by the anomaly between the criminal justice system and the tribunals where the same protection is not given to the witnesses. Although the findings of the tribunal cannot be used against someone, the information made available makes it easier to conduct a subsequent criminal investigation.The costs in these instances can be determined by the new chairman of the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments for findings made by the tribunal prior or subsequent to the enactment of the Bill. I can understand the reason for that provision in the present circumstances but it involves retrospective legislation which is often neither welcomed nor countenanced by the Oireachtas, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the court authorities.In conclusion, I welcome the Bill and its provisions. It is necessary to deal with future tribunals of inquiry or to create mechanisms which may obviate the need for tribunals but can get to the truth more quickly, effectively and at a lower cost to the taxpayer. That is the ideal but there is also a serious need to look at the operation of current tribunals. It will be a travesty if in five or ten years time the Oireachtas is addressing some of these tribunals still sitting at great cost to the State when their findings will probably be irrelevant. I hope that can be tackled on an all-party basis in a sensible way, if that is not too optimistic.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I welcome this Billand my Labour Party colleagues and I will facilitate its quick passage. We are not proposing amendments. It is very important that the Government and the Oireachtas give wholehearted support to the work of the tribunals and in particular to the tribunal which this legislation affects. Hopefully, the legislation will help in that work. It is important too that the Government ensures the tribunals are resourced in any way necessary to carry out their work properly and in a timely way. Senator Terry mentioned that hitherto the Government has not always facilitated this tribunal and others as it should, for example, by delaying its response to Mr. Justice Flood's request for judges. I hope this Bill reflects a new approach on the part of the Government to the work of the tribunals.The legislation will be important and assist the tribunal's work and I hope we do not have to wait 20 or 30 years for the tribunal to complete that work. Tribunals are established to find out what happened on a particular issue and make recommendations for change. The longer it takes for this to happen, the less valuable is the work. The Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments has done much valuable work and we have already learned a great deal from its interim report. The process has changed politics too and the many recent changes and reforms in that arena are probably due to the revelations that have both given rise to the tribunals and been produced by them. My party and others introduced some of these reforms. Public funding of election campaigns, disclosure requirements, and the Freedom of Information Act are recent innovations.Although I have been active in politics for a long time I was elected in 1999 and am perhaps more aware of the boundaries than people who entered politics 20 or 30 years ago when there was a large grey area. Some people were corrupt and others were caught in the middle. At times I am excessively conscientious about this. For example, two Christmases ago I returned some bottles of wine to a developer and then wondered whether I was being overly zealous. It was probably an insult to the person concerned.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	158	That depends on the year.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	159	The public perception is that there is still corruption in politics and the tribunals have an important role in establishing what went wrong and what needs to be done to ensure politics is above board and to restore public faith. The public image of politics has been damaged especially by the revelations from the tribunals and it will be damaged further if the tribunals do not complete their work. If politicians support the planning tribunal and act on its recommendations, and if it is not stopped but is facilitated to work in a timely way, that will help to protect politicians and democracy. It will also help people to realise that politics is not about strokes or making decisions for the wrong reasons but aims to implement policies for the common good and for different political parties to articulate their ideas.I live in Lucan and decisions concerning that area are being examined by the tribunal. I love Lucan and have lived there most of my life. I still think it is a relatively nice place to live, but it was badly planned, which may be due partly to decisions taken for the wrong decisions. It is important to find out what was behind some of the decisions that have made Lucan the way it is today. Many of those decisions had a knock-on effect throughout Dublin. The areas in Lucan affected by such decisions have suffered a knock-on effect in terms of traffic and so on, as have other areas of Dublin. Many other parts of Dublin are the subject of investigation by the tribunal.There have been changes in practice, although it is difficult to persuade people that procedures in planning have changed. Planning is subject to much more scrutiny by members of the public than it was in the past. For example, Adamstown has received much attention from the media. That scheme was well planned by the local county council, a great degree of consultation was engaged in and it took a long time to plan it. The manner in which it was planned is probably the way the rest of Lucan should be planned. It was difficult as a local politician and for other local politicians who backed the Adamstown planning scheme to persuade people in Lucan that this was the case. People have observed the way planning happened in the past and they have heard the proceedings of the tribunals. In terms of proper planning, there is the notion that they will believe it when they see it.It is important that the Commissions of Investigation Bill, to which the Minister of State referred, is brought in speedily. Will he indicate when it is hoped to bring that legislation before the House? Other mechanisms also need to be examined, a point Senator Walsh mentioned.The Labour Party proposed that in addition to such a commission there should be a parliamentary investigation system with a parliamentary investigator. The terms of reference of the proposed commission would be set by the Government. The Labour Party believes there should also be a way for the Parliament to determine investigations that can take place, which would have the benefit of being clear-cut and less costly in terms of the way in which the work of such inquiries could be set out in advance. Senator Walsh was correct when he pointed out that the new legislation will be helpful for new investigations. However, we need to continuously monitor the work of the current tribunals and, most importantly, ensure that we do not take a decision to abandon them. Irrespective of what we do, it is important that the work of the tribunals is carried out and completed in a timely way. For all the reasons I have outlined, it is important we get to the bottom of any bad planning decisions that were made for reasons that were not for the common good and that we make sure the necessary reforms are in place to prevent such things happening in the future.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is important and essential legislation. I am pleased its passage is being facilitated through this House and I hope it will be facilitated through the other House so that it will quickly become law because it is required. It will remove the uncertainty regarding the issue of costs, which arose when Mr. Justice Flood stepped down from the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments and for that reason it is to be welcomed. However, it raises broader issues which have been well debated in the media, within these Houses and elsewhere.It is unquestionably correct to say that there has been widespread cynicism and dissatisfaction concerning the costs of tribunals, the length of time they take to complete their work and that it seems to be the case that people can repeatedly go to the High Court to try to frustrate the intentions of the Oireachtas in that regard. It is important to state that the tribunals were established by the Oireachtas. I take Senator Tuffy's point in that regard. It is important that the imprimatur of the Oireachtas is dominant in the setting of the terms of reference of the tribunals and the way in which they are constructed. There is a definite desire by some people to frustrate them, which is understandable, and perhaps it is one of the few deficiencies of the fact that we have a written Constitution.It was notable in the recent past in the case of a major public parliamentary inquiry in Britain into the suicide of a public servant that it seemed to be possible to dispose of it in a short period. Admittedly, it was about a specific incident and the circumstances surrounding it, but there were broader issues concerning defence, the conduct of the Iraqi war and why the United Kingdom went to war in the first place. It seemed possible, through the mechanism of that inquiry, to conduct the investigation speedily and effectively. It is unfortunate in the case of the Abbeylara inquiry, which was conducted by a committee of these Houses, that there is a question mark over that type of inquiry, as there is a possibility to do much more within the ambit of the parliamentary system.Another reason for such cynicism was a widespread belief that nobody was ever punished, that the tribunals would run their course and that they might point the finger in certain directions, but nothing would happen. However, recent events have shown that to be manifestly not the case. One senior official has been jailed and a former Minister is being charged with offences under the tax amnesty regulations. We cannot prejudice the outcome of that, but it appears there is a follow up to the work of the tribunals, which is to be very much welcomed.Another reason for such cynicism is the substantial legal costs that arise and that the tribunals appear to be an unlimited gravy train for barristers. It reminds me to some extent of the bovine TB eradication scheme, with which the Minister of State would be familiar from his experience, whereby those with vested interests wanted to perpetuate the scheme because they were drawing a good deal of money from it. It was not difficult to understand the reason that scheme to eradicate the disease continued to run for so long. There is a certain parallel between that scheme and the tribunals, which might be stretching things a little far but, nevertheless, it is a reasonably valid point.It is essential to remove the legal uncertainty that arose from the resignation, particularly with regard to the matter of costs. I note the Minister of State made the point that we do not want to prejudice anything in terms of what the judge might do, but certainty in regard to that matter must exist. I agree with Senator Walsh's questioning of the retrospection aspect. I have been a Member of this House for several years and I recall very few Bills where there was such a degree of retrospection. I accept that retrospection is essential, but I hope it does not lead to another cavalry charge to the four gold mines in terms of somebody challenging that aspect. I do not understand the reason for a provision in section 2(1) which states, ". shall, for that purpose, have regard to any report of the tribunal relating to its proceedings in the period before his or her appointment". I would have thought it was axiomatic that the judge would have such regard without the need for that to be specified in legislation, although it creates a standing for the reports that were prepared earlier and those reports are to be welcomed. I wonder about the necessity for that provision.Notwithstanding the cynicism about tribunals, they have fundamentally altered the culture of the country for the better. The nod and a wink culture and the acceptance that people in high places could play fast and loose with our planning and tax laws is gone. That is the monument to the tribunals, irrespective of what was in the reports. Part of the cynicism surrounding them arose at the time of the publication of the report of the beef tribunal and the lack of clarity and conclusion that appeared to emerge from that report. Subsequent reports were much more focused and explicit in terms of where they pointed the finger, who they regarded as being responsible for certain activities – and denying those activities – and in exacting costs where that was considered appropriate. There has been a huge shift in that culture which, as we heard this morning, dated back as far as the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes. There was definitely a philosophy that the little people should not get involved in major affairs, that they were an encumbrance and that the views of the public should not be considered. I recall that in some of my early days in the Oireachtas, that atmosphere pervaded these Houses. There were people here who thought that nothing and nobody should get in their way. Thankfully, that has changed.We must now look at where we go from here. Inquiries in general must become much more precise. That it will be possible to take several modules together by having separate divisions within a tribunal is very welcome. This alone should greatly accelerate the work of the tribunals and their conclusions. The legislation is very much to be welcomed. It is essential and important, and should be quickly enacted into law to remove any ambiguity from the issue of costs arising from the Flood tribunal. There are other aspects involved, but this alone is sufficient for the legislation to merit a speedy passage.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate and I appreciate their co-operation. There is a substantial degree of consensus on the need to expedite this matter. I welcome Senator Terry's remark that the legislation is overdue, and that she appreciates the urgency that applies to it now.I can confirm to Senator Terry that the Office of the Attorney General and the Attorney General were closely associated with the drafting of the Bill. The Senator also commented on the reasons for the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood. I refute any allegations that the Government had any involvement in that resignation.There is a general consensus that the legislation involves a great deal of common sense. I agree that this Bill is short and technical. Senators have raised wider issues in terms of the overall cost and so on, and I understand those concerns. I can also confirm that the Commissions of Investigation Bill will be introduced in the coming session and that the Government will continue to support the work of the tribunals in the interim. As to how tribunals will carry on, in terms of the new legislation, we must wait and see.Although this is a short and technical Bill, it deals with an important issue. Tribunals date back over 80 years. In that period, tribunal legislation has been substantially amended five times. The Bill introduced today is only the sixth amendment. In general, all the amending measures were occasioned by some specific need that emerged from the experience regarding sitting tribunals or tribunals which had just concluded their work, or by the anticipated needs of tribunals about to be set up. This is also the case with the current Bill, which has been inspired by the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood as chairperson of the Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. However, the tribunal's mechanism has proved its worth over the years. The amending legislation which was passed since 1979 had made it more effective, while the courts, having regard to the Constitution in interpreting the legislation, have ensured that the basic rights of persons who are the subject of inquiries are always respected, while remaining consistent with the need to allay the public concern which has given rise to the establishment of the tribunal.This Bill is an important step in enhancing the effectiveness of existing and future tribunals. We are providing certainty regarding the authority of the chairperson of a tribunal to make a determination on application for costs in a situation where he or she had not originally heard the evidence, and in that case shall have regard to any report of the tribunal. That determination is a critical matter. It might be recalled that there is no constitutional or legal right to costs, but rather a right to apply for them to the chairperson of the tribunal.We are also providing for two very effective mechanisms for tribunals, namely, for a tribunal of its own volition to seek the direction of the High Court and for tribunals where there is more than one member to sit in separate divisions to allow for more efficient and speedy consideration of the matters concerned. Senator Jim Walsh referred to the pace of tribunals. Older players are often accused of not having sufficient pace, but in terms of cost efficiency and in particular time efficiency, this amendment will be very important.I agree with the Senators who noted the need to look at the legislation concerning tribunals in a comprehensive way, and perhaps develop proposals to amend and consolidate it. In that regard, the anticipated final report of the Law Reform Commission will have a major influence on our future intentions. Likewise, I am sure that the proposed Commissions of Investigation Bill, which will come before the Houses in the next session, will bring about a much more efficient and cost-effective method of investigating matters of public concern.I thank the Senators again for their comments and I commend the Bill to the House.

In page 3, subsection (1), line 25, after "purpose," to insert "in addition to the requirements of subsection(1),".The purpose of these amendments is to add to the legislation. They are minor amendments and I ask the Minister of State to consider and accept them. Amendment No. 1 is tabled in order to make line 25 of subsection(1) clearer. Paragraph 2(1)(1A)(b) states that in determining costs, the sole member or chairperson shall have regard to the report of the tribunal. The amendment is designed to ensure that the person determining costs also has regard to other factors, as already provided for in section 6(1) of the 1979 Act.What is provided for in amendment No. 2 may not be quite what I wanted. The idea was simply to delete the inverted commas at the end of line 27 on page 3. This is merely a technical amendment which would then allow for amendment No. 3 to follow on as part of that subsection.Regarding amendment No. 3, subsection(2)(1) effects a textual amendment. When subsection (1A) is inserted into the 1979 Act, it should be accompanied by subsection(2), which strengthens subsection(1A). They should be read together. My amendment will also be of assistance when it comes to preparing a statute law restatement of these Acts.Amendment No. 4 proposes the insertion of a new sub-clause between lines 31 and 32 in page 3. The purpose of this amendment is to reinforce the section. I propose it to give absolute clarity to the intention of the section. It is in this spirit that I propose the amendment and I urge the Minister of State to accept it.

However, her amendments are more in the nature of drafting points than substantive amendments.

I ask the Minister to look at these amendments before the Bill is presented in the Dáil. There may be merit in what is being said and this would be a way around the impasse.

I understand the cost aspect but I do not understand why this needs to be specified in the legislation.

The purpose of my amendment is to change subsection 3(2) into a textual amendment to ensure that subsection 3(2) is read in conjunction with changes made by subsection 3(1). In the context of any statute law restatement it is important that the amendment and its temporal application are read together.

However, I do not believe the amendment will add to the already clear provision in the Bill in this regard and the amendment is opposed.Regarding the previous point, we will look at the matter to see if a change in punctuation is necessary. I have very high regard for the Attorney General's legal expertise, but we will consider his grammar to ensure certainty before the Bill comes before the Dáil.

Seanad Éireann has always supported the Government's attempts to bring peace and political stability to Northern Ireland.The purpose of the Bill is to provide in our law for the establishment of the Independent Monitoring Commission which has been the subject of an Agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland. It may be helpful if I set out in some detail the background to the establishment of the commission.Members of this House who follow developments in Northern Ireland very closely will undoubtedly be aware of the broad background to the creation of the Independent Monitoring Commission, but I will revisit some of the main points in that genesis to show where the IMC fits into the overall pattern of political progress in Northern Ireland.The early months of this year saw a great deal of political engagement between the two Governments and the pro-Agreement parties in Northern Ireland. Our intensive engagement continued through the months that followed and following much painstaking effort and a slow grind, a full and complete audit of all areas of the Good Friday Agreement which remained to be fully implemented was developed. This engagement included a set of talks over two days at Hillsborough, involving the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, as well as the parties and a range of Ministers, myself included.The result of our engagement was the Joint Declaration published on 1 May 2003. The Joint Declaration is the comprehensive assessment by the two Governments of what remains to be implemented from the Agreement and the most positive way of ensuring that this takes place. Published in conjunction with the Joint Declaration, the Agreement on Monitoring and Compliance set out some important principles on how confidence and stability in the political process can be sustained and developed, principally through the creation of a new independent body. This new body will monitor and report on the carrying out of commitments in relation to the ending of paramilitary activity and the programme of security normalisation in Northern Ireland, as set out in the Joint Declaration. It will also consider claims that any party within the Assembly was in breach of its commitments under the Agreement.The text of an international agreement setting up this new body, now known as the Independent Monitoring Commission, was published in September and signed here in Leinster House on behalf of the two countries by me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the British ambassador on 25 November 2003. Members of the commission had been appointed earlier and they have been doing some preliminary work in shadow format.The membership which is broadly based comprises Lord Alderdice, the former Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly and former leader of the Alliance Party; Mr. Joe Brosnan, former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Mr. John Grieve, a former senior officer with the London Metropolitan Police; and Mr. Richard Kerr, a former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States.The commission, whose members are all individuals of the utmost integrity and standing, visited Dublin last week. I had the opportunity to discuss the broad political situation with them and they also had the opportunity to discuss the situation with other members of the Government. We shared with them the Government view that the IMC can act as a confidence-building mechanism on a wide range of issues, particularly by offering reassurance that the activities which destabilised the institutions in the past will not be allowed to recur.It did not prove possible to reach the agreement that we had hoped for in advance of the elections to the Assembly last month. That election has created a number of new imponderables. I cannot pretend that I am in a position to tell the House exactly how the political situation will evolve in the light of the Assembly elections. For its part, the Irish Government will do all it can to help achieve agreement among the parties but I stress that this must be in the context of the Good Friday Agreement. One way or the other, it is a fair assessment at this stage to say that the Independent Monitoring Commission will play a key role in future developments.I will now deal in some detail with the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 defines certain terms used in the Bill. Section 2 provides that the commission will be independent in the performance of its functions and will have the legal capacity of a body corporate in Irish law. Section 3 deals with the objectives, functions and membership of the commission, as well as the appointment of staff and the proper keeping of accounts.Section 3(1) provides that the objective and functions of the commission are as set out in Articles 3 to 7 of the Agreement. The objective of the commission is to carry out certain functions with a view to promoting the transition to a peaceful society and stable and inclusive devolved Government in Northern Ireland.The functions of the commission are as set out in Articles 4 to 7 of the Agreement. Article 4 provides that the commission shall monitor any continuing activity by paramilitary groups and assess whether the leaderships of these organisations are directing or seeking to prevent this activity and report to the two Governments on its findings. Article 5 provides that the commission monitors the British Government's adherence to its agreed programme of security normalisation in Northern Ireland and report its findings to the two Governments. There is also a mechanism for the commission to examine normalisation in the absence of an agreed programme. Article 6 provides that the commission may consider a claim by any party in the Northern Ireland Assembly that a Minister or Assembly party is not committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means or that a Minister or party is failing to observe any other terms of the pledge of office. In so far as a claim relates to the operation of the institutional arrangements under strand one of the multi-party Agreement, it shall be considered by those commissioners solely appointed by the British Government and any findings reported to the British Government only. Article 7 states that the commission shall recommend any remedial measures considered necessary.Section 3(2) deals with the membership of the commission as well as the appointment of staff thereto, the proper keeping of accounts by the commission and privileges, immunities and inviolabilities as set out in Articles 10 to 14 of the Agreement.Membership of the commission shall be as set out in Article 10 of the Agreement. The commission shall have four members appointed as follows: two members, one of whom shall be from Northern Ireland, to be appointed by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; one member to be appointed by the Government of Ireland; one member appointed jointly by the two Governments, who shall be a nominee of the Government of the United States of America.Section 4 deals with the provision by me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, of such moneys, premises, facilities and services, including staff, necessary for the proper functioning of the commission in line with Article 12 of the Agreement. Section 5 deals with immunities and privileges afforded to the commission. Section 5(1) provides that the commission and its property shall be afforded certain immunities and privileges in the performance of official functions. Section 5(2) and (3) deal with immunities and privileges afforded to members of the commission, its staff and agents or persons performing functions assigned to them by the commission.Section 6 provides that the commission shall not do anything which might prejudice the national security of Ireland or of the United Kingdom, endanger the safety of any person or have a prejudicial effect on any current or forthcoming legal proceedings.Section 7 deals with the disclosure of information to or by the commission. The section ensures that the commission is in a position to obtain all relevant information to enable it to fulfil its mandate. In particular, it specifically permits the Garda Síochána to provide information to the commission.The section also ensures that the commission and its agents observe confidentiality in respect of material received. Section 8 provides for the formal dissolution of the commission in an orderly manner in line with article 16 of the agreement. The section allows for the winding down of the commission in a manner which would allow for such transitional or consequential provisions, as are necessary or expedient.Section 9 provides that applications, under the Freedom of Information Act 1997, for disclosure of information relating to communications between the commission and public bodies may be refused. This is necessary to protect communications between the commission and public bodies. The commission itself is outside the scope of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, as it is not a public body under the Act and it is not intended that the Minister for Finance would make an order declaring it to be such a body.Section 10 provides that a copy of each report submitted to the Government by the commission or its members, under articles 4 to 6 of the agreement, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Section 11 is a standard provision which provides for the payment of any expenses arising under the Act out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 12 provides that the Act will come into operation by order to be made by me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, following consultation with the Secretary of State.It is in the nature of things that when this House is asked to enact legislation in the context of giving effect to an international agreement, the form of the legislation is to a large extent determined by the terms of the agreement. The agreement, included as a Schedule to the Bill before the House today, is the culmination of detailed negotiations between the Irish and UK Governments. Such a process inevitably involves compromises on both sides.While the wording of the agreement might not be exactly what any individual Senator might write, if he or she was starting with a clean sheet of paper, I hope the House can accept that the agreement it is being asked to legislate for is a balanced one which has the potential to make a significant contribution to the quest for political stability in the North. It is against that background that I commend the Bill to the House.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	186	Fine Gael supports the Independent Monitoring Commission Bill. We have tabled some technical amendments to the Bill, which we can go through on Committee and Report Stages. I understand the importance of this legislation, which was needed in 1998, not 2003. If we had the kind of role and scope that is now being put in place in the Bill then, whereby an independent commission could adjudicate on the facts concerning the ability of parties in the North to stand by their obligations, we might not be in the mess we are currently. This is an excellent idea but it has come too late because we do not have the institutions in Northern Ireland. It is clear that the recent election there delivered a result which will make it more difficult than before to restore those institutions. In effect, the commission will become an ombudsman in Northern Ireland, adjudicating on complaints on a variety of matters, but we needed such a body five years ago.It is important, however, to have an independent monitoring body in place to call a spade a spade and deliver the hard truths about the situation to politicians in Northern Ireland. The two largest parties on either side of the divide, the DUP and Sinn Féin, currently oppose this legislation. The DUP vociferously opposed it in the House of Commons, while the current position of Sinn Féin, the biggest Nationalist party, is also opposed to the legislation. That is because for the first time this legislation can recommend that sanctions be imposed on parties that are in breach of the Good Friday Agreement. Sinn Féin does not want that because it has been consistently and deliberately in breach of its commitments under the Agreement as the issue of decommissioning has not been resolved.We are now at a stage where hard, face to face talking is required between the parties in Northern Ireland and between them and our Government. I hope that when this commission is up and running, it will set aside diplomatic speak and when complaints are made to it, it will give full and direct recommendations to both Governments concerning what needs to be done. If that had happened in 1998 or in 2000 we might not be in the current position. On behalf of Fine Gael, I thank the four eminent people who, as the Minister stated, have decided to accept appointment as members of the commission. They have a knowledge of security matters in this State, in Northern Ireland and in the United States of America. They have an expert knowledge of counter terrorism, which is important because the kind of organisations we are dealing with, which still have not decided to decommission their weapons fully and thereby honour the commitments under the Good Friday Agreement, must be told in no uncertain terms what needs to be done, even at this late stage, to make progress.Whatever the possibilities were of re-establishing the institutions before the elections two weeks ago, it will now be more difficult to do so in light of the results. The Minister was honest about the current political situation. No one has a road map to resolve this situation and there is no plan B. The situation is worse now because over the past five years the two principal parties have used and abused the Agreement to get their own way. I refer specifically to the DUP which has built its political success in recent months on attacking at every turn the Agreement, which is the voice of the Irish people, North and South, as expressed in 1998. Equally, Sinn Féin has successfully built up its political capital in recent months, using the issue of IRA weapons as a bargaining tool between the Irish Government and other pro-Agreement parties.I am pessimistic about the current situation. Both Governments have done everything in their power to work a way out of this situation. A great amount of time was spent in the discussions between Mr. Adams, Mr. Trimble and both Governments before the recent elections, but we are now in a difficult situation. No Member of the House should be naive enough to think that agreement will be found simply by wishing for it. This situation will require a great deal of political skill and savvy in the coming months and perhaps years if it is to be resolved. The Minister and his Government colleagues have the support of this side of the House, which wants the Agreement implemented. However, we need to know that the people we are dealing with are not moderates. Over the past five years, they have used all their political ability to sunder the Agreement. That situation needs to be recognised and not naively wished away as, unfortunately, some Members of the House still seek to do.The only time the IRA has decommissioned some of its weapons, since 1998, was as a result of the suspension of the institutions when Mr. David Trimble put pressure on them. There have been three IRA acts of decommissioning since 1998, each one occurring as a result of the pressure exerted by Mr. Trimble. If there is a lesson to be learned from this by the Government and by the SDLP, it is that we must stand together as democrats in constitutionally configured parties to deal once and for all with the parts of the Agreement that have not been implemented.One of the major reasons two thirds of the Unionist community voted for anti-Agreement parties is that the issues of Sinn Féin in Government and decommissioning, which is an essential part of the Agreement, have not been adequately resolved. We should have dealt with the issue before now. Had sanctions been brought to bear on those parties which were outside the Agreement and not fulfilling its obligations much sooner, we would be in a stronger position. We are where we are, however, and have a difficult situation to address. I know the Governments will do everything in their power to get the multi-party talks going again, assuming there is some prospect of agreement, but that will be difficult.We will deal with the substance of the Bill on Committee Stage but I want to ask the Minster two questions during this debate, the first of which is on the issue of information. First, the Minister rightly said that one of the sections that deals with this aspect gives power to the Garda Síochána to give information to this commission but as I understand it, in the context of Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, we, as a sovereign State, cannot give information to bodies outside the police force in Northern Ireland. In other words, we cannot give information to the ombudsman's office in Northern Ireland because it is not a police force. Will the Minister refer to that when replying to the debate because as I understand it, any information sought by one police authority from another on activities of individuals cannot be obtained by an institution other than a police authority, in other words, an ombudsman?I recently came across a case where the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland attempted to get information, as I understand it, about certain activities along the Border but the Garda could not give that information to the police ombudsman on the basis that the ombudsman was not a police force. If that lacuna exists, we should rectify it. Perhaps the Minister would outline his current thinking on that because it is important that as much information as possible is given to the ombudsman if alleged activities occur and the Garda is in possession of that information.Second, will the Minister state in his response whether the Government is bound by the recommendations that come from this commission? I am aware the Assembly parties can make a complaint to the commission and recommendations might follow but I am not sure if they are bound by those. As a sovereign Government, are we bound by any conclusions or recommendations that come from this commission? If so, this would make the issue of sanctions a much more real prospect in the years going forward.I look forward to dealing with some of the more detailed aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage. Those of us on this side of the House have facilitated the Government in bringing the Bill, which I welcome, through the House today in a swift way so that this commission can be in place by 1 January. I am aware it has already met in shadow form and is doing its work. We wish it well in its future work.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I, too, welcome the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to the House. He is a frequent visitor to this House and this is indicative of the amount of work going on in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in introducing legislation.The Minister outlined clearly the background to the introduction of this legislation and referred to the Good Friday Agreement and the Joint Declaration. It would be fair for the House to acknowledge that the Minister, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others have played a crucial and constructive role in bringing the process this far, and I would like to acknowledge that. As alluded to by Senator Hayes, the Agreement was overwhelmingly endorsed by all the people on the island and also within each of the jurisdictions, North and South. It behoves all democrats to adhere to its terms but, unfortunately, this is not always the case.When I first read the Title I thought it was quite an innocuous Bill. I then read the memorandum, which appeared to be even more innocuous but on reading the substance of the Bill, I came across areas about which I would have some reservations. I do not want to appear pedantic in any way but the first aspect that struck me was the interpretations, something with which I never had difficulty previously. Perhaps that is indicative of our own backgrounds in terms of these issues but I would have difficulty with some of the descriptions in the Bill.I am conscious that, through the Agreement, we have tried to bring relations between Britain and Ireland onto a higher plane and in the removal of Articles 2 and 3, which was voted for in the referendum adopting the Good Friday Agreement, there was a clear majority to give effect to the provisions. It strikes me as a little odd, however, because we replaced Articles 2 and 3 with a more aspirational article in the Constitution which I believe puts a constitutional obligation on us to pursue a united Ireland. I am well aware of the political, security and other sensitivities attached to that but it is important that we clearly state where we are coming from and everybody North and South has acknowledged that it is a legitimate aspiration for people to seek to have a united Ireland. This places an obligation on all of us, the Houses of the Oireachtas, Ministers and the Government, to pursue that. I would like to see that view more strongly reflected in the stand taken by the Government in this House. I will come back to that aspect because we can sometimes overstate the sensitivities and be apprehensive when there is no need to be.On the Agreement itself, a certain à la carte approach has been taken by parties and others. For example, we saw the delay in holding the election, despite opposition from various parties and from the Government. The North-South Ministerial Bodies have not functioned in the manner in which we would have envisaged at the outset. North-South Ministerial Councils have not functioned in some areas either because of opposition and withdrawal of co-operation. It is important that in moving along we do not take an absolute position on all aspects of the Agreement. It is a holistic Agreement and therefore there are obligations on everybody to fulfil its terms fully, willingly and in a co-operative way. I realise there are difficulties in achieving that but I would have some concerns that in the meantime we might move ahead of everybody else and not encourage them to fulfil their particular responsibilities. I do not want to labour the point too much because to some extent it is a question of optics but where another country is defined in our legislation, that definition is also there for international legal interpretation. In doing that, we should be conscious of our responsibilities to fulfil the aspiration within the Constitution.The Minister rightly dealt with section 7 but at first glance I actually misread it. I thought it was a mandatory rather than a discretionary imposition on the Garda Síochána and on the Commissioner, although I believe there will be a strong political imperative for absolute co-operation in this area so as to make the discretionary aspect somewhat redundant. It raises serious security issues, however, and while I am conscious that this whole area is about security, North and South, and the fulfilment of obligations by people to ensure that everybody embraces the change in Ireland, there has to be some caution as to how that is done. I imagine the Minister and others might agree with me that a requirement on the Garda or the Commissioner to disclose operational matters or findings to outside parties is probably undesirable. I do not want to go back over even recent history in this regard but there have been instances where people with statutory responsibility did not fulfil their responsibilities as they should have. It is important that we are mindful of that.We will also need to open up our system of justice in other areas. The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights discussed these matters during its review of the criminal law. Disclosure of information in certain areas can affect the prosecution of cases and the successful completion of investigations.Regarding Article 3, Senator Brian Hayes alluded to the fact that the legislation has to some extent been overtaken by events since it was first envisaged. While an independent demonstration of adherence or otherwise to the terms of the Agreement by the various parties was needed at one stage, changing circumstances, namely, the emergence of Sinn Féin, on the one hand, and the Democratic Unionist Party, on the other, as the largest parties in the Assembly, raises a question mark, as the Minister also noted, about devolved government in the North. I hope the current problem will be overcome. There is a strong body of opinion that if it is overcome in the current circumstances, the result may be more sustainable as a consequence.I am not as pessimistic as others regarding the outcome of the election. While it may have been preferable for the moderates to have achieved greater success at the polls – it could have encouraged agreement – in the circumstances, the largest parties now have an obligation to bring finality to the Agreement. We must be optimistic and work towards this objective.On Article 4, I spoke to several of the recently elected DUP representatives. It is interesting that it is now possible to discuss issues such as a united Ireland with people who would be perceived to be on the extreme wing of loyalist and Unionist opinion. While they may not be about to change their opinion on this issue, the mere fact that it can be discussed is notable. One of them told me he had been less than diligent in criticising paramilitary violence on the loyalist side. This violence needs to be acknowledged by Unionist politicians. There has been one-way criticism of the IRA and republican paramilitaries, perhaps with justification, but it is necessary for credibility and balance to point out that much of what happens on the loyalist paramilitary side is a major deterrent to the normalisation of society in the North.At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights this morning, at which the Minister was present, the Garda Commissioner stated that paramilitaries are prominent in the organised criminal fraternity in at least three of our cities and in the Border area.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	189	This is unacceptable at this point and brings into focus the fact that the information flowing to the commission will perhaps provide evidence and identify witnesses and the names of those involved. Obviously, therefore, there is a responsibility to ensure this information does not fall into the wrong hands, given the nature and character of those who will be investigated on both sides. We appear to have at least circumstantial evidence that this was not fully the case in the past.Regarding Article 5, which sets out the measures one would identify for the normalisation of society such as the demolition of towers, closure and dismantling of military bases and withdrawal of troops from Northern Ireland, the response has been less than generous. While it is possible that reasons for this will be cited, I have concluded from my occasional visits to the North that more could have been done, even in light of current security concerns, to give effect to these measures.I understand the programme of commitments in the area of normalisation has not yet been agreed – perhaps the Minister will correct if I am wrong in this. The Bill states the commission shall, at the request of the British Government, prepare a report. Why can this not be done by the Irish and British Governments? Could the commission of its own volition make such a request? I am making a distinction between Article 5(2) and Article 5(1), which is triggered only when the commitments and the agreed programme are in place.Although my concern with regard to Article 10 is not substantive, I would have preferred equality of numbers in the allocations. Given that both Governments jointly nominated the member of the commission from the United States, perhaps they should also have jointly nominated the member from Northern Ireland.On Article 13, we are dependent on absolute adherence to the requirements that people will not disclose information they receive in the course of the performance of their duties. The text even refers to agents. Apart from the members of the commission, staff and agents will also be engaged, whose identity we do not know at this stage. Given the eagerness and ability of some of the paramilitaries to obtain information – we have had experience of this – this area will need to be closely monitored.Despite the reservations I have outlined, I support the Bill and hope the commission operates with efficacy. The Minister does not need to be reminded by me or anyone else that we are not dealing with members of the Legion of Mary on any side and we must, therefore, be vigilant about how the commission operates.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this legislation. While I was not present for the Minister's opening remarks, I have a copy of his speech, which I welcome. We must concede that in the overall scale of trying to make political progress in Northern Ireland, this legislation is neither the end of the beginning nor the beginning of the end, but simply another small step forward. When we discuss the politics of trying to bring about a political settlement or solution to Northern Ireland, we can sometimes dream too much of finding one great step forward which will solve all the problems. There will be no such step and the message must be to try to keep taking small steps and bring as many people as possible on board on each occasion.When the Houses debate the politics of Northern Ireland and possible or attempted solutions to the problems there, we fail to recognise sufficiently the progress that has been made. If we were to examine the record of political debate on Northern Ireland in the Oireachtas during the past 20 to 25 years, we would find that from the late 1960s to the middle of the 1990s every debate concentrated on the most recent terrorist atrocity.There were appropriate words of condemnation, but very little hope. At least in recent years when we debate Northern Ireland, for all the difficulties that still remain, there is a significant degree of hope. There has been major progress, although it has not gone as far as everybody would have wished. However, we must acknowledge that as a result of what has happened since the early 1990s and in so far as the ceasefires are complete, there has been a huge difference in the lives of the citizens of Northern Ireland. The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland, whether in west Belfast, south Down or south Armagh, are able to get on with their lives in a reasonably comfortable and secure fashion. That was not the case 15 years or 20 years ago. We have come a long way and although I recognise that we have a long way to go and that legislation such as this Bill is still necessary, we should try to see the glass as being half full instead of half empty.The Minister stated that the legislation is for the purposes of debating and dealing with the question of how confidence and stability in the political process can be sustained and developed, principally through the creation of the new independent body. That is what it is all about – how to create confidence and ensure that political structures are developed and used to the full.People mentioned the election results in Northern Ireland and the general overview expressed by political parties and commentators was that the results were disappointing. There was a demand for elections in the Oireachtas and throughout the body politic in the Irish Republic. The elections were called and they took place; the people of Northern Ireland spoke. We cannot re-run the result of the election no more than we could re-run the result of the general election here 18 months ago, no matter how much some of us would wish to do so.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	194	We have to live with the consequences of how the people of Northern Ireland spoke. We talk about some parties winning the majority of the Unionist vote and other parties winning the majority of the Nationalist vote as if there was a substantial shift. If one looks at the total vote and the results in the constituencies, while there was a shift of seats, there was not a major shift in public opinion. There was perhaps one shift that has not been commented on and perhaps Senator Walsh, who spoke earlier about the dream of a united Ireland, should dwell on the fact that the total Unionist vote in the election, not including those who voted for the Alliance Party, seemed to grow substantially.We debated informally over the past two years or three years how the population shift in Northern Ireland and the changed demographics would bring about an almost 50-50 political divide. The election result of a fortnight ago appeared to knock that argument on the head. I will not dwell on that because we should not try to solve problems by some sort of mathematical formula. In respect of the issue we are debating here and the broader issue of Northern Ireland, we must try to make progress in small steps.The weapons issue remains firmly on the agenda. Weapons are part of the problem, but I am not sure how far we can go in trying to make them part of the solution. We will not arrive at a situation where every single weapon of destruction, be it an armalite, a bullet or a cartridge, will be collected. It simply does not work that way and it never has done so. If, in the Ireland of the early 1930s, when William T. Cosgrave was handing over power to his political opponents, he had demanded evidence to show there were no illegal weapons left, the handover would never have happened. If, in the Ireland of 1948, when John A. Costello was forming the first, broad-based, inter-party Government, he had demanded absolute assurances that every piece of weaponry formerly used by some components of the parties involved in that Government were fully decommissioned, we could not have proceeded.There is only so far one can go in demanding that weapons are beyond use. It must be a strong political aspiration, but the issue is that if people have a willingness to go back to the type of armed politics they employed in the past, they can always purchase or obtain more weapons. While we seek reassurances and must insist that people who wish to practice politics disarm their armed wing, trying to obtain full proof of this disarmament is so difficult that if we put it at the very top of our political agenda we might find it impossible to progress that agenda. We must try to work with the political parties and particularly with those who previously did not show a commitment to politics to ensure that they are brought on and kept on side. We know from our history that politics works, just as we know that violence, division and sectarianism does not work. We must keep politics and its practice to the fore.In the Schedule to the legislation, Article 4 refers to the dealings the commission will have concerning the threat from paramilitary groups. It has a massive task on hand. One notes that it must monitor attacks on the security forces, murders, sectarian attacks, etc. Sadly, they are still happening. Training, targeting and intelligence gathering is still happening to some degree. Punishment beatings and attacks are still happening on all sides of the political equation in Northern Ireland. We have to aspire to the time and the day when all of that will cease. The question I ask myself is how we best march in that direction.We must, while working hard to ensure progress on decommissioning and security, keep politics to the fore. People from various backgrounds and histories have been elected to a new Assembly in Northern Ireland. Some of them have committed deeds which we could not be proud of or defend. The challenge facing those people is to try to put the political affairs of Northern Ireland back on the agenda and we must work with them.There was a suggestion in this House last week, from the Government side, that we should invite the leaders of the Northern political parties to address us. I echo that suggestion. It is important that we have an opportunity to listen to some of these leaders as well as speaking to them. The more dialogue, the better. It is the only way forward. I want to see the big issues of militarisation and demilitarisation tackled and resolved, but we have to keep politics to the fore and keep people talking because it is the only avenue that brought about progress over the past ten or 15 years and it is the only way that we can make further progress.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I welcome the Minister and the Bill. I was thinking as I listened to the Minister that he is taking benchmarking a little seriously because every time he is here, we have to be here and we may look for more.This is a very important Bill because 30 years of violence have left a legacy of pain and distrust. It is understandable that pain and distrust would endure even while serious progress was being made. The history of the past six years has been one of great hope followed by severe disappointment. Notwithstanding all the current difficulties, the unfolding of the Good Friday Agreement has been immense. Over the past five years it has transformed the conditions of the people in Northern Ireland and relations on the island.The principle of consent has now been accepted by all sides. The value of North-South co-operation is recognised universally. The strong partnership between both Governments in driving progress has demonstrated the value of good intergovernmental co-operation. There are still many difficulties to be overcome before we can have full implementation of the Agreement but the crux of the issue is the matter of trust.Last May the Minister was involved in extensive negotiations on the Joint Declaration and today's Bill is part of what came out of those discussions. There is no doubt progress has been made on policing, equality, elements of the criminal justice system and demilitarisation. We also had a significant act of decommissioning some weeks ago and a statement from Gerry Adams. However, we and everyone in the North, need to know that paramilitary activity is over once and for all and that there is no ambiguity about it. People will only develop the trust that is required if they hear a statement to that effect. The many failures of the executive over the last number of years have been brought about by that lack of trust. It is clear to everyone that the two Governments must come to grips with the issue. Otherwise I cannot see us moving forward to any great extent. Trust and paramilitary activity are the two issues at the core of the problem and we will never be able to sustain any kind of stability unless we tackle them.Paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration sets out the need for an immediate, full and permanent cessation of paramilitary training, targeting of people, intelligence gathering and a plethora of other riotous behaviour. It also makes clear that the practice of exiling people must stop. People who have already been exiled should be able to return in safety and security should they so wish. Five years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and ten years since the first ceasefire, who could possibly object to the monitoring of activities such as these? It is high time these activities ceased. They are wrong and they are damaging the very fabric of the Good Friday Agreement.This summer was the most peaceful Northern Ireland has seen for a long time. In recent weeks, however, we have seen an upsurge in violence, consisting mostly of loyalist attacks on Catholics. This is simply unacceptable and must be tackled. If there are people in these communities with any influence at all I encourage them to help in whatever way they can to bring about a cessation of this activity. I am not sure whether all sides realise that the IMC, which we are discussing today, is for both sides of the community; republicans and loyalists can benefit from it. It will become part of the architecture of the peace process. Those who suggest it is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement or outside it are missing a vital point. It is there to help. Any fair-minded person must believe it will be a positive development. If paramilitary activity is a thing of the past why should anyone have any objection to that fact being stated? The commission can also investigate some of the mischievous allegations which could undermine confidence. When the institutions are re-established, as they should be soon, it is to be hoped this stop-start progress will be a thing of the past. The commission will be a positive influence in this respect.The communities in Northern Ireland are now emerging from the shadow of the gunman. All communities have finally realised that the people who were their so-called protectors were actually the reason they were being attacked. They have now put this behind them and realise that their protectors were of no assistance at all. Senator Walsh mentioned the process of security normalisation, saying it was vital, and I agree. People have a right to live in a normal environment. The commission will have the responsibility of monitoring the demolition of watchtowers and removal of police from the barracks. All those things will be of benefit and the commission will be the vehicle through which they are delivered. There will be no justification for having soldiers in police barracks and watchtowers if paramilitary activity has ceased.The members of the commission, as the Minister said, are eminent people. I do not know any of them but I will take the Minister's word that they are the right people for the job. Americans have played a key role in Northern Ireland down through the years, from Mr. Clinton down. Their lending of help is a further indication of their support. The commission will have a difficult job. There is a long way to go before trust is built up between communities in the North. I wish them well.The recent elections have brought new challenges to the North; they have made a complex issue a little more complex. The people of the North have spoken. They have given the candidates their mandate and they expect them to do what they must. They expect them to contribute to the possibility of a restoration of the devolved Government. The Agreement was ratified by 85% of the people of this island and 71% of the people of Northern Ireland. More than 70% of the representatives returned to the Assembly are pro-Agreement, which says something. I hope all parties work with the Governments to achieve normalisation and stability in the North. I wish the Minister well.

I welcome the establishment of this independent monitoring commission. It represents progress and an injection of energy for Northern Ireland. I do not agree with Senator Brian Hayes that there is no road map. How could we have a road map in politics? Every step of the way is unpredictable and it requires vision and courage. As I said here two weeks ago after the elections, I do not look at the election results as dismally as some people. I see it as an opportunity. We may be surprised by the DUP – its representatives may be more pragmatic than we expect and be willing to do a deal. As I said that morning, we should send our good wishes from this House to both parties, who were democratically elected.The last day I said this I got into trouble, but I deeply regret that Professor Monica McWilliams lost her seat. I was a personal supporter of hers. I will not mention any more names. I wanted to put that on the record in a calm manner because there were ructions when I mentioned to whom she is related – she is a first cousin of you-know-who.

The Government was too patient. I do not think we will achieve a perfect result on decommissioning. How can we be sure that every gun and every missile will be handed up? Someone must have the courage to make a decision and accept in good faith that both sides want peace. If they wish to do so, people can go out and buy more weapons, therefore, politicians must have the courage and vision to accept the sentiments of Sinn Féin. I would have accepted the sentiments expressed by Gerry Adams on the last occasion. A member of the American International Observers Group, Mr. Bill Flynn, who is highly regarded in the insurance business in the United States agreed with me that the wording was acceptable. I do not think we will get a perfect result on the matter at any time.I am just saying what I believe. I have a passion for peace in Northern Ireland. I have been observing what has been happening in the Garvaghy Road since 1995. I have drawn up a report for various taoisigh. I have friends on both sides of the community in the North. I brought the first Fianna Fáil group to Glengall Street to meet David Trimble and we had dinner with him in one of the councillor's houses. I have friends on both sides of the divide, including friends who are ex-prisoners. This is the issue to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.Perhaps the issue of prisoners could be dealt with under the independent monitoring commission. This is part of the Belfast Agreement and has not been adequately addressed. It has never been taken seriously by politicians, North or South. The Agreement states that the Governments continue to recognise the importance of measures to facilitate the reintegration of prisoners into the community by providing support, both prior to and after release, including assistance directed towards availing of employment opportunities, retraining, re-skilling and further education. An ex-prisoner can be elected an MLA and become a Minister in the North but an ex-prisoner cannot get a job sweeping the floor in City Hall. Billy Hutchinson was an ex-prisoner, as were people on the republican side, and an ex-Minister was a prisoner. However, humble loyalists cannot get a job cleaning windows in City Hall because of a public service ban. There is no consistent approach to ex-prisoners.This could be my swan song in politics, but I will stick with it. I have given a commitment to people on both sides of the divide in the North, including the DUP, the UVF and republicans. I will help these people who need a political voice. I will put my heart and soul into this work because I totally oppose violence. I was asked at the beginning of the peace process to visit prisoners in the North. When the ceasefire broke down in 1994 I told the prisoners that I would not visit them again unless the ceasefire was restored. I will not help anyone who is not committed to peace, because it is not in my nature. I am totally opposed to violence but I believe we must have faith in the process. We will not get a perfect situation. Political leaders must be pragmatic and have courage and vision.I submitted my document on ex-prisoners to the Taoiseach and the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs who is discussing it with the Minister's Secretary General. I will give the Minister the document. As the previous Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is on the commission, he knows exactly the position of ex-prisoners. He would be the right man to handle the issue under the independent monitoring commission. My regret is that we did not have a second person on the commission, one from the North and one from London. I would like to be involved in these negotiations. President McAleese asked me as chairwoman of the Gaisce awards to try to get the award into the North, which I succeeded in doing.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I welcome the legislation which the Labour Party supports. We will facilitate its quick passage through the Seanad and Dáil by not tabling amendments. Northern Ireland is not my area of expertise but, on reading through the legislation, I can see it is part of the bigger picture in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the adherence to democratic means over violence for political ends.While we cannot go backwards, progress is disappointing from a party political point of view. While I am not happy with the result of the election, one must put it in context. People voted overwhelmingly for the Good Friday Agreement both here and in the North. There are many reasons that people vote for a particular party in elections. The important point is that they voted and used democratic means to express their wishes. I do not think this is an endorsement of anything other than a peaceful way forward for Northern Ireland.I was involved in a small way in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. The work the forum is carrying out is helpful and it is important that it continues. Meetings were held recently, and even though Unionists did not take part formally, they did contribute. I found what they had to say very positive and they were prepared to engage. We must find a way of including Unionists. We had a forum on Europe, which could have worked better. If we want to keep the Forum on Peace and Reconciliation going, we must deal with issues that affect ordinary people. The work the forum does is very helpful but it is held in Dublin Castle. We need to involve people at all levels.It would be nice to see a united Ireland in the future, but I do not think it is what is important. It is not my priority. What is important is co-operation between the two jurisdictions at every level. As talks progress, this will bring about peace in the future. We must try to improve co-operation at all levels. There is a lot of work going on in this area about which most people are not aware. However, much more needs to be done. I have experience of co-operation between local authorities here and in the North. This is something in which I became involved in the past couple of years. I had not been to the North until recently. I stayed my first night in Northern Ireland during the summer at a summer school in Armagh. Many people now travel to the North to do shopping, which is the way forward. The two jurisdictions can enrich each other. We could be of help to and learn from each other. Everyone considers themselves Irish but may have different perspectives on the matter. However, the most important aspect at the end of the day is co-operation and I see the legislation as part of that.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I welcome the Minister to the House. I recognise the importance of this legislation which derives from the agreement last April between the British and Irish Governments and the Joint Declaration in an effort to break the impasse which led to suspension in October 2002 and to repair the tried mechanisms which would enable trust to be repaired. Unfortunately that agreement in April did not achieve the intended effect of getting the institutions restarted nor, unfortunately, did more recent attempts. The Governments have faced these situations on a number of occasions since the Good Friday Agreement was signed and have to persevere until the obstacle is overcome, which I have no doubt that will happen sooner or later.Last April I would have had mixed feelings about this commission. It was established in a particular political context which has now changed. It tried to encourage the Unionists and others back into the institutions, with the Unionists seeking definite sanctions which would not be entirely dependent on the British Government. This independent commission, which in theory would be free of politics, would establish the facts, come to a judgment, and suggest an appropriate sanction, which would then fall to the parties in the Assembly and eventually, by default, to the British Government.It was envisaged, possibly by the Unionists in the type of situation that occurred last October or a recurrence of something similar, that the commission would be in a position to form a judgment, make recommendations and so on and that there would be improved the sanctions against misbehaviour by one party or the other. Since the elections, the political context for this has changed completely, and the issue is no longer one of reassuring the Ulster Unionist Party in order that Mr. Trimble can return as First Minister with the support of his party, as the result has put the DUP into poll position. The members of the commission have scope in the coming months to play a confidence building role before any institutions are re-established. If they are able to give positive reports on progress or lack of incidents this will create a climate which will make it easier for all parties, including the DUP, following a review, to put the institutions back together.Instead of the institutions returning first and this body being established afterwards as a fail-safe or sanction mechanism, it has a different role of helping, along with others and the Governments, to establish the climate in which it is possible to restore the institutions. I am torn in my judgments of the continuing residue of paramilitarism, even mainstream paramilitarism, that still exists. On the one hand I have great admiration for the distance travelled. If one looks at any international comparison it will be difficult to find similar situations. In South Africa, for example, the ANC fought a guerrilla war, entered negotiations, came out on top and won. In that simple case the ANC formed the institutions of the state and the army. The type of paramilitarism in which they were involved disappeared, but that is not the position in the North of Ireland. It is difficult to detect any winners of the 30 years of conflict. In many ways everyone was a loser. I have never subscribed to the zero sum game theory of Northern politics, even though many parties behave as if it applied. Enormous progress has been made but it needs to be concluded and finished. Naturally, when I was a member of the Government team I shared the frustration at the relative slowness in putting the past to bed and moving forward, something I still share as a citizen and public representative. My hope is that the election results will give encouragement to the political strategy which was embarked upon many years ago, and that people will realise that not merely is there no need for paramilitary organisations but the continuing existence of them is an encumbrance and a hindrance and a potentially serious embarrassment. I do not expect people to do things unilaterally, but I hope in the coming months in the context of moving forward that people use the opportunity to put the past behind them and to put paramilitary organisations definitively out of commission. This is a great opportunity for the republican movement to show a final act of political courage that will vindicate the course on which it has embarked.I know some of the members of the commission quite well and have every confidence in their political sense, judgment and integrity. It is important it tackles a problem which has been left to one side and I urge the Unionist parties to do the same, namely, loyalist paramilitarism. There has been very little movement in this regard, though the loyalists have in a sense politically marginalised themselves because of an unwillingness. They made a considerable and constructive contribution in the early stages of the peace process but their path has faltered because they have not participated in the more general demilitarisation that has taken place. The commitment of the British Government to remove the military character of the North is equally important.In supporting this legislation, I look forward to seeing it used in a constructive manner. No matter what is written, we must consider the realpolitik of the situation – either there are conditions in which the institutions can function on an inclusive basis or they will not function at all. If it was politically unreal before the Assembly elections that, short of a return to war, something would not happen, the parties would come together or the British Government on its own would exclude what was even then, by a slight margin, the larger of the Nationalist parties, Sinn Féin, it is totally out of the question now. If one even attempted to do it, the SDLP would be crucified, not Sinn Féin.We must be realistic. No one can force the republican movement into acts of completion but, and this applied to every stage of decommissioning, the question is if it does not move to conclude, is it prepared to pay the political price? That is the issue. I believe the republican movement is committed to the process and to doing what is necessary to sustain it and the institutions. The republican movement may not come to that easily and I understand some of the internal difficulties involved. It is not an easy task, although it is easy for us to preach glibly. Nonetheless it must carry its strategy to a logical conclusion and there should be no further unreasonable delay in doing so. I accept that it will be done and the plan for doing it will be in the context of putting the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement together again on a durable basis. That is what we all wish to see.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I thank Senators for their contributions on the Bill this afternoon. This legislation is narrow in its focus but important in its potential effect on the situation in the future. It was interesting to hear contributions in the House from various perspectives.Senator Brian Hayes asked if the Government would be bound by recommendations of the commission. That is not in this agreement and could not be because the Good Friday Agreement speaks for itself and this is a supportive measure. It is not something that could bind either Government because that would amount to a significant change to the Good Friday Agreement. Recommendations of the commission are unlikely to call for direct action by the Government but in the agreement on monitoring and compliance, the UK Government has undertaken to resolve claims made about parties in the Assembly in accordance with the commission's recommendations and in consultation with the Irish Government so there is direct effect.The Senator also raised the question of the provision of information by the Garda Síochána to the Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland. That is outside the scope of the Bill but since he raised the matter, as a matter of courtesy, I should say that whereas the exchange of information between police forces is well established in practice and principle, the other issue is being examined by my Department in the context of the new Garda Síochána legislation and, with the establishment of an ombudsman service in this State, that question will be addressed.Senator Walsh mentioned information provided by the Garda Síochána to the commission. The Bill states that the Garda Commissioner may provide information to the commission and that is obviously necessary for the commission to do its work. The commission is bound to maintain confidentiality in respect of information given to it, but there is no obligation to provide information which could have the security implications referred to by Senator Walsh.The Senator asked if there is an agreed programme of normalisation. There is not because we did not reach agreement at the time of the joint declaration or in the process that went off the boil at Hillsborough earlier this year. The commission, at the request of the British Government, can report on "normal" normalisation, as opposed to the "agreed" normalisation that is provided for in the Agreement.Senator Bradford mentioned decommissioning and I do not doubt the wisdom of what he said. It is an issue that remains on the table and must be faced. Senator Mansergh made the similar point that this will not simply go away; it must be addressed. As he correctly said, acts of completion cannot be forced by external agents on the republican movement but, by the same token, the logic of history and the momentum of events is a much stronger force than requests of Governments.Senator Kett mentioned the provisions of the Joint Declaration on paramilitary activities. It is a matter of great regret that at the time people were not willing to commit themselves to that aspect of the Joint Declaration. It escapes me why there was not a willingness to agree to the specific language of paragraph 11 of the declaration at the time.Senator White raised the position of ex-prisoners and I do not doubt she is genuine in her approach to this issue. It would be misleading, however, for me to suggest that the IMC will have a role, direct or indirect, regarding prisoners. It is not envisaged and the issues she raised will have to be resolved in other ways.Senator Mansergh is right that the political context has changed since the commission was originally mooted but, to a great extent, the need for monitoring by an independent body remains, notwithstanding the changed context. A central tenet of the DUP approach is that there must be an end to paramilitary activity and, in those circumstances, it is not difficult to see a key role for the commission even if circumstances have changed substantially.It is a matter of huge disappointment to the Government and to me that the seemingly strong momentum that existed in the run up to the Hillsborough summit failed to deliver. In retrospect, the people who withheld that which was necessary to create an agreement at that time must now ruefully reflect on the lost opportunity.I attracted negative comment for saying that the two Governments were attempting to act as honest brokers and was reproved for using that phrase. It was suggested that a different role was envisaged for the Dublin Government, that of being an unswerving ally of one side of the process. This political generosity and willingness to compromise was needed at the time to sustain the position of other participants in what would have been the immediate re-establishment of the Executive's institutions in Northern Ireland. A great opportunity was lost then for very little. In retrospect, some people may regret that we focused then on convincing each side that it needed the other until, like the two halves of an arch, they would lean against one another to bring about political transformation in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, an overly adversarial approach was adopted, and to borrow Senator Mansergh's point, the "zero sum" mentality overshadowed what could have been a clear and unequivocal verbal formula to effect a transformation that would have put us in a much healthier and stronger position than we are in today. Our present position is not by any means hopeless because the people have spoken in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement provided internally for a review of its terms which must proceed.In that context however, the gulf between the parties represented by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, were the existing arrangements to be attempted again, is wider than ever before. The width of that gulf is a cause of concern. Senator Kett said the situation had become more complex. While I understand his point in a sense perhaps it is not more complex, merely more simple but more difficult. We now know what are the problems, we can see the two protagonists who hold the numerical majority in the political communities in Northern Ireland and we know their demands The republican movement now faces a different Unionist line-out, which is probably less able to accept some of the delicate language and events deemed to constitute acts of completion last spring. Had those words and events been delivered on generously they would have accomplished that purpose. The situation has changed but not necessarily for the worse. We must take some time to let the new realities bed down and to allow those who have achieved different and stronger mandates in the recent election to face the responsibility of those mandates. While people may talk about their mandate, it is a mandate to reinstate institutions in Northern Ireland, not simply to stand by a position. Senators Kett and Walsh made the point that we must face up to the reality that 70% of the people of Northern Ireland voted for pro-Agreement parties. No matter what construction is put on the outcome of this election, when people were given the opportunity 70% of them lined out for parties whose fundamental predisposition is to make the Good Friday Agreement work.Those who were calling for re-negotiation of the Agreement must realise that the two Governments are not in a position to re-negotiate it. They will review it, as they have undertaken to do to the electorates North and South, and to the people of these islands. The fundamental principles of a partnership society, creation of a sense of equality, recognition of east-west and North-South relations and the need to share in executive power in Northern Ireland cannot be re-negotiated, no more than can the constitutional arrangements between the two sovereign Governments and the restatement of the Irish position on the status of Northern Ireland. None of these matters is up for re-negotiation. In that context, it is open to everyone now to ask whether the exact technical details and minute provisions for the operation of the institutions in Northern Ireland can be altered as a consequence of a review. That is an area in which there is sufficient room for people to asses the present position in the light of what has happened.I thank the House for its positive endorsement of the Government's position, which is that this International Monitoring Commission should proceed in present circumstances. I acknowledge Senator Mansergh's great work in assisting the Government to arrive at this point. I take seriously therefore his statement that he was always rather ambivalent about the necessity for this body. It was intended at the time to be a hand-holding institution for those being asked to take matters on trust in circumstances where they found it difficult politically to sell that message to their own electorates. Events have shown how difficult that task was. This body can play a very useful role in a further outworking of the Agreement.People have asked why there is not another Nationalist representative. The body was designed to represent the two Governments, the US as an honest broker and an interested and co-operative party, and a similar person selected from within Northern Ireland who happens in this case to be Lord Alderdice. It was a carefully constructed, balanced international mechanism but was not designed to be balanced numerically between Nationalism and Unionism, or to function on that basis. I am grateful that Senator Mansergh now sees it would be better to proceed with this body than to walk away from it.By the same token, some people were positively hostile to the body. They should look at the terms of the Agreement and the functions of this body and ask themselves what threat there is in the establishment of a monitoring commission to report to the two Governments on the situation that exists on the ground in Northern Ireland with regard to paramilitarism and demilitarisation, or the political commitment within the institutions to making them work. If they are committed to the Agreement and to exclusively peaceful and democratic means what possible threat is there to their interest that such a body should now exist? I particularly ask the republican movement to co-operate fully with this body in future because it poses no threat to it. On the contrary, it is balanced and reasonable having regard to the interests republicans in Northern Ireland claim to represent.I thank Members for the interesting and stimulating debate we have had and I look forward to the early passage of this legislation.

In page 4, line 11, after "Minister" to insert ", subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance".We tabled a small number of amendments on this Stage not to seek in any way a radical altering of the Bill, but to be helpful in terms of its drafting. The legislation is useful in that it does not have the collection of verbiage contained in much legislation going through this House. It is clear, to the point and useful.In much legislation of this nature, where there is reference to the spending of moneys, it is usual that the sanction of the Minister for Finance would also be provided for where there is a likelihood that substantial moneys would be expended. The object of this amendment is that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be the person making such a decision with the consent of the Minister for Finance. If one surveys similar legislation, one will find this is a typical provision. What is involved depends very much on the amount of money that will be spent in terms of this commission. I understand it is to be funded on a 50-50 basis, but I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to this amendment. From our research, it is typical that the line Minister and the Minister for Finance would make decisions about expenditure of this nature.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	205	There has been a convention on this type of body which is being set up as a direct result of the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. Especially given the international dimension, the Minister for Finance is more disposed to take on trust the necessity for the expenditures involved and, in practice, does not intervene in institutions of this type. Therefore, I query the need for this amendment. I am not sure it would be a good idea to bring in more conventional Government accounting mechanisms to a body of this type.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Senator Mansergh is correct and I must reflect that Senator Brian Hayes's remarks are probably causing various people in the Department of Finance to fall off their chairs in amazement at the Opposition demanding that the Department of Finance's interests should be protected.It should be noted that section 4 deals with a number of elements concerning moneys, premises, facilities and services, including staff, as may be necessary for the proper functioning of the commission. It gives the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform broad licence to be supportive of the affairs of the commission and to give it staff, facilities and the like, as is necessary. However, all is not black from the point of view of the Department of Finance because section 11 states that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act, which would include all those elements, shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. My dash for freedom from the Minister for Finance has been short lived given that by the end of the Bill I am back on the leash.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I assure the Minister that the amendment was not provoked by a call to my office from the Minister for Finance at any given time.The commission will be a subhead in the Minister's Estimate of expenditure every year. Can he give a view on the total resources that will be given to the commission? I understand it will be established in Northern Ireland, presumably around Belfast. What level of staff resources will be provided to it?

Therefore, the Irish Government will contribute €1.5 million and the UK Government will contribute the sterling equivalent of €1.5 million.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 4, after line 42, to insert the following new subsection:"(5) Any immunity or privilege conferred by this Act or enjoyed under the Agreement shall only apply to acts or omissions–(a) in good faith, and (b) in the course of duty.”.This section sets out in a clear and precise way the immunities and privileges that will be granted to the commission, which are quite strong. A great degree of immunity and privilege in respect of this section has been conferred on the commission. The question must be asked as to whether such immunity or privilege is absolute in all cases. We believe immunity and privilege should be lost where a person acts in bad faith or where he or she does not act in the course of duty. We have considerable evidence that this precedent is typical in common law. The inclusion of the proposed subsection (5) would further clarify the position whereby the question of an absolute immunity or privilege in all cases would not hold sway in this scenario. It is clear from the section that a high degree of immunity already exists.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	210	This is an international body. The question of whether it could be susceptible to suit in the Irish courts is a serious one. If people began to take judicial review type remedies of mandamus ordering it to do things, certiorari quashing its reports or directing it by a court based injunction to exercise its functions in one way or another, it would cease to have the status of an international treaty organisation and rapidly become one which was effectively a domestic institution subject to the domestic law on either side of the Border.I should be careful about what I say but sometimes, particularly in Northern Ireland and I know southern lawyers are inventive, I am mindful that I have seen extraordinary judicial reviews unleashed in the northern context from time to time. I do not want a situation to develop where the members of the commission would find themselves fighting about their reports, procedures or conclusions in the courts either north or south of the Border. That is why the immunity is as far reaching.I fully accept that Senator Brian Hayes's research suggests that in many domestic common law institutions absolute privilege of this kind is not provided because it is required that people should act in good faith, without malice or other circumscribing pre-conditions for the immunity to persist. However, in this case it seems we should not lose sight of the fact that the decommissioning commission which currently exists and the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains have absolute immunity, which has also been conferred on this body. It might be very significantly misinterpreted if we were to give a lesser degree of protection from domestic suit to this commission than we have to those other commissions. Bearing in mind what I said about its international status, the result would be major political embarrassment if a case was to be launched by, say, loyalists against it in Northern Ireland, by republicans here in the South or by either combination in the courts requiring it to come to one conclusion rather than another or attempting to invalidate in terms of domestic law its conclusions or activities. On balance it is better to stick with the precedents established by statute for the Commission on Decommissioning and the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, and to provide the same degree of immunity for this commission as applies to these.

In effect, this says the same thing. Putting in the phrase “in good faith” raises or presumes situations arising in which people might not act in good faith. Some of the people involved come from outside this jurisdiction and are serving at the request of the Irish and British Governments, and the phrase in the amendment suggests that it is very possible they might not be acting in good faith in the course of their duties.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	212	That is very possible.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Arising from Dr. Mansergh's remarks, if one inserts the "in good faith" stipulation, one is saying to a judge of an Irish court on either side of the Border, in a Northern Ireland High Court or in a High Court in the South, that whether the commission is acting in good faith is a justiciable issue before that court. If one concedes it is a justiciable issue, one then gives the right of audience and a sort of curial opportunity to people to make a case that people are acting in bad faith, and to unleash legal attacks on them in the courts.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	215	They would have to provide evidence to substantiate such claims in court.

If they then said they had a reasonableness test, the case could be dragged out. In very many cases of judicial review which I have seen, efforts are made to bring matters which are, to use Senator Mansergh's term, for resolution on the political plane, onto a legal plane. If anyone has any illusions about this, a series of actions was commenced with a view to toppling the institutions in Northern Ireland by people who claimed that the British Government was acting in a way that did not conform with their desires. It is not at all fanciful to envisage that litigation would be thrown at the Independent Monitoring Commission to either embarrass it or prevent it from acting or reporting, or requiring it to report in a particular way or to invalidate its reports in some sense. In those circumstances Senator Mansergh is correct. This is an international body which operates on a diplomatic and political level and not within the purview of domestic litigation. If it falls into that latter category, all its activities will, going by past experience, be dogged by litigation, and this will embarrass rather than enhance the peace process.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	217	There is a caveat there which makes this subject to section 6, which clearly sets out areas where, in the performance of its functions, the commission shall not do anything that could be prejudicial to a number of areas. There are already protections there to obviate the need for Senator Hayes's amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I thank the Minister for Justice, Deputy McDowell, and the other Senators for the debate. No one is suggesting that the people to be appointed are not entirely independent or that they will be under the ownership of a government or a Department. It is important however that there is a degree of consistency in respect of any body of law we put in place in this House or the Lower House when it comes to privileges. I am minded to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Minister has informed me that the procedure outlined in section 5 is similar to that outlined for the Commission on Decommissioning and the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains. It is logical that there should be some consistency on the issues in all three commissions, but we should never sacrifice certainty for brevity. While the legislation is brief and to the point, usefully so in many ways, it is important that these principles are set out in legislation. Regarding the issue of evidence being sought in this jurisdiction as against another jurisdiction, we all have to comply with the basic rules of law. It would be useful for all bodies to do so. In view of what the Minister has said in terms of the other two bodies, I withdraw the amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 5, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following paragraph:"(a) compromise its political independence,”.We are proposing the insertion of a new clause whereby the independence of the commission could not be compromised by its political independence. In addition to the actions already listed in the section, it is vital that such a body does not compromise itself. It must remain absolutely independent of political activity as well as of everything else. Amending the legislation in this way will add greater definition and meaning to the existing section on the commission's duties. No one is suggesting that the commission will be anything other than politically independent, but this amendment will strengthen its hand when it goes about its business.

It might be regarded as not quite the done thing to agree to an amendment which in effect would amend Article 13(2). I have slightly better news for Senator Hayes regarding the next amendment and I ask him to withdraw this one.

This is an amendment with which I have a certain degree of sympathy, because there were situations in the past where the political independence of assessments of situations which might have been in breach of the Mitchell principles, for example, have been questioned or challenged. I accept the Minister's reasoning but in establishing bodies of this kind it is not a bad provision to bear at the back of one's mind. If such bodies are challenged on anything, it is very often their political independence.

There is a slight difference of nuance here. One could say someone shall be independent in the performance of his function and also say that his independence shall not be compromised. I see that point. At this stage, whatever sympathy I may have, Senator Brian Hayes was not sitting on my shoulder when the ink was drying on the Agreement and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 5, subsection (1), line 10, after "by him" to insert "for that purpose".This section deals with the flow of information from the Garda Síochána to the commission, where it requests it. There are grounds for the amendment proposed by the Opposition. As currently worded the Bill could empower any member of the Garda Síochána to give information to the commission, and that would not be a good thing. The amendment proposes that subsection 7(1) be amended to allow that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or a member of the Garda designated by the Commissioner "for that purpose may disclose to the Commission any information in the possession of the Garda Síochána which, in the opinion of the Commission, is necessary for performing its functions".The insertion of the words "for that purpose" designates a member of the force to give information. If information is to be handed over by the gardaí, it is essential that only those members specifically designated for that purpose are empowered to do so. The section as drafted seems to indicate that any member of the Garda who has been designated for any purpose could hand over that information. This matter needs to be clarified and I ask the Minister to respond positively to the amendment, which gives greater certainty as to the person who gives the information than is currently the case.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Senator Mansergh's earlier comment reminded me that it was possible that British forces might resort to subterfuge. If history has taught us anything it is that we should be vigilant in this area. While I support the advancement of better relations between the islands and between people North and South of the Border, I do not propose that we enter a state of political amnesia in this regard.What action should the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána take if he becomes aware of any such activities of a serious nature? Article 3 of the Agreement states that:The objective of the Commission is to carry out the functions as described in Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 of this Agreement with a view to promoting the transition to a peaceful society and stable and inclusive devolved Government in Northern Ireland.I thought my question was covered by that Article but Articles 4 to 7, inclusive seem to be predicated on paramilitary activity rather than anything else. However, on mature reflection, subsection 7(2) states:Nothing in any other enactment prohibits disclosure of relevant factual information either to or by the Commission.Should it happen – and I hope we will never encounter such a scenario – that British forces were involved in illegal activity, would it be open to the Garda to use this monitoring commission to bring that activity to its attention? That would be a real test of the independence of the commission, bearing in mind that we would have a representative on the commission and there would also be an American representative as well as someone from Northern Ireland who might have an interest in this also. Could the commission be used as a forum to deal with such a situation if it were to arise?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	232	Senator Walsh already made it clear that where a first reading of section 7 might give the impression to the casual reader that the disclosure of information was mandatory, it is not. It is discretionary. Therefore, a member of the Garda Síochána would not be in a position to give information which he or she believed was prejudicial to the interests of the State or threatened security, or if he or she had other good grounds for withholding that information. However, as the commission is a body based on confidence and good faith it is hoped that in the vast majority of cases it will seek information to which it is entitled and will treat it accordingly.There is a question here of what is sauce for the goose being sauce for the gander. We cannot ask that our Act contain provisions for the Garda Síochána which would not  be mirrored in the PSNI's activities regarding loyalist paramilitaries, for example. This cuts both ways.It must also be emphasised that the Garda Síochána, unlike police forces in neighbouring jurisdictions, is also a security service. The Garda Síochána does for Ireland what MI5 and the police forces do for Britain. We must recall that the Garda Síochána is not a regional constabulary but a national security service and, therefore, must be protected by the discretion contained in section 7.

On a previous amendment we were discussing the predication of possible lack of good faith to a new international body, one which includes a former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the recent former Chairman of the Northern Ireland Assembly. I said nothing which would imply that there had not been very serious incidents involving bad faith on the part of different security agencies, matters which are the subject of investigation by Judge Peter Cory and Mr. Justice Barron, among other matters.There have been some extremely serious incidents upon which I have very strong views, but I do not wish to have attributed to me any notion that I consider people in the past belonging to those bodies incapable of acting other than in good faith. My remarks were solely related to this body.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	234	There was a naiveté in cases over the years, such as the Garda Síochána putting its faith in giving information to the RUC. I recommend caution about being too trusting. It makes us out to be naive and a little gullible if we think that there are not other forces there. I draw the Minister's attention to the point that there are people in the system who want to undermine the peace process. There are people in security in Northern Ireland who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo and who do not want to see progress. The PSNI is evolving. There were times in the past when we put too much faith in the goodwill of the people on the other side. I am not generalising in that it applies to everybody, but there have been instances where we were naive. We gave Articles 2 and 3 away too quickly. We are not quick to demand a quid pro quo for Articles 2 and 3. My point is we seem to be very generous.

Either we support the Good Friday Agreement or we do not. We did not give the Articles away, we re-worded them in a way that reflects modern republicanism and it was supported in the end by every substantial party, north and south of the Border. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 which was the foundation of Northern Ireland as it existed over 60 years was repealed. We also had North-South bodies instituted. I do not understand how anybody who supports the Good Friday Agreement would say that we gave away Articles 2 and 3 too cheaply.

I do not wish to embroil myself in the row that is taking place on the other side of the House. I raised the issue of information on Second Stage and the Minister kindly replied. As I understand it, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland cannot investigate alleged incidents that occur to PSNI officers in Northern Ireland where information that is sought south of the Border cannot be given by the Garda authorities to the police ombudsman. That issue must be addressed. We all support the new dispensation on policing. We support the police ombudsman's work in investigating complaints made against officers. It is ludicrous that we cannot give information to the ombudsman in Northern Ireland where that information is sought by the Garda Síochána. I welcome the Minister's statement in his concluding remarks on Second Stage that the matter will be resolved in the context of new legislation concerning the Garda Síochána, but it also works the other way. We have a responsibility to ensure these new institutions work. We must change our legislative framework to ensure that information works on a two way basis.

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	240	We expected something back.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	241	—or the people of this State giving something away. The people of this State made a positive choice to re-articulate their stance on the national question in a manner which would underpin and strengthen the emergence and persistence of democratic values in Northern Ireland. One must see it in context. One of the implications of the pre-Good Friday Agreement situation was that as a matter of international law, the United Kingdom was also being asked to say that in certain circumstances it would give effect to the wishes of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland as to the status of that part of this island. If one looks at these matters in the round, one will see a balance and there is no betrayal of the ideal of Irish unity or of the quest for Irish unity in the newly rephrased Articles 2 and 3. On the contrary, they best represent what most people on this island regard that ideal as being in substance.There are people who are not in this House who have always rejected the 1937 Constitution and always decried it and said it was of no binding moral or legal significance. The alternative view was that the people of this part of the island were saying to the people of Northern Ireland that if there was to be Irish unity, it would be on our terms, under our Constitution. It was not a question of take it or leave it, they could simply lump it. That was the original implication of Articles 2 and 3. There was a reference to the right of the Government established under that Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of the territory. The only basis on which the southern Government can exercise jurisdiction is in accordance with the 1937 Constitution, so in effect it was a claim to impose the 1937 Constitution on the whole of the island, regardless of the wishes of a majority of people in Northern Ireland.Those, including Senator Mansergh, who worked on the Good Friday Agreement put in place a delicate architecture which was balanced. It is not delicate in the sense of being a china ornament which can be easily smashed when the bulls enter the china shop. It is a robust statement of the realities between the peoples of these islands which is that the status of Northern Ireland is now to be decided by the people of Northern Ireland, by their solemn choice. Both peoples on these islands, if I may use that round phrase about them, have solemnly agreed as between themselves that such is the way forward. This is not a sterile, antiseptic proposition of international law but part of an organic agreement, the rest of which is set out in the Belfast Agreement. It is a carefully balanced international agreement which gives rise to partnership and equality in Northern Ireland and which is designed to give both communities in Northern Ireland the dignity of expressing their communal values and loyalties in circumstances where the other community cannot take that away from them. There are North-South balancing institutions and east-west balancing institutions which are all part of a complex political arrangement.I do not agree with Senator White's view that we have given it away or that it has been given away for nothing. I do not believe we have given anything away. If it was wished to submit the claim to international arbitration in The Hague, there was nothing to stop us signing up to that provision and seeing how far that claim would have availed us. We must be realistic. I would prefer to take a positive view of these issues. The ending of the sterile claim to impose the 1937 Constitution without consent has been replaced by something much more challenging, viable, attractive and consistent with what in my view impels Irish republicans, among whom I count myself, to strive for over time. It is not a question of giving something of value away; it is a question of putting something much more valuable in its place. I do not know how I got distracted from discussing the amendment.

We should not get into our heads the notion that the Good Friday Agreement has been betrayed, traduced, minimised or cast aside. It is the agenda for the future and will be implemented. It is the only show in town. Its strength lies in the fact that both Governments are totally committed to it. I am glad that, notwithstanding the election results in Northern Ireland, it was a clear demonstration by 70% of the voters there that they support pro-Agreement parties.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	246	As a nation we acquiesced promptly to the change to Articles 2 and 3 but I do not think that was reciprocated by other parties to the Agreement. Mr. Trimble did not sell the Agreement to his community vigorously enough. I am entitled to my opinion. We were enthusiastic and optimistic that the pace would be much quicker. I am disappointed that the institutions are not in action. At the moment, the heart is out of the Agreement in many ways.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I would put a slightly more positive construction on Articles 2 and 3 in the context of the 1937 Constitution and subsequently, than the Minister. They were a denial of legitimacy to Northern Ireland in circumstances where the balancing elements in the 1921 settlement had all been removed and, in particular, the Boundary Commission which turned out, effectively, to be a complete fraud. It was reasonable for us to maintain that denial of legitimacy until such time as we had a comprehensive settlement, as in the Good Friday Agreement, which dealt with all the issues and concerns we had. I can understand Senator White and, indeed, many other people feeling disappointment at this particular point and perhaps asking themselves whether our participation was worthwhile, or if we sold our cards too cheaply. One has got to take the medium and long-term views. I remember making a mental note to myself in the shrubbery outside Stormont when I went for a walk to clear my head at 7 a.m. on Good Friday in 1998. I could see political trench warfare as far as the eye could see. Many obstacles have been worked through and there will probably be more. Nonetheless, it is an extremely worthwhile project and we should not allow ourselves to become depressed and despondent.At lunch time I was talking to a member of the victorious party in the Northern Assembly elections and, needless to say, he does not take a gloomy view of current conditions. In fact, he sees positive advantages in the DUP having to take some responsibility and face some hard choices because the responsibility is now at their door. I urge Members of the House and the public who are tempted to become despondent in the present situation to keep their confidence. As the Minister said, there is no alternative project anywhere in sight that would remotely get agreement among the parties. It is a question of finding the way this will work. I have no doubt whatsoever that it will work; the only difficulty is that I cannot say in how many weeks or months, or whether it will take more than a year. I have absolute confidence, however, that it will happen.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	248	The debate is interesting and has developed beyond the section. It probably goes to the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, from which many benefits have flowed. Equally, however, people have reservations, some of which I share. I never saw Britain as having a legal, moral or any other type of justification for being in Northern Ireland. Articles 2 and 3 provided a certain bulwark with regard to that and I fully accept what the Minister has said. In one of the briefing sessions we had in the lead up to the Good Friday Agreement I made the point that while both articles had been there for 60 years, they had not advanced the cause of Irish unity by one iota in the interim. Perhaps if they had been tested in the courts, as the Minister said, they may not have proved to be of any tremendous benefit. In recognising the constitutional position, we are legitimising what I, and I am sure most Irish people, would not have seen as being legitimate in the past. When one refers to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, our laws acknowledge, de facto, a legal status which I do not think they are entitled to have. I make that distinction because I think the British have no right to be in Northern Ireland. However, I fully subscribe to the notion that to achieve a united Ireland we must have a majority in Northern Ireland who will come that distance with us to unite the people, in the words of John Hume. That is what he aimed to do – it is a unification of the people rather than the land. I have had this discussion with Unionists, including some DUP people. I told them that the last thing I would like to see happening in a united Ireland was a large proportion of the majority community in the North not subscribing to it and perhaps emigrating. That would be a huge loss.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	249	That is very generous of the Senator.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	252	The extent of that step on our part was far greater than anybody acknowledged in the past.My earlier question about section 7(2) concerned MI5 and MI6, to which the Minister referred. To take a hypothetical situation, they might in future get up to nefarious activities in the State or in Northern Ireland where their activities would be totally contrary to the stability of the peace process, which is the declared objective of Article 3 of this exercise. In that scenario, assuming the commission is composed of people of the utmost integrity and absolutely independent of all political sides, is it a forum through which such activities could be investigated and adjudicated upon, in the same way as is done with the paramilitaries? I do not make a distinction between the terrorism and activities of loyalist or republican paramilitaries and activities by the apparatus of the state. If anything activities by the state are worse because the state has a specific obligation, over and above everybody else, to adhere to laws. That was the question in respect of section 6.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	253	Now that we are all opening our hearts, I will make one or two brief comments. This is an interesting debate. I was always in favour of amending Articles 2 and 3 because I believed they were illegitimate. I have always accepted that there have been two states on the island of Ireland since the historic agreement in 1921. The reality is that whatever one thought of Articles 2 and 3 at the time, they were, for many people in Northern Ireland, an illegitimate claim on the sovereign territory of Northern Ireland which is part of the United Kingdom. I hope I am quoting him correctly when I say that Senator Walsh said the British have no right to be in Northern Ireland.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	254	No moral, legal or—

We must come to terms with the many people who regard themselves as exclusively British or Irish, or British-Irish. That is why I always felt that Articles 2 and 3 were repugnant to the very notion of reconciliation that should logically exist on the island of Ireland. That was shown to be the case when the McGimpsey brothers brought their case and the constitutional imperative argument was put to them by the Supreme Court. Most people in the Republic did not realise there was a constitutional imperative about reuniting both parts of the island because they knew it was unenforceable, impossible and illegal. That was reflected ultimately in the settlement arrived at after Good Friday.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 5, line 40, after "Oireachtas", to insert "within 1 month of receipt".We propose in this amendment to impose a timeframe as to when the Minister must bring a report from the commission before the Houses of the Oireachtas. As currently drafted, section 10 states that the Minister shall, after consultation with the Government, bring such a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas. Our amendment proposes that that report would be given to the Houses of the Oireachtas within one month of receipt by the Government.It is important that where a report, which might be embarrassing either for political parties or Governments, comes into the possession of the Government, that information would be put on the public record and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within one month. We have seen examples in Northern Ireland in particular where reports have laid on desks unpublished to ensure that the political situation was not made more difficult. I appreciate that but we are attempting to put a timeframe around this. That would be a useful way of ensuring that the Houses of the Oireachtas get this information as soon as possible. We suggest the one month timeframe is not unduly restrictive.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	269	If I could briefly indicate a negative attitude towards this amendment, there may be occasions when reports come to hand in regard to which the two Governments may decide, for one reason or another, that to publish them within a month would not be helpful to the whole process. Obviously I would hope that the great majority of reports would not be in that category but there may be occasions when it is necessary to act in that way and the advice available to me, which I believe is correct, is that it would be foolish to tie myself down to a situation of that kind in circumstances where there could be unforeseen adverse consequences. Whereas I fully agree with the Senator that it is generally preferable that timeframes be put on reports, many reports from many sources under statute appear to take a good deal of time before they come before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is one in which there is a genuine, as opposed to a spurious, interest of the Executive in allowing some degree of flexibility because I can imagine circumstances in which it would be decided that a particular report was not to be published within time.

One month is unnecessarily constrictive but whether one is talking about domestic politics or the North, issues can arise that are highly embarrassing, unhelpful and so on, which if suppressed and sat on indefinitely has a festering effect on public confidence. A great deal of caution has to be exercised. I accept that the exact timing of reports is a matter for the Government to judge but it would be a bad principle that reports should be sat upon indefinitely. There are times when the public and Government, and we can see this with some of the tribunals established in the security area, must face up to very unpleasant and unpalatable facts. In the last analysis, a democracy cannot shirk from that.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	271	One of the provisions in the Schedule which caught my eye was that the commission would be expected to publish reports as and when required and, in any event, at least every six months.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The section deals with Articles 4, 5 and 6 as laid down in the Agreement. Article 4 concerns paramilitary activity. Article 5 deals with the responsibility of the British Government concerning demilitarisation, and Article 6 concerns a complaint made by a political party within the Assembly if a Member of the Assembly has breached the pledge of office. Am I right in saying there is nothing of particular embarrassment to the Irish Government in any of this? Articles 4, 5 and 6 are external features. They are not to do with our failure or bad will and I do not understand how there would be a difficulty in ensuring a speedy publication of the report. I am mindful of what the Minister said concerning a potential negative but they are negatives of external forces, be they paramilitary parties, the British Government or individual Members of the Assembly. They have nothing to do with the Irish Government, as such.

In page 6, subsection (2), line 3, to delete "shall come" and substitute "comes".This is the last amendment.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I thank the Minister. Two out of six is not bad.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The Schedule refers to the agreement between the British and Irish Governments. Article 6 states the commission may consider a claim by any party represented in the Assembly. As the Minister is aware, the configuration following the election result includes an independent member of the Assembly elected, I understand, on a hospital action campaign. Does Article 6 preclude this member of the Assembly from making a complaint to the commission on the basis that he is not a member of a party represented in the Assembly?

It is probable that the member in question could constitute himself as a technical group or something similar. A person can be a party to an agreement and I presume a generous view will be taken in this regard. If we consider the Technical Group in the Dáil, there may also be one in this House—
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	283	It is not a registered political party.

The word "party" in this context is probably closer to the meaning of being party to an agreement than to a political party.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I thank the Minister and Senator Mansergh for clarifying the matter.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	288	Without any pretence at being disorderly, I thank Senators for facilitating the passage of the Bill and debating it so thoroughly and scrupulously. I also thank Senator Brian Hayes for his party's amendments. I tend to agree with Senator Mansergh, rather than Senator Brian Hayes, on the legitimacy or illegitimacy of Articles 2 and 3, which, like Senator Mansergh, I regard as having been put in place to put in contest the status of Northern Ireland, rather than to make a serious grab at Northern Ireland. The terms of the articles are now immeasurably better than previously because they reflect what I, as a republican, believe to be the reality of the position.One must also remember that as a matter of international law, Northern Ireland is not the same as Scotland, Wales or anywhere else, but a portion of this island, the status of which is determined by its people alone. This is significantly different even from Scotland and other areas to which Westminster power has been devolved on the island of Britain. From that point of view, this change has not been given away for nothing, but is a concession or compromise on the part of the United Kingdom of enormous significance. It is not simply a matter of a choice as to the status of Northern Ireland taken one afternoon in Westminster. Instead, it is a matter of international law laid down in a treaty now registered with the United Nations that the future of Northern Ireland is decided by a majority of its people, a crucial change of which one should never lose sight.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The House should thank the Minister for accommodating a wide ranging and interesting debate that has shown the importance of this issue which goes to the core of the body politic. It is good to have views such as those expressed today aired in the House. We could not finish on a better note than the Minister's last point.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I thank the Minister for his generosity in facilitating two of our six amendments. It is important we wish the new commission well. Its members have a difficult job to do and their work and recommendations will be important because they have a certain expertise in counter-terrorism and security matters, which we should not underestimate. The key to this issue is to forever remove the gun from Irish politics. This is the route for constitutional parties to take. Paramilitary parties must now sunder their relationship with illegal organisations. If this is done and we achieve a measure of agreement, the future is possible for the hardest men and women on both sides of the community in Northern Ireland.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I ask the Minister for Education and Science to provide the House with an update regarding the urgent need for a sports hall for Palmerstown community school and the community of Palmerstown. This sports hall was scheduled by the Department of Education and Science to be built by 2001 as part of an initiative involving the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Education and Science. It was one of six sports halls that were to be provided under the drugs task force initiative. In addition, it was required by the school because it was one of the remaining community schools without such a facility. I understand there are only three community schools that do not have a sports hall. Many new schools include such a facility. I require an update from the Minister on this matter.This is one of six schools where sports halls were to be provided under the drugs task force initiative, but only one of them has gone ahead. I realise the Minister will not be able to give that information to me today, but two schools relatively close to where I live, which are not under the terms of the drugs task force initiative, received approval for sports halls. Obviously those sports halls were needed, but it is worrying that something that was considered necessary for the community under this particular project left Palmerstown community school on the long finger. It is also a concern that only one out of six has gone ahead.I am a member of the board of management of Palmerstown community school. I will be attending my last meeting tomorrow as I have tendered my resignation with effect from next January. I wanted to make it clear that I am on the board of management, but as a local public representative and as someone who lives near the area, I believe it is an important local issue. Palmerstown does not have that type of facility for the community. It does not have a community centre or anything like it. It was not just the hopes of the school that were raised regarding the provision of the sports hall. There was also a hope in the community that it would have access to it in some way. This matter was agreed and negotiated with the local community and with the school's board of management. The community has lost out in respect of this facility so it is urgent that the sports hall gets the go ahead, as previously promised. I look forward to the Minister's response.

The criteria used for selecting projects was also published for the first time.The proposed sports hall project at Palmerstown community school is listed in section six of the 2003 school building programme. I am pleased to inform the Senator and the House that the architectural design of the project has advanced to stage five – pre-tender documents – of architectural planning. The proposed refurbishment and roof repairs project at the school is listed in section seven of the 2003 school building programme. This project is at stage one – initial sketch scheme – of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band two rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large scale projects.The Department of Education and Science intends to publish details of the 2004 school building programme by early January at the latest. The programme will clarify what progress is planned for projects, such as the proposed hall, refurbishment works and roof repairs for Palmerstown community school during 2004. I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House.The Seanad adjourned at 5.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 December 2003.
