The commencement date will not be before 1 January 2006 because we must recruit staff, establish offices and perform many other related tasks. I am giving the matter some consideration and I will confer with the Hayes group as to whether I should establish the ombudsman commission in shadow form prior to the establishment date in order to ensure that it hits the ground running.

For example, if the commission were to employ someone or enter a contract, the contract would be with the commission and not with individuals who could change over time. If one has a group of three or even if one has a single person who is personally liable on a contract, all sorts of complications arise if that person changes. Are contracts made in the name of the person as a corporation sole or as an individual? That is the thinking.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I move amendment No. 67:
In page 40, subsection (1), lines 25 and 26, to delete "3 members, all of whom are" and substitute "one member who is".This is the basic point that arises regarding the ombudsman. All of us have been impressed by the good example and precedent set in Northern Ireland by Nuala O'Loan. That is a one person office which has been highly effective. If we wish to be as effective, should we not follow what appears to be a worthy precedent? It has been suggested that by having three people involved, it could dilute the office and, to some degree, possibly render it less effective. It would be — I should choose my words carefully — less strident in discharging its functions. I have been impressed with Nuala O'Loan's performance in Northern Ireland as a single ombudsman. This precedent should be given consideration in the decision on whether to run with a multi-member commission.The purpose of amendment No. 69 is to deal with the question of who may be appointed a member of the Ombudsman Commission. We should ensure that vacancies are advertised outside the State as there is a case for highlighting and underlining the independence and standing of the ombudsman or commission, as the case may be. Its independence could be enhanced by opening up membership to individuals from outside the State. The reason I tabled the amendment is to create circumstances in which a person from outside the State could apply.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The first question to arise from these amendments is why the commission should have three members. We have discussed previously with the Minister the reason he, given that no one else believes an ombudsman is anything other than one person, opted for a three member commission. The Minister has decided to establish a commission, a body corporate consisting of three members which, as a structure, does not appear to be as accessible or immediate as the single ombudsman model established in other domains to provide a service to the public.The Ombudsman Commission will not be as effective because it will have three members. The Minister previously stated that if he had opted to have one person, the Opposition would have argued for a three, four or five person commission. That would not have been the case. There is a perfectly efficient, effective and workable model in Northern Ireland. When a specific model is seen to operate effectively in another jurisdiction, it is always preferable to consider using it rather than rowing out into uncharted waters by introducing a new model.It is seldom that machinery of this nature works effectively. The danger with all such structures is that they may become bogged down by bureaucracy and inscrutability and develop defensive mechanisms rather than providing the transparency and accountability that is sought. It is essential to have a person who is prominent and identifiable because bodies of this nature must not have any degree of anonymity. The danger of having a tripartite commission — a triumvirate including one woman — is that it will lack a clear identity. This would be damaging, given that the purpose of the exercise is to have a clear mechanism that is answerable and seen to be answerable. It is a shame the Minister did not opt for the existing model of ombudsman and reap the benefits of what has already been seen to work.The same principle applies with regard to my amendment. I do not want an anonymous chairperson. It would be preferable, therefore, that the chair be identified at the point at which the commission is established and its members appointed by the President, rather than having an anonymous committee of three which may or may not have a chair. The latter approach would create confusion and a lack of clarity in the operation of the commission. If the chairman is appointed by the President for the duration of the commission's term, at least there would be an identifiable person who would be expected to speak on its behalf. As matters stand, we will have a commission of three persons, none of whom will be directly responsible.While it is difficult to get answers directly from a commission, it is much easier to get them from a person. If a chairperson were to be appointed by the President, it would confer an important function on the person in question and, by having an identifiable person who would be answerable in a transparent fashion, help make the improvements we seek. The chairperson would effectively be expected to act as spokesperson for the commission in matters of public concern and as the point of contact for the public. The old question of who to call when one wants to contact Europe arises in this context. Who will one call when one wants to contact the commission? It is not transparent to call a committee. If my amendment were accepted, it would sharpen the commission.

The latter would be more focused and would, I hope, replicate the great work of Nuala O'Loan who has set the standard for the office of the ombudsman of the Garda Síochána. Reaching that standard will be a difficult task. We should set as our minimum objective the effectiveness of the office of Nuala O'Loan.During the debate on this section, I will table amendments required to ensure that an ombudsman rather than an ombudsman commission will be established. The main issue is that the Minister must ensure that adequate resources are made available to the ombudsman or, in the event that he is unwilling to accept our amendments, the Ombudsman Commission to guarantee that the functions provided for under section 60 can be carried out in full and that investigations or inquiries which may become necessary are conducted as efficiently, effectively and quickly as possible in a manner that ensures the public will have full confidence in the procedures in question. This has not been the case — if it ever was — with regard to the Garda Complaints Board in recent years. The reason the Minister must ensure sufficient moneys are allocated to the ombudsman is that the Human Rights Commission is underfunded and under-resourced. We do not want another body which is tasked with representing the public, inquiring, investigating and upholding its rights without sufficient funds to carry out its full duties.I have a number of amendments with which I will deal as we come to each section. I support amendments Nos. 67 to 69, inclusive and hope the Minister will consider accepting them.On section 58, the Ombudsman Commission should be appointed by the President on the recommendation of an independent advisory body rather than plucked out of thin air. It is not stated who will make the recommendation. It is to be decided by the Government. If the Ombudsman Commission is to enjoy the confidence of the public, the more independence it has from the Garda Síochána and the Government of the day the better. Those within and outside the Garda Síochána will have faith in the ability of the commission to examine each complaint with which it will deal if its functions are fully independent and it is as accountable and transparent as possible.

On the issue of policing and the Ombudsman Commission, we must face up to the reality that we need radical reform of policing services on the island in both jurisdictions. We also need radical and progressive change which should be an urgent priority, as we have seen in recent days. We need quality policing, professionalism and people who like and respect the job. We also need accountability. There is an historic consensus here today in that we have heard people from all parties praising Ms Nuala O'Loan. All the people on this island respect the job she is doing and have confidence in her.It is important, in respect of the Ombudsman Commission, that the public sees professionalism, accountability and quality policing. I feel very strongly that if some of the ideas in amendment No. 68 are taken on board, community respect for the Garda Síochána will increase and accountability spread. Last night I received a telephone call from Mr. Frank McBrearty Junior. Listening to him on the telephone I could hear how distressed and traumatised he was by his particular case. We should remind ourselves that there are such cases. It is important to have the Ombudsman Commission in order that the people will get the quality police service they deserve but also to ensure the Garda Síochána will be seen to get a fair hearing. That is why I support amendment No. 68 and believe it is so important.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	10	In deciding on a three-person commission the Government was influenced by a number of considerations. First, contrary to what is suggested in some commentaries, three-person or multi-person commissions are usual. They are in place in Canada and Great Britain. It is not as if there is something egregious or unusual about the idea of setting up a multi-person commission. Commission members are entitled to go away on holiday or foreign trips. The commission need not grind to a halt if one of its members is indisposed or undergoing surgical treatment. There are very good reasons there should be more than one person in the job. Nothing I say is intended to detract in any way from the merits of Ms Nuala O'Loan. However, there are compensating advantages to having more than one person on the commission.Commentators have different views. An article written by a barrister in the Irish Law Times states that having three persons making important decisions is a more accountable method than having only one person. I fully accept that one person has a stronger brand image in principle. However, having three for a job of this size, complexity and responsibility is better if we can afford it. That is why we are having a three-person model.On Deputy Costello's amendment, I am disposed to accept its principle. It is desirable that one of the members of the commission should be its titular head and act as chair in that capacity. I could accept the Deputy's amendment except that a few consequential amendments would have to flow from it. I ask him, therefore, to take on board that I accept the principle of his amendment and will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to give effect to it. It is desirable that there should be a chairperson of the commission.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's last amendment provides that vacancies should be filled by advertising within and outside the State and encouraged from persons outside the State. I wonder if there is a misprint because I do not know what that means. It obviously meant something but perhaps somebody's handwriting was unintelligible. I make the general point that proceeding by way of advertisement is not very desirable because there are many who would be prepared to act if approached by the Government but who, for whatever reason, do not want to enter into an open and transparent competition and do not want it known that they are prepared to act. If, for example, we were to appoint a judge, would we want it known that members of the Judiciary applied and were rejected? Would that be a good idea? Prominent solicitors and barristers might not want it known that they had applied for a position and had been rejected.

I am convinced, from my experience, that the process of operating by competition is sometimes entirely negative. Those who would be willing to take the job if they were offered it might be people who would never dream of responding to a newspaper advertisement, just as there are some who write to newspapers but there are others who believe it is a sign of madness.

I enjoy newspaper letters and I am not one of that school.We have provided that the Government will nominate, that resolutions will have to be passed by both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann recommending the appointment of the persons concerned and that they will be appointed formally by the President, as would be the case regarding the Ombudsman. In addition, in considering the nomination of a person, the Government shall satisfy itself that the person has the appropriate experience, qualifications, training or expertise for appointment to a body having the functions of the commission. Likewise, as regards the seniority of the position, the salary which the post of chairperson at least will attract and the fact that a Superior Court judge will be eligible for the job are strong signals that this is a serious position. The position will not be given a salary level which would indicate that it was being downgraded in any way. These features of the proposal are sensible.The Government is satisfied that a three person commission is appropriate and has continuity. One will not find oneself in the position that if a member becomes seriously ill, the entire system will be thrown into confusion. The Government wants three people on the commission because it is internationally usual to have more than one person in such a position.I agree with Deputy Costello's amendment. While there is nothing to prevent the Government from placing an advertisement in a newspaper or elsewhere, I am not keen on the idea that the only way to become an ombudsman is to reply to an advertisement. This would not be a happy position, nor would it necessarily produce the best candidates. Specifically, it would not be desirable to have Superior Court judges making job applications and being rejected in public.

I will consider the Minister's comments and withdraw the amendment, although I may reinstate it on Report Stage. With regard to a three person commission, has the Minister considered what will be the position in the event of a disagreement arising between its members? Will the chairperson have a casting vote or will a majority decision be acceptable in the event of disagreement on a fundamental issue?I am glad Deputy Costello's amendment has been accepted, given the necessity to have a nominal head who is primus inter pares. His proposal offers a good solution and I am delighted it has made headway.I will not press my amendments on the method of filling vacancies. I am laying down a marker because I have some concerns about certain appointments made to a number of bodies by the Government. I do not want the commission to be filled in the same way that prison visiting committees have been filled, although I admit my concerns in this regard relate more to the Minister's predecessor. Having observed appointments to bodies such as the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, it strikes me that in many instances the main qualification appears to be membership of a cumann of a certain party. I am not sure what is the equivalent of a Fianna Fáil Party cumann in the Progressive Democrats.

Head-hunting must be genuine to ensure we have a commission which everyone can support, which will be clearly independent and of which we can be proud. I am happier that any such appointment must be approved by a resolution placed before the Houses, which is in contrast to appointments to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. I am laying down a marker in this regard because this is an important appointment from the perspective of the Garda Síochána and the general public. I will not press the amendment.

I do not wish to dwell in any way improperly on appointments made in the past but if people check my record they will see that I have appointed members of every political party and none to judicial office in a way that nobody from the parties opposite has ever equalled. Nobody has equalled the extent to which I have been neutral in the question of judicial appointments.I am touched, in particular, by the Deputy's reference to prison visiting committees because I have appointed members of such committees at the request of members of the Fine Gael Party. That point may be unknown to the Deputy but I remind him of a letter he wrote to Nora Owen when she was in my job asking that a member of Skibbereen Town Council be appointed to a prison visiting committee in Dublin or preferably somewhere north. The word "north" was followed by an exclamation mark.

I welcome his acceptance of my amendment. However, while it is a good amendment, it is not great because it would be better to delete reference to appointing three members. If a one member ombudsman's office were appointed, my amendment would not be necessary. That said, I will not look a gift horse in the mouth. The appointment of a chairperson by the President will strengthen the commission and give it greater focus. It is preferable to having an anonymous three member commission in which it would be difficult to determine issues such as responsibility and who exactly speaks for it.I have a query regarding the process which is, by and large, good in terms of the nomination by the Government and appointment by the President. As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe stated, it does not involve a prior selection process, as such, but it does involve the passage of resolutions by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann recommending the appointment. Might that create a potential problem in the future? I am not stating it is not good that it should go before the Dáil and Seanad. What if one of the three members being proposed is criticised by either the Dáil or Seanad? We must consider the type of action they will have to take, the role they will play. Their roles and functions are extremely sensitive. They will be sitting in judgment on alleged misbehaviour by members of the Garda Síochána.It would be difficult to make an appointment without even one party in the House raising questions about one of the members because of the nature of the work concerned. That would seem to suggest the need for a consultative process which would operate between the Government and the Opposition prior to a name being put forward in the House and, possibly, that there also be a selection process in respect of the three persons nominated for appointment. The Minister would, therefore, be in a position to strongly defend that process in that there would be some independent element to it. He or she could outline the process and indicate the names of those to be considered by the Houses for appointment. If it is simply left to a nomination by the Government, however, it is inevitable, as is the way of matters of this nature, that a Member of one of the Houses will make an allegation about one of the nominees. That might give rise to questions which could damage the commission.My second point was also made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. It seems that the Bill makes provision for matters to be decided individually by members of the commission. Does it do so? It is not quite clear. Must the commission act unanimously or will a majority decision suffice? If the dissenting member of the commission had previously been mentioned in one of the Houses, the Minister could experience difficulties in terms of how a decision was made. While the legislation provides for confidentiality, the Minister knows the way these matters develop. It is not always possible to ensure watertight confidentiality in respect of an issue.

The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is one person, namely, Mrs. Nuala O'Loan. She takes holidays and her office continues the work required. It is the title that is being granted. The office is obviously the body which will take on most of the work, rather than the individual who is in charge. I am not sure. Perhaps the easiest way would be to make it a one person commission. It would avoid some of the conflicts and dissenting voices to which Deputy Costello referred.On the question of how somebody will be nominated or identified to apply for the position, it should be a public process involving an advertisement outlining specific criteria. The Government should encourage individuals it believes are capable of doing or preferable for the job to apply in the belief that those people would come through that process with flying colours. If some of the judges applied, perhaps it would be a reality check for them if they were rejected. Solicitors and many others could look at that.

That should not deter the Dáil or Seanad from passing the resolution or from endorsing them, if Members believe the person is the most ideal for the job. It is more than likely that it will be similar to many other resolutions in that it will be taken without debate and rubber-stamped.

The fact that somebody could have something bad said about him or her in the course of a debate applies equally to the current procedure in the case of the Ombudsman. When I previously served as an Opposition Deputy, I recall, on the occasion of one Ombudsman's appointment, querying not the personal qualities of the individual concerned but his background and history. The instance to which I refer — I make no secret of it — was that of the appointment of Mr. Kevin Murphy as Ombudsman. I felt, perhaps rightly or wrongly, that it was not a good practice for a senior official of the Department of Finance to be appointed to that position and I made that view clear in the Dáil. As usual, nobody listened to me. I do not know whether I was right or wrong. It is a matter of judgment afterwards. It never stopped me from having a robust and cordial relationship with Mr. Murphy. I did not make comments impugning his personal character.One must bear in mind that if a Government was tempted to appoint somebody who was unsuitable, it would have to bear in mind that the person would have to run the gauntlet of scrutiny. If the appointment was in any way egregious, there could be serious criticism. That would deter a Government from coming up with somebody who would not be a consensus candidate for the position.

I considered whether a policeman coming from another force should be excluded. However, there is nothing objectionable about a provision allowing for such an individual to join the commission. I believe the balance is right in this area. The public would be sceptical if a former garda of rank became a member of the commission. I want to underline the independence of the commission. I do not want to exclude the possibility of, for example, an American police commissioner being appointed to it.

The President of the Human Rights Commission is paid a High Court judge's salary. A serving judge can be appointed to the Human Rights Commission. It is a signal to the Department of Finance that it cannot decide that once the Bill is passed, the remuneration will be set at a principal officer's salary level. It is a convention that if the position is one to which a superior court judge can be appointed, then the salary for a full-time member of the commission will be at the level of that paid to a superior court judge.

There is an in-built recognition that the three members will not make decisions at all times.

The section provides that the commission can act notwithstanding one or more vacancies among its members. A situation could arise where a member died suddenly. In such circumstances, a serious investigation may require a decision by the commission. By not having such a provision, the commission would be paralysed until the Houses of the Oireachtas approved a successor.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I move amendment No. 70:
In page 42, subsection (2), between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:"(d) to prosecute summarily members of the Garda Síochána where it decides to do so,”.Section 60 provides for the objectives, functions and powers of the commission. Section 60(2) outlines these various functions, such as receiving complaints, carrying out its duties and issuing guidelines. This amendment will include a function for the commission to prosecute summarily members of the Garda where it decides to do so. This is to prevent the commission handing over to the Director of Public Prosecutions the entire decision-making process as to who will or will not be prosecuted.The Director of Public Prosecutions does not have to explain his reasons for making such a decision. I am not sure if the same is the case with the Ombudsman. However, the authority of the Ombudsman Commission should allow it to prosecute in summary cases and make the decision as to what cases are appropriate to go before the courts. It is not necessary to refer every case to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Minister is anxious to put a structure in place where the Director of Public Prosecutions is the sole prosecution agent on behalf of the State. That is fine in theory. In this instance, however, an office is being established which must have transparent and accountable mechanisms. The decision taken by the commission must be seen to be clear. If every case passed to the ombudsman is subsequently passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the role and authority of the ombudsman's office will be weakened. It would be strengthened by allowing the ombudsman, having examined a complaint against an individual member of the Garda Síochána and reached the conclusion that the case should be summarily prosecuted, to make a decision.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I am not attracted to the idea of the Ombudsman Commission being a prosecutor. I have considered this point previously. Members of the Garda Síochána are entitled to the same rights as everybody else. We must all abide by the Director of Public Prosecution's decision in a matter and members of the Garda Síochána should have the right to be prosecuted by an independent prosecutor and not by a person who had already investigated a matter and reached conclusions which he or she publicly stated. In my opinion, members of the Garda Síochána would view that as unfair.What would happen if the Ombudsman Commission took a particular direction that was publicly known and then tried to prosecute people in the courts? It might be embarrassing for the courts to deal with matters wherein the ombudsman commission acts as prosecutor. I would prefer if everybody appearing before the District Court under this legislation does so because the DPP believes a prosecution should be brought.

Can we take it then that cases referred to the DPP will be a matter of public knowledge? Section 60(2)(d) states “in appropriate cases, to report the results of its investigations under Part 4 to the Garda Commissioner or to the Director of Public Prosecutions and, if it reports to the Director, to send him or her a copy of each investigation file.” I would have thought the only reason a report would be made to the Director of Public Prosecutions would be for the purpose of recommending prosecution. Why is this line of communication between the Ombudsman, Garda Commissioner and the DPP being put in place if it is only “in appropriate cases” that the Ombudsman Commission must report the results of an investigation? What are appropriate cases? Are they cases where it is expected court or disciplinary action will be taken? What will happen to the other cases?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Section 93(2) states:(2) If the Ombudsman Commission, after considering the designated officer's report, is of the opinion that the conduct under investigation may constitute an offence by the member of the Garda Síochána it shall—(a) send a copy of the report and of the investigation file to the Director of Public Prosecutions together with any recommendations that appear to the Commission to be appropriate and,(b) at the Director’s request, provide him or her with any information relating to the investigation that appears to the Director to be necessary for performing his or her functions under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974.Section 89 is concerned with cases where the recommendation is to take disciplinary action. I want to make it clear that I am not removing the authority of the Garda Commissioner as the fons et origo of discipline in the force. There were suggestions that he or she should not be the person who makes disciplinary decisions. I do not want it to be the case that some disciplinary actions are taken in circumstances wherein it might be perceived by the public that the Commissioner was not going along with the process. If the Commissioner was seen to be distancing himself or herself from disciplinary action taken against members of the Garda, that would be extremely damaging to the sense of discipline within the force. Discipline must be a unified, coherent code. I am strong on the issue of discipline. We cannot allow a situation whereby when disciplinary proceedings are being initiated, the Commissioner is seen to be distancing himself or herself from that process. That would undermine discipline in the Garda Síochána.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I accept the Minister's points on sections 80 and 93. In appropriate cases, a report of the results of an investigation will be sent to the Garda Commissioner and in other cases a report will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Are cases referred to places other than the Garda Commissioner and DPP? Section 89 relates to matters of discipline under the disciplinary regulations of the Garda Síochána. Section 93 relates to cases likely to be dealt with by the courts and with which the Director of Public Prosecutions would deal.Will cases which will not require disciplinary action or which will involve judicial proceedings be contained in reports on shelves in the Ombudsman's office or will they be brought to the attention of any other body? Should all reports, whether involving disciplinary proceedings or taken by the DPP, not be sent to the Commissioner? All cases should be accounted for by way of report. It is only in appropriate cases that the ombudsman commission must provide the results of an investigation to either the Garda Commissioner or the Director of Public Prosecutions. I am merely pointing out to the Minister that it appears that cases which will not require disciplinary proceedings under the disciplinary regulations or which will not warrant judicial action will be left behind. What will happen to such cases? Will they remain in limbo, with nobody knowing what happened to them?

If the Ombudsman Commission reports to the Garda Commissioner, is it precluded from reporting to the Director of Public Prosecutions and vice versa as a result of the use of the word “or”? Could a person, if prosecuted, make the case that because a file had been sent to the Garda Commissioner, the Ombudsman Commission was not empowered under the section to also send it to the Director of Public Prosecutions?

It may be that it is an unnecessary choice at that point.Investigations carried out by or on behalf of the Ombudsman Commission will result in four broad outcomes: first, there will be no case to answer; second, there will, as provided for under section 82, be an informal resolution of an issue; third, there will be a civil investigation — non-criminal in nature — for a disciplinary breach; and, fourth, there will be evidence of a suspected criminal offence. In those circumstances the material is furnished to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Regarding membership of the Ombudsman Commission, we go beyond the provisions applying to a High Court judge under the Constitution. As I recollect from recent times, the Constitution only provides for stated misbehaviour and incapacity. In this case, bankruptcy is provided for, which raises several issues. A situation may arise where a judge could be removed as a member of the Ombudsman Commission but not as a judge. Bankruptcy is not a ground for removing a judge.I am also intrigued by the provision that a person ceases to be a member of the Ombudsman Commission as soon as he or she is nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann. An individual's nomination to the Seanad could involve the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors or the Munster Agricultural Society. It strikes me as odd that a mere nomination, as opposed to election, determines this.

Section 63(1) states: "The Ombudsman Commission may appoint such numbers of persons as its officers as may be approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance". Section 63(2) states that not only will the numbers be determined but also the grades and the number of officers in each grade. Whatever else, for the Ombudsman Commission to work effectively and efficiently, it must have sufficient personnel. Any Minister for Finance can cut the budget for the commission and thereby make staff redundant.Effectively, therefore, the Minister for Finance could spancel the work of the Ombudsman by means of a cost initiative. If the commission is unable to carry out its work, we will return to the old mechanism, the complaints procedure, which did not work. It should be possible to leave the Minister for Finance — whom the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would like left out of everything — out of this.

This is the most serious issue of contention. How can we be sure the Ombudsman Commission will be able to conduct its business? There is nothing in the legislation to indicate the minimum it will require to ensure it carries out its duties effectively. Everything is subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	110	This is standard form. The Minister for Finance is a constitutional officer and one of the only Ministers referred to by title in the Constitution. He cannot be a Minister in the Seanad. One of the functions of the Minister for Finance is to control the finances of the State. We cannot have statutory bodies free to make appointments which are paid for from the public purse without accountability linked to the Minister for Finance. As this is a linchpin of the Constitution, leaving out the Minister is not an option. On one occasion, my good colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, used the phrase "If in doubt, leave them out" but I have forgiven him for that. I fully support the notion of the Department of Finance having this control. If it were not the case, the public accounts and public accountability would begin to disintegrate.

Could there not be provision to the effect that the Ombudsman Commission shall have sufficient personnel and resources to carry out its works, followed by the caveat that the consent of the Minister for Finance is required? In other words, could we not have the assertion followed by the caveat? If the caveat is necessary in all cases, perhaps my proposal would help the Minister to strengthen his hand and those of future Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

In this section, however, the Bill provides that the Ombudsman Commission must take on the staff of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, regardless of whether it wishes to do so. I am not pointing a finger at the current employees of the board because the problems associated with the body have nothing to do with its staff. Like any other organisation, the board will have good and not so good staff. Are we insisting that the independent Ombudsman Commission employ all the staff of the board without any by or leave? The section indicates that every member of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board staff can be transferred to the Ombudsman Commission. Does this remove all discretion on the part of the Ombudsman Commission regarding the transfer of existing staff from the board?The Minister is to notify a trade union or staff association of his intent to make any such order and to consider any representations which are made. I would have thought he would need to notify the staff associations if he decided not to transfer a staff member who may want to be transferred to the new commission. This is a minor point. My main point relates to the powers and independence of the commission, given that it appears to be obligated, if the Minister so decides, to take on transferred staff without any by or leave.

It appears somewhat strange to include in the legislation a broad statement that the entire staff of Garda complaints body will be designated, by order of the Minister, as officers of the Ombudsman Commission. Although one would expect some link between the bodies, under this section one could effectively create a similar body. If one does not know how many new officers will join the commission and one transfers one corporate operation with the same personnel into another corporate entity, all one will have is the same entity managed by three persons instead of the chairman of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board. What would be the essential difference between the new and old mechanisms?If the Minister for Finance has full control over the recruitment of additional personnel, we could find ourselves left for a long time with the existing complaints board operating in the Ombudsman Commission's office, with nothing having changed except that we have three persons, either two men and a woman or vice versa, presiding over the operation, as distinct from a chairperson.Will the chairperson of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board also transfer if he so wishes? Will he be part of the staff or is he regarded as a temporary appointment to the board? Will the Minister clarify precisely what is likely to happen on 1 January?

This matter should be dealt with separately. I presume employees of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board are civil servants. If the body for which they work becomes defunct, they automatically come under the powers of the Minister for Finance and can, therefore, apply in the normal fashion to join other Departments. In this case they, like others, could apply for positions under section 63.I am aware that Schedule 2 applies to transferring staff. From dealing with Bord na Gaeilge, when it was changing to Foras na Gaeilge — I was in that boat at the time — I am aware that taking a rigid approach to designating people who have a position in the Civil Service or public service to another position can result in a protracted process. Perhaps staff matters flowing from the dissolution of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board should be kept separate from this legislation and dealt with in a separate, shorter Bill.We have not covered every angle. I could also go through the Schedule and point out some problems I see with it. However, as far as this is concerned, our best bet is to delete the section. The staff should be returned to the Civil Service where they would have the right, as civil servants, to apply for whatever positions within the Civil Service suit their capacity, training and work practices in a manner similar to other civil servants.

It also provides that repeals of certain provisions of section 1 can, for different purposes, be carried out by separate orders. It is, therefore, envisaged that the repeal of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act 1986 contained in Schedule 1 will not take place on an instantaneous basis because there will be outstanding complaints which must be dealt with by the existing complaints authority. They will not be simply transferred holus bolus to the new commission because there will be work in progress. Consequently, it is likely that the two bodies will continue in parallel for a transitional period while the current commission rids itself of its caseload.I spoke to the chairman of the current commission today and he informed me that, to a great extent, the caseload has been dealt with and that the outstanding cases are greatly reduced in number. Nevertheless, it is quite clear, particularly with judicial reviews in progress, that the body cannot be wound up completely in the near future.Section 64 is purely an enabling section which allows for the transfer of people. It is not a self-executing transfer by statute. It simply allows the Minister to move those who wish to go from one body to the other. As the Deputies have correctly surmised, the people in question are civil servants on secondment from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board. Some of them may not wish to remain in this area at all but may wish to return to the Department.The committee will also be aware that some of the office functions of the complaints board have already been designated as liable for decentralisation by a Government decision.

Although it is essential that it should have a base in Dublin, it would be good if some of its support activities could be carried on outside of Dublin. That flexibility is there and is a matter for further consideration. In a spirit of partnership, no one will be forced to do anything he or she does not want to do. Anyone who is moved will retain the same entitlements in the new situation as he or she held in the old. These are standard arrangements when people are moved from one body to another.

This phrase disconcerted all members of the committee. Perhaps it would be to use a wording such as "Any member of the staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who on the establishment day is engaged in duties in the Garda Síochána Complaints Board may be designated".

There are 25 employed currently but the number employed in this role in Northern Ireland is 125. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that approximately 100 new staff will be required.The reason I am raising this issue is that there will be a question of providing resources for the additional personnel. If we must fall back on special assistance, as provided for in this section, we may find that we will fall back on the secondment of gardaí who will be paid as members of the Garda Síochána and will be entitled to return to their primary role. That is not satisfactory, unless it is a temporary arrangement. There is nothing in the Bill to state it might be temporary, other than that the service contract might be temporary, yet this could be an integral part of the recruitment of staff.

I presume, however, that it would be difficult for the Ombudsman Commission to have the same relationship with members of a police service outside the State as is provided for in section 66(1)(b). The gardaí seconded to the commission will be under its direct control, whereas police officers from outside the State could be under the direction and control of their superior. Was this point considered?

It is very difficult for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to start to legislate for chains of command for police services outside the State.

Section 91 deals with searches of Garda stations. Section 91(1) states: "Subject to this section, a designed officer directed by the Ombudsman Commission to investigate a complaint under  section 90 may carry out a search of a Garda Síochána station . . .”. However, section 67(2) states: “Functions under sections 91 and 100 may not be delegated to anyone other than a member of the Ombudsman Commission.” Is there a conflict between the two sections?

Therefore, "functions" means the functions of the Ombudsman Commission. It does not mean the functions of anybody else.

One could not have an officer of the commission delegating or making a direction under that section without the knowledge of the commissioners. In other words, a member of the investigative staff cannot enter a Garda station and cannot authorise any other officer to do so. No member of the administrative staff of the commission can issue such authorisation, it must be issued by the commission itself.

Clearly that is not the intent. Perhaps the Minister will consider the wording used to see if it needs to be tightened up.

If I tell somebody to search a station, I am not delegating a power of search of a station, I am authorising the search of a station. Section 67(2) provides that "Functions under sections 91 and 100 may not be delegated to anyone other than a member of the Ombudsman Commission.” The three members could delegate, to one or two of their number, the right to make such an authorisation under section 91.

In page 46, subsection (2), lines 21 to 23, to delete paragraph (a).In amendment No. 74, I am seeking to delete section 70(2)(a) which states that a member of the Ombudsman Commission who gives evidence shall not “question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such policy.” Amendment No. 77 is somewhat similar and seeks to delete section 71(10) which reads:In carrying out duties under this section, a member of the Ombudsman Commission shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such policy.These provisions are somewhat harsh. I know the Minister's response will be that the Government does not want the Ombudsman Commission — or anybody else — drawing up Government policy, particularly as its function is to carry out that policy. The system is more complicated than that and it should be allowed to express an opinion on the merits of a new policy and the objectives thereof. What will be the position if a member of the Ombudsman Commission comes before the Committee of Public Accounts and is questioned by a particular member of that committee? The member of the commission will not be allowed to express an opinion. It seems that the Ombudsman Commission will be able to give very limited information to the Committee of Public Accounts on policy matters and objectives. It is difficult to determine the level of expenditure if one is not able to examine and express an opinion on the merits of the objectives of the various policies adopted by Ministers and Governments. This seems to be an effort to gag the Ombudsman Commission because it will only be able to provide minimal information for the Committee of Public Accounts.

The Committee of Public Accounts has a limited purpose and it is not a policy-making body. In this section, we are rendering one of the members of this independent commission liable to be brought before the Committee of Public Accounts to account for the expenditure of the commission.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	182	The PAC should not be allowed to ask those questions in the first instance. We are making one of the commissioners liable to answer questions about the finances of the commission. The same provisions apply to the Human Rights Commission. When members of that commission come before the Committee of Public Accounts, they cannot become involved in political debate. The Ombudsman for Children and the Equality Authority operate on the same basis.I explained to the Seanad that the reason for the provision is that politics is a competitive business and it would clearly be significantly advantageous to somebody who disagreed with the Government to recruit important independent bodies to his or her cause. I have no doubt that if we did not have such a provision for bodies such as the commission, people would call on it to agree that what the Government is doing is wrong and it would then be drawn into conflict. I also have no doubt that some of its interrogators at the PAC would have a political interest in recruiting the commission, so to speak, to their cause. It is better that bodies, in the context of being accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, should stay out of day to day politics and not get sucked into policy debates.

However, I would add to the end of each the phrase “save and except for as it relates to a finding under section 98”. Members of the commission should be able to give evidence, in terms of a finding under section 98, in instances where they are examining certain practices, policies and procedures of the Garda Síochána. That might be the only area in respect of which they should be allowed to express opinions.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Deputy Ó Snodaigh made a very good point. The Minister may request the Ombudsman Commission to examine practice, policy or procedures. Where the commission has been invited and requested specifically to look into policies and procedures, it is still not allowed to express an opinion before the Committee of Public Accounts, even though the relevant Minister has made a specific request to it to express opinions, examine and publish. This seems to be an anomaly. Perhaps there should be a caveat in section 70(2) to allow the commission to accede to the request of the Minister.

That could be a matter for the Committee of Public Account to call on the Ombudsman Commission to comment on its role in making the Garda Síochána more efficient. The commission might wish to make a recommendation to the Minister.

In the context of a body coming into daily contact with particular problems with the force which give rise to complaints, the Minister is given a power to ask the commission to address the reason certain incidences of misbehaviour are happening and what can be done to stop them. That is not an issue for the Committee of Public Accounts.

Would it not be appropriate for the Ombudsman Commission to appear before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights having examined, at the request of the Minister, practice, policy or procedures with a view to reducing the incidence of such complaints? It seems strange that the Minister may ask the commission to examine certain matters and that another section of the Bill forbids the committee to ask the commission to express a view on matters on which it had reported to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

Section 70 states that a member of the Ombudsman Commission who gives evidence under the section to the Committee of Public Accounts shall not "provide information that might facilitate the commission of an offence". Section 71 provides that when appearing before other committees, the Ombudsman Commission is similarly precluded from discussing the merits or objectives of policy but is not precluded from providing information that might facilitate the commission of an offence. Does this indicate, by implication, that it is so entitled? Why is there no preclusion about providing information that might facilitate the commission of an offence in section 71 when it is so provided for in section 70?

The provisions in the legislation that I am seeking to delete seem to go overboard in curtailing the ability of the Ombudsman Commission to speak out openly and clearly. It seems there is no reason it should not be able to give an opinion on policies and practices, especially if the Minister had requested it to look at a practice and if it prevents or reduces the number of complaints about practice or policy which, in turn, may save money.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	199	There is a tendency in Ireland to think that the views of an independent body are better than those of Deputy Costello. If the Deputy can get somebody who wears a badge to agree with his views, his views become better on that account. Why not leave such people out of the debate? I agree with the Deputy that it is undoubtedly helpful in the mindset of the media if somebody wearing the Ombudsman's hat agrees with one Member rather another. The media go down on their knees when an independent person has come to the same conclusion as one side of an argument. As politicians, we should face down the attitude in the media that it is significant if the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, for example, has a view on a policy issue but it is insignificant if Deputies Jim O'Keeffe or Costello have one. We must pay homage to officeholders' opinions but the opinion of those who hold office as a representative of the people does not matter. Our opinions are seen as the usual old guff. That is the attitude in so much public commentary in Ireland that it is time Members stood up for the value of their opinions which at least carry a mandate.

All my amendment proposes is the deletion of the words "has been". There are some grounds for including a matter that is or may at a future time be before a court or tribunal. What are the grounds for including a matter which has been the subject of such proceedings? It would seem that there is no opportunity to comment on something that happened in the past.

The Bill should explain what that report should include. For example, it should include statistics — including trends and patterns — any such analysis or use as the ombudsman commission would see fit and, if necessary, details on matters of national security.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I wish to make two points. First, the reports referred to in the earlier subsections will be made to the Minister who shall, as soon as practicable, lay them before each House of the Oireachtas. It is really a question of what is meant by "as soon as practicable". There have been certain suggestions that the publication of reports received from the Inspector of Prisons, for example, have been unduly delayed. I would not want a similar occurrence to arise here.While there are a number of reports referred to in subsections (1) to (4) which are to be published as soon as practicable, subsection (6) states that the commission "may make any other reports". My question is whether subsection (5), which relates to the laying of reports before the House, similarly applies to subsection (6). It could be construed that it does not because of the positioning of that subsection.

There was, for example, a particular difficulty with his report for last year. In the case of this year, I am anxious to get it into the public domain but under the official languages legislation I am awaiting an Irish translation. I have a legal duty to publish in both languages.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I move amendment No. 78:
In page 48, subsection (4)(a), between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:"(ii) an officer of a police ombudsman or comparable body, outside the State,".The subsection to which this amendment refers provides that there is no prohibition on a person disclosing information if the disclosure is made to certain people or bodies, namely, the Garda Commissioner, the Minister, the Attorney General, the DPP, the Chief State Solicitor, the CAB, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Revenue Commissioners or a member of either of the Houses of the Oireachtas where relevant to the proper discharge of that member's functions. My amendment suggests that it should also be possible to provide for disclosure to "an officer of a police ombudsman or comparable body, outside the State". My thoughts are of encouraging co-operation between the State and police organisations abroad. In particular, they are focused, perhaps, on a police ombudsman in another country.I am slightly concerned that section 73, as it is currently framed, might inhibit the type of co-operation to which I refer. If, for example, the ombudsman commission was meeting its Norwegian counterpart with a view to exchanging information about their experiences, its members might feel inhibited or they might, under this section, be deemed guilty of an offence. If the Minister would consider the matter from that point of view, I would be satisfied. I do not wish to press the issue unduly.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	231	My amendment arises because the Garda inspectorate came late in the legislative process and it was considered that its officers should be in a position to have access to information.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	232	All information obtained in the line of duty by an officer of the State is subject to the Official Secrets Act 1963. Does that Act contain conditions on disclosure, particularly if the latter is likely to have a harmful effect? Is there a general statement to the effect that all information obtained by a member of the Garda or, in this instance, a member of the ombudsman commission, is confidential and, therefore, cannot be disclosed?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	233	The Official Secrets Act has two tiers of operation, one of which relates to official information. It is an offence to disclose official information per se. Official information is any information which is in the possession of a public servant arising out of the course of his or her duty. It is an offence to reveal such information unless its disclosure has been authorised. For example, a Minister may always disclose official information but others may not. In the case of serious indictable offences under the Official Secrets Act, these must involve the disclosure of information which jeopardises the security of the State.The Bill provides for an indictable offence in respect of the disclosure of information in harmful circumstances. The Bill confers a right to apply for search warrants and also a right to arrest and question people. This arose from the fact that the Garda Commissioner reported some time ago to my predecessor and to me, as Attorney General, that the person who preceded me as Attorney General, Mr. David Byrne, had raised the issue of the unauthorised disclosure of Garda information. At the time, the Garda Commissioner made the point that as long as he had to rely on the Official Secrets Act, he had no real method of investigating because the summary offence did not give any powers of investigation and he was effectively left with no way to discover who was leaking Garda information and no real prospect of doing so unless an issue relating to the security of the State was involved.The committee will be aware that when I originally published the draft heads of this legislation, I indicated that I was going to deal with the question of unauthorised leaking of information by members of the force and the same must obviously apply to members of the commission. The position is simply that we have refined it to make it a fair section which is no longer subject to any major criticism.Only a tiny handful of people disclosed information. I am not suggesting that it was a widespread practice but there were some who knowingly gave confidential information to people who would publish it in circumstances where it did immense damage to private individuals. It was unfair that this happened. People's sexual histories were the subject of publicity in these circumstances. I want to make it clear that, being a disciplined force, the Garda Síochána has immense powers to ask questions, discover information, search people's houses, arrest, detain and, in certain instances, oblige individuals to answer questions. In the circumstances to which I refer, there is a correlative duty to observe confidentiality. Where that duty is breached with harmful effect, we must take a serious view of the matter.

While that would be my only caveat, I agree with what the Minister stated.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Although I did not want to open up the debate on the leaking of information to the media, I must ask the following question. In recent days, every time one opened a newspaper one read a different account of what happened at Lusk. It was stated that there was an exchange of shots and that there were six robbers. Then it was stated that there were only three robbers and that a certain number were arrested. Garda sources were regularly mentioned in the media reports. Is that harmful to the Garda investigation?Any day of the week one could hardly open a newspaper which did not contain information on a criminal investigation which had emanated from the Garda. In the article on Mrs. Rachel O'Reilly in the Evening Herald yesterday, the Garda is again taking this action. The article in question stated that the Garda has the culprit or that it is close to a breakthrough. There have been similar leakages in recent months where assertions were made that emanated from Garda sources. The Minister could spend his life investigating leaks which arise every day in the media. How does he decide whether the disclosure of information is likely to have a harmful effect and whether he will start an investigation which would lead to the imposition of the penalties outlined here?I wish to return to my original point, which is not quite related. In the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, which are additional to those of this legislation, the only stipulation is where it is an indictable offence. This legislation stipulates a summary offence as well as an indictable offence. That is the only time when the Minister is talking about an investigation being jeopardised, whereas section 73 relates to any disclosure of information likely to have a harmful effect. In other words, there are different stipulations in the two items of legislation. If there is no stipulation in the case of a summary offence in the Official Secrets Act, how could this then be an addition to that Act?My third point relates to what we discussed on section 55 in respect of the Garda Síochána and the disclosure of information. Section 73(4)(a)(ix) refers to the disclosure of information to “a member of either of the Houses of the Oireachtas where relevant to the proper discharge of that member’s functions”. What does that mean? The question we raised earlier regarding a previous occasion when Members of the House were supplied with information and the State went to court to get them to disclose the sources of that information again arises.

This refers to a member or officer of the Ombudsman Commission disclosing information. The circumstances in which they can and cannot disclose information are set out here. In bringing in rules for members of the Garda Síochána, it is important to ensure that those who police members of the Garda Síochána — who arrest them, search their houses and ask them questions with all the powers of a member of the Garda Síochána — will be subject to the same ethical standards as members of the force.

The first relates to disclosure of information by the Garda Síochána. Every day information appears in the newspapers which, to a reasonable person, could have a harmful effect.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Prelude	240	This Bill is not yet law. If the Deputy has a difficulty with anything that is published in the newspapers at present, it is because the Official Secrets Act is weak. The Commissioner stated as much to my predecessor, to me and to the Attorney General, Mr. Byrne, when he indicated that the Official Secrets Act did not provide a fair guarantee of secrecy because breaches of it are, in many instances, effectively uninvestigable.

As matters stand, the Official Secrets Act applies to the entire public service and it is unlawful for members of the public service to disclose official information to any person, regardless of whether he or she is a member of the media, unless they are authorised to do so. People argue that this is too broad a brush to use. However, that is the law. We may have to revisit the matter.
